Overall the build quality of the piece and fitment were very good. I suspect these are all coming from the same builder.



It only had one row of probably 3/8 gray foam tape (cheap quality not 3M"" so I left that on (it was well adhered) and added another row of the 1/2 inch 3M clear VHB tape inside it with adhesion promoter on both the diffuser and on the bumper. Only had one shot to line it up as the stick was instant and permanent with the adhesion promoter. It went on nicely with the wifey providing a 2nd pair of hands while I positioned it. Mine diffuser with 12 Phillips screws and no instructions. I used 2 screws in the recessed holes and sank the other 10 underneath straight up. Pretty sure this is not going anywhere and no screws are in the body colored bumper only the black plastic underneath. Overall very happy with the part and the install.



My diffuser install was made a little more tricky as I have a stealth hitch (for my bike rack) and I jigsawed the diffuser for the removable access panel - it came out very nice and you can't tell it was cut.

A stunning mansion that was once shared by Manchester United legends Gary Neville and David Beckham has been valued at £3million after being placed on the market.

The luxurious 35-acre grounds include a tennis court infinity pool and five-hole golf course - and was regularly used by Beckham while his wife Vitoria was away during his time at United.

Former England defender Neville had a barn converted into the luxurious mansion was back in 1999 the same year he and Beckham won the treble with United.

In another nod to his time playing for club and country there are two lions carved into the wooden staircase with both United and England crests.

The 9000 square foot property is packed with smart features including an intercom that runs in each of the rooms.

As well as an entertainment space there is a £60000 bar that has disco strobe lighting and a large projector screen for watching movies.

The four bedrooms all include en-suite bathrooms and walk-in wardrobes with the Master also boasting a special steam room.

Neville spoke about his time living with Beckham back in 2014 telling the Guardian: “I roomed with David Beckham and when I had my house in Bolton David would stay when Victoria was away.

“He'd make food for me all the time. Stir-fries with noodles and vegetables and pasta dishes with sauces – a lot of pasta.”

The former right-back moved out of the house in 2003 but still owns some land close by.

Neville added of his time rooming with Beckham during the early stages of their careers: “He is the cleanest person.

""He gets into his room he lights candles he puts pictures up – everything has to be absolutely perfect it's been the same since he was 18.

“I just throw everything everywhere so it just did not work at all.

“I’m always talking always arguing and he was the complete opposite of that.

“He would listen to music he would want peace he would want to be chilled and it's just the complete opposite end of the spectrum of where I was at.”

Holly Willoughby gives fans a rare look inside her bedroom at her £3m home

Holly Willoughby has given fans a rare glimpse into her bedroom at her £3million London home.

In a new Instagram picture the This Morning presenter sat at her dressing table in what appeared to be an attic room in the property she shares her husband Dan and their three children

Behind her could be seen a three piece mirror on the top of the vintage style wooden table with jewellery hung from it.

Roses in white and pink with stocks bloom in the vase to bring colour and fragrance into her dressing area.

For the finishing touch ITV's darling added a scented candle to her vanity table.

As she applies her make-up and does her hair Holly could choose to sit on her plush orange stool which oozes glamour and sophistication.

She wrote: ""One of my favourite denim shapes is the boyfriend jean it's super flattering and versatile but they're not always very moveable which is where these fab @marksandspencer 's one come in with added stretch meaning I can wear them even when chasing the kids around...

""For now I am wearing them with t-shirts and sweatshirts but can’t wait to take them ‘out out’ with a heel and nice top! One day.""

It comes after Holly was left in tears over Phillip Schofield's sweet 40th birthday surprise for her.

It's an incredibly busy time for Holly who is also fronting Dancing on Ice with Phillip Schofield.

At the moment she has to factor in homeschooling her trio while the UK remains in the third national lockdown.

During a recent phone in on This Morning Holly opened up about her struggle with homeschooling her kids.

If you already subscribe thank you. If not please do so today at statesman.com/subscribenow.

Gov. Greg Abbott on Saturday said he was asking for a federal emergency declaration from the Biden administration as the state faces some of the worst winter weather in years.

The declaration will open the door to more federal resources and assistance for Texas and local governments affected by the deep freeze.

On Friday Abbott issued a disaster declaration for all 254 counties as the state deploys personnel to respond to severe winter weather. The governor also ordered the State Operations Center to expand operations to 24 hours a day.

Abbott on Saturday also warned that demand for power might exceed supply across the state Monday and Tuesday as temperatures drop.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas which manages the state's power grid said Thursday the agency was expecting record electric use because of the extreme cold.

“This statewide weather system is expected to bring Texas the coldest weather we’ve experienced in decades” ERCOT President and CEO Bill Magness said.

The grid operator has asked power generators across the state to review fuel supplies and transmission operators to minimize transmission outages that could affect ability of the system to serve the increased demand.

ERCOT could set a new all-time winter peak demand record Monday when even colder temperatures are forecast. The current demand record is 65915 megawatts set Jan. 17 2018. Temperatures sank as low as 18 degrees that day in Austin. The forecast low for Monday is 6 degrees.

Public Utilities Commission of Texas Chairwoman DeAnn Walker said the best ways to conserve power include keeping the thermostat to 68 degrees or lower closing blinds and shades to trap heat turning off and unplugging appliances that are not actively in use and avoiding using large appliances like dishwashers and laundry machines especially in the morning and evening.

Abbott warned that iced-over trees and tree limbs could fall and compromise power lines so power companies will have crews ready including from out of state to fix any problems that arise.

Chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management Nim Kidd said that people who lose power should avoid burning gas-burning appliances inside of homes to minimize the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.

People should also take steps to protect water pipes from bursting which can cause flooding and damage to homes after the temperatures rise.

Abbott also said that the next batch of COVID-19 vaccines to arrive in the state is expected to be delayed because of weather conditions — arriving Wednesday instead of Sunday or Monday. Indoor vaccination sites will continue operating as long as people can drive there safely and outdoor vaccination sites are closed.

The state is averaging more than 130000 vaccinations a day limited only by the number of doses shipped here by the federal government he said.

Abbott said a number of state agencies and departments have mobilized to help during the storm including the Department of Public Safety Texas Parks and Wildlife and the Texas Forest Service.

The Texas Division of Emergency Management has deployed:

Texas Department of Transportation roadway preparation equipment and crews to monitor road conditions.

Texas Department of Public Safety patrols to assist stranded motorists along major travel corridors.

Texas Military Department equipment and personnel to support Amarillo Wichita Falls Abilene Fort Worth and Waco in assisting stranded motorists.

Texas Parks and Wildlife Department vehicles and personnel to help stranded motorists along major travel corridors.

Texas A&M Forest Service personnel to help clear snow ice and downed trees.

Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service and Texas Task Force 1 search and rescue equipment and teams.

Texas Animal Health Commission equipment and personnel to address livestock concerns.

“This is going to be a very challenging time for Texas and for Texans” he said. “But it is a challenge that we know our fellow Texans are up to.”

Abbott on Saturday also warned Texans to stay off the roads over the next few days as roadway conditions are expected to get worse across the state.

“The temperature will go so low and remain so low for so long it will mean there will be many roads across the entire state that will be extremely dangerous and treacherous to drive on” he said.

Road closures will be up to law enforcement or local officials he said. For people who get stranded while driving Abbott said to call for roadside assistance at 800-525-5555 which is listed on the back of Texas drivers licenses. Stranded travelers could be stuck in temperatures as low as single digits waiting for help which is potentially life-threatening he said.

He said a key goal for the state and its residents should be to avoid a repeat of the 106-car pile-up that happened in Fort Worth early Thursday killing six people.

Abbott said authorities have responded to more than 1000 crashes on Texas roads since Thursday resulting in over 10 deaths so far. Texas Department of Public Safety troopers and members of the National Guard have been deployed to help on roadways and conduct wellness checks in remote parts of the state he said.“Almost anybody going over the roads in the next few days is taking their life and other lives in their own hands” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rcmlzdHYuY29tL25ld3MvdGV4YXMtbmV3cy9nb3YtYWJib3R0LXJlcXVlc3RzLWZlZGVyYWwtZW1lcmdlbmN5LWRlY2xhcmF0aW9uLWFzLXRleGFzLWV4cGVyaWVuY2VzLWV4dHJlbWVseS1sb3ctdGVtcGVyYXR1cmVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abbott: Federal Emergency Declaration for Texas approved,"UPDATE 2-14-21:

Gov. Greg Abbott announces that the Biden administration has approved Texas' Federal Emergency Declaration in response to the severe winter weather throughout the state. The declaration will authorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide Direct Federal Assistance and emergency protective measures for mass care and sheltering for all 254 counties in Texas.

ORIGINAL STORY 2-13-21:

Governor Greg Abbott gave an update to Texans on Saturday afternoon as the state prepares for extremely low temperatures across the state.

Many road closures and dangerous conditions are expected following the snow and ice predicted throughout Texas. The governor announced that he will make a request to the White House for a Federal Emergency Declaration to make resources available to Texas communities affected by extreme winter weather.

""Every part of the state will face freezing conditions over the coming days and I urge all Texans to remain vigilant against the extremely harsh weather that is coming"" said Governor Abbott.

Abbott urged Texans to stay off the roads and conserve energy as power companies prepare to assist in potential power outages.

You can help power companies by unplugging devices when not in use closing windows and blinds and adjusting thermostats to 68 degrees or below. Texas residents are asked to avoid heating their homes with ovens or stovetops and only use generators or grills outdoors and away from windows to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.

Thirty-four warming centers have been established in communities across the state and various other resources have been given to local officials to help their communities. The Texas Department of Transportation began pre-treating roads this past Tuesday and will continue to treat roads in the coming days.

AUSTIN Texas — As a winter storm barrels through the state of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott stressed the importance of staying off the roads and conserving power so the state can meet a surge in demand that will stress the energy supply.

Abbott received a briefing on the winter storm from Texas leaders before giving an update to the media and public from the Alternate State Operations Center in Austin on Saturday Feb. 13.

""The severity of the cold weather that is about to be experienced here in the coming days is unprecedented in Texas history and we need people across the state to get ready for these extremely harsh conditions that are coming"" said Abbott.

The governor said more than 1000 roadway segments already have snow or ice on them ahead of the expected sub-freezing temperatures.

""It will mean that there will be many roads across the entire state that will be extremely dangerous and treacherous to drive on ... There are no experts when it comes to driving on ice"" said Abbott.

Texans are asked to stay off the roads in the coming days to avoid another dangerous pileup accident. In Fort Worth on Tuesday a pileup of at least 133 vehicles on the Interstate 35 southbound toll road left at least six people dead.

The Department of Public Safety has already worked on more than 1000 crashes since Thursday. It has deployed 3000 troopers that will be working 24/7 assisted by the National Guard to help with potential stranded travelers. The National Guard will also be conducting welfare checks in remote areas of the state.

Texas Parks and Wildlife has deployed more than 400 vehicles to respond to needs such as accidents or stranded drivers while search and rescue teams are on standby ahead of the winter storm. The Texas A&M Forest Service will deploy chainsaw crews across the state to assist with clearing roads.

Demand for power

Abbott said the demand for power as temperatures drop over the coming days could mean demand exceeds supply during parts of Monday and Tuesday.

""At this point we really have no additional generation that we can add to the system to address the issues"" said chair of the Public Utility Commission of Texas DeAnn Walker. ""So therefore it comes from conservation and demand management.""

In the coming days Texans are asked to start conserving energy by turning their thermostats to 68 degrees closing shades and blinds and unplugging nonessential appliances that still draw power such as toasters. Residents should avoid using large appliances like washers and dryers during peak hours like the morning and evening.

State officials also reminded Texans not to burn gas appliances inside as it could lead to carbon monoxide poisoning.

Residents are urged to call 311 for downed power lines which could still be live and dangerous.

The press briefing came the day after the governor issued a disaster declaration for all 254 counties in the state ahead of the forecasted winter storm.

Abbott said he is also requesting a federal emergency declaration that will assist with the response to the winter storm as well as post-storm road repair.

A Winter Storm Warning has been issued in Austin and Central Texas through the weekend and until noon on Monday. The weekend began with a chance for more icing Saturday evening. A stronger winter storm will then move in during the second half of the day Sunday and will continue through Monday morning.

Since the wintry weather moved through Thursday icy road conditions have snarled traffic in Central Texas and beyond. At least six were killed in a 133-vehicle pileup crash on I-35W in Fort Worth. In Austin at least two pileup crashes were reported. The Texas Department of Transporation is urging drivers to stay home through the winter storm.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZ3JlYXRub3J0aHdlc3R3aW5lLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzE0L2FiYm90dC1jbGFpbS0yMDE4LWFiYm90dC1jbGFpbS12aW5leWFyZC1waW5vdC1ub2lyLXlhbWhpbGwtY2FybHRvbi02NS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abbott Claim 2018 Abbott Claim Vineyard Pinot Noir Yamhill-Carlton $65,"Acclaimed Thoroughbred breeder Antony Beck embarks on his second decade as a member of the Oregon wine industry and Abbott Claim marks his second brand in this neighborhood that renowned winemaker Ken Wright made famous.

A three-time state MVP in water polo at Curtis High School in University Place Wash. Abbott had a partial scholarship to stay on that path at Long Beach State. But in the spring of 2017 — the spring he thought would be his last for competitive baseball — he batted .438 (21-for-61) with eight doubles two home runs and 18 RBIs to earn an eighth round draft selection by the White Sox.

That year with the AZL White Sox he got off to a good start and showed good patience at the plate. However he struggled making contact which caused him to slash just .225/.344/.275 with 17 walks (13.8%) and 38 strikeouts (30.9%) in 102 at-bats.

Abbott got off to an extremely difficult start with the AZL White Sox in 2018 but salvaged his season somewhat as he found his power late in the season. Overall though Abbott slashed just .139/.347/.306 in 72 at-bats with three doubles three homers nine RBIs 18 walks (18.9%) and 33 strikeouts (34.7%) in 72 at-bats.

In 2019 with Great Falls Abbott still fanned far too frequently — but started making harder contact. In 58 games and 181 at-bats with the Voyagers he slashed .238/.355/.459 while producing 13 doubles nine homers 27 RBIs 26 walks (12.0%) and 79 strikeouts (36.4%). He hit .212/.350/.455 against lefties and fared a bit better versus righties (.243/.356/.450). Abbott does have a great degree of patience for someone so young as he’s walked 14% of the time during his professional career; however that patience has also led to a seriously high strikeout rate of 34.5%.

When play last ended after that season Harvin Mendoza and Abbott were two players on a similar track to more substantial playing time at Kannapolis for 1B/DH duties. While Abbott has the better power potential Mendoza is more likely to win that battle due to being a more polished hitter. With the loss of Great Falls there’s even a chance that Abbott returns to Arizona for some rookie league seasoning before getting to North Carolina."

A few times the name “Rawtherapee” was mentioned in the comments. It made me curious: Is this software a competitor for Lightroom too? I took a few weeks to check the manual make some test edits and develop a workflow.

As has been the case in the review of Darktable there is a lot of criteria to look at when comparing software for photographers. In this post I will check how Rawtherapee can help you manage your files – even though it’s not meant to do that. Why do I still do it? Because I believe that a one-fits-all-solution is always better than separate programs. After all I want to be able to compare and inspect photographs before I edit them. Besides the fact that it’s not a file manager Rawtherapee might still be good enough for my purpose. Here is what I found out.

That's Rawtherapee: Tidy and comprehensible.

Round One: User Interface

Rawtherapee consists of three main working areas: the “File Browser” the “Queue” and the “Editor”. God knows why the “Queue” is positioned before the “Editor” but in this article I’ll focus on the “File Browser” anyway.

Just like Lightroom Rawtherapee works with different sections. In the middle of your screen you’ll see your photographs. On the left you can browse your images; on the right you’ll find some quick functions. Nothing surprising here except for the design. Rawtherapee looks a little outdated compared to other software but it doesn’t really affect its usability. Well I still ask myself why there is flower stamps on the right bottom? Never mind! The left and the right panel are collapsible. You can either click on a button or press “L” for the left panel to open and close or “Alt+L” for the right panel to close.

Although I don’t fancy the design of Rawtherapee I wouldn’t judge the program worse than others at first sight. Everything is clear and understandable.

Even tidier: Rawtherapee with collapsed side panels.

Round Two: Importing Files

Whichever software we use we don’t want to destroy our files when we edit them. Just like Lightroom Rawtherapee works non-destructively. This way your raw files stay the same no matter how hard you edit your photographs. The edits are saved and applied separately. When exporting an edited photograph you will create a separate developed file while the original stays in its folder.

Still the first big difference in your workflow appears when importing photographs. Most people I know use Lightroom to transfer their images to a local drive and directly import them into their catalog. Rawtherapee doesn’t know catalogs and it doesn’t help you to import your images. You need to first save your images on your local drive and then open them in Rawtherapee. That’s not necessarily better but simply different. It lacks one function which might be handy for some people: In Lightroom you can add metadata already while importing images. That’s not possible in Rawtherapee.

Find your folder double-click and here it is: a grid preview of your photographs.

Your browser’s usability also depends on your personal file management. I’m used to having a separate folder for every year and day – because it’s Lightroom’s default. If I gave my folders a more comprehensible name than “2020-01-05” I’d probably remember the content better. However browsing through the images in Rawtherapee works quicker than importing them into Lightroom. Still you will lose a little time first copying and then loading your photographs.

I also have an issue with the missing option of opening multiple folders at once. When I select “2021” not a single picture will show up. I need to select a folder that actually contains images to show the preview. I know that it’ll cause trouble to open all images on my “G:\” drive at once but isn’t there a compromise?

Round two goes to Lightroom because it’s more flexible.

Round Three: Preview Settings

The smallest previews let you scan a lot of tiny pictures at once.

While Lightroom offers you a quick and easy preview of each photograph in the “Library” Rawtherapee’s “File Browser” makes your life a little harder. You can’t review a photograph full size and not even on thirty percent of the screen. A row of five (collapsed side panels) or three (opened side panels) photographs in a row is as close as I can get in the normal review. It’s a file browser after all.

Unfortunately it doesn't get any closer than this.

At least it offers a nice feature. In the right panel you will find the option “Inspect”. Once you selected it you will be able to review your photographs in a 100 percent preview wherever you hover your mouse. For me it turned out to be the quickest way to compare certain details of two photographs. My only issue: I don’t always use it and I need to resize the panel to get a better impression of the preview.

Quickly inspect at 100 per cent while hovering your mouse over the small previews. Great idea!

Round three goes to Lightroom: I’d like to have a single preview before I select an image for the editing process. The “Inspect” panel is great but it can’t replace a full screen-size review.

Round Four: Metadata and Search

If Rawtherapee isn’t a managing system why are there so many management features then? Let’s look at the ways we can filter our photographs in Rawtherapee: Star rating? Yes! Color labels? Yes? Pick and Reject? Well there is something called “Trash” that works the same. Rawtherapee even offers a “Filter” section to search for metadata.

For a single project the filters are quite useless. I hardly change my settings or gear a lot during a session.

Yet because of the inability to look into upper-level folders the filter only works for the smallest entities. I could squeeze all of my photographs into one big folder but is that a solution? Filters should search all of my images and not only the sub-sub-sub-folder. That might be helpful for a wedding photography day but not for someone who is browsing through his files to search for a certain photograph.

Even if I had the chance to filter all of my photographs at the same time I’d still be disappointed. I love keywords to organize my photographs. Consequently the “Filter” panel seems to be useless at least to me.

Another smack in the face for Rawtherapee.

Round Five: Pre-edit

Rawtherapee stops at 99 per cent (left) and shows me weird previews (middle) even though the batch edit is off.

As soon as I touched the “Batch Edit” panel things went crazy. My laptop’s fan drowned out my headphones and certain aspects of the program stopped functioning. I know that the problem usually sits in front of the screen. Still even after several of the program the affected folder won’t properly open anymore and without any visible reason some files’ previews look misedited. It only went after restarting my laptop.

I didn’t use this panel too often so it hadn't happened before. Only while I was writing this article and simultaneously capturing the necessary screenshots did Rawtherapee drive my laptop nuts. “Batch Edit” would be handy to quickly apply the same adjustments to your photographs before editing the details. However it got stuck in my case.

So let’s simply forget about it.

Summary: Rawtherapee Falls Behind... and Yet

While Darktable could really perform well against Lightroom in its capabilities of managing your images Rawtherapee falls far behind. One could argue that it’s simply a “therapee” for your raw files and not the anteroom. Still it features a lot of managing extras like rating color labels or the search function. I only ask myself: Why?

Why offer some features and not fully develop them? One could say: “Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth.” But in search of a suitable replacement I need those features.

I’m indeed grateful to the developers of any free and open software. I love the idea of collaboration and opening the creative world for beginners and all of us who can’t afford the Adobe subscription. In the case of Rawtherapee I need a second program to manage my files. I love that Lightroom (and Darktable as well) work as a managing system and allow me to quickly find the photographs I need.

When I select a top level folder I want to see all the photographs of all the sub folders. Instead I get an empty screen and 0 per cent.

If a software lacks a little quality in usability doesn’t look as neat as an expensive one or has some weird flower stamps below the edit panel it’s fine for me. But if it lacks a handful of handy features which I assume aren’t as hard to code as a lot of its other features I become a little wistful. Next week we’ll figure out if the “Edit” panel can cheer me up a little.

What I liked about Rawtherapee’s “File Browser”

Clear and comprehensive structure

Quick import of data and fast building previews

The “Inspect” panel makes detailed reviews easy

What could be improved

Extension of filters to all levels

Inclusion of metadata and search

Possibility of single image review

So far that’s my first impression. I guess many of you also have tried Rawtherapee so please let me know: What do you like or miss the most? Which software do you use to organize your photographs before editing them with Rawtherapee – or are you fine with the file browser alone?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvaWxrZXJrb2tzYWwvMjAyMS8wMi8xMy9zY2FsaW5nLW1hcmtldGluZy13b3JrZmxvdy13aXRoLWFpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scaling Marketing Workflow With AI,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ilkerkoksal/2021/02/13/scaling-marketing-workflow-with-ai/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvaWxrZXJrb2tzYWwvMjAyMS8wMi8xMy9zY2FsaW5nLW1hcmtldGluZy13b3JrZmxvdy13aXRoLWFpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0YXJnZXQuY29tL3NlYXJjaHN0b3JhZ2Uvb3Bpbmlvbi9QYXktcGVyLXVzZS1wcmljaW5nLW1vZGVsLWNhbi1ib29zdC1kaWdpdGFsLWluaXRpYXRpdmVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pay-per-use pricing model can boost digital initiatives,"Businesses of all shapes and sizes -- and across multiple industries -- are ramping up their digital business initiatives and IT services roadmaps. Even prior to COVID-19 these initiatives were high on the IT priority list but in a soon-to-be post-coronavirus era (vaccine distribution permitting) businesses will succeed or fail based on their ability to use technology to better understand and engage with customers.

For some businesses COVID-19 has reaffirmed their existing roadmaps and plans. For others the pandemic has been a painful wake-up call. As businesses seek to add to or accelerate their digital initiatives some would say transformations personnel and budget constraints will present major hurdles to success.

Some IT organizations have turned to a pay-per-use or as-a-service model for infrastructure as a means of speeding up digital initiatives by accelerating investments without significantly impacting near-term budgets. Enterprise Strategy Group found in a recent study for example that IT organizations were more likely to favor a consumption-based model for procuring data center infrastructure over a traditional model with upfront capital purchases.

What's behind the growing interest in a pay-per-use pricing model? Two high-level goals drive interest in consumption-based pricing: the need to simplify IT operations and a desire to maximize near-term budget opportunities. A pay-per-use pricing model reduces the considerable level of effort involved with architecting and optimizing data center hardware for current and future needs of application environments. Given how quickly these environments are scaling and evolving -- especially with the rise of cloud-native container-based workloads -- accurately forecasting infrastructure demands over multiple years has become increasingly difficult. In addition more than one-third of IT organizations are experiencing problematic skill shortages in the area of IT architecture and planning. Shifting to a pay-per-use or as-a-service model can eliminate much or all of the upfront forecasting and architecting work. The other and possibly more enticing benefit is that pay-per-use infrastructure purchasing offers a way to maximize the near-term potential of existing IT budgets. For enterprises that have multiple projects on the roadmap shifting from a large upfront capital purchase model to one that allocates costs over the life of a technology can enable existing budgets to extend to a larger amount of infrastructure -- which can accelerate IT projects. This opportunity to accelerate activities with existing budgets has quickly become a major driver behind the increasing levels of interest in these consumption-based models.

What holds organizations back from consumption-based IT? One of the more dominant reasons why organizations do not take advantage of as a service and pay per use is that their current budget model will not allow them. Another common critique however centers on the assumption that if you implement a pay-per-use model you will pay more over time than if you procured the system upfront. In other words usage-based pricing enables you to pay less upfront but over the life of the product those who choose to pay more upfront will pay less overall. Each offering is different. But even if you assume that a pay-per-use option would require a larger expense versus an upfront purchase the ability to defer payments has value. In addition pay-per-use models reduce the personnel time and risk associated with forecasting the environment. The cost equation ultimately comes down to two questions: How confident are you with your ability to forecast application needs over the next three to four years? And are you sure there isn't something you could do that would be a better use of your time?

As-a-service vs. consumption-based pricing The research data on the rising interest in a pay-per-use pricing model often focuses predominately on consumption-based pricing which is different from a true as-a-service model. Organizations can achieve similar benefits with each approach however. With subscription-based pricing you manage the infrastructure but only pay for what you use. With an as-a-service model the expectation is that the infrastructure vendor will take care of the maintenance support and even the upgrade path. As a service goes further to reduce the burden on IT resources which can help accelerate digital initiatives.",,,,,,

""For nearly two decades I have held my tongue and made excuses for certain events that traumatize me to this day"" Carpenter 50 began in her statement. ""Joss Whedon abused his power on numerous occasions while working together on the sets of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. While he found his misconduct amusing it only served to intensify my performance anxiety disempower me and alienate me from my peers.""

""The disturbing incidents triggered a chronic physical condition from which I still suffer"" Carpenter added. ""It is with a beating heavy heard that I say I coped in isolation and at times destructively.""

""This is not a man saying 'I didn't see it so it didn't happen' "" he said. ""I am gutted. I'm seriously gutted because one of my memories — my fondest memory — was the fact that it was so empowering. Not just with the words in the script but the family feel of the show.""

""I am really sad that if people went through these experiences"" Head added.

The new allegations come the year after actor Ray Fisher accused Whedon of being ""gross abusive unprofessional and completely unacceptable"" while they worked together on Justice League in 2017.

The female-centered dating site (BMBL) which went public on Thursday has explicitly banned unsolicited and derogatory comments made about someone’s appearance body shape size or health.

""We are not scared to take a stance for what we believe aligns with our values and our mission. Historically we banned guns from our platform and just two weeks ago we banned any form of body shaming. This is not going to be tolerated on our platform"" Bumble founder and CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday.

While Bumble has a zero tolerance policy for hate and toxicity the company has also taken several public stances on what it deems harmful behavior. ""This includes language that can be deemed fat-phobic ableist racist colorist homophobic or transphobic"" Bumble said in a Jan. 27 announcement which said such behavior could result in a warning or ban for repeat offenses or particularly harmful comments.

Speaking to Yahoo Finance on Thursday Herd said Bumble prioritizes holding users accountable for their behavior. ""In the real world there are guardrails laws consequences for your behavior. We're not trying to you know censor people but we are trying to tell you that if you want to behave poorly you cannot do it here"" said Herd who previously co-founded the dating site Tinder.

'We look at the woman's life cycle'

Founded in 2014 by Herd Bumble now reaches 42 million monthly active users across 150 countries. Bumble’s key differentiator is that women have to make the first move in heterosexual matches.

Bumble currently has offerings Bizz and BFF intended for users to meet their next business partner or best friend. Herd's vision of expanding Bumble both vertically and horizontally reflects her ambitions to grow up with women who may have first joined the app to find a boyfriend or girlfriend.

""We look at the woman's life cycle or the person's relationship journey. When you think about all of the different touch points you have in your life that are really a derivative of your relationships whether that's the quest for love or once you find love how you embark on the next chapter — engagement marriage fertility everything thereafter that comes with those journeys"" she told Yahoo Finance.

Herd has a personal mission to empower women and curb bad behavior particularly online. She sued her former employer Tinder for sexual harassment ultimately settling for an undisclosed amount.

Story continues

And Herd whose company is based in Austin Texas vocally supported a Texas law barring ""cyberflashing"" or the sending of unsolicited lewd photos. House Bill 2789 went into effect on September 1 2019 making the electronic transmission of sexually explicit material a Class C misdemeanor with a fine of up to $500 if the person who received it did not give consent. Herd has said she wants to work with Congress to introduce similar legislation on a federal level.

Shares of Bumble closed 76% above its IPO price on its first two days as a publicly traded company.

But indeed one could set up say a very nice luxury showcase bathroom using products that Nimir has a hand in. Soap? Nimir. Toilet paper? Nimir. Air freshener? Ditto. The deodorant on the counter the hairspray – even the cleanser and moisturizer – are all formed with products that Nimir Industrials manufactures and sells.

And it is doing a pretty good job of it. That is why on February 4 2021 the company announced to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) that its board had approved two new capital investments. The first is a new chlorinated paraffin wax plant which will include a chlorine liquefaction plant. This will produce 30 tons a day or 10000 tons annually and will cost Rs1 billion. The second is a renovation and upgrade of the fatty acid and soap noodle plants which will increase the capacity of soap noodles by 15000 tons annually.

The more interesting figure of the two is the Rs1 billion being spent on the new plant. But to understand why let us first take a look at the company’s history. Nimir Industrial Chemicals is part of the Nimir Group which includes Nemir Resins – which manufactures surface coating resins polyesters optical brightener and textile auxiliaries – Nimir Holding and Nimir Management. Nimir Holding has voluntarily winded up and its assets are now part of Nimir Chemicals; Nimir Management is designed for investment in Nimir Resins.

Nimir Chemicals was incorporated in Pakistan in February 1994 but started its commercial operation in January 2000. The company was initially involved in the manufacturing of oleo chemicals but is now also involved in making chlor-alkali. Its plant is located in Sheikhupura Punjab.

Oleo chemicals actually refers to vegetable oil and animal fats. This includes soap noodles (used in the manufacturing of soaps) stearic acid glycerine and distilled fatty acids. These components are then used in finished products like toilet soap tyres rubber textile softener metal polishing cosmetics candles pharmaceuticals and tobacco.

Chlor-alkali refers to the industrial process of electrolysis of sodium chloride. Nimir’s products include caustic soda sodium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid. These are then used in cleaning bleaching textiles water treatment and steel.

Finally on a contractual basis it makes toilet soap bars and toilet soap finishing and packing for different companies. It also provides certain solvent and palm oil products.

In other words Nimir produces the precursor products to many of the home and personal care products – such as soaps laundry detergents bleaches and household cleaners – that Pakistanis use in their daily lives.

Nimir Industrial Chemicals has done well: in the last six years it has consistently made a bigger profit after tax than the year before. In 2016 it recorded Rs441 million in standalone profit; in 2018 it recorded Rs696 million; in 2019 it recorded Rs810 million and in 2020 it recorded Rs926 million.

Net sales in 2020 were recorded at Rs17.1 billion up from Rs14.9 billion in 2019 and Rs12.1 billion in 2018. This is impressive as net sales numbers were not too long ago of just Rs7 billion in 2017 and Rs3 billion in 2014. The earnings per share has increased from Rs2 in 2015 to Rs8.4 in 2020.

It is also a far cry from the tumultuous years of the mid-2000s when there was concern about the operations of the company and its ability to survive as a standalone entity and the caustic soda plant still had to commence operations.

Nimir Chemicals did very well in the year of the pandemic; after all the company quite literally manufactures the precursor to soap the number one defense humans have against the Covid-19 pandemic. As the annual report for 2020 explained: “Nimir Industrial Chemicals Limited being the producer of soap – an effective prevention tool against the virus continued its operation throughout the lockdown period while adhering to the SOPs imposed by the government to ensure health and safety of the workforce. Therefore the Company stayed resilient in its performance and posted better results on the back of increased sales and profitability during the financial year under review.”

It is this financial soundness that has allowed the company to make expansion plans. For instance in the year 2020 the company approved Rs3060 million in the new solid-fuel based 20 MW power plant; approved Rs 450 million in a third party toll manufacturing facility; and approved an investment of Rs250 million in the second line of aerosols.

But the new chlorinated paraffin wax plant represents a bold shift away from personal care products and diversification into a new sector: manufacturing. The global chlorinated paraffin wax market includes lubricating additives plastic additives rubber paints and metalworking fluids. As it is flame retardant it is typically used by the aerospace and automotive sector. The Asia Pacific region leads in the manufacturing of this wax and this entire sector is expected to boom in the next ten years and the Asia Pacific region develops further. Pakistan is no exception and it seems Nimir Industries has spotted an opportunity that it can reap the benefits from for the next decade.",,,,,,,,,

GUESTS can enjoy a summer holiday for a week or two at Sir Cliff Richard’s £6million luxury Barbados home — for £3000 per night.

The singer 80 advertised the six-bedroom property on Airbnb after he was unable to sell it.

5 Sir Cliff Richard has been trying to sell the property for four years

The sprawling mansion had been on the market since 2017 but had not sold despite a reduction of £200000 on the £6.8million asking price last month.

The Caribbean island getaway sleeps ten guests and boasts a tennis court a swimming pool and a bar and is set in 2.6 acres of sun-kissed land.

But Sir Cliff has strict house rules which stipulate “no pets parties or smoking”.

The Airbnb advert reads: “The property is beautifully landscaped with huge palm trees lining the entrance leading to a fabulous six-bedroom mansion that is home to one of the most popular British singers of our time.”

On Desert Island Discs in December Sir Cliff revealed he spent the first lockdown at the home.

Asked how he would cope on a desert island the star said: “I’ll miss not having my friends around me.

""I’ll miss not having proper meals cooked for me. I’d miss tennis terribly.

“When I did the first five-week lockdown in Barbados I dealt with that pretty well.”

Sir Cliff who has sold more than 250 million records worldwide has relocated to New York City because he likes the “anonymity”.

Swanky: Sir Cliff Richard has reportedly rented his luxury Barbados villa on Airbnb for £3000-a-night

Originally putting his 26-acre property on the market in 2017 the singer who is a full citizen of Barbados set an asking price of £6.8million in 2019 but has still failed to find a buyer.

And now according to The Sun Sir Cliff has rented his luxury Barbados villa on Airbnb for £3000-a-night.

In an advertisement on the popular rental website it reads: 'Coral Sundown is very privately tucked away at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac in the heart of the exclusive Sugar Hill Tennis resort in West Moreland St. James.

'The property is beautifully landscaped with huge Palm Trees lining the entrance leading to a fabulous six-bedroom mansion that is home to one of the most popular British singers of our time.'

While 'house rules' claim 'no pets parties or smoking' while staying in the lavish property.

MailOnline has contacted Sir Cliff's representatives for comment.

The luxury villa is situated in the exclusive Sugar Hill Estate on the west coast of the sun-soaked island of Barbados.

In January Hamptons International put the property on the market for £6606000.

The 2.6 acre property has six en-suite bedrooms a family room and powder room. The two main suites have panoramic balconies while there is also a covered terrace bar and large swimming pool.

The singer - who has sold more than 250 million records - also has a pool house with an additional kitchen and dining room.

He has lived on the idyllic island for more than 20 years however now resides primarily in the USA.

Sir Cliff is spending less time in the UK following a high profile police raid on his property in 2014.

In 2016 he sold his Berkshire apartment for £2.6 million which he said has been 'defiled' by the televised raid.

Scenic: The estate is enclosed within grounds offering private tennis courts a double car garage and a driveway lined with palm trees

The singer has since successfully sued the BBC for defamation over the incident.

He described the accusations - which he was never arrested or charged over - as 'two years of hell'.

It appears Sir Cliff has chosen to move to New York to try and stay out of the limelight.

He relocated to the USA because he likes the 'anonymity' of America his friend Gloria Hunniford said.

Estate agents Hamptons said: 'A unique luxury villa in the exclusive Sugar Hill Estate Coral Sundown boasts some of the most magnificent views of Barbados' clear waters.

'Every bedroom faces the Caribbean Sea and all vantage points are blessed with beautiful views.

'The ground floor accommodates four bedroom suites that open out to the lush gardens.

Or follow us on Google News

The Volkswagen ID.3 is now being produced in Volkswagen’s Transparent Factory in Dresden* Germany.

This is the 4th Volkswagen Group factory that is producing electric vehicles based on the MEB (Modular Electric Drive) platform. This follows the opening of the Zwickau factory a short distance to the southwest of Dresden and the subsequent opening of Anting and Foshan factories in China at the end of 2020. The four factories combined can produce 900000 vehicles a year.

The factory isn’t just a factory for Volkswagen though. “We are a production plant tourist attraction event location test lab and delivery center – all in one” Danny Auerswald the site manager states. Here’s a breakdown of the various operational components of this facility:

“In addition to production this will create new or expanded areas of business. There are currently 380 employees working at Volkswagen’s Dresden site.

“In future significantly more vehicles will be handed over to customers in the Transparent Factory. To that end a second delivery point was recently set up in the factory – which is unique in the automobile industry. The number of vehicle handovers to customers is expected to increase from 1301 in 2019 and 3296 in 2020 to more than 5000 vehicles in 2021. The goal is around 9700 deliveries a year by 2022.

“The Functional Testing station in Dresden is being further expanded. It is an integral part of the worldwide network of testing stations for the overall vehicle development. Its focal points: The testing of assistance systems mobile online services engines and chassis.

“In the Technical Vehicle Service used vehicles will be inspected and repaired. Electric vehicles will also be prepared for delivery at the Transparent Factory. The goal is to deliver vehicles produced in Dresden primarily in Dresden.

“Moreover the topic of Production 4.0 will be driven forward in the Transparent Factory. The guiding principle is the automation and digitalization of complex operations within assembly and logistics. Specifically the factory will act as a planned pilot plant in the Company for the development and application of new technologies in real series processes.”

https://youtu.be/n4is7E4Wg80

While the historic Zwickau factory was the first to produce an ID vehicle — the ID.3 back in June 2o20 — Volkswagen indicates that it wants to develop this Dresden facility into the “Home of the ID.” Engaging in multiple aspects of ID vehicle development including offering customers a close-up show of how their vehicles are made will turn the Transparent Factory into a multi-pronged heart of the ID revolution. Or as Volkswagen phrases it:

“The central goal: To act as a beacon for Volkswagen in Germany offering customers visitors and guests a holistic experience of the ID. family – from initial advice and test drives to production visits co-constructing the ID.3 and modern event formats up to the handover of electric vehicles. An additional focus of the strategic realignment is the development of a research and innovation site that drives innovative projects on a pilot scale for later use in large capacity sites at Volkswagen.”

“Here visitors customers and guests come into direct contact with the mobility of tomorrow” Auerswald adds.

The company is still increasing production of the ID.3 ID.4 and other EV models on a weekly basis at its three other operational MEB-focused factories. Further Volkswagen plans to start EV production at factories in Emden (Germany) Hanover (Germany) and Chattanooga (Tennessee USA) in coming months.

For the past few years before ID.3 production was readied at the plant Volkswagen produced the e-Golf at the Transparent Factory. From 2017 until production ended late last year Volkswagen built 50401 units of the e-Golf there.

Indicating the significance of ID.3 production starting at the Transparent Factory those in attendance for the launch included Saxony’s Minister of Economy and Transport Martin Dulig; Mayor of Dresden Dirk Hilbert; the management of Volkswagen Sachsen — Dr. Stefan Loth (Technology & Logistics) Karen Kutzner (Finance & Controlling) and Dirk Coers (Human Resources); and the Chairman of the General Works Council of Volkswagen Saxony Jens Rothe.

You can visit the Transparent Factory from Monday to Saturday between 9:30 am and 6:30 pm and on Sunday from 9:30 am to 5:00 pm.

*Which is just a hop skip and a short high-speed rail ride from my home in Poland. So I hope to visit it when we finally get back to Poland.

Future of tech in healthcare

Alphabet Amazon Apple and Microsoft have been dipping their toes into the healthcare industry and some of their endeavors have the potential to change healthcare at large.

As the Big Four move steadily onward into healthcare it's necessary for legacy players (hospitals insurers pharma companies health IT firms) to know exactly what their strategies look like and what they stand to lose and gain.

Here are some key takeaways from the report:

Alphabet Amazon Apple and Microsoft are gunning to carve out spaces within the healthcare market and each is targetting its own set of sectors to transform or disrupt.

Microsoft is focused on its race with Amazon and Google to lay claim to the healthcare cloud market Apple is knuckling down on clinical research initiatives via its wearables Alphabet is focusing on its AI expertise to drive precision medicine and Amazon is shaping up to disrupt the pharmacy virtual care and telehealth realms.

Their moves into healthcare are providing health systems with tech needed to patch up interoperability and data sharing gaps giving healthcare payers a chance to collect a more comprehensive set of health data for members and granting pharma companies the ability to streamline drug development and manufacturing.

But tech giants' forward march into healthcare is in some cases troubling incumbents. Amazon's prescription delivery play has traditional pharmacies looking for ways to retain their customer bases for instance and Alphabet is building an ecosystem that we think could put it at odds with top dogs in the EHR industry.

And their inroads into the healthcare space may be stymied by consumers' meager trust in tech companies handling their health information as well as a rampant cybersecurity crisis that could have healthcare firms holding off on tech investments.

""For nearly two decades I have held my tongue and made excuses for certain events that traumatize me to this day"" Carpenter 50 began in her statement. ""Joss Whedon abused his power on numerous occasions while working together on the sets of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. While he found his misconduct amusing it only served to intensify my performance anxiety disempower me and alienate me from my peers.""

""The disturbing incidents triggered a chronic physical condition from which I still suffer"" Carpenter added. ""It is with a beating heavy heard that I say I coped in isolation and at times destructively.""

Anthony Head who played Rupert Giles on the show spoke about the allegations against Whedon during a virtual sit-down with ITV's This Morning and said he was ""gutted"" by the claims.

""This is not a man saying 'I didn't see it so it didn't happen' "" he said. ""I am gutted. I'm seriously gutted because one of my memories — my fondest memory — was the fact that it was so empowering. Not just with the words in the script but the family feel of the show.""

""I am really sad that if people went through these experiences"" Head added.

James Marsters is the latest Buffy the Vampire Slayer alum to speak out amid abuse allegations against the series' creator Joss Whedon.

Marsters who played Spike on the hit teen series and its spinoff Angel said in a Twitter post on Friday that he was ""heartbroken"" following allegations that Whedon 56 had created a ""hostile and toxic"" work environment on the set of both shows.

Reps for Whedon did not have a comment at this time.

""While I will always be honored to have played the character of Spike the Buffy set was not without challenges"" Marsters 58 said. ""I do not support abuse of any kind and am heartbroken to learn of the experiences of some of the cast.""

The actor added ""I send my love and support to all involved.""

Recently Charisma Carpenter — who starred as Cordelia Chase on Buffy the Vampire Slayer from 1997–1999 and Angel from 1999-2004 — shared a lengthy statement on social media accusing Whedon of making repeated threats to fire her and efforts to ""alienate"" her from her peers.

""For nearly two decades I have held my tongue and made excuses for certain events that traumatize me to this day"" Carpenter 50 began in her statement. ""Joss Whedon abused his power on numerous occasions while working together on the sets of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. While he found his misconduct amusing it only served to intensify my performance anxiety disempower me and alienate me from my peers.""

""The disturbing incidents triggered a chronic physical condition from which I still suffer"" Carpenter added. ""It is with a beating heavy heard that I say I coped in isolation and at times destructively.""

During one alleged instance Carpenter claimed Whedon asked her if she planned to ""keep"" her baby after learning she was pregnant. She also claimed he ""callously"" called her ""fat"" to colleagues during her pregnancy.

""He proceeded to attack my character mock my religious beliefs accuse me of sabotaging the show and then unceremoniously fired me the following season once I gave birth"" she claimed.

Following her claims her Buffy costars Sarah Michelle Gellar Michelle Trachtenberg Amber Benson and Eliza Dushku all came forward in support of Carpenter with Benson noting that the set was a ""toxic environment.""

Anthony Head who played Rupert Giles on the show spoke about the allegations against Whedon during a virtual sit-down with ITV's This Morning and said he was ""gutted"" by the claims.

""This is not a man saying 'I didn't see it so it didn't happen' "" he said. ""I am gutted. I'm seriously gutted because one of my memories — my fondest memory — was the fact that it was so empowering. Not just with the words in the script but the family feel of the show.""

""I am really sad that if people went through these experiences"" Head added.

The new allegations come the year after actor Ray Fisher accused Whedon of being ""gross abusive unprofessional and completely unacceptable"" while they worked together on Justice League in 2017.

WarnerMedia launched an internal investigation after Fisher's claims and said when the investigation concluded in December 2020 that ""remedial action has been taken."""

What used to cost thousands of dollars and fenced off to only deep-pocketed corporations is now readily available for any product. Amazing.

BUT Amazon just released a really cool new feature that allows you to get direct customer feedback on your product specifically.

Basically you can create short surveys that Amazon will present to customers who recently interacted with your product: people who purchased viewed your product but didn’t purchase and more.

Ultimately the program allows you to get direct feedback from your target market with ease and speed. This can be a powerful tool for sellers to iterate and improve on their product marketing quickly based on quantitative and qualitative data.

The program is called Amazon Insights and you won’t be able to find a link in your Seller Central Dashboard.

Instead once logged in you will have to go here: https://sellercentral.amazon.com/insights/intake/new

Who Can I Survey?

When you create your survey you determine what your goals are and who you wish to target.

Here are the choices that Amazon gives you from their pre-made templates:

Purchase Behavior:

Product Awareness:

Product Opinion:

or just create your own questions:

I went through the process of creating my own question and answer options. You can see from the screenshot below that it is very straightforward.

I selected how I wanted to segment the survey recipients (I wanted to learn why people saw but didn’t purchase my product) and then enter some answers that they can select from:

Per Amazon here is how you can set up your targeting:

Customers who have purchased your product(s) on Amazon

Customers who viewed your product(s) on Amazon

Customers who viewed your product(s) but did not purchase

Customers who purchased a product in the same category as your product on Amazon

The most important thing that I’m sure you’re wondering: how much does this cost?

And you may not like the answer: I don’t know. Yet. I have submitted my request to start an Insights campaign but will hear back in the next 7 days.

Regardless you pay per response and the pricing depends on your targeting criteria and size of segment you target. I will definitely share more once I hear back!

You will have to do a minimum of 100 responses at least though so be ready to make at least some investment into getting these survey answers.

This is how your survey and result will look to your end user:

My Take On Amazon Insights

I am excited to see how this program unfolds. I think it is actionable and helpful information if you can learn exactly why someone did NOT purchase your product.

So I think that the Purchase Behavior survey will be something that I would be happy investing in.

However I am not sure how helpful the other Insight topics will be.

Product Awareness: for private label sellers I have zero expectation that they have ever heard of my private label brand. Instead I am banking on the fact that they are simply in need of a solution to their problem and willing to purchase any good product that appears on Amazon. Remember this is the main challenge we are addressing in our product research!

And as for Product Opinion I get product reviews to tell me about this. Granted not every purchasing customer will leave a review but over time a significant portion will leave a review and help me identify any defective products packaging feature or any other product quality issues.

Regardless I think that gathering competitive data can leave you at a nice advantage over your competitors. Whether it is your Pay Per Click Search Term Report Jungle Scout Product Tracker data 😉  or these survey Insights actionable data that is proprietary to you can give you that competitive edge that ultimately can push you ahead of your competitors!

For my active products I get the majority of my actionable data from Fetcher. It calculates my business metrics so I always know how my products are performing and where I can make improvements. Give it a whirl.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxmb3JkZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9vcGluaW9uLzIwMjEvMDIvMTMvYW1hem9uLXB1dHRpbmctbG9jYWwtYm9va3N0b3Jlcy1vdXQtYnVzaW5lc3MtdGFraW5nLWxvc3Nlcy1pdHMtYm9vay1zYWxlcy82NzM2NDE3MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon is putting local bookstores out of business by taking losses on its book sales,"Adam Stern

Guest Columnist

In 2021 the pandemic-riddled Age of Online Shopping with an Amazon delivery truck creeping down every street lane and avenue in America why do we need independent bookstores?

If price and speed are all that matter Amazon is the most efficient way to get books. Though the websites of independent stores such as the Seminary Co-op and 57th Street Books in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood are good they cannot compete with a cutting-edge website and app funded by a billion-dollar corporation. Amazon maximizes this advantage by using books as a loss leader — losing money on their sales so that customers will be drawn into buying higher-margin items. That’s why many books on Amazon are cheaper than the same books at a bricks-and-mortar bookstore.

That is not new information but let me repeat: Amazon is putting local bookstores out of business by taking losses on its book sales so that it can make more money selling other stuff.

Yes you can get a product as quickly as possible for the lowest price but there are hidden costs to this type of consumerism — unsafe working conditions for the men and women sorting packing and shipping those innumerable boxes among others.

The twin pillars of independent bookstores are browsing and community.

You do not get a browsing experience on Amazon; you get algorithmic recommendations based on your viewing history. That algorithmic experience has as much to do with browsing in a bookstore as a photo of a cheeseburger has to do with eating one just off the grill the smells of char and beef and crispy onions wafting toward you cheddar cheese oozing over the edge of a toasted brioche bun with a hint of tangy mustard.

Remember before the pandemic what it was like to browse a bookstore? There’s no hurry no rush. It’s a pleasurable wandering allowing room for the unexpected and intuitive. Book browsing is also communing with a space — unlike on Amazon where you scroll. Your whole body and mind are engaged in browsing: You drift around the stacks drawn on by the rhythmic spines; looking circling bending and reaching; picking up books this one larger or smaller in the hand that one unexpectedly heavy; noticing the colorful designs; creamy or stiff paper; the smell of ink; you encounter other human beings in that space doing the same thing a browsing collective of curious minds. You never know what you may find what mind from the past or present you may meet or what person you may encounter just on the other side of the bookcase; and isn’t finding the unlooked-for one of life’s pleasures?

Book shopping online builds no memories no sense of the families students friends and quiet readers who create a bookstore’s unique texture.

A friend a Chicago Public Schools reading specialist and bookstore colleague used to browse with a promising young student at 57th Street Books helping her develop a lifelong love of reading. This student is now her teaching assistant and takes her own kids to the store to wander in its unrivaled children’s room.

If you talk to people in Hyde Park it seems everyone has a similar story. Community matters in this place.

Bookstores — places that nurture learning and discussion champion diverse voices and ideas celebrate language treasure knowledge and connect the past with our chaotic present to show us how we might go forward — are more needed than ever. We must do everything we can to support them now before it is too late because they are hubs of building what Martin Luther King Jr. called the Beloved Community centered on justice equality and love.

Food giants Walmart Costco and Kroger – which together last year totalled sales worth more than half a trillion dollars – are selling Brazilian beef products imported by JBS the world’s largest meat company which has been embroiled in a string of deforestation allegations in recent years.

Research by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the non-profit data-analysis agency C4ADS established that in recent years the JBS subsidiary Sampco Inc has imported into the US thousands of tonnes of Brazilian beef destined for grocery chains and other food companies.

The products include shredded and canned (corned) beef as well as frozen meat and steaks. In December researchers identified Sampco-branded shredded beef produced in a JBS factory in São Paulo being sold by both Walmart and Costco and shipping data pinpoints JBS exports of Brazilian corned beef being supplied for sale in Kroger stores.

Food giants Walmart Costco and Kroger – which together totalled net sales worth more than half a trillion dollars last year – are selling Brazilian beef products imported from JBS the world’s largest meat company which has been linked to deforestation.

Brazilian beef has been identified as a key driver of deforestation in the Amazon where swathes of forest are cleared for pasture used for cattle farming. The Amazon is a crucial buffer in stabilising the regional and global climate. Experts say preserving the world’s rainforests is essential if further intensification of the climate emergency is to be averted.

Research by the Guardian the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the nonprofit data analysis agency C4ADS established that in recent years the JBS subsidiary Sampco Inc has imported thousands of tonnes of Brazilian beef destined for grocery chains and other food companies into the US.



The products include shredded and canned (corned) beef as well as frozen meat and steaks. In December Sampco-branded shredded beef produced in a JBS factory in São Paulo was being sold online by both Walmart and Costco and shipping data pinpoints JBS exports of Brazilian corned beef being supplied for sale in Kroger stores.

Between July 2017 and November 2019 Sampco imported more than 5000 consignments of Brazilian beef products totalling 7884 tonnes records obtained by C4ADS show.

Responding to these findings campaigners called on the grocery chains to take swift action to rid supply chains of deforestation-linked products.



“Supermarkets need to go beyond their sustainability rhetoric by setting strict requirements for their suppliers banning deforestation monitoring their suppliers for compliance and dropping contracts with the worst offenders like JBS” said Lucia von Reusner senior campaign director of international campaign organisation Mighty Earth.



Costco declined to answer questions but pointed to its sustainability policies which state: “Our intent is not to source beef from high-risk deforestation regions until comprehensive traceability and monitoring systems are in place.”

A Walmart spokesperson said: “Walmart takes these allegations seriously and will review the claims made. We believe healthy forests sustain biodiversity support livelihoods and play an important role in mitigating climate change. Walmart is working with suppliers on certification monitoring supporting sustainable sourcing regions promoting collaborative action and advocating for effective policy.”

A spokesperson for Kroger said: “We take deforestation seriously as demonstrated by our no-deforestation commitment and continue to engage our suppliers in pursuit of this commitment and to ensure no deforestation is happening in our relevant supply chains.”



JBS beef exports have been linked to farms involved in up to 115 sq miles (300 sq km) of deforestation a year. The company slaughters almost 35000 cattle a day in Brazil.



A JBS spokesperson said: “The spurious allegation that JBS exports are linked to deforestation is irresponsible and based on flawed superficial analysis of the correlation between the concentration of deforestation at municipality level and the location of our plants. Correlation is not causation.”

Campaigners said the latest revelations highlighted the urgent need for US laws that combat deforestation. To date there has not been any significant proposal in the US for federal legislation outlawing agricultural imports linked to tropical deforestation unlike in Britain and the EU where momentum for new rules has recently gathered pace.

“The US is complicit in driving global deforestation through its sales of beef products from Brazil” said Sarah Lake Mighty Earth’s vice-president and director for Latin America. “The Biden administration has an opportunity to advance legislation to restrict the import of products linked to deforestation just as the EU the UK and France are already doing.”

Brian Schatz Democratic senator for Hawaii said before the Covid pandemic that he planned to introduce such legislation. And last week a bill was introduced to the California state assembly that would require contractors supplying products to the state to ensure they are not linked to deforestation overseas.

“I love animals and Denny surprised me and took me to Sydney Zoo in Western Sydney and it was such a wonderful fun day” she said adding that before that magical first date she had wondered if Denny was “into me or not” and feared they may be stuck in the ""friend zone.""

“We hung out with each other a lot as friends before I realised he was everything I was looking for in a guy—he’s funny caring and he looks out for me. We also have a lot in common… and I thought he was really cute!”

Alyssa 25 who lives in southwest Sydney and works as an outbound pick process assistant at Amazon and Denny 26 an Amazon learning trainer from Elizabeth Hills started dating in August after meeting through a mutual friend at work and falling in love.

Denny jokes that if it wasn’t for his young niece teasing him in front on Alyssa at a family dinner he may never have summoned up the nerve to ask her out. “I pretty much asked her out when I drove her home” he said sheepishly.

“She’s so sweet kind and honest and she’s really fun to tease—and she’s a good kisser!” he grinned.

This Valentine’s Day is the first they will spend together and even though both Denny and Alyssa are working at Amazon on the day this couple isn’t fazed. “I love working with Denny because just seeing him makes me feel better if I’m having a stressful day” Alyssa said.

Mark and Sandra

Mark McSwiney and Sandra Palaitis both insist they aren’t romantics yet this couple celebrated their 26-year-relationship in the most romantic way possible flying to Hawaii to tie the knot in front of their two thrilled sons four years ago.

Amazon safety coordinator Mark 60 said he’s only ever had eyes for critical role trainer Sandra 53 since they were set up on a blind date by one of Sandra’s schoolmates despite some minor bumps along the way.

“The first time I bought her flowers she got hay fever” laughs Mark who says it was fantastic to finally wed in front of their two boys Ryan 22 and Adam 20 in what was a celebration of Sandra’s 50th birthday and their long love affair.

“I had to marry him to get some new bling” joked Sandra who said Mark may not be the world’s biggest romantic but he does make an effort including making her sandwiches complete with the crusts cut off and cooking BBQs to share the load in the kitchen."

Amtrak passengers are being bused around the site.

Sixteen cars were derailed at a switching area according to Normal Mayor Chris Koos. Illinois State University Police said there were no injuries and no hazardous materials were aboard the train.

""At around 5 a.m. I heard what I thought was an earthquake"" said Logan Meagher an Illinois State University student who lives near Uptown Normal. ""I saw a huge flash of light. I came outside and there was this.""

Police asked residents to avoid the area Saturday morning as crews continued to work. Because of the length of the train multiple intersections were closed although Main and Center streets were open.

Matt Swaney a Normal Fire Department spokesman said the Town of Normal ISU Ameren Illinois and Union Pacific had finished evaluating the derailment site and the impacts to the surrounding area and repairs were underway.

""We have been informed that an extended power outage will likely affect some of the immediate neighborhoods portions of Illinois State University campus and the Uptown Normal business district"" Swaney said. ""At this time Ameren Illinois is working with Union Pacific to coordinate the repairs and once the information and the extent of the outage is known it will be shared via official channels and social media. Officials are assembled in a joint information center and emergency operations center to coordinate information dissemination.""

As of 2 p.m. Ameren Illinois was reporting 46 McLean county residences without power.

The McLean County Emergency Management Agency is working with the Normal Fire Department ISU and other community agencies and organizations. There is a possibility of an extended power outage to replace broken poles and the EMA is waiting for additional information from Ameren. Officials said they have plans developed to assist residents that live in the affected area if the need arises.

A Pantagraph photographer at the scene reported that the train was heading north and more than a dozen cars are off the tracks.

Temperatures were near zero at the time of the derailment around 5 a.m. but Koos said officials were uncertain whether weather had anything to do with the cause.

""Two lines that run parallel have damage but we hope that one line will be functional as soon as the wreckage is cleared away"" he said.

ISU student Trevor Tanke said the building where he was staying often shakes slightly when there are strong wind gusts but what he experienced early Saturday was jarringly different.

""It shook for like 15 20 seconds and we were like 'Wow. Was that an earthquake?'"" he said. He looked out the window and didn't see anything.

""Thank gosh everyone's OK"" he said surveying the wreckage later Saturday morning. ""That's scary.""

Swaney asked the public to stay clear of the area.

""Do not approach the train or the tracks in an attempt to take pictures or video"" he said. ""While there are no hazardous materials involved in the derailment there are power lines down and portions of the train or track may be energized and poses a electrocution hazard. In addition it is unlawful to trespass on railroad property and may result in fines or arrest.""

Early Saturday railroad crossings were closed at University Street Fell Street Broadway Street Linden Street College Avenue Mulberry Street Beech Street and Willow Street/Fort Jesse Road. The railroad underpass at Vernon Avenue was also closed.

Most of those were reopened within hours. As of noon the railroad crossings at University Street and Fell Street were closed as well as the railroad underpass at Vernon Avenue and Beaufort Street.

Amtrak officials at the Uptown Center in Normal told The Pantagraph they were using buses to transport passengers from Lincoln to Pontiac until the train tracks could be reopened. The company also brought in some track repair equipment to help with the repairs of the track.

Amtrak spokeswoman Beth Toll said several adjustments were made to the schedule Saturday.

""Due to a freight train derailment Amtrak Texas Eagle trains 422 and 22 will detour between St. Louis and Chicago missing all intermediate stops. Alternate transportation will be provided for passengers scheduled to board between St. Louis and Chicago. Additionally Amtrak Lincoln Service (operating between Chicago and St. Louis) trains 303 306 and 307 are canceled. Passengers onboard Lincoln Service train 300 which was already en route and is terminating at SPI are being provided substitute bus transportation.""

Service updates are available on Twitter at @AmtrakAlerts.

ISU said there was no imminent danger to the campus community but students living nearby who have concerns can email the Dean of Students Office email at deanofstudents@ilstu.edu. Staff are monitoring this email address.

Because of the derailment the Children's Discovery Museum in Uptown Normal canceled the Glow Climb Splash member events for Saturday and announced those events would be rescheduled. Staff will contact ticket holders with further instructions.

""The staff is watching the developing situation and will make a decision about Sunday playtimes later today"" museum officials said in a social media post.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But airlines have not applied the same verve to communicating with passengers about exposure to the coronavirus. None of the four major U.S. airlines has a process for informing passengers if they have been on a flight with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.

American Delta Southwest and United all have the same position on telling passengers if they shared a flight with someone who tested positive: It’s up to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health departments.

Since airlines implemented strict safety and cleaning protocols in the early weeks of the pandemic there have been few reports of outbreaks linked to specific airline flights. But cases of potential exposure are fairly frequent: The CDC identified more than 4000 flights between January and November 2020 that included potential exposures.

The CDC contends that it’s difficult to know for certain if someone was infected with the coronavirus on a flight. “CDC is not able to definitively determine that potential cases were associated (or not) with exposure in the air cabin or through air travel given the numerous opportunities for potential exposure associated with the entire travel journey and widespread global distribution of the virus” CDC spokesperson Caitlin Shockey wrote in an email to the Washington Post according to a September 2020 report in that paper.

The CDC is indeed in charge of the process of contact tracing and reaching out to passengers about a possible exposure. Yet the agency has been overwhelmed since the start of the pandemic and so have local health departments that might be able to take up the cause.

Martin Cetron director of the CDC’s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine told USA Today recently that owing to underfunding of public health and to state and local health departments being swamped with other COVID-related responsibilities he isn’t confident in the agency’s ability to inform airline passengers of a potential exposure.

CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald told Fortune in an email that the agency hasn’t been able to conduct a contact investigation for all of the more than 4000 flights with potential exposures between January and November 2020. Among the reasons McDonald cited were the need to prioritize investigations where the “CDC received contact information within a time frame to enable effective public health response.” He did not respond to a follow-up email asking for clarification on how many investigations were conducted and the exact number of flights with potential exposures.

Airlines currently play a support role in the contact tracing process by providing a flight manifest to the CDC if an exposure is suspected. And in December United and Delta launched programs in concert with the CDC that collect passenger contact information that the government agency will have immediate access to. Passengers are prompted at check-in to voluntarily opt in to share their information.

But the major U.S. airlines themselves have chosen not to take on the responsibility of notifying passengers about potential exposure.

Fortune contacted the four largest U.S. airlines by passengers carried—American Delta Southwest and United—as well as Airlines for America the trade group that represents them and other major U.S. airlines to ask about their process for exposure notification. Their responses were nearly the same: They said they work with the CDC to supply passenger information through flight manifests and that the CDC is responsible for contact tracing. None answered the question of why they had not set up their own notification systems in addition to CDC efforts.

According to McDonald of the CDC “Nothing in CDC’s reporting requirements prevents airline operators from contacting passengers who may have been exposed to an infectious disease.”

Most airlines stated in their responses that the CDC is the best-positioned entity to conduct contact tracing and notification.

Ashish Jha dean of the Brown University School of Public Health believes airlines should play a role in notification alongside the CDC and public health departments.

“They actually have the passenger information. They have addresses of people. This would not be that hard for airlines to do” Jha said in a phone interview. “But my sense is they have not seen it as their responsibility and that’s why it’s not happening.”

Not only are airlines the most technically capable of notification but they also have an ethical duty to their customers Jha said. He recalled that last summer after dining on a restaurant’s outdoor patio he received a call the next morning from the restaurant informing him that someone who had also dined there that night tested positive for COVID. The same standard should apply to airlines he said.

“It’s their customers so they should be the ones notifying.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLW1pYW1pLXRlbC1hdml2LWZsaWdodC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Launches Miami To Tel Aviv Flight (Now Bookable),"Last week American Airlines revealed that it will serve Tel Aviv out of a third US city with all three flights expected to launch in 2021. This new flight is now bookable.

American’s Miami to Tel Aviv route launches June 2021

As of June 4 2021 American Airlines will launch 3x weekly Miami to Tel Aviv flights. The new service will operate with the following schedule:

Miami to Tel Aviv departing 7:40PM arriving 3:10PM (+1 day) [Wed Fri Sun]

Tel Aviv to Miami departing 11:55PM arriving 6:50AM (+1 day) [Mon Thu Sat]

With only three flights per week it’s interesting that American is choosing to operate one of the frequencies on a Friday given that a not-insignificant number of travelers to & from Israel don’t travel on that day. I’m guessing this isn’t a coincidence and that the airline thinks enough other people want to travel on Fridays to maximize their time away from home.

American’s new Miami to Tel Aviv route

American Airlines will use a Boeing 777-200ER for the route featuring 273 seats including 37 business class seats and 24 premium economy seats.

American’s 777s feature premium economy

A few interesting things to note about this route:

At 6603 miles this will be American’s longest route out of Miami; it’s blocked at 12hr30min eastbound and 13hr55min westbound

American will go head-to-head against EL AL in this market

This will be American’s first route from Miami to Asia (even though Western Asia isn’t what people traditionally think of when they hear Asia); Miami Airport has been trying to attract service to North Asia/China for years so here’s to hoping we see a route like that at some point

This flight is now on sale though as of the time of this post there’s not much award or upgrade availability in first & business class at a reasonable cost

American’s Dallas & New York to Tel Aviv flights

It’s fantastic to see American not only return to Israel but to do so in full force. American’s last route to Israel was from Philadelphia to Tel Aviv and that route was cut in 2015 after allegedly losing money for years.

American’s new Miami to Tel Aviv route complements new service from Dallas and New York:

As of May 2021 American will launch daily flights between New York and Tel Aviv; this is being operated as part of American’s new strategic partnership with JetBlue in the Northeast

As of October 2021 American will launch 3x weekly flights between Dallas and Tel Aviv; this was the first route to Israel that American announced though it has been pushed back due to coronavirus

American will fly to Israel from three US cities

Bottom line

How cool to see American continue to expand its service to Israel as the airline goes from operating no flights to the country to operating flights out of three cities. I’m particularly excited about the Miami route as a resident in the area who would love to return to Israel after having had an amazing trip there a few years ago.

I still find it a bit surprising how soon all of these routes are being launched with Israel’s borders still closed. While Israel is getting its population vaccinated quickly I’ll be curious to see if that also means that borders reopen within the next few months which presumably is something that American is banking on here.

But chances are you never thought working on a math problem or bringing a birthday cake on board could result in you getting the boot. The reality is that there's plenty of gray area in an airline's contract of carriage including the right for a flight crew to kick you off the plane if they find you to be ""uncooperative"" or a threat to the ""safety of other passengers or the crew."" These broad definitions have led to some truly bizarre (and often unreasonable) instances of people getting kicked off planes.

If you have an upcoming flight that you really can't miss (or simply want to be entertained by some real-life in-flight horror stories) it might pay to read up on some of the truly unusual reasons people have gotten kicked off planes.

Smelling Bad

All three major U.S. airlines — American United and Delta — note in their contract of carriage that people who have an offensive odor can be asked to get off a flight. According to Delta you may be kicked off a plane if your ""hygiene or odor creates an unreasonable risk of offense or annoyance to other passengers."" As you'd imagine what constitutes a scent that is offensive or annoying to other passengers isn't easily determined.

Weighing Too Much

A man on a 2016 United Airlines flight from Las Vegas to New Jersey was kicked off the plane because of his weight. The passenger Errol Narvaez was assigned a new seat after boarding even though he paid for a preboard ticket. Then Narvaez's new seatmate said something to a flight attendant resulting in the flight supervisor asking Narvaez to get off the aircraft. A spokesperson for United Airlines told HuffPost that they have a right to remove people who can't safely fit in their seat adding that Narvaez was removed ""for the safety and comfort"" of other people on the flight.

Kissing Your Girlfriend

The L Word actress Leisha Hailey and her girlfriend were kicked off a Southwest Airlines flight in 2011 for kissing. According to the actress and her girlfriend who released a statement through their band Uh Huh Her ""It was one modest kiss."" In response Southwest released a statement saying ""Initial reports indicate that we received several passenger complaints characterizing the behavior as excessive. Our crew responsible for the comfort of all customers on board approached the passengers based solely on behavior and not gender. The conversation escalated to a level that was better resolved on the ground as opposed to in flight.""

Bringing a Birthday Cake On Board

A family flying from New York to Las Vegas for a birthday celebration brought along a birthday cake — not knowing that it would lead to their expulsion from a JetBlue flight. When a flight attendant asked that they move the cake out of the overhead compartment and set it under the seat in front of them the family complied but then a second flight attendant intervened confronting the first attendant.

The JetBlue customer Cameron Burke told ABC7 News after the 2017 event that ""She was pointing to her 'Did you tell him he couldn't put anything in the overhead compartment?' I had approached them and I said everything was fine and she said 'Sir this does not involve you.' When she told me I had been noncompliant then I said 'Ma'am had you been drinking?' Because her behavior was not normal.""

Eventually the Port Authority Police Department was called the entire aircraft deplaned and the Burke family was not permitted to fly.

Wearing Sagging Pants

Wearing sagging pants may sound like an absurd reason to get booted off a flight but it was a reality for Billie Joe Armstrong guitarist for the punk band Green Day. On a 2011 Southwest flight from Oakland to Burbank California a flight attendant asked Armstrong to pull up his pants. He responded by saying that she should worry about more important things. In response Armstrong was kicked off the flight.

Earlier that same year college football player Deshon Marman was removed from a U.S. Airways flight for refusing to pull up his pajama bottoms.

Having a Bathroom Emergency

A man on a Delta Air Lines flight was forced to get off the plane after he got up to use the bathroom while the aircraft sat on the runway. According to ABC News Kima Hamilton asked a flight attendant if he could use the bathroom and was told no. He waited another 30 minutes while the plane was delayed on the tarmac before finally getting up to use the restroom. After returning to his seat a Delta employee kicked him off the plane even as Hamilton explained it had been a bathroom emergency.

Doing Math

On an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Syracuse Guido Menzio an Ivy League economist was reported to the crew for scribbling in his notepad. According to The Washington Post Menzio's seatmate couldn't figure out what he was writing so she reported him to the flight's staff. As a result Menzio was asked to leave the plane for questioning where it was discovered that he was an economist and that his ""scribblings"" were just advanced math equations.

Showing Too Much Skin

All the major U.S. airlines have a policy around passenger dress — specifically against clothing that is ""lewd obscene or offensive"" according to United. As a result there have been instances of people being kicked off the plane for wearing clothing deemed to be inappropriate. In 2016 a JetBlue passenger was removed from the plane for wearing short shorts and in 2017 a controversy broke out between a woman who claimed she was booted off a Spirit Airlines flight for showing too much cleavage while the airline said it was because she was intoxicated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJsaW5lcy8yMDIxLzAyLzE0L2FtZXJpY2FuLXNvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1jYW5jZWwtaHVuZHJlZHMtb2YtZmxpZ2h0cy1hdC1kZnctYWlycG9ydC1sb3ZlLWZpZWxkLWFzLXNub3ctaWNlLWRlc2NlbmQv0gGsAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2FpcmxpbmVzLzIwMjEvMDIvMTQvYW1lcmljYW4tc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLWNhbmNlbC1odW5kcmVkcy1vZi1mbGlnaHRzLWF0LWRmdy1haXJwb3J0LWxvdmUtZmllbGQtYXMtc25vdy1pY2UtZGVzY2VuZC8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Southwest Airlines cancel hundreds of flights at DFW Airport Love Field as snow ice hit,"American and Southwest Airlines canceled more than 500 flights Sunday at DFW International Airport and Dallas Love Field and are anticipating that most flights Monday will be scrapped as severe weather continues to sweep through North Texas.

Southwest canceled all but 10 flights Sunday in and out of Dallas carrier spokeswoman Brandy King said. All that remained were eight departures and two arrivals. Southwest’s other major airports such as Houston Hobby Oklahoma City and Austin also were running on skeleton schedules.

The airline usually operates about 200 flights a day out of Love Field.

The airport also lowered temperatures in the terminals and surrounding buildings at the request of natural-gas supplier Atmos Energy to help preserve the supply of heating fuel in the region.

If you already subscribe thank you. If not please do so today using the blue ""Subscribe"" button in the top right corner of this page.

Update: Texas electric grid operators have launched rotating blackouts across the state after power demand reached an all-time high early Monday morning.

Rotating blackouts are ""controlled temporary interruptions of electric service"" enacted as a last resort in an effort to conserve power and meet statewide demand. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas warned that some traffic lights and other infrastructure may be without power during this time.

According to a tweet from the organization which manages the statewide flow of electric power Texas set a new record power demand of 69150 megawatts late Sunday. The record is more than 3200 megawatts higher than the previous record set in 2018.

(One megawatt can power about 200 homes during periods of peak demand.)

Earlier: Texas electric grid operators are eyeing emergency response measures as increasingly colder temps force residents to place a greater demand on the state's electricity grid.

The most extreme measure the Electric Reliability Council of Texas could take is calling for rotating blackouts across the state wherein local electric providers would be asked to shave down energy usage by certain amounts.

""Although rotating outages could be required as early as Sunday night they become more likely Monday and Tuesday"" said Dan Woodfin senior director of system operations for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.

Winter storm safety:Prepare for power outages with this checklist

Rotating blackouts would be employed after the grid exhausts all other measures. Grid operators monitor the system's operating reserves or how much electric generation exceeds demand. As that margin grows narrower grid operators enact three emergency response stages before turning to rotating blackouts as a last resort.

Level 1 of the Energy Emergency Alert protocol is enacted when operating reserves are reduced to 2300 megawatts. At that stage the grid can trigger an emergency response service that allows it to tap a portion of its 1100 megawatt emergency reserve.

Level 2 of the Energy Emergency Alert protocol is enacted when the system's operating reserves drop below 1750 megawatts at which point it can deploy the remainder of its emergency reserve.

The final level of the emergency alert protocol is reached when the grid's operating reserve is reduced to 1000 megawatts. If grid operators foresee those levels dropping below the 1000 megawatt threshold for longer than 30 minutes then they ask the state's transmission owners and utilities to reduce electrical output by a certain amount.

As of Sunday afternoon the system's operating reserve levels were at around 4200 megawatts.

""The real intent of doing these rotating outages is to preserve the reliability of the system as a whole so we kind of have to respond to whatever happens on the system"" Woodfin said.

Each energy distributor can use its own discretion for how it reduces its load. Often Woodfin said this will cause utilities to cut power from certain neighborhoods for 15 to 30 minutes on a rotating basis.

""ERCOT determines how much is necessary to reduce the demand on the system and then we tell the entities that own the transmission and distribution wires that they need to reduce the overall demand on the system by say 1000 megawatts"" he said.

To avoid that measure grid operators will continue to ask residents to reduce their individual energy usage. Recommended measures include:

Reducing heaters to 68 degrees

Closing shades or blinds to better insulate windows

Turning off or unplugging nonessential appliances

Avoiding the use of large appliances

Minimizing the use of electric lights.

Large electricity consumers are asked to consider closing operations or shutting down non-essential functions.

Loud powerful visceral: What happens to the V8 engine in an electric car world?

They're loud powerful and as American as apple pie.

And they could soon become extinct.

The fabled V8 engine that powers American muscle cars and European exotics has been slowly losing its standing with carmakers and motorists. Smaller more fuel-efficient four- and six-cylinder engines have overtaken the V8 as CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards tighten.

The V8 got a crushing blow last month when General Motors the industry behemoth behind the Corvette Camaro and Silverado truck announced that 40% of the company’s U.S. models will be battery electric vehicles (BEV) by the end of 2025. That's not all: GM said it plans to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035.

The all-new 6.2-liter V8 in GMC's 2021 Yukon lineup is the most powerful engine in the full-size SUV segment. GMC

Automotive insiders were already bracing for a possible all-electric 'Vette. Then Ford GM's domestic rival and maker of the popular F-150 pickup truck and Mustang sports car accelerated its shift to electrification more than doubling its investment in electric vehicles to $22 billion.

Ford's legendary V8 engine is available in the 2021 F-150 truck. Ford

Elon Musk made EVs cool with his Teslas. They're also the majority of EVs sold in the U.S. a tiny (2%) but rapidly growing segment of the automotive market. Mainstream and luxury automakers including Ferrari the apex of the sports car orbit with its throaty V12 and V8 engines are gearing up for a world where internal combustion engines and petroleum are obsolete and passé.

""Electric cars are an inevitability"" Eric Minoff a specialist in the Motoring Department at Bonhams auction house told ABC News. ""So many governments are mandating [electrification]. It's foolish to continue holding on to gas technology.""

It will take serious commitment from automakers to reach these lofty EV goals he noted adding that V8s still play an important role with consumers. And V8s could become even more desirable as fewer roll off the production line in the coming years.

""It's simple supply and demand"" he said.

V8s commonly found in large pickup trucks high-end SUVs and low-volume sports cars are not entirely equal; enthusiasts and collectors have to seek out the performance-focused models Minoff advised.

""The top-of-the-line engine model is always worth more"" he said. ""Whatever is the biggest most powerful engine -- that's always what people want.""

The Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 boasts 760 horses from its supercharged 5.2-liter V8 engine. Morgan Korn

Stephanie Brinley an analyst at IHS Markit also sees V8s emerging as a hot commodity in collector circles. Electric motors deliver unparalleled acceleration and torque. Good old-fashioned V8s however still have a leg up on their silent peers.

""There's a very visceral connection to a high-powered V8 that you don't have in the same way with an EV"" she told ABC News. ""EVs have fake sounds and don't have the same vibrations as a V8 engine. Lots of people grew up with noise under the hood.""

V8-powered vehicles accounted for 15.3% of U.S. vehicle registrations (excluding EVs) in 2020 up from 14.5% in 2019 Brinley noted. Nearly 72% of V8 vehicle registrations were full-size pickup trucks. Half of Ford Mustang Dodge Charger and Chevrolet Camaro owners who registered vehicles last year chose the more expensive and powerful V8 engines according to the data.

A supercharged 6.2-liter V8 engine in the Camaro ZL1 lays down incredible performance figures. Chevrolet

""For Ford and GM to pivot to an all-electric future building credibility with an EV pickup is crucial"" Brinley said. ""The challenge for automakers is to [build] EVs that create a similar emotional and aspirational reaction.""

Dodge's burly large V8 engines have helped lift sales at the struggling marque and attract buyers who demand insane horsepower and thrilling speeds. Its 2021 Durango SRT Hellcat SUV ""the most powerful SUV ever"" can easily whip the competition: A supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi Hellcat V8 engine delivers 710 horses and 645 lb.-ft. of torque. Loyalists were stunned when Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis declared last month that V8s no longer have a place in the ""Golden Age of muscle cars.""

""The days of an iron block supercharged 6.2-liter V8 are numbered"" Kuniskis told CNBC on Jan. 26. ""They’re absolutely numbered because of all the compliance costs. But the performance that those vehicles generate is not numbered.""

Big powerful and rumbly V8 engines are a hallmark of Dodge Chargers. Dodge

Plenty of automakers continue to crank out vehicles with thundering V8s extending their expiration date. BMW recently revealed its 2022 M5 CS the quickest and most powerful production BMW car ever built. A 4.4-liter M TwinPower turbo V8 engine propels the sporty sedan from 0 to 60 mph in 2.9 seconds.

The 4.4-liter M TwinPower turbo V8 engine in the 2022 BMW M5 CS has been tuned to deliver 627 hp at 6000 rpm. BMW

GM's Cadillac division answered enthusiasts' pleas with its CT5-V Blackwing a 668-hp track star with a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 that can reach speeds above 200 mph (it also comes with a six-speed manual transmission).

The Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing with its 6.2-liter supercharged V8 will be the fastest and most powerful Cadillac ever. Cadillac

V8s are offered in five Lexus models -- the LX GX RC F LC 500 and LC 500 convertible -- and in Toyota's Tundra pickup truck Sequoia and Land Cruiser SUVs.

""Every model with a V8 had stronger sales in December 2020 than it did in December 2019"" according to Lisa Materazzo group vice president of Toyota Marketing.

The Lexus LC 500's powerful 5.0-liter naturally aspirated V8 engine makes 471 hp. Lexus

Like its rivals Toyota has accepted a reality of zero-emissions vehicles. The Japanese company will debut three new electrified models -- two BEVs and a plug-in hybrid -- in the U.S. later this year.

Randy Nonnenberg president and co-founder of Bring a Trailer said 1960s and 70s muscle cars with V8s are trending on the online auction platform.

""Collectors are nostalgic for older V8s"" he told ABC News. ""They represent muscle and horsepower. Motorsports and drag racing are highly identifiable with V8s.""

Jonathan Klinger a vice president at collectible car insurer Hagerty told ABC News the ""love affair"" with American muscle cars and V8s won't end when EVs rule the roads.

""The V8 engine absolutely has its place in the automotive space and will continue to"" he asserted. ""The traditional V8 engine -- and even an ICE engine -- are going to remain desirable to a group of enthusiasts. It's hard to replicate the muscular deeper engine note in a V8.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMTQvYmlsbC1nYXRlcy1jb25jZXB0cy10by11bmRlcnN0YW5kLXRoZS1jbGltYXRlLWNyaXNpcy5odG1s0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjEvMDIvMTQvYmlsbC1nYXRlcy1jb25jZXB0cy10by11bmRlcnN0YW5kLXRoZS1jbGltYXRlLWNyaXNpcy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bill Gates: These 5 concepts will help you understand the urgency of the climate crisis,"Scientists politicians youth activists and business leaders are talking about the dire consequences of climate change. But for the average person sitting on their couch it can be hard to understand what is so urgent and why it matters to their life. In his new book ""How to Avoid a Climate Disaster"" billionaire Bill Gates shares five basic concepts that have helped to frame his understanding of the pending climate crisis. Gates says they can also help others grasp what's happening to the Earth. ""When I started learning about climate change I kept encountering facts that were hard to get my head around"" Gates writes in the book which comes out Tuesday. ""For one thing the numbers were so large they were hard to picture....Another problem was that the data I was seeing often appeared devoid of any context."" Gates began to develop ""a mental framework"" organized around five concepts. ""These are complex subjects that can be confusing"" Gates writes. ""This framework will help you cut through the clutter."" Here are the buckets of information Gates says can help you get your head around the importance of mitigating climate change.

51 billion tons of greenhouse gasses are added to the atmosphere each year

Though emissions for 2020 were a bit less than usual due to the coronavirus pandemic slowing travel and economic output in a typical year the world adds 51 billion tons of greenhouse houses (GHG) to the atmosphere according to the book. To help put that into perspective each of those 51 gigatons (a gigaton is 1 billion tons) equals 2.2 trillion pounds. That is equivalent to 10000 fully-loaded U.S. aircraft carriers according to NASA (multiplied 51 times). Gates writes that when considers any green technology or policy he assesses its impact based on what percentage of 51 billion tons of GHG it can remove from the atmosphere. ""At Breakthrough Energy we fund only technologies that could remove at least 500 million tons a year if they are successful and fully implemented"" Gates writes referring to the energy innovation investment fund in which he has money along with other like Jeff Bezos. ""That's roughly one percent of global emissions.""

Making things like cement and steel is more of a culprit than cars or jets

Often transportation and electricity get the lion's share of attention when it comes to addressing climate change. For instance electric vehicles are super buzzy thanks to people like Elon Musk and his company Tesla. And while they are important there is more to the story. Any comprehensive climate change strategy has to consider other sources of GHG so Gates provides a breakdown of various categories and the percentage of total global greenhouse gas emissions each is responsible for: Making things like cement steel and plastic: 31%

Electricity: 27%

Growing things including plants and animals: 19%

Transportation including planes trucks and cargo ships: 16%

Temperature regulation meaning heating cooling and refrigeration: 7%

It takes 5000 gigawatts it takes to power the world

Gigawatts are an energy measurement: ""If you were measuring the flow of water out of your kitchen faucet you might count how many cups came out per second"" Gates writes. ""Measuring power is similar only your measuring the flow of energy instead of water. Watts are equivalent to 'cups per second'"" he explains. Gates shares key back-of-the-napkin measurements to help give context to how much energy it takes to power various things. (One billion watts equal one gigawatt; 1 million watts equals a megawatt; and 1000 watts equals a kilowatt.) The world: 5000 gigawatts

The United States: 1000 gigawatts

Mid-size city: 1 gigawatt

Small town: 1 megawatt

Average American household: 1 kilowatt

Some power sources take up more space

""Some power sources take up more room than others. This matters for the obvious reason that there is only so much land and water to go around"" Gates writes. ""Space is by far from the only consideration of course but it's an important one that we should be talking about more often than we do."" To measure how much space will be taken up to generate a given amount of power scientists use a metric called power density which is measured in watts per square meter. It's important to consider the watts per square meter when discussing the viability of a particular energy solution for a particular location or situation. ""If you want to use wind instead of solar you'll need far more land all other things being equal"" Gates writes. ""That doesn't mean that wind is bad and solar is good. It just means that they have different requirements that should be part of the conversation."" Here are the watts per square meter for some of the most commonly discussed power sources: Fossil fuel: 500 to 10000 watts per square meter

Nuclear: 500 to 1000 watts per square meter

Solar: 5 to 20 watts per square meter (Gates says it's theoretically possible for this to get as high as 100.)

Hydropower such as dams: 5 to 50 watts per square meter

Wind: 1 to 2 watts per square meter

Wood and other biomass: Less than 1 watt per square meter

It all comes back to money"

Several federal agencies are probing American Express' small business and consumer card sales practices according to a regulatory filing.

Amex received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York related to its small business cards sales practices the company disclosed in Friday's filing. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is also seeking information related to Amex' consumer sales practices.

""We are cooperating with all of these inquiries and have continued to enhance our controls related to our sales practices. We do not believe this matter will have a material adverse impact on our business or results of operations"" the company said in the filing.

In January the Wall Street Journal reported that federal investigators including the Treasury Department the FDIC and the Federal Reserve were investigating AmEx card sales. Those agencies were looking into whether Amex used ""aggressive and misleading sales tactics to sell cards to business owners and whether customers were harmed"" the Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter.

Amex is also cooperating in a probe led by the OCC and the DOJ regarding sales practices for small business cards in 2015 and 2016.

After an internal review of sales during that period Amex has taken ""appropriate disciplinary and remedial actions including voluntarily providing remediation to certain current and former customers"" the company said in the filing.

Current and former Amex employees previously told the Wall Street Journal that some salespeople ""strong-armed or misled small-business owners"" and misrepresented rewards and fees to boost sales.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlYWNvbmpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvMDIvMTQvYWtyb25zLTd0aC1mbG9vci1jbG90aGluZy1jb250aW51ZXMtaW5ub3ZhdGUvNDQ0OTMzMzAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Akron's 7th Floor Clothing continues to innovate,"Preston Clark and Frank Miller III have been friends since they were kids.

As adults they also are business partners including doing tax preparation.

But they are better known as the owners of 7th Floor Clothing an Akron fashion business that makes T-shirts hats hoodies a brand-new line of eyewear and more. It's gotten them exposure on eBay and in New York City with American Express. The duo also have been the subject of articles in national publications including The New York Times and Forbes.

They started with a gamble to quickly design and sell T-shirts while LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers played in the 2016 NBA finals the year the Cavs won the national championship.

Miller 38 has a background in sales while Clark 41 has a background that includes design work and graphics. Both are Firestone High School graduates.

""He [Miller] called me and said he would like for me to do a championship T-shirt design"" Clark said. ""He said 'There's a catch.' I said 'What's the catch?' He was like 'I can't afford to pay you.' ""

""I was sitting right here in my chair twirling it around"" Clark said laughing.

""""I was thinking in the back of my mind all the bills I had to pay"" Clark recalled. ""The good thing is I've known Frank since were were kids. We've known each other since he was 7 and I was 10. ... I told him I would sleep on it but in the back of my mind I'm like I don't have anything to lose I'm going to put it together. I designed it.""

The next day Clark showed Miller the T-shirt design and got a big thumbs-up.

""That's how we got started"" Clark said. ""It was right before Game 6 of the finals. We didn't have a clue who would win. We had faith in our hometown hero LeBron. We put all our eggs in one basket.""

They printed 100 shirts and headed out to LeBron's James high school alma mater St. Vincent-St. Mary High School to watch Game 7 on a jumbo TV screen in the LeBron James Arena.

""Going into this it was fun. It really wasn't a cash grab"" Clark said. ""We genuinely had fun creating the shirt and we had fun selling it.""

The Cavs won the championship and the celebrations began.

""Once people saw those shirts they just started buying them like crazy"" Clark said.

An ESPN reporter at the school asked Clark how they got the T-shirts so fast.

""I'm behind him selling T-shirts"" Miller said. ""It was a great time.""

Miller said he brought the 100 T-shirts from a mentor he declined to name.

They sold out at the school and printed another 100 shirts that night.

""We took those to Cleveland. We were on the streets selling those hand to hand "" Miller said. ""That was a great night.""

At that time they didn't have a website for the fledgling business. That has since changed.

""After the T-shirt kind of fizzled out we were like what's next?"" Miller recalled.

Clark quickly came up with the idea of a ""dad hat"" showing a frog kissing a trophy playing off a popular meme at the time.

""We produced 50 hats"" Clark said.

They called LeBron James' best friend who came to the office took a picture of the hat and showed it to the NBA superstar. James liked the hat and Miller and Clark sent him one. Still hat sales didn't take off.

""The hats weren't selling"" Clark said.

""At that point in time we were pretty strapped for cash"" Miller said.

About a month later they were eating lunch at a Whole Foods and got a text from a friend. It showed LeBron James' Instagram account with photos of the player wearing the 7th Floor dad hat. They thought at first the photos were fake and then quickly realized the Instagram posts were real – and an opportunity.

""We got so excited that we didn't finish our food"" Clark said. ""We walked out.""

They went to James' Instagram posts to direct people to their new 7th Floor Clothing website.

""We might have had a thousand orders that first day"" Clark said.

""That PayPal kept pinging"" Miller said.

They scrambled to get hats in production Clark said. They may have had only 30 hats in stock at the time.

Running 7th Floor Clothing has been a learning process the two said. They have learned lessons involving pricing e-commerce and customer service among other things.

""Free shipping is not free shipping"" Miller said meaning it is costly to the business providing the shipping. ""We were cutting our teeth and getting our name in the industry. That was our launch pad. That led to the next big thing that happened to us.""

The next big thing was the ""Stay Home 23"" clothing line they put together in partnership with a store at Summit Mall to try to persuade James to stay with the Cavaliers. The clothing line while failing to persuade James to stay in Cleveland got national attention.

A New York Times reporter called Miller.

""I hung up on the guy man"" Miller said laughing again. ""I thought it was a joke. Then he calls back.""

The New York Times did its story which created more buzz for the two men.

Akron Mayor Dan Horrigan's office called and invited them to take part in a new e-commerce small business program with eBay. The Retail Revival program was designed to help their business and others in the Akron area learn how to sell their products online.

Clark came up with the idea of showing up at the kickoff meeting wearing shirts in eBay's corporate colors.

""Me and [Miller] sat in the very front row"" Clark said. EBay employees at the meeting took note and sent photos of the two wearing the shirts back to corporate headquarters.

""We embraced the eBay culture"" Miller said. That led to them being invited to eBay's headquarters where they said there treated like royalty and took part in a pop-up shop there to sell their made-in-Akron products.

""They helped get our brand out to the world"" Miller said. ""eBay took real good care of us.""

They spoke at an eBay conference in Las Vegas. They have traveled with Mayor Horrigan to events. Last year the mayor had the two introduce him at the annual State of the City address. 7th Floor Clothing also has printed T-shirts for the mayor's re-election campaign.

American Express spent months taping them for a docuseries ""Saving Main.""

""We just told them our story"" Clark said. American Express also took them to New York City to do a futuristic pop-up shop in the city's SoHo district in lower Manhattan.

Clark and Miller said they have been greatly helped by a University of Akron marketing class in 2019 where students spent a semester studying 7th Floor Clothing and proposed ways they could improve their brand.

""That was an amazing class"" Clark said.

In the meantime they continue to create and produce. They have been making masks for people to wear during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.

And now they have a new eyewear line that recently launched. Other new designs will be coming out as well. Their products will be sold in the NoTique retail store when it reopens in March at 772 N. Main St. in Akron's North Hill neighborhood.

They remain in demand as speakers at events and in classrooms.

""We always like to talk to the youths. It's all about paying it forward"" Clark said. They have created 7th Floor Academy to provide business lessons and expect the academy lessons swill be available in the near future for people to watch on YouTube.

The academy is being planned to help people avoid the kind of ""bumps"" Miller and Clark experienced as they created their business.

The business name doesn't come from their office location which is on the 4th floor of the Saalfield Building in Akron. (Their clothes hats and other products are also made in another section of the building.)

The name 7th Floor comes from seven being a holy number Miller said.

""It's really saying God is our foundation"" he said.

They start each workday with a prayer.

""We say God is the CEO of our company"" Clark said.

Whether it was the mask or the deserted departure hall I felt like I was living in a whole different world. Since then I've been adjusting my flight routine to adapt to the new reality.

Whether it's doubling down on previous practices or starting new ones here's a look at how I've modified my flight routine due to the pandemic.

Overhauled booking pattern

Before the pandemic I booked travel anywhere from 330 days before the trip to hours before departure using both a mix of cash and points. Nowadays I'm no longer comfortable purchasing nonrefundable airfare well ahead of the trip.

With ever-changing travel restrictions I'm using miles for flights that I'm not 100% committed to taking. With free redeposits there's little downside to booking speculative awards. (Though most major U.S. airlines have permanently dropped change fees for paid tickets you'll only receive a future travel credit should you voluntarily cancel a nonrefundable reservation.)

For flights booked within a week or two of departure I'll still use cash or travel credits received from other canceled trips.

Another benefit to booking flights closer to departure is the ability to predict the odds of scoring an empty middle seat.

Driving instead of ride-sharing

Although data shows that flying is safe I'm doing all that I can to minimize my person-to-person interactions throughout the travel journey including how I get to and from the airport.

To that end I've now parked a car at the airport for my three most recent trips instead of taking a taxi or rideshare. The same is true at my destination — I've rented a car for every domestic mid-pandemic trip I've taken thus far.

Using the CLEAR security lanes

In 2019 I was using CLEAR to avoid a crowded TSA PreCheck security line. In 2021 I'm using it to avoid lowering my mask during the travel experience.

With CLEAR's facial recognition software you can enjoy a fully touchless security identification process using just an iris scan. You'll then avoid interacting with a TSA agent who would otherwise ask you to take off your mask to match your face to the picture on your photo I.D.

Skipping the lounge

I've long been a proponent of skipping the airport lounge before the run-of-the-mill domestic flight. That's especially true these days as I'm trying to avoid indoor dining in crowded spaces.

I've stopped into a few lounges here and there during recent travels but most of the top-notch amenities (like spas and stretching rooms) that differentiate the best outposts are closed due to the pandemic.

In many cases even if wanted to spend time in the lounge many are still closed. Except for the largest hubs most lounges remain shuttered including American's Flagship Lounges and United's Polaris Lounges.

Being the last to board for a new reason

Another new habit I'm developing is being one of the last on board. This way I'll avoid overcrowding in the poorly ventilated jetway.

But even more importantly this is a key step to snagging an empty middle seat. By being one of the last on board I can monitor the real-time seat map to see which were assigned to standby travelers. I can then ask the gate agent to reassign my seat if necessary before boarding.

Once on the plane it's significantly harder to play musical chairs especially during the chaotic boarding process.

Strategically choosing seats

In addition to strategizing for an empty middle seat I'm also now choosing flights based on seat availability especially for those with unique spacious configurations.

For instance take a look at JetBlue's new Airbus A321neo. Seat 25A is one of the best on the plane. The window doesn't have a seat in front of it and it's about as distanced as you'll get from others.

On longer transcon routes I'm looking for flights operated by spacious twin-aisle jets in the hopes of scoring one of the private business-class pods.

Limiting in-flight eating or drinking

The inflight experience of 2021 doesn't look anything like 2019 (unless of course you're flying in the recently refreshed JetBlue Mint cabin).

Across the board airlines have cut most inflight food offerings. Some continue to offer a snack pack but don't expect more than a bottle of water or a can of soda and a one-ounce bag of pretzels on your next flight.

As such I've stopped eating or drinking on most short domestic flights. If I'm adequately distanced from others in a business- or first-class seat I'll consider taking a quick bite. But with the limited inflight offerings there's less of a reason to eat in the air.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZ29sZndlZWsudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMTQvcGdhLXRvdXItcGViYmxlLWJlYWNoLXdlYWstZmllbGQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here are four reasons the PGA Tour should be worried about Pebble Beach's weak field,"Pebble Beach Golf Links is a national treasure for most golfers kind of like Augusta National for the rest of us. We’ll never get a chance to play at the home of the Masters but with the right determination and the right bank account most golfers in the country would love to play Pebble Beach.

Which is why it is so interesting that so few of the top players on the PGA Tour are playing at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am this week.

But the lack of a strong field at one of the fabled courses and fabled tournaments on the PGA Tour this week points to the trouble the Tour has in protecting some of its events while pushing for a more global game anchored by marquee events.

Consider that the Pebble Beach tournament will award 30 world ranking points to its winner today based on strength of field. Last week the Waste Management Phoenix Open awarded 58 points to winner Brooks Koepka and the Saudi International event on the European Tour awarded 54 points to winner Dustin Johnson.

That puts the Pebble Beach event this week in the same basic category as alternate events played against majors or World Golf Championships.

Why such a weak field?

The problems that Pebble Beach is facing this week are certainly familiar to the Palm Springs area’s Tour event The American Express. And while the American Express had a much better field this year than in recent years – Si Woo Kim won 46 world ranking points with his victory last month – the issues likely aren’t going away anytime soon.

Overseas tournaments: The American Express has been opposite the European Tour’s Abu Dhabi event for years which is now part of that tour’s elevated Rolex Series. Many top Europeans and even Americans head to Abu Dhabi to play with appearance money secured. This year Pebble Beach is a week after the Saudi International another European Tour event with plenty of appearance money to spread around. Flying literally halfway around the world from a Middle East event to the West Coast for a PGA Tour event is not easy for a player and Johnson withdrew from the AT&T event just a few days after winning in Saudi Arabia. Johnson is a two-time winner of the AT&T event.

The pro-ams: The AT&T and the American Express are the last events on the PGA Tour to have amateurs playing side by side with the professionals in rounds of golf that count for the tournament title. One theory on why the American Express field was stronger last month than in recent years was that the pro-am wasn’t played and pros felt more comfortable playing without the amateurs. Pebble Beach’s pro-am that is played over three courses often has led to six-hour rounds of golf but with no amateurs playing this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic you might have expected a stronger field. It didn’t happen for the tournament. If the ams return next year there’s no reason to think the field will get stronger.

Weather: The American Express rarely is concerned about the weather at its event which is the opposite of the Pebble Beach tournament. It is often cold and rainy on the Monterey Peninsula for the AT&T tournament with soft greens that can be a major problem for players. It rained in the Pebble Beach area this week.

The schedule: The tournaments following the Pebble Beach event this year are the Genesis Open hosted by Tiger Woods in Los Angeles with a $9.3 million purse a World Golf Championship event originally planned for Mexico but now being played in Florida the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Orlando and the Players Championship. That’s four events many top players either want to or need to play. So Pebble Beach would have been five events in a row and most pros never play five weeks in a row. The American Express might have benefitted from scheduling this year with many players either starting their year at the La Quinta tournament or playing one or two events in Hawaii to start the calendar year and then playing the American Express and the Farmers Insurance event in San Diego the following week.

Is there anything the PGA Tour can do to help out their events? The Tour already has players focused on major championships World Golf Championship tournaments and events like the Players and the FedEx Cup playoffs not to mention the Ryder Cup to be played later this year. Regular Tour events can get lost in the shuffle of big events travel and the allure of overseas tournaments.

But tournaments like the American Express and the AT&T Pebble Beach while not majors are the glue that keep the Tour together both for stars and for journeymen players looking to make a living week to week. Seeing the strength of the field at the AT&T event this week and knowing how the American Express still fights for top players to come to the desert guaranteeing a strong field ought to be a focus of the Tour as it reaches for a global tour and more high-profile big-money events.

Such efforts have helped shaped outsiders’ perceptions of a diverse continent that is home to 54 countries and 1.3 billion people. Generations of American children were told to eat their vegetables “because there are starving children in Africa.”

Today a rising African middle class on a continent that is home to nearly two-dozen billionaires is challenging previous assumptions about foreign aid from who donates money to who should get paid to deliver aid to whose metrics ought to be used to determine whether it was a success. A growing group of intellectuals aid workers and civic leaders from Africa say the “white savior” mentality of the world’s foreign aid system can end up doing more harm than good.

They point out that planeloads of free American corn can help famine victims in the short term but they can also put local farmers out of business making the food supply in the long term more precarious. Relief efforts in Sudan may have saved countless lives but they also emboldened combatants who controlled access to food prolonging a brutal war. The international efforts in Somalia to stand in for the government have sometimes harmed attempts by Somalis to create governing structures of their own fostering long-term dependency. The images of starving children used to raise money for famine relief are now decried as “poverty porn” that portrays Africans as helpless victims so that American and European organizations can collect funds.

Degan Ali executive director of Adeso a Nairobi-based organization that works in Somalia and Kenya is among the most outspoken African activists demanding an overhaul of the way foreign aid works. The daughter of a Somali military officer who moved the family to Washington when Ms. Ali was a child she returned to Somalia as an employee of the United Nations but quickly grew disillusioned. She watched her mother an award-winning environmentalist in Somalia struggle to raise funding while big grants went to international organizations led by white Americans and Europeans who made influential decisions far from the places they were trying to assist.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2Fuc3BhLmNvbS92ZW5kb3JzL3RocmVlLXdheS1tZXJnZXItd2lsbC1tYWtlLWJlYWNoYm9keS1jb21wYW55LXB1YmxpY2x5LXRyYWRlZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Three-Way Merger Will Make The Beachbody Company Publicly Traded,"The Beachbody Company Santa Monica California has entered into a three-way merger agreement that will make it a public company The Beachbody Company announced on Feb. 10.

The two merger partners are Forest Road Acquisition Corp. a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company and Myx Fitness Holdings LLC an at-home connected fitness platform featuring a bike and home studio.

The combined company is valued at $2.9 billion and is expected to add more than $420 million of cash to the balance sheet including a committed private investment in public equity of $225 million led by institutional investors that include Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC and Fertitta Capital.

The Beachbody Company will be the parent company of three content and technology-driven businesses: Beachbody On Demand (BOD) Openfit and Myx.

The transaction is expected to close in second quarter 2021. The combined company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under a new ticker symbol BODY.

Beachbody will continue to be led by Carl Daikeler Beachbody’s co-founder chairman and CEO and Jon Congdon co-founder of Beachbody and CEO of Openfit. Forest Road’s strategic advisor Kevin Mayer former CEO of TikTok and the leader behind Disney+ will join the combined company’s board of directors. Beachbody management and shareholders are rolling over 100 percent of their equity stake and will own approximately 84 percent of the pro forma business at close.

Beachbody is looking to capitalize on the increased demand for at-home health and wellness offerings and will further invest to drive accelerated customer acquisition expand internationally and pursue attractive high-return merger and acquisition opportunities according to Beachbody.

Beachbody has brands P90X INSANITY and 21 Day Fix. Through the BOD and Openfit platforms the company has developed a diverse offering of live and on-demand content as well as nutrition solutions that reach more than 2.6 million paid digital subscribers.

With the addition of Myx the company's portfolio will expand to include a connected fitness offering that provides an on- and off-bike offering with workouts that are personalized based on machine learning and heart rate data. Myx sold over 27000 bikes which are priced at $1299 in its first year of operation. Its customer base of users completed an average of 15 workouts each month.

The merger with Myx will help leverage the scale of The Beachbody Company's platform synergies in distribution marketing and content creation for all three of its brands according to the company.

“We have seen incredible digital growth in recent years which was further fueled in 2020 by a structural and lasting shift in how people embrace health and fitness” Daikeler said.

With the merger the company will redefine the at-home fitness experience pairing the integrated hardware science-based heart-rate coaching and personalized smart recommendations behind Myx with Beachbody and Openfit’s content libraries content innovation and vast network he added

“The company's engagement and retention metrics validate the quality and depth of its content library and direct-to-consumer (DTC) technology capabilities” Mayer said.

He sees parallels at Beachbody with the work he did at Disney where the company accelerated its digital transformation and leveraged its content to build Disney+ ESPN+ and Hulu.

“In addition to its significant organic growth potential the scale and differentiation of Beachbody’s platform will allow us to pursue attractive M&A opportunities in this highly fragmented ecosystem which will enable us to increase our market share globally and diversify our product offering” Mayer said.

Tom Staggs former COO & CFO of Disney and Forest Road board member and strategic advisory committee chair said: “We are fortunate to have identified a business poised to benefit from three powerful market trends: digital subscriptions connected fitness and growing consumer demand for health and wellness. These trends give us even more confidence that we have found an extremely attractive investment for our shareholders.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvYWwuY29tL2VuLXVzL25ld3Mvd2hpY2gtZm9vdGJhbGwtdGVhbXMtaGF2ZS1tb3N0LWZhbnMvMXFtZzRqMzQ1N3d2aDFreGtiN3FiZG83cW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which football teams have the most fans?,"From traditional powerhouses to new-age behemoths football clubs all find themselves in competition for the affection of supporters

Football like most sports is just as much about the fans as it is the actual events on the field.

The business of the game has relied heavily on support from the terraces in the form of ticket sales and more recently in the retail market where merchandise such as replica shirts is sold.

Successful clubs are usually the best supported but variables such as geography history and cultural significance come into play so success doesn't necessarily translate to support. It definitely helps though.

So which clubs have the most fans?

Real Madrid and Barcelona were the two most valuable football clubs in the world in 2020 according to Forbes which put their worth at over $4 billion (£2.8bn) each. Manchester United were not far behind at $3.8 billion (£2.7bn) while Bayern Munich Manchester City and Chelsea rounded out the top five.

It's nigh on impossible to get an exact figure on how many fans each club has but looking at things such as shirt sales stadium size and social media followers helps to create a rough picture of popularity.

Before anyone reaches for the rage button we must emphasise the word 'rough'!

With that in mind Goal takes a look at which football clubs have the most fans worldwide by taking into account a variety of factors.

Which football clubs have the most social media followers?

Rank Club Country Followers 1 Real Madrid Spain 252.1 million 2 Barcelona Spain 250.3 million 3 Man Utd England 142 million 4 Juventus Italy 104.1 million 5 Chelsea England 93.4 million 6 Liverpool England 92.7 million 7 PSG France 91 million 8 Bayern Munich Germany 88.7 million 9 Man City England 76 million 10 Arsenal England 75.9 million

Note: Combined total of followers from Facebook Instagram Twitter TikTok and YouTube as of February 2021. Main official accounts only.

Real Madrid and Barcelona are the football clubs with the most followers on social media across all the major channels with no other team coming remotely close to the Clasico rivals.

Manchester United a club which did not have an official Twitter account until April 2012 (three years after Liverpool) are the next most popular club online but they are well behind Real and Barca.

Juventus follow the Red Devils no doubt buoyed by the Cristiano Ronaldo effect with just over 100 million followers.

Chelsea and Liverpool are next with the Blues perhaps surprisingly marginally ahead of the six-time European champions.

Despite their relatively new stature among the traditional powerhouses of world football Paris Saint-Germain's online presence is considerable with just under 100 million followers.

The French giants have social media clout that is comparable to that of Bayern Munich and bigger than that of Arsenal and Manchester City.

Seven-time European Cup-winners AC Milan have to make do with a place outside of the top 10 with just over 40 million combined followers.

Milan's following means that they occupy the same sort of ground as their rivals Inter Premier League side Tottenham and Brazilian giants Flamengo who all have followings in the region of 37-38 million.

Which football clubs have the biggest stadiums?

Rank Club Stadium Capacity 1 Barcelona Camp Nou 99000 2 Kaiser Chiefs Soccer City 94700 3 Club America Estadio Azteca 87500 4 ATK Mohun Bagan Salt Lake Stadium 85000 5 Borussia Dortmund Signal Iduna Park 81300 6 Real Madrid Santiago Bernabeu 81000 7 Universitario Estadio Monumental 80000 8 AC Milan / Inter San Siro 80000 9 Flamengo / Fluminense Maracana 78000 10 Esteghlal / Persepolis Azadi Stadium 78000

As the above table shows it is probably not wise to judge the global popularity of a club based solely on the size of its stadium.

While Barcelona and Real Madrid are in the top 10 in terms of stadium capacity the likes of Manchester United Liverpool Juventus and Bayern Munich are all conspicuous by their absence.

South Africa's Kaiser Chiefs and Mexico's Club America are undoubtedly the biggest clubs in their respective countries but their appeal does not extend beyond their borders in the same way as other clubs.

ATK Mohun Bagan may be able to fit more fans inside Salt Lake Stadium than Man Utd can get into Old Trafford but they are nowhere near as well supported.

Indeed only two of the top 10 most-followed clubs online - Real Madrid and Barcelona - feature on the list of clubs with biggest stadiums.

You can see the top 20 biggest stadiums in the world here.

Which football clubs sell the most jerseys?

The most popular football jerseys vary from country to country so Flamengo shirts may sell well in Brazil or Aston Villa shirts may do well in parts of England but not so well outside of those countries.

There are however a number of clear winners when it comes to shirt sales globally with millions being made each year.

Barcelona Real Madrid Manchester United and Liverpool regularly feature on lists of the highest-selling jerseys as do Arsenal Chelsea Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus.

According to Planet Football Liverpool's home jersey was the best-selling football shirt on Amazon for 2019-20 while the home and away shirts of Man Utd Man City and Arsenal all featured in the top 10.

However when it comes to the United States market alone Real Madrid and Barcelona jerseys are much more desirable than the Premier League clubs with a number of Mexican teams also proving popular.

Which football teams have the most fans?

Real Madrid and Barcelona appear to have the most fans worldwide with Manchester United - once the undisputed biggest sports team in the world - following the Clasico giants as a close third.

Not only do the aforementioned trio top the list when it comes to social media followers they also boast some of the biggest football stadiums in the world and sell the most shirts across nearly all markets.

Their appeal is truly global and that is reflected in their value. Indeed they are the only football clubs in the top 10 of Forbes' most valuable sports teams in the world.

Liverpool Juventus and Bayern Munich are among a cohort of traditional giants who lag behind the top three while new-age behemoths like Chelsea and Manchester City also boast considerable support.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMTMvb3Bpbmlvbi9yYWNlLWVjb25vbXktaW5lcXVhbGl0eS1jaXZpbC1yaWdodHMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | The Way Out of America's Zero-Sum Thinking on Race and Wealth (Published 2021),"Over a two-decade career in the white-collar think tank world I’ve continually wondered: Why can’t we have nice things?

No one can argue that water is one of the most essential elements that nature has to offer. It is even more important than food! Scientists have determined that the human body can survive without solid food for three weeks but can’t go one without water for even 3 days! The body will get dehydrated and even if it somehow manages to stay alive it’ll go in a state of shock and go into a vegetative state. The necessity of water is second only to our need for oxygen. Did you know that the daily required amount of water needed for a human being is 20 to 50 liters of clean safe water? This includes drinking cooking cleaning and other basic everyday activities. Water provides nourishment prevents disease helps in flushing out toxins is necessary for agriculture and food production and last but not least is very important for sanitation.

Sadly clean safe water is still a luxury in many parts of the world. Polluted water doesn’t only pollute the environment around it it also causes a myriad of diseases in its wake. One of the most common diseases caused by polluted water is diseases. So much so that every year around 1.8 million people suffer and die from diarrheal diseases like cholera. It is up to the ones in power to help save people from the lack of safe water. Most of the water issues stem from a weak government and an unstable economy as you’ll find that most of the countries that are plagued by this are either developing or third world countries.

There are a lot of non-governmental organizations who are trying their best to eradicate this problem such as Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP) and Centre for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology. There are also companies dedicated to help the world by working to minimize water pollution. Some of these are: American Water Works Co. (NYSE: AWK) Nalco Water (NYSE: ECL) and Xylem Inc. (NYSE: XYL). Some businesses are doing their part by funding government and non-government projects that are making water and sanitation available to the world but all of this effort is still not enough as the world is still plunging deeper and deeper into a water crisis. One way that safe drinking water is being made available to the world is through water companies. These companies make it their business and goal to extract and provide safe drinking and usable water to its consumers. The industry has grown so much that there are almost as many options as soft drinks for drinking water. Some brands customize their selections by flavors and essence as well as on the basis of the type of water. Some of the most favored types of water aside from still water are spring water sparkling water fizzy water and bubbling water. As the years go by the water industry is becoming more and more competitive.

Gustave Eiffel (1832-1923) was in his fifties. Having already created countless bridges stations churches metallic structures for diverse buildings and even the frame of the Statue of Liberty for his friend Bartholdi he wanted to make a splash. After all the 1889 Exposition Universelle was just around the corner. The event was even more important in that it heralded the hundred-year anniversary of the French Revolution. But what could he contribute?

The idea of gigantic towers was in the collective imagination with the English and the Americans able to think of little else. The Washington Monument had been completed in 1884 standing at a mere 555 feet tall. Designed several years before a project for a 984-foot tower in Philadelphia had never come to fruition. Meanwhile in France plans for a stone column with similar dimensions had also hit a brick wall. One day in June 1884 Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nouguier Eiffel’s two most trusted employees walked into their boss’s office. “You asked us to come up with some monument ideas for the Exposition Universelle? Well we have something to show you” they said. Koechlin flattened a design out on the table. “A pylon?” exclaimed Eiffel. “No! A tower a thousand feet high!” replied Koechlin.

Eiffel was hardly enthusiastic. But instead of rejecting the project he asked Koechlin and Nouguier to make some adjustments. Three months later the pair returned with the same project but had called on architect Stephen Sauvestre to totally redesign it. The tower looked nothing like a bridge column or a pylon the base had been widened and monumental arches connected the four supporting pillars and the first floor. With the revisited plans the tower had adopted a stylish new look. And what better way of celebrating technical progress than by building a metal edifice?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vam91cm5hbG9mbXVzaWMuY29tL2xpc3RpbmcvMTQtMDItMjEvY29tcG9zZXItY29tcG9zZXItdGFsa3Mtam9hbi10b3dlci1jb25vci1icm93btIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Composer-to-Composer Talks: Joan Tower / Conor Brown,"American Composers Orchestra’s Composer to Composer series features major American composers in conversation with each other about their work and leading a creative life. The intergenerational discussions will begin by exploring a single work with one composer interviewing the other. Attendees will gain insight to each work’s genesis sound influence on the American orchestral canon and be invited to ask questions of the artists.

On February 24 Conor Brown talks with Joan Tower about her work Sequoia (1981).

Of the piece Tower writes “I think most composers would have to admit that they live to various degrees in the sound-worlds of other composers both old and new and that what they consciously or unconsciously take from them enables them to discover what they themselves are interested in. Long ago I recognized Beethoven as someone bound to enter my work at some point because for many years I had been intimately involved in both his piano music and chamber music as a pianist. Even though my own music does not sound like Beethoven’s in any obvious way in it there is a basic idea at work which came from him. This is something I call the “balancing” of musical energies. In Sequoia that concept is not only very much present in the score but it actually led to the title (which is meant in an abstract rather than a pictorial sense). What fascinated me about sequoias those giant California redwood trees was the balancing act nature had achieved in giving them such great height.”",,,,,,,,,

Around noon city officials said in an email ""Dominion Energy has identified the cause of the outage affecting Virginia American Water’s Hopewell facility as an issue with one of their transformers and they are currently working to replace the transformer and then reenergize the new transformer.""

There is still no estimated time for the restoration of the city's water according to officials.

At 9 a.m. officials said the city's backup supply in the water towers have just three to four hours of supply left.

As a result city officials issued a mandatory water conservation order for the 9500 customers in Hopewell as well as folks in the New Birchett Estates Cedar Creek Cedar Creek West Strattford Woods and Mullberry Woods subdivisions in Prince George County in an effort to extend the backup supply.

""Please refrain from washing dishes taking showers washing clothes or any other unnecessary water use. This order is in place until further notice"" officials urged.

Officials said workers at the water plant are working to fix the problem as ""quickly and safely as possible.""

""If power is not restored soon the company may issue a boil water advisory to customer as a precautionary measure"" officials warned.

As of 9:45 p.m. more than 460 customers remained without power in Hopewell according to Dominion Energy.

With the power of photosynthesis and help from our mighty microbes our soil is Earth's greatest carbon sink and with proper coaxing can draw down 250 million metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gasses in the US annually reversing the impacts of climate change. Furthermore regenerative agriculture is a path toward climate resiliency and adaptation. As flood drought and other extreme weather patterns become more frequent farmers and ranchers are prepping their land to weather the impacts of climate change. By being better stewards of the land they are able to absorb more water during a flood maintain water security during a drought and prevent wildfires by grazing livestock to control brush.

Economic Benefits

While most of our interviewees were motivated by ecological community and personal values economic benefits of regenerative agriculture were also a major motivator and outcome for many. Due partially to improved soil health our interviewees found that the overall health and yields of their crops improved as a consequence of their regenerative farming techniques. Cost-savings from reduced use of chemicals including fertilizers herbicides and pesticides and antibiotics had a positive impact on farm and ranch profitability.

In our practices blog we wrote that regenerative farmers and ranchers shared some financial values and practices. For many if not most of our interviewees the outcome of their careful financial practices was reduced debt and risk and overall benefits for financial security and bottom line. We don’t want to give the impression that all of our interviewees found it easy to be successful; on the contrary farming is a difficult profession even for regenerative farmers and many of our interviewees shared their struggles to break even. It’s important to note that financial success often came easier when farmers had access to land and resources inherited or granted from family and friends and that is a problem when historic racial and gender inequities contributed to unequal access to wealth and land ownership. Good old-fashioned luck and good fortune of circumstances also had an impact on a farmer’s success. Even so after speaking with so many individuals from many different backgrounds and farm types across the country we think it’s fair to say that regenerative agricultural values and practices have economic benefits.",,,,,,

The US accounted for 67% of these investments coming from companies based in North America - the highest number yet up from 63% in 2019.

“In the context of the Covid-19 global pandemic the FDI sector has shown huge resilience and its performance is remarkable” said Martin Shanahan CEO IDA Ireland.

The results he said “show the continued attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for companies seeking to invest”.

Click here for US Business in Ireland e-paper.

Of the 246 investments 128 or 52% went to regional locations outside of Dublin underlining IDA Ireland’s strategic focus on regional development.

This compares to 250 investments in the same period last year which Shanahan said was “an excellent outcome achieved through a focus on our existing client base and on stronger than anticipated new name performance”.

Employment growth increased by 3.6% which means there are 257394 people working in IDA client companies in Ireland accounting directly for 12.4% of COVID-adjusted national employment.

That speaks to a continued confidence Shanahan said in Ireland’s investment proposition “as a stable and reliable location for global investors evidenced by the 95 new name companies who invested here in 2020”.

Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment. Picture: Keith Arkins

The other 151 investments made here last year were he said: “expansions by established companies demonstrating their considerable commitment to Ireland”. Longevity resilience and commitment he said are the hallmark of multinational companies in Ireland: one-third of which have been here for 20 years or more. Apple recently celebrated 40 years with over 6000 employees and Intel is established 30 years with 4900 employees in Kildare Cork and Shannon Pfizer Analog Devices Boston Scientific Eli Lilly and Merit Medical have all been in Ireland for two decades and others much longer.

The USA Shanahan said has been our primary source market for FDI with many of the leading multinational companies across life sciences technology and financial services choosing Ireland as their preferred location in Europe for their operations.

Many of these companies he said have doubled down on their investments and expanded and transformed and grown their operations here in Ireland.

“We have 847 US-multinational companies employing over 170000 people in Ireland so their contribution has been immense”.

This he said will be important in the years ahead with the advent of new ways of working technological change and the transition to a low-carbon economy.

While job losses were slightly up last year on recent years at 4.5% sectors such as Life Sciences and Technology were much less affected and in a number of cases increased operations in response to demand for Covid-related products mitigating job losses in other sectors. At the end of the year 52% of employees in IDA Ireland client companies remained working from home compared to 28% nationally.

IDA Ireland recently announced a new four-year strategy entitled ‘Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth 2021-2024’. The strategy sets out a target of 800 investments half in regional locations and 50000 new jobs over the next four years. It includes a programme of investment in 19 regional industrial and commercial sites. Shanahan says the strategy will target new industries like autonomous vehicles cell and gene therapy Artificial Intelligence and Big Data. IDA Ireland plans to deliver 19 Advanced Building Solutions (ABS) to regional locations over the course of the strategy in support of further regional investment.

The focus is on attracting the next generation of leading MNCs to locate in Ireland further driving sustainable growth and maximising the impact of FDI in Ireland to 2024 and beyond.

The new four-year strategy was Shanahan said written in the context of continuing uncertainty with the virus and with Brexit and he said IDA Ireland will be reviewing the strategy at its mid-point.

“Towards the end of 2022 we will assess progress and make any adjustments necessary to respond to changes in the global or national environment. While the strategy is directionally correct in its current focus and form we will be as pragmatic and flexible as required in adapting to circumstances as they unfold”.

We are facing he said into difficult times – “competition for global investment is growing and has never been as intense. To compete for and win investments regions must have the strongest possible value proposition. This will require regional and national stakeholders working in collaboration to create the conditions that meet and exceed the needs of international investors”.

Shanahan also noticed a rising challenge from the prospect of growing regional investment thanks to the surge in remote working. While he said this could open up opportunities for investment in Ireland where 58% of FDI and employment is outside of Dublin he added: “that opens up lots of locations that weren’t maybe in play before and they’re all locations that Ireland will have to compete with. We compete on a world stage that’s the reality of it”.

Shanahan said FDI was central to Ireland’s recovery during the last recession and it will he said be crucial again as we rebuild after the pandemic.

Post-Brexit he said Ireland is well-placed to continue to compete for investment.

“We are one of the top locations of choice for international financial services. We believe we have a very strong product offering to companies that may in the past have considered locating in the UK to service Europe.”

Ireland he said has performed strongly in Brexit related investments securing 90 investments with a commitment to 5500 jobs primarily in financial services and many have come from the US such as Bank of America J P Morgan Citi and others.

“Ireland is now the only English-speaking common-law jurisdiction fully integrated into the European legal order. As companies seek Brexit solutions that will impose the lowest possible additional costs and the least possible disruption to trade Ireland offers a base to sustain access to the Single Market to minimise uncertainty and to grow their business. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) together with the Withdrawal Agreement including the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland means that Ireland’s key objectives in the Brexit process have been achieved.""",,,,,,,,,

A Tai Sodje brace either side of half time was not enough for Carlos Vicens side at the AON Training Complex as four goals from Charlie McNeill secured the three points for United in the Under-18 Manchester derby.

The defeat is City’s first in the league since November 2019 after an incredible run that spanned 20 games.

WHAT HAPPENED

Despite City dominating possesion in the early stages it was United who opened the scoring as McNeill headed in from close range 10 minutes in.

The hosts then doubled their lead moments later as Kwandu Oduroh was adjudged to have fouled Noad Emeran in the penalty area.

CITY+ | SIGN UP TO ACCESS EXCLUSIVE CONTENT

McNeill stepped up from 12 yards and saw his penalty well saved by Josh McNamara however the United forward was the first to the rebound to tap in a second.

Vicens’ side looked to react quickly to falling further behind as a mazing solo run from Micah Hamilton saw the winger hit a fierce strike from the edge of the box to draw a good save out of Radek Vitek.

Carlos Borges then capitalised on the rebound but saw his effort tipped onto the post from six yards by the United shot-stopper.

Just five minutes before the break a moment of contreversy saw both City and United score within the space of a minute.

After the Reds kicked the ball out of play due to injury the game was restarted by a City throw-in as Hamilton threw the ball back to Marc Jurado.

However the United right-back let the ball run away from him allowing a confused Sodje to capitalise and tap in from close range.

This confusion was soon rectifted in an act of fair-play from Vicens’ side as we allowed McNeill to take the ball from the restart unchallenged and place it into the net to restore their two-goal advantage.

Into the second half and like the first it was the City youngsters who dominated only this time we were rewarded with a goal.

A superb low ball across the left from Carlos Borges found an unmarked Sodje who tapped in at the back post to get Vicens and his team back into the game.

Just two minutes later the Borges-Sodje link up nearly worked once again for City as a stunning cross into the United box from the winger was headed just wide from the our number-nine.

As the game entered the final moments City’s hunt for an equaliser continued as Sodje Hamilton and Borges all came close from to levelling things up.

In spite of this United and McNeill added a fourth in the final moments to inflict defeat on Vicens and his side.

HOW WE LINED UP

Josh McNamara‘s goal was protected by back four of Kwaku Oduroh Shea Charles Jadel Katongo and Juan Larios.

Harvey Griffiths Josh Adam and Oscar Bobb formed our midfield whilst Carlos Borges and Micah Hamilton played on the left and right wing.

Tai Sodje led the line up-front.

WHAT IT MEANS

The defeat means our Under-18s remain in third nine points behind leaders United with two games in hand.

An eventful match was on the books as Manchester United had a few U16’s come in the bench while Mainoo had his first start for the U18’s. A special encounter for Charlie McNeill as he faced his former team.

United starting XI: Vitek; Jurado Bennett Hardley Hughes; Svidersky Savage; Wellens Mainoo Emeran; McNeill Substitutes: Murray Guadagno Gore Mather Oyedele

The game starts off well for both teams with the game being played at both ends with Manchester City already showing their teeth in the five minutes of the game. Then it was United which started to pressure high up in the pitch via Bennett.

In the seventh minute City had a good chance to go ahead as Charlie Savage calms things down in the United end while Emeran is brought down. The game was all City as the ball travelled past the United defence however no one took advantage of United’s distraction and it ended as a free throw for the Reds.

Before United had their first chance to score it was Vitek keeping the young Reds in the game again. As it has been noted previously in the other games United are indeed so brilliant going forward. A perfectly executed corner from Savage finds McNeill near the post and his brilliant header ends at the back of the net. McNeill kisses the United badge much to City’s annoyance. The former City youngster almost doubles United’s lead as a beautiful pass from Emeran is well past the keeper but McNeill does not make enough contact to score.

City are clearly not happy with the result as they tried to create chances but United’s pressure on the pitch was constant as a beautiful play by Wellens and McNeill finds Emeran who is brought down in the box. McNeill takes the penalty but sees his shot saved however is positioned good enough to smash the rebound in the back of the net. However it seems that City would be making the move soon and they did as Vitek is again brought in attention as he makes a double save. Two minutes later City try again but a Bennett block makes it easier for Vitek to get a good save out of the shot.

In an attempt to get a penalty of their own City players injure Wellens but manages to continue playing. United keep pressuring while City are always there. In the 38th minute Wellens is brought down in the edge of the box with Emeran stepping up to take the free kick but his shot is blocked and Jurado was not able to keep the pressure high up. In what seemed a fair play game by both sides as United gave the ball to City expecting to get it back City play on and score. In the replay as given by the circumstances it is seen that neither Jurado who could have had the chance to block Sodje did not and Vitek on the other hand did not make any move to save the shot.

The referee was adamant to get United’s two goal lead back due to fair play so McNeill roamed free in the pitch and scores his third goal of the game. In the second half City seemed eager to get something from this game as they scored early on. Borges had been a terrible headache for United during the game this time he is capable to make it past Jurado and pass to Sodje who makes no mistake.

The following minutes are problematic for United’s defence as the movement is limited to the United half and the City players were going strong left and right. The young Reds again were unable to go out of their own half. City came close scoring four times as the clock was approaching to the 70th minute but Vitek and luck keep City away from scoring. Another ridiculous decision by the referee as two City youngsters collide in the edge of United’s box and the referee points to a City free kick.

Despite the struggle the United substitutes help United keep City’s dangerous play out of their box while Hughes was once again United’s hero as he put Sodje off as it seemed like that they were almost certain to get their equaliser. As the 90th minute was approaching Charlie McNeill steals the ball from a City defender on the edge of the box and finishes in a brilliant way. This was City’s first defeat since United won against them in November 2019.

Is Apple Next?,"Tesla announced in a public filing Monday that it bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin as part of a corporate policy that allows the electric vehicle (EV) maker to invest in “alternative reserve assets” including not just cryptocurrencies but also gold bullion and gold ETFs.

The company added that it intends to start accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. No word on gold or other precious metals though.

Tesla’s move into Bitcoin makes a perfect kind of sense. CEO Elon Musk briefly the world’s wealthiest person before falling back to number two has long been a fan of the crypto which like his company represents a potential seismic shift in how we conduct our personal finances and power our transportation.

Both Tesla and Bitcoin had a killer 2020. Shares of the carmaker rose 743% making it the year’s best S&P 500 stock. Bitcoin meanwhile increased more than 300% fueled by institutional investor demand. As I write this Tuesday morning its price has blasted past $48000.





Tesla wasn’t the only major crypto news on Monday. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launched its long-awaited futures contracts for Ether the native digital currency of the Ethereum network. The move comes a little more than three years after it unveiled Bitcoin futures. Today the second largest coin after Bitcoin soared past $1800 for the first time ever.





Bitcoin Has Hit the Big Leagues

I believe both headline events—Tesla’s decision to buy Bitcoin and the CME’s decision to offer a new way to trade Ether—help underscore the growing acceptance of digital assets as more than just speculations but currencies and investments as well.

Google searches for “invest in crypto” in fact have recently hit a new all-time high.

For years now skeptics have been comparing Bitcoin’s rise to the tulip bulb mania of 17th-century Holland. A couple of years ago Warren Buffett called the cryptocurrency “rat poison.”

Famed investor Bill Miller a noted Bitcoin proponent countered Buffett’s criticism saying accurately that if Bitcoin is rat poison then cash is the rat.

(Miller later one-upped Buffett again after the Oracle of Omaha dumped airline stocks near the start of the pandemic. The former chief investment officer at Legg Mason said in May that if you don’t own airlines “you’re making a bet against the vaccine.” Six months following Miller’s comment Pfizer and Moderna both announced they had developed effective vaccines against the virus.)

Putting his money where his mouth is Miller this week authorized his flagship fund to begin participating in the world’s largest cryptocurrency. The $2.7 billion Miller Opportunity Trust now has the right to invest in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.

Tesla “Broke the Seal” Apple Now Urged to Bite into Bitcoin

So who will be the next big firm or investor to announce their foray into crypto? I’ve been seeing some chatter in recent days that Apple could be chomping at the bit.

One analyst at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) made such an argument this week. In a piece published Monday analyst Mitch Steves said he believes it would be a no-brainer for the iPhone maker to develop its Apple Wallet into a Coinbase-like “Apple Exchange” giving users a more trustworthy and readily available means to trade cryptos.

Further Apple should consider buying Bitcoin outright—perhaps as much as $5 billion—which would “send even more users to ‘Apple Exchange’” Steves writes.

To elaborate if Apple “purchased $5B of Bitcoin (20-25 days of cash flow) the price of the underlying asset would need to rise by 10% for the firm to fully fund the [hypothetical crypto exchange]in the first place.”

Steves adds: “This is a solid value proposition in our view as the business would be funded without diluting any other projects at the firm (iPhone potential cars etc.).”

A 10% increase in Bitcoin would be a non-event. As many of you know cryptos remain highly volatile. While both the S&P 500 and gold bullion have a 10-day standard deviation of ±3% Bitcoin has one as great as ±16.

HIVE Blockchain Most Liquid Tech Stock in Canada

Besides the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust a favored way to get access to cryptos without owning them outright is through HIVE Blockchain Technologies (TSX.V:HIVE) (OTCQX:HVBTF). HIVE is not only the world’s first publicly traded crypto-mining firm but it’s also the only one currently mining both Bitcoin and Ether.

Because HIVE uses only green renewable energy to mine its coins the stock appeals to ESG investors. ESG stands for Environmental Social and Governance a set of criteria an increasing number of today’s investors use to screen for potential investments.

I’m very pleased with HIVE’s trading volume. In 2020 HIVE traded more than 1.7 billion shares in Canada alone making it the year’s most liquid stock on the TSX Venture Exchange and Canadian Alternative Trading Systems (ATS). And in the U.S. HIVE ranked number four for liquidity on the 2021 OTCQX Best 50 a ranking of top performing companies on the OTCQX Best Market based on 2020 total return and average daily dollar volume growth. HIVE soared close to 2300% during the year.

The secret project has gained momentum in recent months adding multiple former Tesla executives gaining the supervision of Apple’s top artificial intelligence executive and ramping up road tests. The initiative known as Project Titan inside Apple is attracting intense interest because of its potential to upend the automotive industry and supply chains much like the iPhone did to the smartphone market.

If and when Apple commits to building a car it is likely to seek multiple partners -- including a major one to assemble the vehicle and many others to supply key components. The following companies -- whose representatives declined to comment -- are possible candidates:

Foxconn

Foxconn Technology Group already has a close relationship with Apple. For well over a decade it has been the U.S. company’s largest production partner assembling the majority of the world’s iPhones and a big chunk of its Macs and iPads from vast complexes employing upwards of a million people across China.

In October Foxconn whose main listed arm is Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. unveiled its first electric-vehicle chassis and a software platform to help carmakers bring models to market faster. It also plans to release a solid-state battery by 2024.The Taiwanese company founded by billionaire Terry Gou announced a plan in early 2020 to form a joint venture with Fiat Chrysler to develop and make electric vehicles in China though Foxconn won’t be involved in any assembly itself.In January Foxconn signed a manufacturing deal with Chinese EV startup Byton Ltd. with the goal of starting mass production of its M-Byte model by the first quarter of 2022. It also announced another venture with China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. to provide production and consulting services.

Magna

Magna based in Ontario Canada is the third-largest auto supplier in the world by sales and has a contract-manufacturing operation with years of experience making entire car models for a variety of auto brands.

Magna produces everything from chassis and car seats to sensors and software for driver-assistance features. Automakers including BMW AG and Jaguar Land Rover have hired its Magna Steyr unit and outsourced production to its factory in Graz Austria.Magna also pitches its engineering and manufacturing services to EV startups. Last fall it agreed to provide Fisker Inc. with an EV platform for its Ocean SUV and added self-driving features to the deal in January.In December Magna put about $450 million into a joint venture with Korea’s LG Electronics Inc. to make EV powertrains. It’s also expanding its manufacturing footprint in China the largest EV market by building the ArcFox Alpha-T for Beijing Automotive Group Co. -- the first vehicle it’s assembled outside of Europe.It also has the benefit of a prior relationship with Apple: the two were in talks to build Apple’s car when the iPhone maker first set out on this path about five years ago.

Hyundai or Kia

Hyundai and Kia have drawn the most attention so far this year thanks in part to Hyundai initially confirming reports in Korea last month that it was in discussions with Apple. But the carmaker quickly walked that back and recently repeated that it wasn’t in talks.

Hyundai and Kia both have plants in the U.S. in Alabama and Georgia. Their dedicated EV platform will deliver driving range of over 500 kilometers (311 miles) and be capable of recharging car batteries up to 80% in 18 minutes.While the two sell EVs derived from existing models they will start selling vehicles based on the dedicated EV platform from March helping to bring down costs and improve performance efficiency. They plan to introduce a combined 23 new EV models and sell 1 million units globally by 2025.The big disadvantage Hyundai and Kia have is the recent back-and-forth on whether they are developing a car for Apple a notoriously secretive company. Although the two automakers have said talks aren’t happening it’s possible discussions could restart if Apple deems them the best possible partners.

Nissan

Although it’s seen as a long shot Nissan brings several elements to the table that could be beneficial for Apple.

Nissan already has a common EV platform developed with French partner Renault SA which will be used for its Ariya compact SUV debuting later this year. When asked whether the Japanese company would be willing to build cars for Apple CEO Makoto Uchida said during an earnings news conference that Nissan “has the DNA to do things others won’t do.”The automaker has been mired in a slump reporting its biggest loss in two decades in fiscal 2019 and could get much-needed revenue from helping Apple develop or manufacture its vehicle. It also could benefit from access to Apple’s technology.After pursuing a strategy of volume at any cost that ate into profit Nissan needs to attract higher-paying customers largely with the technology inside of its cars.

Stellantis

One factor in determining the suitability of a partner for Apple may be availability of production capacity. This could point to European automakers such as Stellantis NV which has been hit by the region’s sales slump and has spare room in some plants.

Stellantis is under pressure to find synergies after forming last month through the merger of PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler.Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares said during a Jan. 19 press conference that Stellantis is open to working with Apple or any tech company on EVs “as long as it doesn’t create any technology dependence” that would jeopardize the automaker’s future.Chairman John Elkann said in 2016 that the auto industry should work with “new industry participants” like Google and Apple rather than try to compete with them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTAyLTEzL3Utcy1jcmVkaXQtd2Vlay1haGVhZC1hbWVyaWNhbi10aXJlLW1heS10YXAtanVuay1ib25kLW1hcmtldNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Tire May Tap Junk Bond Market: U.S. Credit Week Ahead,"The high-yield market issuance frenzy is expected to keep up next week as investors continue to gobble up risky assets to escape ultra-low interest rates in other products.

For a detailed coverage of this topic and a more comprehensive list please head on over to the 5 biggest acquisitions of all time.

We've seen some giant companies throughout history many of which have actually been broken by the regulators in the country for being monopolies. For example Standard Oil was the biggest company in the world by far at the time but actually had a monopoly on the oil industry which itself is one of the biggest and very lucrative industries in the world. This is why the owner of Standard Oil John D. Rockefeller is still the richest man to have ever existed in modern times. Adjusted for inflation his net worth is said to be around $350 billion to $420 billion which means that the current richest men in the world Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos with the former currently worth over $200 billion have to do a lot more to catch up. Of course the way Tesla and Amazon's value grew significantly in a year which absolutely wrecked the global economy due to the Covid-19 pandemic the sky seems to be the limit and in a few years (or not even that) we could see these two men eclipse the wealth that John D. Rockefeller amassed more than a century ago.

While Tesla and Amazon may have grown significantly and are now counted among the most valuable companies in the world the current most valuable company in the world is Apple with a market cap of more than $2.237 trillion which is more than the GDP of the vast majority of the nations in the world. And while these companies may have mostly grown organically that is not true for most of the companies that are ranked among the biggest in their industry.

15 biggest acquisitions of all time

Companies grow through two ways; organically or through mergers and acquisitions. Growing organically means that the company slowly and steadily increases its sales and its market share which doesn't happen in a day. It takes years and even decades to grown organically and many companies don't take that route. Instead many companies go through the rate of mergers and acquisitions. Now there is a difference between the two but in a sense both require the purchase of shares of a company. Now the reason most companies do this is to gain more dominance within the industry and the most popular reason for mergers and acquisitions is synergies. Synergy is a term used to describe that the sum of the parts is worth more than the individual parts. By combining the resources of two or more companies the expectation is that it will bring more benefits to the company than just the additional sales or market share. However as many examples throughout history have proven the idea of synergies is easier to imagine than to translate it into reality. In fact according to a report by Harvard Business Review most mergers and acquisitions fail with the failure rate being between 70% to 90%.

Story continues

One of the reasons behind these failures is the fact that there are a lot of clashes between the two companies being merged. Often the companies have different corporate views different goals different cultures and different ways of working and integrating two companies under a single banner is easier said than done. Despite this when its successful it can often be worth it which is why companies often spend tens of billions if not hundreds of billions of dollars on such deals. Below we have a list of such companies ranked according to the value of the deal adjusted for inflation. So without further ado let's take a look at the biggest deals ever made in history starting with number 15:

Decoding Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (AJG): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Robust Brokerage Segment: AJG's brokerage segment is a cornerstone of its financial stability consistently generating the majority of the company's revenue. This strength is underpinned by a diverse client base ranging from middle-market entities to individuals and a wide array of insurance products. The segment's success is driven by AJG's ability to negotiate favorable terms with insurance companies reflecting its strong market position and negotiation leverage.

Strategic Acquisitions: AJG has a proven track record of successful acquisitions such as Willis Re Buck and Cadence Insurance which have expanded its service offerings and geographic footprint. These strategic moves not only enhance AJG's revenue streams but also provide cross-selling opportunities and access to new markets contributing to the company's growth and competitive advantage.

Financial Performance: The company's financial health is solid with the latest 10-Q filing indicating a healthy balance sheet. AJG's revenue and net income figures underscore its financial resilience and operational efficiency which are critical in maintaining investor confidence and supporting strategic initiatives.

Weaknesses

Integration Risks: While AJG's acquisition strategy is a strength it also poses integration risks. The assimilation of large acquisitions requires significant resources and management attention and there is always the potential for unforeseen liabilities such as cybersecurity issues or compliance violations. These risks could lead to financial strain and distract from core business operations.

Story continues

Dependence on Economic Conditions: AJG's performance is closely tied to global economic conditions. Factors such as high inflation increased interest rates and geopolitical instability can impact the insurance industry's risk-taking capacity and client demand for AJG's services. Economic downturns could lead to reduced revenues and pressure on profit margins.

Competition and Market Pressures: The insurance brokerage industry is highly competitive with constant pressure from both established players and new entrants. AJG must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its market share which requires ongoing investment in technology and talent retention.

Opportunities

Technological Advancements: AJG has the opportunity to leverage technology data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance client services and internal efficiencies. By investing in technology-based solutions AJG can differentiate itself from competitors and offer value-added services to its clients.

ESG Initiatives: There is a growing emphasis on environmental social and governance (ESG) factors in the corporate world. AJG can capitalize on this trend by integrating ESG considerations into its service offerings and operations potentially attracting clients who prioritize sustainability and responsible business practices.

Emerging Markets: AJG can expand its presence in emerging markets where insurance penetration is typically lower and growth prospects are higher. By establishing a foothold in these regions AJG can diversify its revenue base and tap into new client segments.

Threats

Global Economic Volatility: AJG operates in a global environment that is subject to economic and geopolitical volatility. Events such as recessions political unrest or trade wars can disrupt markets and negatively impact AJG's operations and financial performance.

Regulatory Changes: The insurance industry is heavily regulated and changes in laws or enforcement policies can have significant implications for AJG's business model. Compliance with new regulations can be costly and time-consuming potentially affecting profitability.

Cybersecurity Risks: As a company that relies on data and technology AJG is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. A significant data breach or cyber-attack could damage the company's reputation result in financial losses and lead to legal and regulatory consequences.

In conclusion Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (NYSE:AJG) exhibits a strong market position with a robust brokerage segment and a strategic approach to acquisitions. However the company must navigate integration risks economic dependencies and competitive pressures. Opportunities in technology ESG initiatives and emerging markets present avenues for growth while global economic volatility regulatory changes and cybersecurity risks pose significant threats.

Dans ce contexte la majorité des membres a voté contre l’ordre du jour de la séance contre le bilan d’activité et le quitus moral au président pour l’exercice 2019/2020 mais a approuvé le rapport financier pour la même période.

Devant le rejet du bilan d’activité et du quitus moral il a été demandé la mise au vote de la dissolution complète du conseil d’administration avec la révocation des dirigeants d’administration. Une décision de dissolution qui a été approuvée par les membres.

Des irrégularités pointées

Il a ensuite été soumis au vote l’élection des nouveaux membres du conseil d’administration. En minorité numérique et devant le désaveu une majorité des membres révoqués ne se sont pas représentés.

« Au moment du vote neuf membres candidats et nouveaux élus au conseil d’administration étaient en situation irrégulière certains n’ayant pas d’adhésion au club en 2021 seulement en 2020 et donc inéligibles » a dénoncé Guillaume Bourdoulous.

Revealed on Threads Gunn told fans to ""get ready"" for the July 11 2025 premiere date while fully revealing Corenswet's Superman. The image shows him sitting in what's presumably a Metropolis skyscraper very casually pulling up his boot while an earth shattering event takes places outside.

While this is a fresh new Superman from a fresh new DC Universe the suit itself doesn't appear particularly new as the sacred S symbol and its arms appear dirtied or faded. Though we'd already been shown the logo the new image reveals the rest of the suit and gives fans plenty more to analyze as they try to figure out Gunn's influences ahead of the film's release.

Superman previously Superman: Legacy will be the first film in the rebooted DCU's Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters but it's definitely not an origin story and also features a ton of other DC heroes and villains.

Alongside Corenswet's Superman stands Rachel Brosnahan's Lois Lane and the film also stars Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho María Gabriela as The Engineer and more. Gunn confirmed these actors will play the roles in other DCU projects too.

Chapter 1 of the DCU also features TV shows and while the exact contents have shuffled a tad since Gunn and co-CEO Peter Safran announced it in 2023 an animated series called Creature Commandos will officially kick off the new universe in late 2024.

(1:09)

Open Extended Reactions

CINCINNATI -- Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow marked a major offseason milestone on Monday.

As the team started the second phase of voluntary workouts Burrow was in uniform and throwing a pass in a video shared by the team.

The Bengals were closed to the media on Monday. But quarterbacks coach Brad Kragthorpe told the team's website he was pleased with how Burrow looked in his first practice back since suffering a season-ending wrist surgery last November.

""He looked like the Joe Burrow we're used to seeing"" Kragthorpe said. ""I didn't see any difference. I thought the ball came out of his hand well. Confidently. I'm happy where he's at.""

HE IS SO BACK. pic.twitter.com/ZsZjzkZEmg — Cincinnati Bengals (@Bengals) May 6 2024

On Nov. 27 Dr. Thomas Graham repaired the scapholunate ligament in Burrow's right wrist a source confirmed to ESPN following an initial report by the Cincinnati Enquirer. In March Burrow told ESPN that he expected to be fully cleared following his surgery. He noted that the timetable for his return if he remained on track was no different than other offseasons.

""In a normal offseason I wouldn't be throwing until OTAs really anyway"" Burrow said. ""I can lift basically normal now which I'm excited about.""

Burrow missed the final seven games of last season after he suffered the wrist injury in a Week 11 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. It capped an injury-riddled year that started with a strained right calf that he suffered during the first week of training camp in 2023 and re-aggravated in Week 2.

The Bengals were closed to the media on Monday as they started Phase 2 of their offseason program.

The region’s primary commercial passenger airports are major hubs for the locally based airlines creating a cascade of travel issues that forced the carriers to reroute passengers across the country to avoid Texas.

Operations may not return to some level of normalcy until Tuesday — and ice and snow may wallop Dallas-Fort Worth again later in the week.

Dallas-based Southwest Airlines canceled all but a few flights Sunday out of Love Field the fifth-largest airport in its network. Southwest also canceled all of its flights out of the airport until at least noon Monday.

More than 2600 flights across the United states had been canceled through Monday according to FlightAware an airline tracking service.

On Sunday the Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground delay at DFW with up to three-hour halts on flights that weren’t canceled. Crews worked to clear runways and de-ice planes that were scheduled for takeoffs.

❄️ Our teams are actively working today to keep our runways clear and safe.

If you have scheduled travel please check with your airline to see if your flight has been delayed or canceled. Also please allow additional time in getting to the airport.

Both airlines were trying to reroute customers scheduled to go through North Texas to new destinations to lessen the impact.

Love Field spokesman Chris Perry said it could be Tuesday before airlines resume “bigger operations.”

“With the early cancellations we’re hopeful passengers will confirm their flight with their airline to avoid being stranded” he said. “For those that are stuck we’ll have cots blankets and pillows available in the terminal.”

Southwest canceled all but 10 flights Sunday in and out of Dallas carrier spokeswoman Brandy King said. All that remained were eight departures and two arrivals. Southwest’s other major airports such as Houston Hobby Oklahoma City and Austin also were running on skeleton schedules.

The airline usually operates about 200 flights a day out of Love Field.

The airport also lowered temperatures in the terminals and surrounding buildings at the request of natural-gas supplier Atmos Energy to help preserve the supply of heating fuel in the region.

The massive number of cancellations wasn’t for a lack of trying. Love Field had teams out in “rolling 12-hour periods” to pretreat runways with ice-melting supplies.

❄️ 🚨 Major cancellations across the board as the overnight weather and upcoming weather create dangerous conditions. Confirm your flight's status with your airline prior to coming to the airport and drive with extreme caution if you are coming to DAL. #DALwx — Dallas Love Field (@DallasLoveField) February 14 2021

Southwest pre-emptively canceled most Sunday flights in and out of Love Field to minimize the prospect of passengers on connecting flights getting stuck in Dallas.

American Airlines was still scheduled to operate about half its Sunday flights but called off 645 on Sunday and another 404 on Monday company spokesman Andrew Trull said.

American canceled operations out of many smaller airports in Texas and Oklahoma on Sunday including Amarillo Abilene College Station and Longview.

Most larger airports in the region were running limited operations including San Antonio Houston Austin Oklahoma City and Tulsa.

In 2014 a government institute named INTI announced the LEA “Lector Electrónico Argentino” an Argentine eBook Reader that it was supposed to be made with local electronic components. I’ve kindly let them know that all eInk screens at the time were made in China by eInk Corporation so the announcement didn’t make any sense considering feasibility costs and existing devices. I’ve also told them that the image they were using for the prototype was a Kindle Paperwhite with a photoshoped Argentine cockade. So they did what was honest and fair: recognize the mistake and delete the announcement. I’m just kidding they blocked me in Twitter and made a zoom in the same image to avoid recognition.

INTI LEA announcement

After 7 biblical years - no signs of the Argentine eBook Reader - I’ve got a cheap 2.9 inches eInk screen made by Waveshare Electronics China and I thought let’s see... what can I do with it?

Fusion 360 custom case

2.9 inches/3x7cm could be a small screen for short stories and novels but not so small for… Haikus (short and fascinating Japanese poetry form)

After some research I’ve decided to use GxEPD eInk library

Haiku eReader electronics

I‘ ve made the connections with a small Arduino Pro Micro that I’ve found in a drawer but BMP images didn’t work due to memory restrictions. Then I’ve found one ESP32 Dev Kit and everything worked perfectly.

ESP32 to 2.9 Waveshare eInk connections are: Busy D4 RST D21 DC D22 CS D5 CLK D18 DIN D23.

Then 2 push buttons connected to ESP32 GND and ESP32 D12 and D13.

Finally a 3.7v battery connected to ESP32 VIN/GND and eInk display VIN/GND

If you want to replace the start image you can just create a new 128x296 pixels image with Photoshop export as PNG then use http://javl.github.io/image2cpp/ utility to convert to Arduino Code. Finally just replace myBitmap [] with your own.

The software has the Haikus hardcoded but you can easily add an SD Card Reader and use this code:

#include <SD.h>

File myFile;

void setup()

{

if (!SD.begin(4)) {

Serial.println(""SD init error"");

return;

}

myFile = SD.open(""haikus.txt"");

if (myFile) {

while (myFile.available()) {

Serial.write(myFile.read());

}

myFile.close();

} else {

Serial.println(""File reading error"");

}

}

}

The Hyundai Tiger concept is a “transforming intelligent ground excursion robot” jointly developed by the Hyundai Motor Group and software company Autodesk. The concept explores the possibility of using autonomous vehicles to negotiate challenging terrain.

The Tiger is Hyundai’s second four-legged autonomous off-roader concept

Jointly developed by Hyundai’s New Horizons Studio and software company Autodesk

Hyundai Tiger: what exactly is it?

The ‘Tiger’ is the firm’s second ultimate mobility vehicle (UMV) concept following in the footsteps of 2019’s four-legged Elevate emergency response vehicle. Like the Elevate its wheels are joined to its modular platform via unique jointed legs which offer significantly raised ride height and 360 degree directional control.

Hyundai Tiger: how does it work?

Hyundai envisioned the Tiger as a mobile scientific exploration platform for use in hostile environments that conventional vehicles struggle to negotiate and is capable of full autonomous driving.

With its legs retracted the electric concept operates like a conventional four-wheel-drive vehicle but it can extend to its full height when faced with an obstruction. With the ability to extend each of its four legs to varying lengths the Tiger can keep any payload completely level regardless of its angle of attack.

Hyundai said the vehicle can be delivered to its destination by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and its fully electric powertrain is charged en route.

Hyundai Tiger: the science behind it

As mentioned previously the Tiger is the result of a collaboration between Hyundai Motor Group’s New Horizons Studio in California and software company Autodesk. The two firms worked together to create a “lightweight but incredibly strong structure” with an innovative carbon-fibre composite additive printing process used for elements of the chassis and legs.

Its makers claim it is “ideal for 360 degree surface evaluation in areas struck by natural disaster while tackling challenging terrain or even exploring the surface of another moon or planet.”

John Such head of the New Horizons Studio said: “Vehicles like Tiger and the technologies underpinning it give us an opportunity to push our imaginations.""

“We are constantly looking at ways to rethink vehicle design and development and redefine the future of transportation and mobility.”

Although such a vehicle is unlikely to reach production in the near future its development is likely to have an impact on mobility-focused ‘purpose-built vehicles’ from Hyundai and Kia the first of which is set to arrive in 2022 using a platform from a partner company.

It happens because AWS pricing is complex expensive at scale and penalizes customers for hard to estimate usage elements such as data transfer and storage performance which involves taking volume size provisioned IOPs and throughput into account for every volume.

AWS provides discounts for three-year commitments on products like compute but ties those reserved instance commitments to particular compute shapes operating systems and regions. While discounting can help win business the deployments are tying customers in to AWS-only services and there’s no guarantee that pricing will be there in the future.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides better performance at a significantly lower cost than AWS. Our pricing structure is simple predictable and transparent with none of surprises associated with AWS. Additionally OCI charges the same flat rate for all regions worldwide which means there are no hidden cost variances if your business expands globally.

Oracle also provides Universal Credits which enable customers to use any Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or platform service in any region at a significant savings with a predictable monthly spend commitment. But just because your spend is monthly doesn’t mean your usage has to be: these credits don’t expire at the end of the month—they can be used any time during their 12-month contract window.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZXVyb3BlLmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS9zcG9uc29yZWQvc3VjY2VlZGluZy1hdXRvbWF0ZWQtZHJpdmluZy1qb3VybmV5LXRocm91Z2gtYWnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Succeeding with the automated driving journey through AI,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://europe.autonews.com/sponsored/succeeding-automated-driving-journey-through-ai on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZXVyb3BlLmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS9zcG9uc29yZWQvc3VjY2VlZGluZy1hdXRvbWF0ZWQtZHJpdmluZy1qb3VybmV5LXRocm91Z2gtYWnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The new entrant fell perfectly in line with the company’s success formula and had an evident edge over the other offerings in the same segment. While looks are subjective we believe that one of the reasons why the Sonet garnered so much attention was because of its appealing design.

However just when we made peace with how good the car looks we came across this. The Kia Sonet customised here was undertaken by Kirthi Care in Bangalore. The exact variant of this Sonet is not known however it does look much sportier. It seems to be a Tech Line variant not the top-end GT Line version.

The vehicle now looks even more sporty and aggressive with an all-black full-body Satin Black wrap from Avery Dennison. All the chrome parts including the door handle front grille along other elements have been updated to new brushed aluminium parts. It also gets gloss painted parts the complement the whole new colour extremely well.

The customisation is reported to be just on the outside with the rest of the elements retained as the stock vesion. The Kia Sonet gets a minimalistic centre console that offers easy access to new features. The vehicle gets several first-in-segment features such as a 10.25-inch HD touchscreen and navigation system with UVO Connected technologies BOSE premium seven-speaker system with LED sound mood lights and ventilated front seats.

In terms of mechanicals the car is powered by the same engines as the Hyundai Venue. This includes a 1.0-litre turbocharged petrol unit delivering 120 PS and 171 Nm a 1.5-litre petrol unit that produces 115 PS 144 Nm and a 1.5-litre turbocharged diesel unit that puts out 115 PS and 250 Nm of torque. The engine will come with an option of a 5-speed manual 6-speed manual 6-speed AT 7-speed dual-clutch automatic and the IMT.

Instead I mean the basic aspects of a high-functioning society: well-funded schools reliable infrastructure wages that keep workers out of poverty or a comprehensive public health system equipped to handle pandemics — things that equally developed but less wealthy nations seem to have.

The GameStop bubble has come and gone but the rookie investors who speak emoji and Reddit may be here to stay with big implications for brokerage firms as well as traditional investors who must pay closer attention to where this fast-moving smartphone app-wielding crowd is moving next. ""We believe some of the new retail activity is here to stay"" wrote an analytics team at Bank of America in a report to clients. Bank of America's team found that the unprecedented surge in brokerage app downloads during the GameStop mania is continuing at a rapid pace this month even with the GameStop trade itself now forgotten. Credit Suisse data shows retail trading as a share of overall market activity has accelerated in recent months and has now doubled compared to the start of last year. Plus with the potential for a new round of stimulus checks this month another rush of cash from these new investors could be ahead. Retail trading has been accelerating since the industrywide decision to drop commissions in the fall of 2019. Since then the pandemic-fueled market volatility brought new investors into the world of stocks sometimes for the first time. Work-from-home stimulus checks and higher personal savings levels as well as social media platforms like Reddit have only accelerated the boom in retail trading. There were 3.7 million downloads of Robinhood in January according to app market intelligence firm SensorTower even with the millennial-favored stock trading app's unpopular decision to put trading restrictions on a handful of stocks during GameStop's climb. After the GameStop drama in February downloads are still tracking strongly with 1.8 million month-to-date.

Traditional brokerages like Charles Schwab and E-Trade also saw an influx of new clients as well as new entrants like Webull. The download levels well surpassed the retail participation seen during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Retail trading has doubled since last year

Since the start of 2020 retail trading as a share of overall activity has nearly doubled from between 15% and 18% to over 30% according to Credit Suisse. The chart shows a spike in activity in recent months.

The Wall Street firm estimates the total retail and wholesaler share of U.S. trading volume since 2017 using TRF or trade reporting facility volumes as a proxy for retail investing. It includes retail trades that are routed to market makers as well as dark pools — which are private forums for trading. The vast majority of retail trades (90%) are reported to the facility. Trading in general has doubled since last year. About 15 billion shares are traded every day up from 7 billion last year according to Piper Sandler. ""Double with retail being a greater percentage of that double in the marketplace"" Piper Sandler analyst Richard Repetto told CNBC earlier this week. Retail investors have been specifically interested in options trading a more sophisticated way to trade equities. At the largest e-brokers 32.7 million contracts traded on all the equity option exchanges in December according to Piper Sandler. In January a record 39.8 million contracts a day traded.

Reddit crowd

A new younger more social-media-savvy cohort has entered the fray from the GameStop mania a phenomenon that affects brokerage companies and traditional investors. Posts on Reddit's WallStreetBets page grew last month so did accounts on Robinhood according to social media analytics platforms ListenFirst and SimilarWeb. As conversations on WallStreetBets spiked above 800000 each day daily downloads of Robinhood topped 400000 per day.

These accounts and those on E-Trade and TD Ameritrade were primarily investors between the ages of 18 and 34 according to Bank of America. ""This is important because it's not just retail investors that may increasingly be a force in markets its young retail investors"" stated the bank's note. While social media usage and retail trading have calmed this week both are still elevated which ""may suggest some of this higher interest could persist as investors look for the next short squeeze and as new investors have been brought into the fray"" stated the Bank of America report.

Stimulus checks on the way

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expects Democrats will pass their next coronavirus relief package before the end of February. While direct payment allotments are still being debated another round of stimulus checks could mean more liquidity for at-home traders. ""Based on prior activity around stimulus checks we would expect another uptick in retail participation with another stimulus payment ahead"" Bank of America said.

Last April when the U.S. government passed the largest piece of stimulus legislation in our nation's history to allow people to keep paying their bills during the forced economic shutdowns some consumers put that money in the stock market. Securities trading was among the most common uses for the government stimulus checks in nearly every income bracket according to software and data aggregation company Envestnet Yodlee. Most analysts attribute the flood of new investors to the attractiveness of the market comeback the absence of sports work-from-home trends and stimulus money. The personal savings rate rocketed to an all-time high in April 2020 demonstrating a phenomenon of ""forced savings"" that helped drive retail trading higher. ""We expect another uptick in retail activity with another round of stimulus though the level will likely depend on the type of stimulus (broad based or targeted) the market backdrop at the time as well as any potential regulatory changes discussed over the coming weeks"" said Bank of America.

Pay attention or get burned?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYmdyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jcmVkaXQtY2FyZHMtbWFqb3ItY2hhbmdlLWNvbWluZy12ZXJ0aWNhbC1vcmllbnRhdGlvbi10YXAtdG8tcGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A radical change is coming to the way major credit cards work,"The credit cards that dominate the spending habits of so many consumers from companies that range from Mastercard to Visa and even Apple with its Apple Card are slowly changing the look and feel that consumers have come to expect from these card products.



Credit cards are increasingly taking on a vertical orientation.

This comes as apps like TikTok and Instagram acclimate the world toward a vertically scrolling feed and it also reflects how most consumers use their credit cards anyway — by inserting them into chip readers vertically for example.

Here’s something I bet most you didn’t see coming: TikTok and Instagram are such pervasive cultural forces in the world today they’re starting to quietly influence the design of — credit cards of all things.

In recent days PayPal released new debit and credit card vertical designs for its Venmo app which a company executive said was partly inspired by the vertical orientation of those popular social media apps. Daniela Jorge vice president of design at PayPal told Bloomberg in a recent interview that this is just the way the whole world is thinking now. And what people’s expectations are for apps and consumer products like credit cards. “The world around us is becoming more of the portrait mode and the vertical orientation” Jorge said.

Besides PayPal major banks are already moving in this direction. Bank of America the second-biggest provider in the US of debit card products was one of the first to adopt a debit card with a portrait orientation. Likewise Discovery Bank started offering vertical credit cards in 2018. And the reasons we should expect this trend to continue with more banks adopting a vertical style for their card products include the fact that with the advent of chip readers and tap-to-pay functionality this is how most people handle their cards already.

With a chip reader for example the credit card is inserted into the reader vertically. Likewise as digital wallets increase in popularity — with card owners increasingly utilizing a digital version of their credit card that’s stored in their smartphone — the phone becomes the device with which the consumer pays instead of a physical card. And phones of course are used vertically. When Apple released its new credit card product Apple Card I didn’t even bother obtaining a physical version of the card at all. I signed up and was approved for the credit card which I keep in my iPhone’s wallet app and use it vertically since I’m simply waving the phone in front of a card reader.

Think about the last time you handed your card to someone to horizontally swipe through a reader. It’s probably been a while right? Now consider that two years after these smart payment chip-enabled cards were introduced Experian says that US banks have issued more than 855 million of them. They’re called EMV cards by the way which originally stood for Europay Mastercard and Visa — the credit card companies that created this new payment standard.

“Switching our debit cards to a vertical layout is about more than how the cards look” Bank of America head of consumer and small-business products April Schneider told Bloomberg. “The vertical layout differentiates the debit card from other cards clients use and the addition of tap-to-pay makes the card faster and safer to use at in-store checkout.”"
BK,Bank of New York Mellon,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmVjYWNpdGl6ZW4uY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMTQvYm55LW1lbGxvbi1zZWVrcy10by1lbGltaW5hdGUtdGhlLXB1YmxpYy1sb2JieS1zcGFjZS1hdC0yNDAtZ3JlZW53aWNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BNY Mellon seeks to eliminate the public lobby space at 240 Greenwich,"February 14 2021 Community News Parks Real Estate

The Bank of New York Mellon has been working with the city to redesign the pedestrian experience around its building at 240 Greenwich (Murray to Barclay) and has a plan to reimagine the sad little sunken area on the corner at West Street as a public plaza — and the plans look great. But at the same time the bank is also trying to eliminate public access to its lobby — since 1980 an official privately owned public space — and in kind of a sneaky way if you ask me.

So there’s a lot to unpack here and there’s a deadline too: the City Planning Commission will make a decision on this application on Tuesday Feb. 16 at 1p. The presentations to both the CPC and CB1 have made this seem like an exchange — the outdoor space for the indoor POPS. But this is and should not be a trade and the bank’s reasons for eliminating the indoor POPS are specious. They should absolutely improve the plaza AND ALSO keep the lobby as a public space. It is clearly listed as POPS on City Planning’s own site and the lobby is designated as a public easement with 24-hour access.

Here’s their plan in bullet points (I listened to the Jan. 4 CPC meeting and the Jan. 21 CB1 meeting):

> remove the reference to a public lobby on the ground floor as a minor modification to the building’s special permit from 1980

> enhance the sidewalks on Greenwich and Murray with plantings and seating

> redesign the plaza on the southeast corner West and Murray streets to add trees and seating

> eliminate the Citi Bike dock currently there

So let’s start at the beginning. The lot was originally part of the Washington Street Urban Renewal Area (above) from 1960. In 1980 the city leased the site to Irving Trust Company which built the building we see now — 23 stories and nearly 1 million square feet by Skidmore Owings & Merrill. At that time the CPC approved a special permit for height and setback waivers – and designated the lobby as a public area and also anticipated a public walkway going north-south on the second floor along with bridges that would span both Barclay and Murray and connect to the buildings to the north and south. In 1989 CPC eliminated both bridges from the plan with the plans for 7 WTC.

BNY Mellon moved to the building in 2002. Then in 2018 the bank purchased the land under the building from the city and that summer moved global headquarters to 101 Barclay or 240 Greenwich. They are now rebranding the headquarters at 240 Greenwich with a grander entrance. At that time the lobby which had been closed to the public after 9/11 was reopened but not without a lot of pushback from the bank.

In this application the bank claims that the public lobby which is clearly on the drawings was never really part of the plan — that a north-south public access on the second floor was the public amenity. But it is in the special permit language as such with drawings to prove it.

So the question is: if they claim the lobby is not public what about that second floor space (in drawing above)? That is issue #1. The bank should NOT be allowed to eliminate that POPS and instead the bank should be required to enhance it and at the same time make it more inviting.

Now back to the streetscape (with images below):

> the sidewalk space will appear to double since the building is already set back from its lot line

> the crosswalks will be expanded in cooperation with DDC and DOT

> the north-south thru block driveway will be maintained for vehicles

> the sidewalks will have planting beds against the building plus seating nooks

> there will be bollards all along the site to “enhance the pedestrian experience”

The new Alexander Hamilton Place — named for the bank’s founder — adds up to 23000 feet and will feature a diagonal path from Murray to West with an undulating seat wall that meanders through the plaza with moveable chairs and tables in addition. They will add to the current trees for a total of 48 plus include bike racks and a drinking fountain.

A $150-billion Morgan Stanley investing arm known for its prowess in picking growth stocks is considering adding Bitcoin to its list of possible bets. Counterpoint Global  a unit of Morgan Stanley Investment Management that’s racked up wins in mutual-fund rankings is exploring whether the cryptocurrency would be a suitable option for its investors according to people with knowledge of the matter. Moving ahead with investments would require approval by the firm and regulators.Morgan Stanley’s affirmation would put the heft of an almost-century-old marquee Wall Street name behind a volatile asset class that’s still struggling to win acceptance in much of the traditional financial industry. But a four-fold jump in four months has stoked customers’ interest making the digital asset even harder to ignore.After catching the attention of hedge fund moguls including Alan Howard and Paul Tudor Jones cryptocurrencies have recently made headway with more mainstay firms such as Mastercard Inc. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. Just this week Tesla Inc  the leading maker of electric cars also got behind Bitcoin with a $1.5 billion investment and plans to start accepting the cryptocurrency as payment.A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. The review could ultimately result in Morgan Stanley opting to stay away from Bitcoin. Previous rallies in the cryptocurrency have also attracted flurries of Wall Street interest only to fizzle.Much of the industry’s skepticism centers on Bitcoin’s unpredictable price swings and the lack of things it can buy more than a decade since its creation. But faithful followers have felt vindicated this year. Billions of dollars have been pouring into the cryptocurrency through vehicles including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.Even institutional investors barred by the rules of their funds from holding Bitcoin directly have turned to such trusts. For Wall Street firms an inability to offer Bitcoin to those clients raises the risk of losing them to other managers. That may spark fresh discussions in the industry about opening up to the asset.Counterpoint Global led by Dennis Lynch has expanded with a simple-sounding mantra of betting on unique companies whose market value can increase significantly. Enthusiasts would argue that approach fits well with Bitcoin.The group oversees about 19 funds of which five delivered gains in excess of 100% in 2020. Its mutual funds have consistently made the top tier of rankings in recent years. Last year’s unusually high returns were aided by bets on companies benefiting from the pandemic such as e-commerce and streaming entertainment. Prominent investments included Amazon.com Inc.

Bitcoin's bid to go mainstream,"SpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk at an event in Berlin on December 1 2020. Photo / Getty

Elon Musk is not like most multibillionaires. The first oblique hint that Tesla's eccentric chief executive was contemplating another audacious market-shaking move came via a risqué Yuletide social media message.

On December 20 Musk tweeted a cartoon image depicting himself as a devout monk trying to live a ""normal productive life"" gazing at a woman in a provocative pose with ""bitcoin"" plastered over her posterior.

The meaning of the bawdy tweet became clearer this week. On Monday Tesla announced that it had spent US$1.5b of its cash reserves buying bitcoin and would soon start accepting payment for its electric vehicles in the digital currency. It sent a frisson of excitement running through the world of cryptocurrencies.

Adding to the frenzy BNY Mellon — America's oldest bank — on Thursday said it would start holding and transferring cryptocurrencies for asset management clients while Mastercard announced it would soon support ""select cryptocurrencies"" on its network allowing more stores to accept them as payment. Even Miami's mayor trumpeted plans to get the city to buy bitcoin.

The flurry of announcements sent the price of bitcoin — which was only invented by an unknown cryptographer in 2008 — to a new high of US$48277 on Thursday. Despite dipping on Friday that brings its 12-month gain to 358 per cent and means that the 18.6m bitcoin currently ""mined"" through an energy-intensive network of computers around the world are currently worth $877bn in total. That is twice the value of JPMorgan America's most valuable bank more than eight Goldman Sachs' or about a third of the entire FTSE 100.

Analysts and investors say the main driver of bitcoin's frenetic recent rise has been fears that central bank stimulus to dampen the economic damage of Covid-19 will ultimately ignite inflation. But the hope of its proponents is that the string of direct and implicit endorsements from pedigreed financial institutions and companies will now help drag the volatile cryptocurrency into the mainstream.

""We are potentially at the birth of a new asset class"" argues Duncan MacInnes a fund manager at Ruffer a traditional conservative UK investment group that raised eyebrows when it placed a $600m bet on bitcoin last year. ""Bitcoin is emerging from the shadows being co-opted by establishment institutions and becoming a legitimate alternative asset for investment portfolios.""

Scott Minerd of Guggenheim says that each bitcoin could ultimately be worth as much as US$400000. Photo / Getty

Nonetheless idle fascination indifference scepticism weariness and occasional mockery remain the primary responses of the mainstream finance industry where many doubt that bitcoin will ever play even a minor role. Cryptocurrencies and their supporting networks have yet to yield any meaningful concrete uses — despite hefty hopes and ample funding in recent years — and bitcoin enjoyed a similarly wild upswing in 2017 only to subsequently plummet 80 per cent from its peak.

Many think a repeat is now brewing. Bank of America's latest survey of fund managers indicates that bitcoin is now considered the most crowded trade in markets and some government officials and policymakers have begun to warn about what they see as a pure distilled example of mania.

""The recent spike in their prices looks less like a trend and more like a speculative mania — an atmosphere in which one high-profile tweet is enough to trigger a sudden jump in price"" Tim Lane the Bank of Canada's deputy governor noted in a speech this week.

New gold dream

Little divides opinion in the finance industry as vociferously as bitcoin. It is more likely to provoke crimson-faced arguments and broken friendships than politics sports or even year-end bonuses.

Supporters say bitcoin is a sophisticated secure decentralised digital asset completely free from government control with a capped supply — it was designed in such a way that there can only ever be 21m bitcoins in existence — that ensures it is a powerful protection against currency debasement or authoritarianism.

In fact many proponents argue that bitcoin will play the role that gold did in previous eras as the central dominant reserve currency in a wider ecosystem of digital assets. Scott Minerd global chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners posits that given the market value of all gold globally each bitcoin could ultimately be worth as much as US$400000.

Detractors meanwhile ridicule the progressively outlandish price predictions brandished over the years by bitcoin proponents. They see the cryptocurrency as little more than a ""digital tulip"" a reference to the infamously frivolous 17th century Dutch tulip bulb mania.

To them bitcoin is at best the tip of an iceberg of speculation unleashed by low-interest rates. At worst they consider it an environmentally destructive quasi-pyramid scheme with no real utility outside financing illegal activity. Or as one wag once bitingly described bitcoin: ""Imagine if keeping your car idling 24/7 produced solved Sudokus you could trade for heroin.""

For sceptics the endorsement of various celebrities — the actress Lindsay Lohan this week tweeted ""bitcoin to the moon"" next to a rocket ship emoji — only adds to the perception of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as fundamentally vacuous and dominated by feckless promoters rather than serious financiers.

Nonetheless the rising intrigue that bitcoin is now generating even in some traditional citadels of mainstream finance is undeniable. Thus far most of the interest has come from investors such as family offices and hedge funds but people in the industry say curiosity is starting to spread.

""One of the most interesting evolutions of the market has been the tone when institutions talk about crypto"" says Chris Zuehlke a partner at DRW a huge Chicago trading firm and global head of the company's cryptocurrency arm Cumberland. ""In just three years bitcoin went from people asking 'what is it?' to 'how do I trade it?'.""

Post-pandemic uncertainty

Analysts say the biggest driver behind the recent burst of investor interest is the uncertain post-pandemic macroeconomic environment. Central banks have committed to keeping interest rates low even if inflation does pick up while government borrowing has ballooned. Meanwhile equity markets have reached record highs.

This raises thorny questions for institutional investment portfolios mostly predicated on a judicious mix of stocks and bonds to generate diversified balanced returns over time. Gold has been a big obvious beneficiary but some analysts and investors now think bitcoin has a role to play alongside the millennia-old store of value.

""This environment creates a huge need for two things: assets that have a plausible case for delivering positive real returns; and assets that can still offer diversification"" argues Inigo Fraser Jenkins an analyst at Bernstein the Wall Street research house. He had previously declared that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin had zero role to play in the portfolios of institutional investors but late last year changed his mind and now thinks they should be taken seriously.

While Fraser Jenkins concedes he can count the number of clients that have started to dabble in bitcoin on one hand he is confident that the ""direction of travel is towards more institutional adoption"".

Viability test

For MacInnes at Ruffer the rapid maturation of the crypto industry also played a major role in his change of heart. Rather than an odd bunch of ""bros"" and ""computer geeks"" he discovered that it is now populated by alumni of prominent investment banks hedge funds and consultancies with many crypto companies professionalised and formally regulated. ""It's grown up"" MacInnes says.

Ruffer cashed out some of its bitcoin profits this year selling $650m worth but is still holding on to about $900m of the cryptocurrency. ""What bitcoin was and what bitcoin is today are both different from what we think bitcoin has the potential to become in the future"" MacInnes argues. ""We think we're at the foothills of this long trend of financialisation and institutional adoption.""

MacInnes concedes that there is a risk of stricter regulation controls or even outright bans but cautions that the window for governments to act without disastrous results is narrowing given the rapid growth of the industry. ""There's an enormous tidal wave of institutional adoption. If governments want to stand in the way of this it has to be soon or it is going to be too late as we'll be in too deep"" he says.

Nonetheless despite the flurry of recent announcements there are few signs that bitcoin is becoming a viable currency — either as means of exchange or a true store of value traditionally two of the main pillars.

Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou an analyst at JPMorgan points out that despite a rise in payments using the cryptocurrency since 2018 the overall volume remains vanishingly small. Costs are stubbornly high at around $25 per transaction and the wild volatility of bitcoin deters both buyers and sellers. Chamath Palihapitiya a prominent venture capitalist recently ruefully revealed that he used bitcoin to buy a US$1.6m Lake Tahoe property in 2016 — the same amount of bitcoin would today be worth US$128m.

Those kinds of swings mean that it is an ""open question"" whether more merchants or corporate treasurers will ever follow in Tesla's footsteps notes Bryan Routledge associate professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business.

The price of bitcoin has been explosive over the past year but the volatility remains stomach-churning which will put off many serious investors and virtually all corporate treasurers outside of Tesla industry executives note. It is hard to claim to be a store of value when prices can often move around by 5-10 per cent in a day they point out.

Even financiers that have an open mind about the merits of bitcoin say they are sceptical that it will command a role in the portfolios of the investment industry any time soon. Krishna Memani chief investment officer of Lafayette College's endowment struggles to see how any major investment groups will adopt bitcoin to any significant degree for the time being. ""I don't think we are there just yet and unlikely to be there anytime soon"" he says.

Perhaps the best explanation for parts of the investment industry's current interest in bitcoin — and an indication of how durable it will ultimately prove — was made by the legendary hedge fund manager George Soros almost a decade ago.

""When I see a bubble forming I rush in to buy adding fuel to the fire"" he admitted in a 2009 speech. As the hedge fund titan knew riding a market mania can be immensely lucrative — provided one gets out before the reckoning.

If your mother enjoys the outdoors and appreciates the delicate beauty of birds what better gift is there than a bird bath? More specifically a solar-powered bird bath fountain. It only needs a little bit of sun exposure before it begins blasting water into the air giving all of your flying friends a chance to wash off that sky dust.

(For even more ideas check out our roundups of the best Mother's Day gifts for every budget and the best last-minute Mother's Day gifts to shop now.)

Why is this a good deal? 💰

At over 30% off this matches the best price we've seen this year. It's also one of the most affordable options on all of Amazon with most other fountains starting at $17 and going up from there.

Why do I need this? 🤔

Running water makes for an attractive feature in any space and this fountain pump will spray water high into the air using nothing but solar power. You don't need to plug it in anywhere; just place it in the bird bath and after about three seconds it will begin spraying water. It doesn't store energy so it may be somewhat less effective on cloudy days.

There are also six different nozzles that you can swap out for different water patterns so you can mix things up from time to time. If you keep it in the middle of a properly-sized bird bath you won't lose a lot of water over the sides. It will minimize the amount of refilling you have to do. That said you should clean it every so often to prevent the pump lines from clogging — the company suggests doing so at least once a week.

Splish splash they were takin' a bath! Mom will enjoy the feathered fun this bird bath will bring to her garden. (Amazon)

What reviewers say 💬

With over 7900 five-star reviews a lot of fans have added this touch of whimsy to their birdbath.

Pros 👍

Despite concerns over sun exposure fans say this fountain works well even with indirect light. ""I have a bird bath with a shallow basin and only 1/2 day of direct sunlight. My concern was that I did not want to have stagnant water that could attract mosquitoes. This solar fountain pump works great. It even works at lower capacity using only reflected light when the bird bath is in a shadowy part of the day.""

Another bird-watcher said ""This little thing is beautiful. It aerates the water and the birds love it.""

It isn't limited just to bird baths either. ""I bought it for my neighbor's koi pond but he put it in his pool. It sprays water about 3 feet in the air. He loves it.""

Cons 👎

One fan said it can be a little noisy. ""I love them! I have one in my front and back garden. Only downside is they make a sputtering noise when they’re not in full sun.""

Another shopper warned that it might actually be too powerful. ""I found that they have too much power for my small birdbath. I put a half-inch square of electrical tape over one of the solar collectors and wait and watch. If the spray is too strong I put another piece on. it usually takes three pieces.""

But the Holburne Museum in Bath is staging a groundbreaking exhibition called Henry Moore in Miniature a collection of the great artist’s works that could fit into the palm of the hand.

The museum’s director Chris Stephens said its relatively small spaces meant one of the themes of its programme was to showcase the intimate in art – and the retrospective of mini Moores met the brief perfectly.

He said visitors to the exhibition which opened on Friday would be able to imagine Moore industriously working away in his studio finding new shapes and textures.

“The exhibition serves as a reminder that sculpture is as much an art of the hand – in its making and appreciation – as of the eye. An object may be small in size but large in scale” he said.

The show billed as the first of its kind features sculptures in stone wood terracotta plaster lead bronze and Plasticine and takes in themes recurrent in Moore’s work: the reclining female figure mother and child the human head the fallen warrior. It has works from every decade of his career from the 1920s to the 1980s.

The first piece the visitor encounters is a mother and child from the 1920s modelled in Plasticine which pleasingly was invented at the end of the 19th century by a teacher at Bath Academy of Art William Harbutt. It sits next to a small animal head made of boxwood in 1921.

Another intriguing display features of a pair of mother-and-childs from the 1930s modelled in plaster and cast in lead which Moore melted in saucepans on a kitchen stove. Stephens said the lead gave the pieces a “poisonous” air which perhaps reflected political times as the world headed towards war.

Seen in public for the first time is a collection of small terracotta heads that Moore modelled while planning two carved heads for a church at Much Hadham in Hertfordshire in the 1950s.

Stephens said: “These reflect his interest in classical traditions tribal masks and perhaps the graffiti carved into walls in Paris captured by the photographer Brassaï.” Moore’s fingerprints and tool marks are clearly visible in the heads.

The final displays are maquettes for yet more mother and child sculptures dating from the late 1970s and early 1980s and a cabinet of found objects from his studio that Moore worked with – bones flints stones.

Presented in partnership with the Henry Moore Foundation the exhibition features more than 60 works gathered in one room on the top floor of the museum. Moore’s daughter Mary Moore said she was delighted these smaller pieces would be seen.

She said: “An enormous amount of Henry Moore’s work – particularly the starting point for his universally familiar large-scale sculpture – began with his modelling with his turning moulding and forming in the palm of his hands.”

By way of contrast a second show that opened at the Holburne on Friday stars a very different artist – Sam Cox better known as Mr Doodle who has almost 3 million followers on Instagram sells his work for hundreds of thousands of pounds a time and has covered every inch of his Kent home with his intricate patterns.

Mr Doodle! Museum Mayhem is the first UK museum exhibition of his work with the Holburne allowing Doodle to take over parts of the building and daub it with his “graffiti spaghetti” of black ink on white background.

He has also been given the go-ahead to replace some of its pieces with his own work. For example John Constable’s Flatford Lock from the Bridge (circa 1814-17) has been replaced with Doodle House from the Gates (2024).

Doodle studied illustration at UWE Bristol and used to bring a suitcase of his work to Bath to try to barter for a meal or a drink. “That was mostly unsuccessful” he said. “It’s cool to come back and do something grander.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy9jeGU4M2owNWtseG_SATJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvY3hlODNqMDVrbHhvLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Historic Royal Navy dolphin bell goes on display in Bath,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS0xMzM4NjQwNy9GV0FXLWZhbnMtc2xhbS1jcmluZ2UtYmF0aC1kYXRlLUZhcm1lci1Kb2UtQ2xhaXJlLmh0bWzSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtMTMzODY0MDcvYW1wL0ZXQVctZmFucy1zbGFtLWNyaW5nZS1iYXRoLWRhdGUtRmFybWVyLUpvZS1DbGFpcmUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Farmer Wants A Wife fans slam 'cringe' bath date between Farmer Joe and Claire: 'It felt awkward watching it!',"Farmer Wants A Wife fans were left 'cringing' on Sunday night as they watched an awkward date between two of the contestants.

The cattle and sheep farmer 33 offered another 24-hour date up for grabs with the marketing manager 36 pulling out all the stops to win.

'I saw the bathtub near our tent so yeah I just wanted to set up a little spot for us to share some time together' Claire told producers.

Farmer Wants A Wife Australia fans said they were left 'cringing' away from the TV on Sunday night as they watched an awkward date between two of the contestants

However it seemed the plan 'fell flat' when awkward scenes showed the pair stripping down and stepping into the warm bath looking shy in front of the cameras.

The pair appeared uncomfortable sharing affections while in their underwear on TV but did attempt to share a kiss and caress one another in a cringey display.

'I couldn't watch the bath just a bunch of giggling it was so cringe' one person wrote on Facebook.

Another added: 'I know I felt awkward for watching haha not even a conversation going.'

'Yes it was so cringeworthy it was hard to watch' one user commented.

One wrote: 'To me that date thing that Claire planned for Joe fell flat I honestly don't think he's feeling it for any of the women.'

'No he is not feeling it with any of them but well and truly enjoying the game!' another agreed.

Farmer Joe has formed several connections this season but still hasn't had much luck after Susie walked out on him when she realised farm life was not for her.

However fans believe he will ultimately end up with Sarah a livestock administrator who grew up on a cattle farm because of their similar backgrounds."

Don’t read further if you haven’t watched the finale of the Showtime series Your Honor which wraps its 10-episode limited series run tonight. What follows is a recap of the final episode of the drama that got Bryan Cranston nominated for a Golden Globe followed by an interview with British writer Peter Moffat –the BAFTA winning creator of Criminal Justice which was adapted into the American series The Night Of. Moffat developed and ran Your Honor and here explains how he transplanted some elements of an Israeli TV series but went mostly his own way after borrowing a killer concept. He set the drama in New Orleans and got Cranston to play a righteous judge who turns all kinds of wrong betraying everyone and everything he held dear in a desperate effort to cover up his son’s hit and run accident a decision he made in a hot second after discovering the father of the victim is ruthless mob boss Jimmy Baxter.

The web of lies spun by meticulous New Orleans Judge Michael Desiato to insulate his 17 year old son Adam (Hunter Doohan) from culpability in the hit and run death of motorcyclist Rocco Baxter had begun to buckle under the weight of lies and tonight it all came tumbling down on the judge. Cranston himself directed the final episodes as his character knew his only chance of surviving was to preside over the murder trial of the son of Jimmy Baxter (Michael Stuhlbarg) and have his thug son Carlo acquitted in the beating death of Kofi Jones the car thief who took the rap for the hit and run. As it became clear Kofi didn’t commit that hit and run Judge Desiato got Baxter to believe it was he and not his son whose car collided with the motorcycle driven by young Rocco. Tonight a carefully choreographed ruse fell apart in dramatic and tragic fashion.

Skip Bolen/Showtime

Episode Nine ended with the Baxter family curious about grieving daughter Fia’s relationship with the mysterious boy Adam. Not knowing he was the son of the judge they believe killed Rocco. Adam’s former photography teacher girlfriend already divulged that he ran down Rocco to Judge Michael’s best friend Charlie (Isiah Whitlock Jr) the town fixer and mayoral candidate who came to warn the teacher to leave Adam alone. The cracks were already showing.

The final episode began with a surprising revelation that Michael’s deceased wife and Adam’s mother was having an extramarital affair which explained a little about her shocking death a year earlier (the hit and run resulted because Adam visited the place she was shot). Adam’s grandmother Elizabeth (Margo Martindale) tells the youth the news but Adam takes it well because he’s fallen head over heels in love with Fia. Michael’s lawyer girlfriend Lee (Carmen Ejogo) whom he asked to represent the slain car thief Kofi because he felt he could control her will not let go that easily. She is the one who got Kofi’s father to okay an autopsy that revealed a brutal murder by Carlo and she is now cajoling Baxter’s rival Big Mo (Andrene Ward-Hammond) for the identity of the real hit and run driver who clearly was not her deceased client Kofi. Big Mo threatens to kill Lee who says she has left a note even as she seems to realize the danger she is in. It’s a tense moment. “I can smell a bluff like the mustard pot of a bad ho” says Big Mo who nonetheless allows Lee to walk out. “You kill me a whole lot of shit comes down” Lee warns. Lee walks away clear in the knowledge her client stole the hit and run car a day after it was used in the fatal incident.

Adam is quick to forgive his father for keeping the secret about his mother’s infidelity. “Thousands of things your mom was so many wonderful things that wasn’t this one bad thing she did this one mistake it shouldn’t define who you are” the judge tells his son in the warmest embrace as dad confides that when Adam’s mom told Michael she was pregnant with him he hugged her so tightly he broke her rib. A fact she concealed through the pain on their abrupt wedding day. “Was that a lie or was that love” the judge asks. It is the warmest engagement between father son since the hit and run. But the lies are closing in.

Cut to Carlo the violent son of Jimmy Baxter who murdered Kofi in the mistaken belief the young man had killed his brother. Jimmy Baxter implores his son to hold his temper while testifying or else give the prosecutor her Perry Mason moment. Asks Carlo: “Perry who?” Jimmy tells his son he will eventually run the crime family and that he will need to use brains and not just a temper and brawn. “Show your father what a real man you can be” Jimmy warns his son.

Michael tenses as he watches Lee enter his courtroom while Carlo is falsely telling jurors about the terror he felt when Kofi came into his cell. Carlo spreads the lies out too thickly explaining that he would never forget the sound of Kofi shutting the cell door before pummeling Carlo and then reopening the cell door and walking out after the brawl. Lee goes to the cell herself and sees that once the door is slammed shut an inmate cannot open it; it locks and only a guard can reopen it. Lee conveys the information to the prosecutor (Maura Tierney) and when she confronts the defendant with his lie Carlo’s civility and charm fades. He calls the prosecutor a terrible name one which the jury hears. While he attempts to walk back his story his bald faced lies are there for the jury to see. Judge Desiato’s careful attempt to fix the trial is in grave jeopardy.

Next Detective Nancy Costello (Amy Landecker) figures out Michael has been lying when she visits his wife’s grave site and a homeless Vietnam vet who sits sentry there explains that the judge had fudged his whereabouts on the day of the hit and run. Desiato’s indignant response to the cop leaves the detective cold. They break and Michael has lunch with Charlie the pal who arranged for the hit and run car to be stolen. Charlie tells him he knows Adam was the driver disappointed Michael hadn’t told him in the first place. Michael confides that he’s in deep with the Baxters and can only be saved if Carlo is acquitted which now looks unlikely. Charlie tells the truth to Detective Costello and promises her a place high up in his administration — he’s the frontrunner to be the next mayor — if she conceals the crime. The detective is stopped cold in her tracks when Charlie tells her that Michael is taking the blame for his son Adam whose life will be forfeit to the Baxters if the truth gets out.

Next relationship that goes down is the one with Michael’s lover Lee. This one is particularly painful. After Michael gives her the proceeds from selling the Mariano Rivera signed baseball — the money is for Kofi’s brother Eugene — Lee begins to see through Michael’s lies and she too realizes that Adam is to blame. Michael challenges her to turn in his son “Kill Adam cleanse your soul” he taunts holding a cell phone for her to make a call. “Justice and principles do you think either of those takes precedence over the life of your child? Will the death of another 17 year old make it right?” She is speechless. “Who are you?” she says. “Your lies and manipulations are fu*king me up. It’s not my soul that needs cleansing Michael it’s yours.” Later Lee will discover that Kofi had been taking his high school equivalency exam the day of the hit and run but by the time Michael disallows this to be read as evidence because the prosecution rested its case he has lost the woman he expected to have a life with.

He realizes the weight of all he is losing as he tries to keep Lee from abandoning him: “I’ll go to the police but we tell them it was me” he says sobbing. “I don’t want to be this person. I don’t want to lie anymore. But he is my son. Am I a bad person because I value my own life so much less than the life of my child?”

She reminds him that four children and a mother are dead because of his actions. “I’ve done terrible things” he allows “and I am so ashamed. But I love you.” She slaps him and tells him to stop talking about himself. “You can never have me now.” She is done with all of it and when she hands the money for the Mariano Rivera baseball to Eugene she tells the young man who lost his brother Kofi to a vicious beating and saw his family firebombed by the Baxters to “get all you can.” The young man is simmering with the betrayal by the judge and the legal system. Lee implores Michael to allow Eugene to testify that it will result in Carlo’s conviction and a second chance for his soul. But we all know Michael’s in too deep.

As Judge Desiato disallows Eugene’s testimony he glimpses that his son holds hands with a young woman he doesn’t recognize. When she sits and hugs her father Jimmy Baxter the judge can feel the noose tightening. Because the only thing keeping Adam alive is that Baxter thinks the hit and run was perpetrated by him and not his son. Baxter takes a long look at Adam as the judge nixes Eugene’s testimony.

Jimmy Baxter again threatens Michael and the rest of the judge’s family in an effort to tighten the noose even further. It works. The judge scribbles an anonymous note ostensibly from a juror and while the lawyers fight Desiato says he himself will “do it; I’m neutral and I’m impartial.” He is soon providing the narrative for the playing of the 911 tape of Rocco Baxter’s final moments laying out the stakes dramatically that these are the last moments of a 17-year old’s life and that this was what Kofi heard. Neutral and impartial? This judge has leapt to the dark side; spreading on sympathy for an obviously guilty defendant at the behest of an unnamed juror who asked to hear the 911 call who actually was the judge himself. This will come to destroy the judge’s entire effort to conceal his son. We know the 911 call was made by Adam on Rocco’s phone (the one he would throw in the river) as Adam struggled for breath with the inhaler he dropped which caused the accident and which became a clue at the crime scene when Adam discarded it. Hearing the 911 call again is too much for Jimmy Baxter’s wife Gina (Hope Davis) who leaves the courtroom. Adam too is overcome by reliving his 911 call and walks out into the hallway. Jimmy Baxter comes out to retrieve his wife and they turn just in time to see Adam puffing…his inhaler! Now there is no doubt about who killed Rocco Baxter. It is a bitter pill for the Baxters to swallow even as Desiato comes through and Baxter’s son Carlo is found not guilty. Jimmy is going to want vengeance.

Eugene seethes at the acquittal. And Fia invites boyfriend Adam to the Baxter’s hotel for a celebration party Adam oblivious to the peril that awaits him. Eugene takes the money he received from the autographed ball hands it to a man and waits for something in return. Michael heads home but his moment of peace is interrupted by a call from…Jimmy Baxter.

“He’s here” Baxter says. “Who?” “He’s having a little trouble breathing” Baxter continues. “Maybe he has his inhaler with him maybe he doesn’t. You want to watch what I do to your son Baxter House Hotel. C’mon over.”

Finding his car boxed in the judge an avid runner sprints to the hotel where he’s denied entry by security men who’ve been told by Jimmy Baxter not to let the judge in. In his second attempt to enter the premises security muscles Michael away and in walks Kofi’s brother Eugene holding a bag.

While Adam is having a nice time making forever plans with Fia Michael’s nightmare gets worse as he peers through the window and sees Jimmy embracing Adam enveloping him in a bear hug like the embrace of a serpent.

Eugene winds his way through the kitchen until he sees the party guest he is most interested in: Carlo just acquitted of killing his brother. But Eugene’s aim isn’t true and his bullet misses Carlo and lodges in the neck of Adam. Soon Jimmy Baxter is pulling his bloodied screaming daughter Fia away and Judge Michael Desiato is left to bid his son farewell the life leaking out of a hole in his neck. The enormity of his grief moment is reminiscent of Michael Corleone in the final installment of The Godfather. Despite the hit and run and all of the terrible things that the judge did to try and protect his son Judge Michael Desiato is left with the knowledge that the son he sold his soul to save is gone. And he is still in the grasp of the ruthless crime boss who would have killed the boy anyway. Both Michael and Jimmy now share a bond grieving over a dead teen son but there is no telling where their relationship might go from here. Cut to a Mozart aria and this riveting limited series is over. For now at least. The Israeli series on which it was based went to a second season and this one’s high ratings might bring it back for more as well.

Now an interview with series mastermind Peter Moffat:

DEADLINE: This was a great ride. We’ve seen other Israeli TV series get transplanted to America most notably Showtime’s Homeland. Very different cultures. What element from that series hooked you?

PETER MOFFAT: The premise. [Executive Producer] Liz Glotzer called me and she said what would you do as a parent if your child hit and killed another child on the roadside and left the scene of the accident? My answer is probably shared by most parents which is well you have to do the right thing and take your son in to the police station. What do you do she said if you discover that the father of the victim is the biggest gangster in town. And my answer is again I think probably the same as most parents. You turn around and leave and to be completely honest with you and I know it sounds like a writer talking to a journalist moment. I knew then I was going to write this. I got off the phone went upstairs to my study and going upstairs I fell over like a child and hurt my arm a bit.

Carried on up the stairs sat down and I fu*king stayed up for hours and hours and hours. Writing the next hundred questions that came to mind. And to answer your question properly I quickly got frightened about watching the original and about knowing the story the original series had come up with because I was so quickly into my own process thinking hard about what this could be. I didn’t want that train of thought interrupted and disturbed by the reality of the original. So I didn’t watch it. I made a conscious decision not to watch it. Once the [writers] room started up people obviously did watch it and brought in elements of the original into the room in order to discuss and see where they could fit for us.

DEADLINE: How long before you watched?

MOFFAT: It was many weeks and months later before I looked at it. I wanted to be sufficiently confident in what I was doing before I felt kind of safe to go and look at other directions.

DEADLINE: Why set in New Orleans the French Quarter? It brought in the haves and have nots and systemic racism…

MOFFAT: Yeah. So it’s a small town New Orleans right? People know each other right and inside the criminal justice system people really know each other. The sheriff knows the chief of police. The chief of police knows all the lawyers. Judges know the lawyers. The police officers know…it’s a very interconnected place and as you also know it’s a very corrupt place. It seemed to me that it would be a lot more interesting for our main character Michael Desiato to try and hide things to keep secrets and to lie effectively if everybody around him is more known to him and is looking at him closely and has understood and is speaking about him than it would if he were more anonymous in a bigger place. And New Orleans the strange thing for me is that it’s so filmic. Point the camera anywhere in New Orleans and it’s really interesting to look at. It’s interesting you mentioned the French Quarter because we stayed away from that story from Mardi Gras and voodoo and the quarter and all of that. I just wanted to explore the rest of New Orleans a city that has a lot of poverty a lot of problems and a city that has deep and fascinating and vibrant and wonderful and exciting culture.

DEADLINE: You can see where you went differently from the other series. There the motorcycle accident didn’t kill the mobster’s son and the mobster was in jail. But the protagonist in that series made moves outside his courtroom while you added another son and focused the action in the courtroom. Both judges were distinguished but here you had this former traded his morality and sold his sold his soul to fix a murder trial of the gangster’s son. Felt like a ‘eureka’ moment.

MOFFAT: Michael Desiato has a lot of skills knowledge and experience about how to work the system about how the criminal justice system functions. When he’s on the other side of it he can think well and effectively about how to keep his kid safe. And that felt very important to me that he was good at it. I used to be at the criminal bar myself a barrister here in London. I spent 10 years doing this work in courtrooms in London at the Old Bailey and all those places. So I know about it and I just thought how complex how complicated and how interesting that world is. Bryan Cranston’s character knows it like the back of his hand and that gives him an advantage in trying to fu*k around with it and trying to get the better of everything. That’s pretty interesting to me and I think pretty effective in the show.

DEADLINE: So you knew how a fair trial could be corrupted from been in that system yourself. Like withholding the gruesome autopsy pictures of Kofi Jones’ battered face the young man whom Michael hired to steal and lose the car his son Adam drove that accidentally hit and kill the son of the gangster. Kofi in turn was beaten to death in a prison cell by the gangster’s other vicious son Carlo who was on trial for the murder. In his attempt to get Carlo acquitted Judge Desiato also refused to allow the testimony from Kofi’s brother Eugene and sabotaged the testimony of Carlo’s best friend and fellow drug dealer. He even set up his fellow judge and close friend Sara LeBlanc by invoking his dead wife’s memory to get the judge to share a belt of Scotch with him so he could set her up for a DWI arrest and get himself to be the judge on Carlo’s case. Did you ask other judges how your character could fix a case methodically incrementally giving his soul away in hopes the gangster father would let him and his son live?

MOFFAT: So I spent a lot of time in two courthouses primarily Tulane and Broad in New Orleans and 26th and California in Chicago which is the busiest courthouse in America. I talked to judges and lawyers from both places and got to know them really well and saw textures and everything of those places and what they’re like. But I’m really pleased that you mentioned that scene with the photographs of Kofi dead Kofi and the injuries that Carlo has allegedly caused him because that’s an interesting moment for a judge. Let’s just say that he isn’t corrupt for a moment. Just imagine that. It’s a real question that he would have to ask himself in a situation like that is is my jury going to be too upset by looking at these pictures?

Is it essential for the prosecution that they see these photographs or have they heard enough about the injuries that have been caused to this individual? And that’s a kind of genuine question that a judge needs to ask themselves in a situation like that. But if you think about Michael Desiato and what he’s done and the deaths that are consequent upon his actions and the people that have died because of his failure to tell the truth and because he’s covered up to pretend to be in that moment that the fatherly judge is taking care of 12 citizens who are doing their absolute best to do their civic duty is an astonishingly horrendous action I think on his part. It’s very very disturbing but what’s interesting for me is that I kept putting myself in his shoes every step of the way and those first two moments that we’ve just been talking about 10 minutes ago what do I do if my child is in this situation what do I do if I discover that the victim’s father is this vicious criminal? Those are easy enough answers. The next question is much harder to answer. What’s the next thing you do? The answer is you commit a criminal offense. You start to cover up evidence of a crime which is a criminal offense in itself right?

DEADLINE: Yes.

MOFFAT: How are you doing now? Well I think it’s still okay because I would do that for my child but there comes a point in there…people are dying because of what you’ve done that the question becomes way way harder way harder. And by that stage when he’s performing like that in front of the jury it’s pretty despicable behavior but it’s interesting to me. And it seems that what audiences are telling us is that it’s despicable behavior and I hate you for it but I also still love you I also still love you right? I want you to succeed but I hate myself for thinking that so I’m feeling pretty complicated and I’m asking myself as an audience member some hard questions some good serious moral questions about my own moral map not just his which is everything you want as a writer from an audience right? They’re there doing that work. They’re having those arguments with themselves and with each other. I love that.

DEADLINE: So two follow-ups there. One based on what you just said so if you had been a judge a fair judge would you have withheld the Kofi pics?

MOFFAT: Yeah quite possibly because I think we’ve seen it. We had the video. We had that evidence on the screen already. No question if you’re prosecuting this case you want those pictures in and you want them handed around the jury and you’ll sit and watch as the jury look at them and you’ll see their responses and their responses will be that they’re appalled right? And that’s what you want. If you think about an adversarial system it’s obvious but it’s worth saying that there are competing narratives right that there are two stories and the best story wins. The truth is somewhere in the middle. It’s a central part of an adversarial system that the truth is not important because you’re constructing a narrative that you want to defeat your opponent’s narrative. It’s storytelling. Now you can’t depart too far from reality. You can’t depart from the truth right but you’re definitely shaping something constructing something that moves people towards the result that you want and in the prosecution’s case it’s a conviction a guilty verdict and if you think that those pictures horrible though they are are going to help you get a guilty verdict then you want them in and your motives are not that clear actually. In my previous career I’ve opened briefs and looked at the most appalling photographs and I thought god you know these are terrible nobody should be looking at this. But then you have to ask yourself the second question which is does it help your client? And if the answer is yes it does do your job. It’s not your business. Do the best for your client. You know you’re a gun for sale gun for hire you know?

DEADLINE: Everything you just said about the judge’s conflicts and the audience still loving him comes down to your star. Bryan Cranston most famously morphed from Walter White to Heisenberg in Breaking Bad and once again here we watched his morals corrupted. How did you make sure he didn’t fall too closely back on that familiar track many associate him with?

MOFFAT: Well here’s the thing about Bryan. I think he wears a kind of coat which says that he’s a good human being. That’s one’s impression of him because it’s true. If you walk with him down a street in New Orleans and people stop they say I just want to shake your hand and carry on doing what you’re doing. Which is obviously not carry on being a former chemistry teacher who’s dealing crystal meth and fu*king up everybody’s lives. They’re saying carry on being Bryan Cranston and we love you.

We all thought that it was a pretty good idea for a character who’s going to fall a very long way across 10 hours of drama that you start him off as somebody who has that inherent goodness about them. Inherent decency about them and that’s what Bryan has. So he has further to fall and this is a little bit pompous and sorry about it but this show’s a tragedy and the further that your hero can fall the better. That’s what happened and to me he’s like a modern-day Gregory Peck which is why there’s a reference in the show to Gregory Peck right one big fu*king Gregory Peck in there. He is that. I trust Gregory Peck. I trust him in To Kill a Mockingbird right and I trust Bryan Cranston. It turned out I’m completely wrong to trust Bryan Cranston but at the starting point I trust him.

DEADLINE: How hard was it to convince him to return to episodic series?

MOFFAT: We met for lunch on the hottest day of the year and with nobody else in the restaurant. It was in the Valley in Los Angeles and I said here’s what happens in episode 2 because he’d read episode 1 and then I said here’s what happens in episode 3 and then he said are you going to tell me the story of all 10? We’d been there about an hour and a half by then. So I said oh no I’d better shut up a bit so I did and you know I could tell from the conversation that we were having and the level of engagement that if he were to do this we would have a great time together. And that conversation has never stopped his level of interest in everything that is written and in everything that we’re doing has never slowed down. It’s been an incredible experience for me to have that kind of relationship with an actor and of course with the director of the last episode because he directed the last episode.

DEADLINE: Where did you ever get the idea that a look from Michael Stuhlbarg could be so lethal? His Jimmy Baxter character is convincingly dangerous a measure of grief for losing his favorite son and rage to get revenge.

MOFFAT: I’ve watched and loved him for a long time is the honest answer. He’s done gang boss before but it doesn’t feel like the center of him. It’s slightly off-key casting in a good way I think. He’s not Italian for a start. The thing about Michael is he takes such care over everything he’s so particular in the best possible way that everything is thought through everything is worked out everything is discussed and I think that’s how and why you’re able to arrive at those kind of small moments which speak so big. Originally I had thought that the ending of the show would be that moment in episode 10 which is there of course. When Michael Desiato is outside Jimmy’s hotel while inside the hotel his nemesis brings his son Adam into his arms holds him and looks at Cranston outside like I’ve got him I own him you’ve lost him you’ve lost your child to the devil. Effectively that is what that moment is saying and I thought that would be the ending because Michael can pull that off completely. Yeah.

DEADLINE: Why did you veer from that?

MOFFAT: Because it became a bigger show. The heart of it is obviously will a father succeed in protecting his son? Will a father keep his son alive against all the odds? That feels like the heart of things but as we wrote more and developed it more it became a wider-reaching show than that. It goes into the politics of race the politics of class the politics of corruption in New Orleans generally the corruption of police in New Orleans and beyond. All those elements are there.

It felt completely wrong to leave those elements out of the ending. It feels right to me that the person who probably has suffered the most as a consequence of the actions of the hero in the show which is Eugene should be at the center of things in those last moments and what’s happened to him to be what we should be thinking about and looking at and working over in our heads as we watch.

DEADLINE: Adam the judge’s asthmatic son played by Hunter Doohan had me yelling at the screen a bit. He walked through these episodes almost in a dream state after hitting the motorcycle and leaving the scene. He seemed oblivious to his father’s soul selling and desperate maneuvers to shield his son from this murderous gangster. He risks everything by engaging with Jimmy’s daughter Fia whose brother he killed. Describe how in the writing the boy got away with acting this way well got away with it until the end? Give me a sense of Adam’s mindset and unwillingness to confront his own crime.

MOFFAT: I’m glad that it pissed you off. I always love that anybody who has a strong enough reaction to make them want to get off the sofa okay it makes me very happy. I’m delighted that you felt that way and I think it’s important to remember with Adam that he’s 17 years old. That he’s a child right and what he’s been asked to do is huge and he gives control to his dad. He says dad help me and dad does okay. So he’s given that over. So what he’s left with really and fundamentally is his own childish guilt. But at the same time it’s insisted by his dad that he not do anything with that that he mustn’t confess that he mustn’t share that he must keep it secret. I just think that’s really really hard. I think he spends a bit of time in the show exploring his feelings of guilt and I think he becomes almost fascinated by his victim and by what he’s done that he can’t stop looking at it. And it’s true too of other forms of crime and other forms of criminals. They do this thing where they remain fascinated by what they’ve done and they literally and metaphorically revisit it and that’s what Adam does here. That’s what Adam does here because he’s a criminal but he takes it a long way and I’m sure it’s maddening to watch you know two things everything that his dad is doing to try and protect him while he looks like he’s sometimes doing the opposite of keeping himself safe.

DEADLINE: Like when his father has him attending school far away in New York and he decided to push his enrollment a year and stay close by.

MOFFAT: But more importantly he’s continuing to live a life in which he falls in love has dreams and hopes and ambitions at the same time as the people that are suffering because of his actions are suffering. And that goes to a much bigger question about privilege and power and what happens when you commit a crime according to the color of your skin and the amount of money you have and the amount of power that you have in order to get yourself out of the problem.

DEADLINE: You added the reveal that Michael’s wife and Adam’s mother who was shot in a random store holdup had been having an affair. It felt like a red herring. Was there more significance than that? You also had this running thing about a baseball signed by Mariano Rivera that seemed also like filler but boy did that deliver a payoff in when Eugene used the money for the ball to buy the guy that led to him shooting Adam.

MOFFAT: Okay. Here’s what Adam learns or thinks he learns when he discovers that his mom was having an affair and that his father has kept it from him right? He understands that his father hasn’t told him about what his dead mother was doing because it would be too painful for him to hear. And the conclusion of that and what you can say about that is that sometimes love is much more important than the truth. Which would be Michael’s then-argument for not telling Adam about what his mother was doing. And Adam is able to draw a parallel between that and his own life in which he’s in love with head over heels in love with thinks he wants to spend the rest of his life with the daughter of the person who it turns out would like him dead.

He can’t tell her. He can’t tell her. If he tells her you know what he did to her brother it’s over right? And so he’s also saying in his fu*ked-up 17-year-old brain sometimes love is more important than telling the truth and he comes to understand having failed to understand initially why his dad is doing what he’s doing. Now it’s like a moral position which has some holes in it but it is a good argument actually that the truth isn’t always the best thing. And actually although it’s a throwaway line that Michael has in that scene with Elizabeth at the beginning of episode 10 let’s round up all the 4-year-olds and tell them that Santa Claus doesn’t exist it’s actually quite meaningful that you do have to lie to children. It’s hard to say. I don’t even like saying it myself. It comes out wrong. But you do it all the time.

DEADLINE: And the Mariano Rivera baseball? It stewed in my brain for a little bit before I figured it out how that ball underwrote the shattering climax after making small appearances over numerous episodes…

MOFFAT: Yeah. It threads the whole way through. But it does get there doesn’t it?

DEADLINE: That moment when the murderous parents Jimmy and Gina Baxter see Adam using his inhaler and everything unravels…have you as a writer and showrunner ever had an opportunity to use an inanimate object as effectively as that inhaler?

MOFFAT: Oh that’s a great question. Okay. So I think disappointingly for you the answer might be no. I think it might be the best use of an inanimate object that I can think of in my own writing career. It’s in the pilot. It’s central to the pilot right and again it makes it all the way through. It gets there. You know it’s there at the end and it’s important at the end. So maybe not. I’ve used inhalers before. I had an inhaler before. There’s an inhaler in The Night Of or Criminal Justice which became The Night Of.

DEADLINE: Can you encapsulate that look on the face of Michael watching the life leak out of the son he tried so hard to protect and the enormity of the realization that he had sold his soul and betrayed everyone he loved and now has nothing?

MOFFAT: I’m fortunate enough to be able to answer that really simply which is that we have playing that part in my view the best actor of his generation. Who is in that moment expressing something about as raw — the death of your child — and about as purely painful as anything I could imagine as a parent myself. And I think he does the job to perfection. It’s an extraordinary achievement on his part and I’m just very grateful that he was able to be there and do that for everybody.

DEADLINE: When you tripped up those stairs as this whole series began for you did you have it in mind then that Michael would have to lose everything despite his careful choreography?

MOFFAT: Definitely. Definitely. It’s partly because I’m English and I want to apologize for sounding too self-important. But Shakespeare’s always the guide. Shakespeare’s always the guide and if you can get King Lear on television then that should always be the ambition. You’ll always fall a long way short but he’s the guide and you know that’s what one’s always after. I’m always after thinking about how do you strip naked a human being who starts with lots of clothes on and what do you see when you see him naked in a storm with nothing right? What does that look like? And well I don’t apologize too much for that but you know what I’m saying.

DEADLINE: Aside from leaving the judge stripped naked how much did you lay track for perhaps another season of this show?

MOFFAT: No thought at all for laying track for another season of this show. If there are loose ends…I’m never unhappy about loose ends provided as you say that the main stuff is satisfied and the main architecture has been built constructed and loved. I don’t mind loose ends but there’s no planning which says let’s leave that open or let’s leave that open. That was never an intention in the writing of this.

DEADLINE: The Israeli show had a second season. Is there a desire for you to keep exploring these characters and this storyline in subsequent episodes? Your judge remains in the pocket of the devil. Does that intrigue you?

MOFFAT: The honest answer to that is what kind of writer would you be if you wrote and spent two and a half years working on something written 10 hours of television and hadn’t given another thought to what would happen if there were an episode 11 and beyond? You’d be a strange human being if you could just drop everybody at the end of 10 hours. So of course I’ve thought about it and of course I have several hundred good ideas but that’s a description of where I’m at in my head.

DEADLINE: So nothing solid about continuing?

MOFFAT: No. One last thing I want to say. I want to mention the score. I want to mention our composer Volker Bertelmann. At the end of Episode 1 we have some Mozart and at the end of Episode 10 we have the same Mozart right and you know Mozart is Mozart and you know Volker has a job of scoring a show which begins and ends with the greatest musical genius who’s ever lived. One of my favorite-ever moments in this whole experience was talking to Volker about how musically to bring us into the Marriage of Figaro which describe the last moments of Michael Desiato’s pain as we roll into the credits and there’s a tiny thing which you might not notice but he just ramps like a little bit of ramping that the last bit of his score that lifts you into the Mozart and it’s a kind of beautiful connection between somebody writing a score for a television series now and the greatest composer that’s ever lived. It’s a small thing not something that everybody will notice but it made me incredibly happy. It’s one of those tiny moments that you get in the construction of something as big as this that really delights and made it a real privilege to be a part of.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vd3RvbG92ZS5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy9yZWFsLWxpZmUvcmF5LWJheHRlci1iaWctYnJvdGhlci02Njc5Mi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Ray Baxter stepped back after appearing on Big Brother Australia,"Australia has a new celebrated vet in town – former Big Brother housemate Ray Baxter.

A chocolate milk-loving self-professed fitness fanatic who once set his sights on becoming a celebrity vet Dr Baxter turned his back on the TV spotlight for his love of family and dedication to his clients.

Dr Baxter 33 recently hit the national headlines again after coming to the rescue of an orphaned dog called Frankie.

The pooch was the only survivor in a horrific hit-and-run in Brisbane which killed Frankie’s owners Matty Field and his pregnant partner Kate Leadbetter.

With the local community out in force to locate the beloved pet Frankie was found in dense bushland the next day terrified and confused.

Taking on the distressed pup free of charge Dr Baxter who had known the couple for years has been applauded for his empathy and generosity at such a tragic time.

“Everyone’s really banded together to make sure she’s OK” he says.

Frankie suffers from Addison’s disease which means she requires daily medication and is now being cared for by Dr Baxter and his team at the SuperVets clinic.

“She didn’t get her medication for a good 12 hours or more. When she came in she was in a pretty unstable way” Dr Baxter told Seven News.

Dr Baxter rose to fame as a housemate on the family-friendly revamp of Big Brother in 2012.

The brief was to find lovable housemates to attract a PG audience and as an established vet adored by his patients Dr Baxter fit the bill perfectly.

The reality series kicked off with a twist –all housemates had a secret – and with Ray’s charming and outgoing persona no one suspected he had a chequered past.

The Brisbane vet entered the Big Brother house filled with anxiety as he worried his controversial confession would affect his business – that he had a few run-ins with the law when he was young.

But as Dr Baxter explained back in 2012 his juvenile mishaps were a powerful motivator in his desire for success.

His motivation for entering the Big Brother house was to put the wheels in motion to become the new presenter of Bondi Vet which at the time was looking for a replacement host as Dr Chris Brown was busy with other media opportunities.

Ray was in line to be the next Bondi Vet. (Instagram)

TV producers admitted that Ray was a good fit for the role.

“I just want to live life to the fullest and make the most of every breathing moment as it could be your last” he said back then.

However after experiencing a taste of the limelight with Big Brother Dr Baxter changed his mind and chose instead to focus on his work at Greencross Vets never forgetting his dream of owning his own practice one day.

He is now a proud dad. (Instagram)

With a mantra that “things in life have always happened for a reason” it seems he made the right choice as he “would never have met his wife Eliza and started a family” had he pursued a media career. What’s more he may never have opened his own vet clinic.

But while his true passion will always be animals Dr Baxter’s best role to date is being a dad to his kids – son Jai who was born in 2018 and new baby daughter Delilah.

Often proudly sharing his family photos on Instagram he has never really desired to go back into the spotlight after finding a deeper connection as a family man who truly loves his job.",,,,,,

The immigrant kid who bootstrapped his way into riches at Facebook Inc. made billions as a risk-hungry investor and became the pied piper of the current blank-check craze now envisions himself as nothing less than the Warren Buffett of the Reddit era.

“Nobody’s going to listen to Buffett"" Palihapitiya the founder of Social Capital said in a Bloomberg “Front Row"" interview. “But there has to be other folks that take that mantle take the baton and do it as well to this younger generation in the language they understand.""

The language of course is social media. That’s where the 44-year-old billionaire talks up his deals trolls the establishment and hypes “all things Chamath."" Recently he stoked speculation he might run for governor of California. Occasionally he tweets out shirtless selfies to his 1.3 million followers. His feed is a digital stream of consciousness.

With Twitter as his bullhorn Palihapitiya has become the undisputed king of special-purpose acquisition companies the hottest thing on Wall Street. Together with Ian Osborne a public-relations soothsayer turned financier he has sponsored six SPACs raised a total of $4.34 billion and acquired businesses in space travel health insurance financial services and real estate.

Lightning Rod

Along the way Palihapitiya has made a fortune for himself and his investors and helped whip up a frenzy that has everyone from Colin Kaepernick to former House Speaker Paul Ryan racing to market their own SPACs. He’s also a lightning rod for skeptics who pooh-pooh his success as the product of relentless self-promotion and see blank-check companies as proof of a bubble inflated by massive government money-printing.

If SPACs are emblematic of a speculative mania then Palihapitiya is the face of that moment.

Palihapitiya said anything that popular will lure its share of copycats and wannabes and inevitably many will fail. He’s confident his brand and investing acumen will not only make people rich but help democratize finance and level the playing field for ordinary investors.

Plus there’s that whole Buffett thing. He fancies growing his empire into a Berkshire Hathaway-esque conglomerate for the 21st century complete with investor conference calls an analyst day and its own must-attend annual meeting. All of which in his vision will generate enough wealth to shrink the inequality gap in America.

It’s pretty grandiose stuff.

“I do want to have a Berkshire-like instrument that is all things you know not to sound egotistical but all things Chamath all things Social Capital"" he said.

It was also Palihapitiya who took a leading role in the frenzy around so-called meme stocks tweeting on Jan. 26 that he’d bought GameStop Corp. call options and helping fuel its short-lived surge. He exited the trade before GameStop crashed making a $500000 profit he donated to charity.

Palihapitiya then joined Reddit’s WallStreetBets crowd in bashing short-sellers and denounced Robinhood Markets which temporarily limited purchases of meme stocks as a “bunch of corporatist scumbags.""

He acknowledges such rhetoric isn’t exactly Buffett-like. But then again perhaps that’s the point.

“Who I am is a byproduct of my generation and my media culture which is faceted -- not always great facets but multifaceted"" he said. “You have to speak in the language of the times in order to get your point across.""

SPAC Boom

Palihapitiya’s bro-ish manner -- cocksure and full of swagger -- isn’t for everyone. It’s arguably what caused his venture-capital firm to implode in 2018. But his SPACs have delivered results at least so far.

The first SPAC he raised with Osborne merged with Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic in 2019 and now trades at $59 up from the standard offering price of $10. His five others also are well above $10 including the two that haven’t announced acquisitions yet -- a testament to investors’ confidence and also to the central-bank largess that has inflated risk assets globally.

Critics contend SPACs are flawed and dangerous with incentives that overwhelmingly favor sponsors and insiders at the expense of individual investors. Palihapitiya says he’s working with Credit Suisse Group AG on ways to reduce share allocations to hedge funds and to allow retail money to participate in so-called PIPE financings.

“On the deals that I do I take a 20% carry and I think that I can find targets and find opportunities that will make that more than reasonable in the final analysis"" he said adding that in every one of his SPACs he has invested millions of dollars of his own money. The only reason he said he’ll ever sell any shares is to release cash for other endeavors.

Rise Fall and Rise

In Silicon Valley where his rise was meteoric and ultimately turbulent everyone knows who “Chamath"" is. It’s getting that way in financial circles too. Not quite a “Jamie"" or “Ray"" but on his way there.

Born in Sri Lanka Palihapitiya emigrated to Ottawa as a boy. He worked part-time at Burger King to help his parents make ends meet. After getting a degree in electrical engineering from the University of Waterloo and trading derivatives for a year he moved to California.

At Facebook his responsibilities included the nascent mobile business and international markets. He left in 2011 to found Social Capital and took early stakes in Slack and SurveyMonkey. Palihapitiya also bought part of the Golden State Warriors basketball team in 2011 Bitcoin in 2012 Amazon.com Inc. shares in 2014 and Tesla Inc.’s convertible debt in 2015.

And then it all seemed to fall apart. His marriage dissolved his key partners in Social Capital left and several investors balked at committing new funds. Many thought Palihapitiya had flamed out.

Three years later he’s bigger than ever.

Palihapitiya estimates his wealth at somewhere between $10 billion and $15 billion much more than public disclosures would suggest. Most of that -- the insurance software and health-care businesses he owns privately his SPACs the new seeding program he started for amateur money managers -- will become part of the holding company he’s modeling on Berkshire.

One of Palihapitiya’s slogans is that only two things matter: inequality and climate change. He said investing in solutions for both is his mission at Social Capital. That’s why he’s also making a “huge bet"" on securing critical supplies for lithium-ion batteries so the U.S. isn’t at China’s mercy in its efforts to tap green energy. He expects the effort to cost billions.

His populist appeal has won Palihapitiya millions of fans. Recently it lent credibility to the rumor he planned to run for governor. While Palihapitiya is upset about everything from taxes to crime rates in California and is funding the #RecallGavinNewsom effort he insists he has no intention of seeking office.

Instead he said he’ll back candidates who share his centrist ideals and eventually plans to spend “hundreds of millions a year"" building a machine that can rival the conservative influence of the Koch and Mercer families.

In the meantime Palihapitiya says he has no plans to “cut and run"" like the other billionaires fleeing his state including Tesla’s Elon Musk and Oracle Corp.’s Larry Ellison. His strategy: be loyal stay on brand hide nothing.

“I make better decisions when I am authentic and transparent"" he said. “The best way to do that is just to be living my life out for everybody to see.""

EUR/USD is categorized in the class of a risk asset and non USD currency.

EUR/USD’s early break to its 5 year average set remainder 27 currencies on a course of deep perspective as non USD currency pairs had to not only match EUR/USD’s break to significant averages but the 1000 pip rise in GBP/USD 700 for AUD/USD and other non USD currency pairs traded weekly from overbought to overbought and a non normal price circumstance. EUR/USD’s break threw normal price markets deeply off course since August 2020.

Non USD currency pairs such as DXY USD/CAD USD/CHF and USD/JPY only option since August 2020 was to concur with EUR/USD and non USD rises by trading deeply oversold week to week and to break 5 and 10 year averages.

DXY for example just broke above its 10 year average at 89.95 and contains a long way to travel to the 5 year average at 95.00’s.

Today markets are ready to slowly embark on a deep 3 and 500 pip correction as currency prices traded to lowest and highest depths of oversold and overbought. This will take time as highlighted in the January 3rd post to long term forecasts because currency prices remain in 3 and 400 pip trading ranges and contained within vital breaks to 5 and 10 year averages. No better time than the present to position for the impending correction.

A correction means a break of 5 and 10 year averages to only trade in new 3 and 400 pip trade ranges as markets and all financial instruments range far more than trend. Consider EUR/USD’s 1000 pip rise from 1.1300 to 1.2300 by 166 pips per month for 6 months. The same similarities exist among all currency prices.

With U.S. equity indexes rising to fresh records again this week one of Warren Buffett ’s most-famous catchphrases comes to mind: Investors should “be fearful when others are greedy.”Any Buffett disciple who checks in on the billionaire investor’s favorite market valuation metric these days may get the urge to shriek in terror.The “Buffett Indicator” is a simple ratio: The total market capitalization of U.S. stocks divided by the total dollar value of the nation’s gross domestic product. It first crossed above its previous dot-com era peak in 2019. Still it has been trending higher for decades and if there’s one mantra investors love even more than Buffett’s it’s “the trend is your friend.”However in recent weeks even that long-term trend fails to justify the metric’s frothy appearance. With U.S. market cap more than double the level of estimated GDP for the current quarter the ratio has surged to the highest-ever reading above its long-term trend according to an analysis by the blog Current Market Valuation suggesting a “strongly overvalued” situation.Of course with the Federal Reserve holding rates near zero and buying bonds for the foreseeable future and an abundance of savings and fiscal stimulus set to trigger blockbuster growth in GDP and corporate earnings it’s fair to wonder if this is yet another of the many false alarms that have sounded during the past decade.“It highlights the remarkable mania we are witnessing in the U.S. equity market” said Michael O’Rourke chief market strategist at JonesTrading. “Even if one expected those (Fed) policies to be permanent which they should not be it still would not justify paying two times the 25-year average for stocks.”This detachment of the Buffett indicator from its long-term trend joins an assortment of other valuation metrics that have exceeded their previous records in the rebound from the pandemic-induced bear market last year -- if not years earlier. Price-to-earnings price-to-sales and price-to-tangible-book value are among the metrics firmly above dot-com era levels that many investors assumed were once-in-a-lifetime peaks.Rising valuations are famously bad tools for timing market tops. Indeed all tools are. For now many investors are confident to bet that the recovery from the pandemic will boost some of the denominators in ratios like these so they’re not letting valuations scare them off. The S&P 500 gained 1.2 per cent for the week to close at a record amid a pickup in vaccine distributions and progress on a new fiscal stimulus package. Energy the best-performing sector this year led the advance adding 4.3 per cent.Meanwhile the yield on 10-year Treasuries hit 1.20 per cent on Friday the highest since the pandemic-induced crash last year. Interest rates are still unlikely to be approaching a level that would undermine the bull case for stocks given the S&P 500’s earnings yield is 3.1 per cent. Speaking to the Economic Club of New York this week Fed Chair Jerome Powell re-emphasized that the central bank’s stimulative policies will not be dialed back anytime soon.“When you compare it to fixed income markets and with the rates where they are the earnings yield for stocks is still positive” said Anu Gaggar senior global investment analyst for Commonwealth Financial Network. “And now with the Fed keeping rates at these low levels that just gives comfort to the market.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9rZW5kYWxsLWplbm5lci1yZXNwb25kcy1oZXItc2tpbXMtMTczNjAwMjA1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kendall Jenner Responds to a Comment That Her Skims Lingerie Photo Causes Body Insecurity,"From ELLE

On Friday Kendall Jenner posted behind-the-scenes images and videos from a photoshoot for her sister Kim Kardashian's shapewear company Skims.

After seeing the photos one of her fans tweeted ""I got 99 problems and looking like Kendall Jenner would solve all of them.""

Jenner saw the tweet and retweeted to tell the commenter that she has her own struggles too:

""i am an extremely lucky girl. appreciative of all that i have. but i want you to know i have bad days too and that i hear you! you are beautiful just the way you are!!! it's not always as perfect as it may seem.""

""YESSSS MA’AM 🔥🔥🔥"" Jenner responded.

In the past Jenner has spoken out about her own body confidence especially when it comes to comparing herself to her sisters.

""My sisters are a lot curvier than me"" Kendall said in an interview with The Telegraph. ""They have boobs and I don't have boobs. Growing up being this little twiggy girl I saw my sisters and always thought 'oh no am I supposed to be more sexy like them?' I almost felt like I didn't fit in for a part of my life.""

She added that she eventually got over those insecurities and she's accepted that she and her sisters are different in their personalities too.

""I like that I have a different vibe to everyone"" she said. ""I like to do different things. And that's okay.""

“There's good evidence to say: ‘Yeah this is a bold policy but it's not as risky as some people think’” Michael Reich a minimum wage expert at the University of California Berkeley told Yahoo Finance.

Opponents of a $15 hike argue that the cost is too steep and the higher minimum would destroy jobs by hammering the businesses that are already struggling amid the pandemic-induced recession.

“If it cost businesses more to hire people” Yahoo Finance columnist Rick Newman recently wrote “they’ll hire fewer workers and invest more in labor-saving technology.”

While there would be labor costs for businesses to manage research co-authored by Reich found that higher minimum wages did not generally lead to “adverse effects on employment weekly hours or annual weeks worked” but did lead to “substantial declines in household and child poverty.”

A recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report revealed that a federal minimum wage increase to $15 by 2025 would benefit an estimated 27 million workers and lift 900000 out of poverty (while increasing the deficit by $54 billion and eliminating 1.4 million jobs over four years).

""Eight out of 10 people live paycheck to paycheck"" Joe Sanberg a progressive activist and entrepreneur who served as a surrogate for Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign told Yahoo Finance. ""We should organize around electing people to every level of political office — from city council all the way to the president — who... will deliver for all of those eight out of 10 Americans.""

Goldman Sachs analysts recently estimated that a federal minimum wage rise to $15 an hour would impact about 30% of workers in the U.S. most of whom have household incomes below $50000.

UC Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education found that $15 an hour would mean 23 million Americans would see a “direct boost” in pay a boon to many amid the pandemic and resulting recession.

‘The U.S. economy is a consumer economy’

Americans overwhelmingly favor raising the federal minimum wage which was last increased in 2009.

And many cities and states have enacted their own hikes including Republican-leaning states like Florida. A majority of states in the U.S. now decree a minimum wage above $7.25.

""What's most compelling is logic that we can all embrace"" Sanberg said. ""The U.S. economy is a consumer economy — 70% of the economy is made up of consumption. But the problem we've had now for 40 years is that the people who need to buy things don't have any money... that's a very basic recipe that all of us who understand subtraction addition multiplication division can recognize as a suboptimal recipe for growth.""

Story continues

If the status quo of $7.25 per hour as the federal minimum continues he added ""there’s going to be a continuation of political upheaval until that game stops.""

When adjusted for inflation the minimum wage has not kept pace with the cost of living in many parts of the country. Meanwhile corporate profits have surged since the last recession.

“The minimum wage was first put in place in the United States in 1938 during the Great Depression” UC Berkeley Labor Center Chair Ken Jacobs told Yahoo Finance Live. “There was a real understanding at the time that an economic downturn is an important time to undergird and set a strong floor for wages to keep families' income and to keep workers' incomes up and to stop a ruinous drive down.”

Consequently Jacobs stressed raising the minimum wage is a policy tool “you should have during economic downturns as a way to raise people up and get the economy going again. I think the argument for not doing it in this period is mistaken.”

While the minimum wage has multiplied by 18 times where it was in 1947 corporate profits have climbed 202 times according to this chart by Deutsche Bank.

‘I've done a lot of these cross-state comparisons’

Several cities in California in particular offer minimum wages higher than $15: Mountain View and Sunnyvale both mandate a minimum wage of $16.30.

A federal minimum wage hike to $15 would affect a large share of workers in the South according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) a left-leaning think tank.

“I've done a lot of these cross-state comparisons... [and] there's no room for compromise on having a regional differential” Reich said. “You want to get above the poverty level in West Virginia or Alabama.”

But data aside the decision then comes down to political will.

Goldman Sachs analysts noted that the “odds of an increase to $15 are low” adding that a “compromise at $10-11 implemented no faster than $1 per year appears to be more politically realistic.”

Nevertheless new Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has repeatedly indicated his intention to fight for $15 by 2025.

In response to the CBO report Sanders stated that they “are never going to get 10 Republicans to increase the minimum wage through ‘regular order’” so the “only way to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour now is to pass it with 51 votes through budget reconciliation.” (Budget reconciliation is a process that expedites the passage of certain types of spending legislation.)

“Joe Biden was selected with a 7 million person majority” Robert Reich who served as labor secretary under President Bill Clinton told Yahoo Finance. “The House and the Senate... are both under the control of the Democrats. If we can't get a minimum wage increase through at the start of a new Democratic administration when you have both houses of Congress under the control of Democrats when can you?”

Correction: A previous version of this article listed the report on the effect of a minimum wage on 23 million Americans as affiliated with Institute for Research on Labor and Employment. This is incorrect. The report was by the UC Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education. We regret the error.

The term small cap can be used to define established companies with a small market capitalization ranging anywhere between $300 million and $2 billion. While we define the term healthcare as an organization that provides medical care and attention to an individual. In a recent article we covered the Top 10 Large-Cap Healthcare Stock to Buy Now.

Investing in small-cap stocks can be tricky. Risk and volatility are inevitable. However the fact that these stocks have a smaller size may mean more room for upside potential given the circumstances. For instance the average return for the Russell 2000 is 15% in the year after a presidential election since 1980. Which is around 4% better than the large-cap stocks. Small caps also tend to outperform large caps when coming out of an economic recession and when expectations of economic growth go from bad to less bad and eventually to good the greater economic sensitivity given by small caps can be helpful to a more rapid recovery.

15 Best Small-Cap Healthcare Stocks to Buy

On the other hand investing in healthcare stocks can be very rewarding given the significance it has to the economy. In the US the healthcare sector will account for 19.4% of GDP in 2027. The number is an increase from 17.9% in 2017. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exemplified the importance of the healthcare sector in finding solutions to ending the pandemic. According to an article from the Health System Tracker healthcare workers now account for a larger share of the employed workforce which went from 10.8% in February up to 11.5% in May.

The Biden Administration commits to the Affordable Care Act which will add Medicare-like public options that will allow a greater number of consumers to receive health insurance. We also like small-cap healthcare stocks (like biotech or gene technology stocks) because that's where a large number of cutting edge research is done. Combining small-cap stocks that have the possibility for major growth and health care stocks that provide innovative solutions to the economy today may be one of the solutions to a portfolio with great growth potential.

In order to identify the 15 Best Small-Cap Healthcare Stocks to Buy we started with the 73 holdings in the PSCH- Invesco S&P SmallCap Health Care ETF as of February 5 2021 and we were able to narrow down our list to 15 stocks using the hedge fund sentiment data.

“Mednax is a business that I have followed for many years. The crown jewel is the pediatric business in which the company provides physician staffing to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and related specialties at various hospitals. It’s a business with a strong competitive advantage given the company’s dominant position very inelastic demand and limited reimbursement risk. The pediatric business has moderate organic growth characteristics which the prior management supplemented with many tuck-in acquisitions over the years. These acquisitions leveraged the back office scale while allowing the local physician groups’ autonomy of operation. Unfortunately the company eventually ran out of meaningful acquisitions to make in this space and the old management was unsatisfied with simply running a very entrenched high ROIC and FCF business and returning capital to shareholders. Instead they took on extra debt to pursue growth through acquisitions in what they considered to be adjacencies: first in anesthesiology and then in radiology. Not surprisingly these adventures outside the company’s area of core competitive advantage didn’t go well. Debt piled up far faster than profits. This led to an activist investor nominating directors to the board and then the board replacing the CEO. The new CEO was previously the CEO of Quality Care Properties. This was a company where he improved performance over this 2-year tenure and which he then sold at an attractive price. His first steps at Mednax were simple: sell off the non-core divisions and reduce debt. I made the investment after the sales were completed leading to a clean balance sheet and the company returning to its roots as a pediatric-centered company. This company doesn’t screen well to many investors since its historical financials are messy and are obscured by the old businesses (now sold) and the seemingly large debt pile (already reduced). This is a perfect set-up: the nature of the business is different than what most investors believe it to be based on a superficial assessment. The new management is now focused on improving efficiencies and running the core business better. I would not be surprised if the ultimate plan were to sell the company in a few years at a nice profit. However I am not banking on that and would be equally happy if management just executes on its low-risk plan of running the business well within its area of competitive advantage. I purchased the stock at less than 10x normalized EPS for a business that I believe is likely to grow mid-single digits long-term. I paid ~ 65% of my base case value with ~ 35% downside to my worst case. I believe the Business Quality to be Excellent (1 out of 5) Management Quality to be Above Average (2 out of 5) and Balance Sheet to be Above Average (2 out of 5). In the short-term birth-rates a key driver of demand are likely to be negative. This may create quarters where the company reports results lower than Wall Street expectations. I am not at all concerned or deterred by that. If anything I would be happy to add to the position if such an event occurs and the market over-reacts given our long-term investment horizon.”

-Market structure changes so that vets give up on selling drugs to consumers cede that business to others like Chewy’s and increase prices for their services to maintain practice profitability

-Consolidating suppliers squeeze the economics out of the distribution business

-Vets prove more resistant to adopting Vets First Choice software and the majority never reach the revenue potential that it offers.”

When they first started populating our streets these motorized scooters came at a premium. However as more and more have been adopted we've seen prices fall considerably in the last year.

That means you'll find an electric scooter for as little as $179.99 this weekend. The Hover-1 Gambit is taking a $70 discount from a $249.99 MSRP to get there making for a particularly compelling entry level offer.

However if you're after a little more juice you'll find the Hover-1 Alpha available for $379.99 (was $399.99). With a 12 mile range and 17.4mph max speed there's plenty of power underneath that deck and an extra $20 off makes an already impressive price even more appealing.

Of course premium electric scooter deals do still exist but with nearly $150 off this Segway Ninebot ES2-N has dropped well below its $649.99 MSRP. You'll find it for just $506.99 in Best Buy's Presidents' Day sales right now.

You'll find all these electric scooter deals just below but be sure to check out all the other Presidents' Day sales happening this weekend as well.

They were run by executives who were proudly capitalist and believed in the country’s founding principles.

No longer it seems. Big businesses’ support of green-energy legislation various social-justice edicts and the silencing of right-wingers on Twitter have become so routine it’s almost not news anymore.

The question is why? People who work at these companies regularly complain to me that most employees view their employers’ new corporate leftism with disdain. They believe it’s a nuisance pushed by a vocal fringe of the workforce.

Companies cave they say because they just don’t need the hassle of explaining to the left-wing business media why they’re not supporting AOC’s Green New Deal.

The conventional wisdom among economic conservatives I speak to is that corporate America’s wokeness can’t last forever because in the long run it’s unprofitable. Example: Ratings for the social-justice-posturing NFL were weak all year as was this year’s Super Bowl. That means the NFL will have to go back to football.

If Nike sales decline amid the sneaker brand’s embrace of the ultimate social-justice warrior former NFL QB ­Colin Kaepernick the founder of the down-on-one-knee movement market forces will likely prod the company in a new direction.

That’s why the NBA — another big business — just made the pre-game national anthem mandatory after one of its owners liberal tech entrepreneur Mark Cuban enraged many fans by pulling it from the start of Mavericks games.

Remember 74.2 million consumers voted for Donald Trump in part because they can’t tolerate virtue signaling being thrown in their faces every minute of their lives.

All of which makes sense until you understand the left-wing forces that have assembled to transform corporate America into something resembling the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. The left might hate capitalism but it has been busy implementing capitalist tools to bend big business to its will.

Changes in the money management business underscore just how successful the left has become. Shareholder votes once focused on prosaic topics such as approving mergers or rubberstamping CEO pay or changes in leadership.

Today they’re fraught affairs where companies are getting bombarded by demands for corporate diversity (more women minorities and transgender people in positions of power) green energy and overt support of what the left calls social justice.

OK corporate diversity is a worthy goal. But since when were many shareholders looking to invest for retirement so concerned about whether they were holding stock in a company that supports eliminating greenhouse emissions or canceling Columbus Day?

Answer: When those shareholders became progressive activists who learned how to influence money managers to tout politics instead of profits.

Proxy advisory firms are hired by big money managers to provide guidance on various corporate-governance issues and shareholder votes. That makes the advisory firms very powerful since most Americans invest through mutual funds and other managed accounts.

And it’s no secret that the progressive-left agenda has gained support from these outfits in recent years. With that trillions of dollars in shareholder votes from ­places like Larry Fink’s BlackRock and Vanguard are now openly supporting left-wing causes.

You might say these firms are pushing an agenda that’s based on rigorous analysis. Some studies show that corporate diversity leads to higher profits. Global warming could destroy the economy.

It’s easy for companies to join the leftist mob when it comes to favoring the Green New Deal — until it actually kills jobs like President Joe Biden canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline. The Bismarck Tribune via AP

Studies also show the opposite — that diversity has no impact on profits. Global warming is real but not the immediate existential threat that requires us to kill jobs by killing the Keystone XL Pipeline during a pandemic recession.

But the power of the left is hard to ignore. They find common ground with public pension funds run by liberal politicians who also want to sway corporate behavior leftward.

It wasn’t so long ago when companies used to ignore the investor crank who bought one share of stock and came to shareholders meetings to lob insane questions at the CEO. Money managers and proxy firms weren’t swayed by outside forces to vote a certain way.

But most shareholder votes now involve progressive edicts under the guise of so-called Environmental Social Governance investing. ESG as it is known on Wall Street is a way to measure everything from a firm’s compliance with green-energy initiatives to its embrace of causes such as Black Lives Matter.

The average retail investors in mutual funds have no say or vote in this vast transformation even as their money is being used for political purposes. The fund is responding to the vocal minority that figured out how the game is played.

Vincent Harinam a law- enforcement consultant and Ph.D. candidate at the University of Cambridge in an article last July on the Web site Quillette wrote: “When it comes to the culture wars the goal of a corporation is not to maximize profits but to minimize losses.”

That means constantly appeasing the vocal and organized minority and corporate America’s lurch to the left won’t end anytime soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2dhbWluZy93b3ctY2xhc3NpYy1wcmUtcmFpZC1nZWFyLWd1aWRlLWJpcy_SAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5kaWdpdGFsdHJlbmRzLmNvbS9nYW1pbmcvd293LWNsYXNzaWMtcHJlLXJhaWQtZ2Vhci1ndWlkZS1iaXMvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to gear up for your first WoW Classic raid,"World of Warcraft Classic returned players to the roots of the MMO-RPG they fell in love with over a decade ago. After grinding through the early to mid-stages of the game players have finally hit the level 60 cap. Now the fun begins. Players can finally dip their toes into the next stage of the game — raids. These missions reach a new level of difficulty one you’ve yet to experience in World of Warcraft Classic. Hopefully you’ve explored some of the best add-ons World of Warcraft has to offer and found decent pre-raid gear. The best gear though is hidden deep in these heavily guarded raid dungeons. You’ll need a skilled team a coordinated strategy and the following gear to find success in World of Warcraft Classic raids.

The sheer volume of talent tree combinations will make this guide quite extensive. Just scroll down to find your class and you’ll see the entry-level armor sets for each class’s viable roles that should help you make your entrance into the raid scene. From then on it’s a semi-natural progression to greater gear. The gear choices here are by no means the best you can get. This isn’t a BiS guide. They merely represent the more easily obtained and suitable options to get you going. Most come from dungeon bosses and high-level quests so we’ve tried to include as little dungeon variance as possible to make it a simple matter of repeated runs through two or three instances.

Unlike retail WoW Warriors can tank in any number of ways. There’s the staple sword and board method but it’s also entirely possible to dual-wield for the added rage generation. Arms Fury and Protection all work here in different ways so gearing up can be a bit of a mixed bag.

Hunter pre-raid gear guide

Hunters are fairly straight-forward when it comes to gearing. Their sole role as fantastic damage dealers means a focus on purely offensive stats. The desire for 9% increased Hit remains from other classes so stack for that from the get-go. Then work to avoid it in other gear slots.

Druid pre-raid gear guide

Druids are the most versatile and fluid classes in World of Warcraft Classic by a long shot. They can imitate the playstyles of other classes at will.

Two-Hand: Rod of the Ogre Magi (Dire Maul)

Mage pre-raid gear guide

Fantastic damage-dealers in their own right Mages have a few noteworthy problems in Classic WoW. They’re forced by element-immune content to swap from Fire to Ice specs to deal any actual damage. Arcane isn’t good enough to compete either. The strange design oversight makes for a very limited class in end-game content but one that’s relatively easy to gear for.

Two-Hand: Rod of the Ogre Magi (Dire Maul)

Priest pre-raid gear guide

Priests utilize Shadow and Destruction magicks to deal damage and invoke Holy incantations to heal allies. They’re typically used as primary healers but their respectable damage output through hard-hitting spells and DoT ticks can quickly earn them a DPS spot in a group.

Warlock pre-raid gear guide

Warlocks deal damage through a mixture of spells and demonic monsters summoned to their side. Whether it’s an Imp Voidwalker or Succubus they’re nothing without their trusty companion – but Warlock gear doesn’t really care which beast you bring to the fight it’s all about extra shadow damage from spells. Just be ready to bank on some random stat rolls.

Rogue pre-raid gear guide

Rogues pride themselves on swift and stealthy kills in PvP but there’s little chance of killing a raid boss in 2 seconds flat just by shanking them in the back. Similar to the Feral DPS Druid Agility plays a major part in Rogue DPS. They want fast precise strikes to build and spend energy.

Shaman pre-raid gear guide

Exclusive to the Horde as their answer to the Paladin the Shaman fills a similar set of roles. They make decent off-healers in raids and dungeons can damage with the best of them thanks to unique weapon enhancements and can tank the occasional dungeon up until around level 40 if need be.

Closing Thoughts

A guide as broad as this is subject to change quite a bit as World of Warcraft Classic goes through its various content release phases. The release of Dire Maul in mid-October has already mixed things up a bit when it comes to optimal and easily obtained pre-raid gear.

Again this stuff isn’t the absolute best pre-raid gear you can get for each class but it represents a grind-minimized route without too much bought-for or rare world drop stuff. Just grab this gear and enchant it with whatever is good for your class and you should be set to take on entry-level raids for even better gear.

PNM supporters celebrate with Kelvon Morrison on nomination day for the THA election on January 4. Morrison won the Black Rock/Whim/Spring Garden district the January 25 election which ended in the six-six deadlock. File photo -

The Tobago House of Assembly (THA) may not be properly constituted but this has not stopped new assemblyman Kelvon Morris from fulfilling his responsibilities as the area representative for the Black Rock/Whim/Spring Garden electoral district.

Morris who contested and won the seat on the on a PNM ticket in the January 25 THA election told Sunday Newsday he has begun serving the residents in the large electoral district in keeping with the promises he made during the campaign.

He said in keeping with his pledges to remain “accessible inclusive and represent with passion” he has already established a 24/7 district help desk to facilitate direct contact.

Morris said the desk will allow residents the opportunity to log issues/concerns make recommendations and have real time responses.

He said he has also launched a clothing and food bank to assist the less fortunate residents in the district as well as those who have been severely affected by the covid19 pandemic.

“We are in the process of setting up an online registry so residents can simply make requests via online visits to the district office community walkabouts or via referral.”

Morris said he has also set up a skills database registry to assist residents especially youths with capacity-building and job opportunities.

Saying community walkabouts are ongoing Morris said he also meets with stakeholders to outline priorities for the way forward.

He said an appreciation to thank and recognise key stakeholders in the electoral district was held on February 6.

The former Bishop’s High School student who replaced former chief secretary Kelvin Charles as area representative said he intends to tackle unemployment and housing for young professionals during his stewardship.

Morris is one of six PNM candidates who won their seats in the recent THA election. The Progressive Democratic Patriots also won six seats.

But the THA remains in deadlock after both parties rejected on three occasions the candidates either side nominated for presiding officer.

In the House of Representatives on Friday the Prime Minister laid the Tobago House of Assembly (Amendment) Bill 2021 which proposes that three more seats be added to the existing 12 in order to break the deadlock.

It also proposes the holding of fresh elections in cases where no THA is installed within 14 days after an election is held.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZG9uZWdhbG5ld3MuY29tL3doYXQtaGFwcGVuZWQtdGhlLWNyZWVzbG91Z2gtbWFuLXdoby1sZWZ0LXNjaG9vbC1lYXJseS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What happened the Creeslough man who left school early?,"

THE founder of an Irish pharmaceutical services company which has begun trials on a new Covid-19 nasal spray vaccine is Donegal man Cathal Friel.

Mr Friel (57) from Creeslough was a finalist in the International category as part of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year 2020.

He left school after his Junior Cert to work in the family business before going back to education. He completed a City and Guilds Cert in Basic Computer Programming in Letterkenny RTC (LYIT) at night classes and got an MBA from the University of Ulster in 1990.

He spent the following five years lecturing part-time in International Marketing and Business Planning at the University of Ulster while running his own new technology services business.

He would then spend a year back-packing his way around the globe before coming back to Dublin where he was part of the team that successfully established Merrion Stockbrokers in 2001. Six years later he founded Raglan Capital.

Today he is the Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of Open Orphan plc and employs 365 people.

“It’s certainly been a bit of a journey. The moral of my story is that while you don’t need a Leaving Cert to become a university lecturer you do need a third level qualification to get on in the new world. New Leaving Cert

“The new Leaving Cert is a degree while the new degree is a masters preferably in a completely different discipline” he said.

Living in Blackrock with his wife Pamela Iyre and their three children Narayan (13) Hari (11) and Devi (8) he likes nothing better than getting back to Portnablagh for two weeks every summer.

“At any given point in the year I’m counting down the days until I’m back home. We take a house in Portnablagh my sister takes one next door and we spend two weeks together every year.”

‘Friel’s of Creeslough’

Cathal’s late father John was a successful businessman running the Ford garage ‘Friel’s of Creeslough’ while together with his wife Tessie he developed an Adventure Sports Centre and Creeslough Holiday Cottages.

“I suppose it was the first real property boom – the late seventies – and not long after they expanded the business the interest rates jumped from six or seven per-cent up to 15 or 16 per cent. Dad had borrowed the money before he took sick. Six older brothers and sisters had gone off the college and here I was a sixteen-year-old meeting the bank manager with my mum. I quit school in a bid to help keep the show on the road” he recalled.

“Looking back it was probably the best life lesson I could have got – trying to manage a ton of debt. People talk abut the crash of 2008 and ‘09 but many forget there was also one thirty years earlier” he added.

After discovering the internet during his ‘gap-year’ he moved to Dublin and got involved in the software industry before setting up a Venture Capital Company two years later called Powerscourt Investment. He then helped to establish Merrion Stockbrokers in Dublin.

“It was my job to buy and sell companies and we specialised in buying and selling a lot of family-owned local newspapers radio stations and software companies.

“I remember selling the Sligo Champion for €24 million one year and the new owners offering to sell it back to me for just €2 million a year later. It was a crazy time” he said.

“I would also have sold Highland Radio Today FM and FM 104 on behalf of Scottish Radio Holdings” he added.

Eland Technologies

Mr Friel was involved in the sale of Eland Technologies to SITA.

“I remember that their COO was Michael Cunningham from Kilcar and he persuaded Richard Stokes Senior VP at SITA to bring the company to Donegal. He drove Richard up to Donegal himself to see the county and if it wasn’t for Michael they wouldn’t be in Letterkenny today” he said.

Cathal Friel founded Raglan Capital in 2007 before setting up Fastnet Oil & Gas plc in 2011.

He also co-founded Amryt Pharma plc in 2015 along with Joe Wiley which has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since 2016 and which listed on Nasdaq in July 2020. Prior to Amryt he founded Fastnet Oil & Gas plc in 2011 which he IPO’d on the London stock exchange.

“I’ve managed to retain Raglan as an advisory business to assist people looking to make investments” he said.

“Amryt was a high risk high reward business whereas Open Orphan operates as a pharmaceutical services company with a focus on virology vaccine studies and orphan drugs in the United Kingdom Ireland France the Netherlands Germany and Singapore.

In December 2019 Open Orphan merged with UK-based Hvivo – a clinical trial business – in a £30 million takeover.

“They were the world leader in vaccine testing but the minute we acquired the company the share price fell. Then along comes the pandemic the share price goes up five times and the rest is history” he said.

“We hired 120 people in the last six months and we now employ 365” he added.

Recently Open Orphan started trials on the next generation of Covid-19 vaccines a nasal spray from US company Codagenix.

“Potentially the vaccine we are testing will give you seven years protection against Covid. It doesn’t need needles and it doesn’t need to be deep frozen. It’s still early days yet and there’s another year’s work to do but it’s an exciting project” he said.

In October Open Orphan signed a contract with the British Government to carry out what are known as human challenge trials for Covid-19.

Human challenge trials involve volunteers being purposely infected with the relevant virus. To date this has only been done with viruses other than coronavirus such as influenza.

“It is quite controversial because instead of making people sick with influenza we are planning on making people sick with Covid-19.

“However by doing so we can save a pharma company €150 million by spending €4 million to €5 million with us. That is the magic of challenge studies” he explained.

The company is still awaiting regulatory approval before it can carry out these kind of trials on Covid-19 in Britain.

“At the moment we’re all going to be taking Covid jabs this summer and we’ll be back again for more of the same next year. Hopefully if we can get this approved and across the line it will mean going to your GP once every seven years or so for the vaccine” he said.

Work habits

The pandemic has changed people’s work habits and Mr Friel believes that that can only be beneficial for rural counties like Donegal.

“It has shown that you don’t have to spend all your time in Dublin and added to Brexit it can only help Donegal’s economy.

“Brexit is one of the greatest things that has happened this country. London had become a European hub with everyone gravitating towards there but in more recent times thousands of jobs have quietly come to Dublin and Ireland.

“One simple example is Tik Tok a Chinese company which would have had close connections with Britain while another WuXi bought GMI (Geonomics Medicine Ireland) for €540m and has since set up two vaccine manufacturing plants in Dundalk as they still need access to Europe.”Mr Friel has also noticed a lot of financial institutions setting up bases in Dublin.

“Many of these jobs will soon start to move around the country.

“Northern Ireland will do better than the south because it’s still in the UK and the EU while Donegal will also get its share of jobs” the Creeslough man added.

United Airlines resumed flying the Boeing 737 Max on Thursday after a 23-month hiatus that began in March 2019 when the aircraft was grounded worldwide.

The first flight departed from Denver International Airport with just under 170 passengers including United's chief operating officer Jonathan Roitman in the first step towards reestablishing consumer confidence for an aircraft family that's killed 346 passengers. In total Thursday saw 24 departures just six fewer than the same day in 2019 one month before the aircraft's grounding.

United follows American Airlines — which began flying the Max in December 2020 — as the second US airline to return the Max to passenger service. By the end of March as more aircraft arrive from Boeing United will use the Max for as many as 98 daily flights from bases in Denver and Houston Cirium data shows.

The Federal Aviation Administration ungrounded the aircraft in November 2020 after mandating fixes to the aircraft's software and systems that caused the two crashes. United pilots now also receive four hours of simulator training and three hours of computer-based training specific to the aircraft before climbing in the cockpit a requirement that wasn't in place during the aircraft's initial debut.

Step Up. Make the Change. Presented by The Boeing Company,"Eggs bacon cereal and muffins with coffee were the food of choice for watching this morning’s Historically Black College and University (HBCU) Engineering Dean Recognition Awards.

During the two-hour digital ceremony it was a treat to see past winners of the Black Engineer of the Year Award (BEYA) make presentations to scientists and engineers leading innovation with incredible inventions patents and product development. Engineering deans from the 15 ABET-accredited engineering schools also spoke about their artificial intelligence machine learning and quantum computing research.

This year’s hosts were national broadcaster Angela Stribling and Dr. Pamela McCauley an entrepreneur and professor in the North Carolina State University Wilson College of Textiles where she also serves as associate dean of academic programs. The two emcees kept the show lively with fun quizzes based on memorable moments and milestones from the conference’s 35-year history.

‘Leveraging talent’

One of BEYA’s longtime sponsors has been The Boeing Company. The corporation has leveraged the talents of hundreds of thousands of people across the United States for more than 100 years.

On Saturday five Boeing executives sat down in a digital fireside chat to address the internal and external crises that coincided in 2020. Joining the panel was J. Murray Gibson engineering dean of the Florida A&M and Florida State universities.

The panel talked about how they deal with the pandemic dilemmas of the digital world economic uncertainty racial injustice and social unrest. According to the moderator these crises impact industry communities and culture overall and brought to attention issues that had been ignored or neglected. As leaders within Boeing and academia the panel discussed how they are stepping into action to make a change.

Delores Alexander joined Boeing in 1987 as an entry-level contract negotiator and is now a multi-billion-dollar negotiator. Long familiar with society’s biases on color race or gender she has spoken about working twice as hard for equity.

Having tough conversations is needed and expected said Matt Daniels a Boeing senior manager. He acknowledged that these discussions could be challenging. Still he noted the significant steps the company has taken in making investments in local communities and institutions such as historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU).

J. Murray Gibson of the Florida A&M and Florida State engineering school the only joint college which focuses on minority students in its recruitment and retention efforts said it was important to talk about institutional and systemic inequities and the underlying issues.

Racism prejudice intolerance: ‘Why is it happening?’

Talking about her experience in the continental U.S.A Marvi Matos said “the first thing you encounter as someone from Puerto Rico is an adjustment from being invisible to being visible because of your accent. You have to endure comments subtle or not so subtle that undermine” said the director of engineering.

Matos first joined Boeing in 2010. After six years she left the company but returned after three years. She studied chemical engineering at the University of Puerto Rico and got her Ph.D. in chemical engineering at Carnegie Mellon.

‘Code-switching’

Over her 20-year career at Boeing Charlisha “Charli” Greene who moderated Saturday’s event has held several positions including supply chain site leader for aircraft modernization and modifications and chief of staff for the vice president and general manager of Integrated Logistics. She has also served in Boeing’s Enterprise Auditor leadership development program. Additionally Greene is the university relations executive focal for Florida A&M University.

Greene asked the panel about “code-switching” in corporate America. According to the Harvard Business Review code-switching or behavior adjustment has long been a strategy for Black people to navigate interracial interactions. But studies have shown significant implications for well-being economic advancement and even physical survival.

Philip June who is vice president of safety and quality for Boeing Global Services said he did not know what the term ‘psychological safety’ meant before last year.

“You try to fit in change the way you speak” he said. “The whole point of communication is how you show up” he added. “But trying to keep up a facade means people lose productivity in assimilation” June said. He noted that Boeing management has an expectation that business is imperative so work must be about creating safe spaces for people to get ideas forward.

Matos agreed. She said she could not understand why some people think they had to lower standards instead of widening the talent pool because they must provide equal opportunity.

Murray said it was important for middle managers and executives to understand equity was not giving someone an ‘extra chance’ or being unfair to one group. There are historical barriers and HBCUs still experience inequities in funding thus limiting the opportunity to grow. “Undergrads need exposure but HBCUs have been held back” he added.

‘Getting exposure’

Since students at FAMU-FSU spend time studying in diverse environments hiring corporations and agencies must believe in diversity; take the programs they have and look at them objectively. He also said FAMU-FSU is not only focused on helping students settle into internships far from their hometowns in Miami Florida but the college is also recruiting students from places like Seattle Washington.

As a strategic position leader Matt Daniels said mutual respect was essential to Boeing employees to advance a global diverse team. He said that although society must do better as a whole he works at Boeing because it promotes diversity allows him to work with others and is aligned with his values and ethics of hard work integrity and respect. Coming up to the first anniversary of the covid-19 outbreak the panel agreed that Boeing had provided a platform for honest discussion.

Not every airline wants to admit it,"Still some reticence? Screenshot by ZDNet

The software has been adjusted.

The pilots have it's said been re-familiarized with its workings.

So despite the misgivings and legal appeals of some the Boeing 737 Max has again been flying passengers for some six weeks without a hint of an incident. Without even word of some mass -- or even tiny -- passenger boycott either.

American Airlines was the first to fly it -- between La Guardia and Miami. United Airlines has put it back in the air too.

As The Points Guy reported Southwest Airlines is returning it to passenger service in March. Even the Europeans are slowly bringing it back.

All then is well.

Indeed the major American airlines are absolutely not hiding the fact that the plane is in the air. When you book you see in the flight details that the plane is a 737 Max.

It seems though that not every airline is quite so enthusiastic. Or perhaps confident.

I was moved you see by the approach of Cayman Airways. It appears taxed by the idea that its Maxes may be flying passengers again.

The Seattle Times' Dominic Gates spotted the airline's announcement for the return of the Max. Which oddly doesn't mention the word Max.

Instead it's an invitation to the public to ""come and walk through the National Airline's brand new Boeing 737-8 jet.""

I'm not sure how reassuring walking through the jet might be. Yes the overhead bins are bigger. It is though the plane whose inadequate software and suspect corporate behavior led to the death of 346 people.

As a commenter to the airline's tweeted entreaty mused: ""Nothing brings attention to an aircraft your marketers want to disguise like a public aircraft tour.""

You might think though that once you click the link provided by Cayman the airline will reveal what it's talking about.

Well no. There is absolutely no mention of it being the Max. There is the offer of watching it take off and land however.

One can understand the marketers' dilemma of course. But isn't it exacerbating any potential nervousness by inviting customers to tour a plane and hiding which plane it actually is? Especially if it's a plane that was associated with so much pain and scandal.

Customers really really don't like being duped. Cayman might as well have invited them to the Boeing 737 Euphemism.

Imagine what any cabin crew might have to deal with if a passenger who's troubled by what happened to the Max discovers only too late what plane they're on.

It's true that American Airlines also offered a tour of the plane as it hurried to bring it back.

Yet once the plane is broadly flying perhaps it's best to act normally -- honestly even -- and hope the disasters are in the past.

You'd think airlines would already have enough to worry about.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmV1L2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy1ldS1uZXctc3Vic2lkeS1tb2RlbC1hcHBlYXNlLWpvZS1iaWRlbi10cmFkZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EU mulls new Airbus subsidy model to appease Biden,"Ironically this tactic of government cash boosting companies through purchases of warplanes and other military kit at unprovably inflated prices is a ruse that Brussels has long accused the U.S. of exploiting.

For now the EU is under greater pressure to change its subsidy model than the U.S. because Europe is on the hook as a more extravagant subsidizer. In 2019 the World Trade Organization allowed the U.S. to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU exports to respond to Airbus subsidies — almost double the amount that the EU won in its parallel case against aid for Boeing ($4 billion).

Officials in Madrid Paris and Berlin told POLITICO they were engaged in tense discussions with the European Commission — the EU's executive body — over how to restructure the aid. Brussels they said was preparing to make an offer to U.S. President Joe Biden's administration.

The European subsidy model at the heart of the dispute is called Repayable Launch Investment. Under this scheme the governments of Germany France and Spain have granted Airbus loans for developing new aircraft models that the manufacturer only repays if the model becomes a commercial success.

The WTO says this type of aid is not illegal in itself but that European countries used it at excessively generous terms. France Spain and Airbus came to an arrangement last year they claimed would make their RLI terms WTO-compatible but the Americans still insist that Europe must ditch the mechanism diplomats said.

Two European trade officials said that one proposal being discussed with the capitals was indeed to completely phase out RLI as that would please the Americans."

A handful of investors have made competing bids upwards of $170 million for the 85-room property according to the Wall Street Journal.

That would be around $2 million per room a price threshold broken only twice before in the U.S. — by the Montage Hotel Beverly Hills and a Four Seasons in Hawaii.

The Napa Valley property was built by Boston-based Alcion Ventures. Managing director Martin Zieff said the firm spent five years picking the development site and 10 years building the property. It is set to open in the second quarter of this year.

The coronavirus pandemic rendered 2020 one of the worst years ever for the U.S. hotel industry and the outlook for 2021 isn’t great. STR projects that industry revenues won’t fully recover until 2024.

Opportunistic investors have raised hundreds of millions of dollars to scoop up distressed properties on the cheap.

Investors are confident in the Napa Valley Four Seasons for a few reasons. Wildfires in 2017 destroyed some of the high-end resort properties in the area reducing competition. Two of the remaining resorts run by Auberge Resorts Collection performed well in the latter half of 2020. Demand for boutique-style properties overall remains healthy.

“It shows the resiliency of the luxury market especially the smaller boutique properties” said Dan Peek president of the hotel group at Hodges Ward Elliot.

It took place in his office at the Max Delbrück Centrum in Berlin-Buch (MDC) in 1994. The chairman of the scientific committee sat down in Rapoport's chair and asked: ""Well Mr Rapoport what do you actually want?""

Rapoport smiles as he recalls the incident. Freshly shaved dressed in a red wool sweater the 73-year-old sits before his webcam and repeats the answer he gave the committee chair. ""I want a professorship here."" To which the chairman responded ""Well we want a lot of things in our lives.""

After a short silence Rapoport laughs. Bright patches of the Boston morning sun play on his orange-green-purple sofa. He is speaking to us from his condo his second home not far from his lab at Harvard Medical School where he has worked as a professor since 1995 enjoying excellent research conditions and inspiring colleagues. The Americans appreciate the molecular biologist from East Berlin.

Back in GDR times together with physicist Reinhart Heinrich Rapoport developed the ""metabolic control theory"" which is still known today and was awarded a professorship for it. Statistics collected after German reunification showed that this quantitative description of metabolic pathways was one of the most internationally cited works by GDR scientists. The importance of an enzyme for the regulation of metabolism for example in red blood cells could now be calculated. And yet he lost his professorship.

The new bosses from West Germany decided that he was not tenable for one of the newly created professorships;

The reason was because in the 1980s Rapoport was a party secretary at the Central Institute for Molecular Biology in Berlin-Buch (ZIM) for two years in addition to his scientific work. An evaluation found that he had never taken advantage of his position or harmed colleagues. But his new superiors from West Germany decided that he was not tenable for one of the newly created professorships; he remained merely leader of a working group.

As the historian Ulrich van der Heyden recently wrote in this newspaper in the humanities ""human capital was thrown in the trash"" after German reunification. The same thing happened in the natural sciences. In 1992 the Max Delbrück Centrum was founded in Buch a merger of the ZIM with the Central Institute for Cancer Research and the Central Institute for Cardiovascular Research. Of a total of 1720 positions at all three institutes only 385 remained at the new institute - a few hundred clinical ones were attached to the Charité hospital mostly on a temporary basis.

Rapoport explains that at that time he was using insulin to research how proteins are transported from cells into the bloodstream. The aim was to get to the bottom of the problem of diabetes i.e. to find out why insulin is no longer transported into the blood. More generally the work was also about investigating how some proteins pass through what are actually impermeable cell membranes: These proteins ""have a signal sequence a kind of postcode which tells the cell that this is a protein to be exported"" he explains. The Rapoport team proved that there is a membrane channel that is opened by the signal sequence which allows the protein to pass through and then closes again.

They were groundbreaking findings. Rapoport was determined to continue working on them with his research group. But to the dismissive answer of the chairman of the scientific committee at the Max Delbrück Centrum he could only say: ""Well I guess I'll be going away then."" Over Zoom he switches from his Berlin dialect to the West German High German of the committee chairman: ""Oh Mr Rapoport you're not leaving!""

A few months after the conversation his phone rang. Marc Kirschner a biologist from Harvard was on the line.

A few months after that conversation his phone rang. Marc Kirschner a biologist from Harvard was on the line. He had heard Rapoport was looking for something new he said. Would he like to get to know the lab in Boston?

That was 26 years ago. That's how long Rapoport has been commuting between Berlin and Boston. He succeeded in doing what few East German scientists managed after 1990: finding a job abroad. Transferred back to his own research one could say. Rapoport allowed himself to be ejected from the reunified science cell. He was also assisted by a kind of signal sequence.

The Rapoport family. From left to right: brothers Michael and Tom mother Inge father Mitja and sisters Susann and Lisa. private

Tom Rapoport the son of Jewish refugees was born in Cincinnati Ohio in 1947. In 1952 at age five his parents had to leave the US again with him and his siblings after Senator Joseph McCarthy tried to purge the country of communists. The Rapoports themselves communists could have lived in Austria or Israel but they settled in the GDR a new socialist country at the time.

Everything started well in Pankow. His mother Inge Rapoport who emigrated from Hamburg to the US as a young doctor in 1938 became the first chair of neonatology in Europe at Berlin Charité. And his father Samuel Mitja who grew up in Vienna did pioneering work on the preservation of blood during the Second World War and received a medal for it in America became director of the Institute for Biological and Physiological Chemistry at Humboldt University in Berlin.

There was a handsome black-haired boy at the front who was presented to us as a new classmate. And came from America. Bettina Wegner singer-songwriter

The East German singer-songwriter Bettina Wegner recalls her first encounter with Tom her ""good buddy"" in East Berlin. Wegner attended the Wilhelm Pieck Russian school with him. ""There was a handsome black-haired boy at the front who was presented to us as a new classmate. And came from America."" She stretches the sounds into ""Ameeerica Ameeerica"" to mimic her childish admiration at the time. Wegner calls Rapoport Tommy even today. ""His Jewishness didn't play a role at all"" she says.

Tommy the new kid was reserved ""totally different from the other boys"". ""Maybe that's why I fell in love with him back then"" says Wegner. She invited him to the cinema. He didn't want to go. ""That wasn't bad."" Tom Rapoport says he wasn't ready yet. They were 13.

Wegner also remembers how the maths teacher once explained a calculation on the blackboard: ""And then Tommy said there were three possibilities. And he immediately demonstrated them."" So it wasn't says Wegner that he showed off and was a know-it-all. Tom was simply clever and the teacher a bit insecure.

At 16 he joined a special class for mathematics and natural sciences at the Humboldt University and later earned his doctorate at his father's institute. Afterwards he worked in Berlin-Buch on insulin under the researcher Sinaida Rosenthal. The former student of Mitja Rapoport had set out to ""introduce genetic engineering to the East"" as Rapoport explains.

Wegner is one of the friends Tom sees regularly in Berlin. But of course he comes mainly for his three children who live here and for his wife Iris. Rapoport's move to Boston was a ""deep cut in the family"" as he describes it. Iris didn't want to give up Berlin she wanted to continue working here. That wasn't easy either.

Iris Rapoport taught biochemistry at Charité. In 1992 she found her personnel number on a list for dismissals. But she simply continued to teach.

Iris Rapoport also has Jewish roots. She too was a member of the SED (communist party) in the GDR and had to fear for her job after reunification. She taught biochemistry at Charité. In 1992 she found her personnel number on a list for dismissals. But she simply continued to teach and filed a complaint. With success. Today she is a pensioner and divides her time between Berlin and Boston.

At the beginning of the year they were both in their flat in Pankow. Tom having landed a few days ago was still in mandatory quarantine and sitting on the sofa. Grey-brown plush soft lamplight instead of Boston sunspots. This flat also has its own history: a colleague from Buch Christoph Pöhlmann who was active in the opposition Pankow Peace Circle tipped them off in the mid-1980s that it was vacant.

Pöhlmann lived one floor up. They were friends - the opposition activist and the party secretary. Pöhlmann knew Rapoport. He knew that as a 19-year-old he had even given up his Austrian citizenship to join the SED. Voluntarily. He knew Rapoport always wanted to improve socialism and that he volunteered to be party secretary because no one else stepped forward. As party secretary Rapoport had to help coordinate the production of chemicals in East German laboratories or help staff find housing. Pöhlmann says: ""In Tom three characteristics converged impossible at the time: intelligence honesty and partisanship."" Rapoport says: ""Those were the worst years of my life because they kept me from science.""

Tom Rapoport was not the only Jewish scientist and SED comrade in Buch. There was Sinaida Rosenthal whose husband had survived the war as a Jewish forced labourer. Helga Rößler who studied retroviruses. Charles Coutelle who headed the Department of Molecular Human Genetics. Albert Wollenberger co-founder of molecular and cellular cardiology a communist who returned from Danish exile. His daughter Ute was still working at the Max Delbrück Centrum in Buch in the 1990s.

We always said: some wanted to save the Jews others wanted to save the whole world Tom Rapoport

The Jewish SED members were mostly more critical and not as dogmatic as others says Christoph Pöhlmann. Their parents - just like Tom Rapoport's - had returned to Germany as communists to the GDR while another part of the family might have ended up in Israel. ""We always said: some wanted to save the Jews others wanted to save the whole world"" Rapoport says.

He does not regret his time as party secretary - but another ""sinister role"" as he calls it depresses him. On the sofa in Pankow he brings up the topic himself: after the fall of communism he was one of a small number of GDR scientists who participated in a commission formed by the Science Council a body that advises the chancellor. The aim was to make 12 recommendations ""on the path to German unity"". Many members of the commission believed that this would boost the scientific community in East and West. That was an illusion. In the end only the East was evaluated and the document was misused as an instrument to replace the scientific elites and dismiss thousands of GDR scientists. Rapoport himself also lost his professorship as a result.

Even today he still reproaches himself for being so naïve. Sure he later found work at Harvard ""fell upwards"" so to speak. But he couldn't help the others who stayed behind. At least not all of them. As for his working group from Buch he took almost all of them with him. At the check-in at the airport the colleagues the Rapoport group popped open a champagne bottle. Off to Ameeerica!

He himself had American citizenship at the time. Had it again rather. Tom Rapoport's life can also be told through his various passports. In his first one which he received as a toddler in the US he can be seen together with his siblings - in the background his mother trying to ""get the babies in a row"". After the family left the US he took his father's Austrian citizenship and thus lost his American passport. Rapoport then gave up the Austrian one when he joined the SED at 19 to get GDR citizenship. At the time he didn't want any privileges over the other GDR citizens. Today he says that was ""pretty stupid."" He got his American citizenship back in 1990 as communism was crumbling partly because he didn't know what to expect in a reunified Germany. Now he's both American and German. And his old fear that he would not be able to stay here was confirmed.

Rapoport was not the only Jewish East German scientist to leave the country after reunification. His colleague and friend Charles Coutelle born in England was taken on as a professor at Imperial College London after his dismissal in united Germany. The East German historian Mario Keßler says that because of the English language and connections abroad children of Jewish remigrants had a slightly better chance of finding their feet elsewhere back then. But Keßler says such new beginnings were only possible for technical or scientific experts - unlike humanities scholars who are more restricted by language or national culture.

One could can draw parallels between the dismissal of Jewish scientists and the experiences of exclusion in the past. In 2002 a group of prominent Jewish scientists from all over the world whose families had to flee Nazi Germany published an appeal in the Frankfurter Rundschau to treat their East German colleagues with more respect. Bettina Wegner known for her songs criticising the GDR also thinks that the dismissals after the Wende reawakened Jewish traumas. Rapoport received several letters of solidarity from professors in West Germany at the time; he still keeps them in his desk today. He was offered a professorship at the Institute of Biochemistry in Heidelberg. But he chose Harvard.

Currently Rapoport is researching lung and respiratory processes which have become all the more important in the Covid crisis. There is a thin layer in the lining of the lungs that contains phospholipids and proteins he explains: ""We have been working on a protein that is needed for breathing. And maybe it's possible to give corona patients this protein to improve their condition."" He waves off the suggestion some have made that he could be awarded the Nobel Prize for his work.

In the Schlosspark not far from his flat he looks out over Pankow's winter-grey townhouses. Whenever he sees them upon arriving in Berlin he feels at home. And yet he is always glad to return to Harvard. The man who researches the postal code of proteins now describes his own it seems: ""Both here and there as often is the case in Jewish families.""",,,,,,,,,

With data unveiled Saturday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s Genitourinary Cancers Symposium showing that their Keytruda-Lenvima pairing could stave off disease worsening and death the duo gave the field a heads up that they were on their way into the market—and coming to play.

Against Pfizer’s Sutent considered the unequivocal standard of care at the time the phase 3 trial began Keytruda and Lenvima (lenvatinib) posted a 61% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death and cut the risk of death alone by 34%. Patients on the combo went a median 23.9 months—just shy of two years—before their cancer worsened versus just 9.2 months for Sutent.

RELATED: Merck Eisai further complicate kidney cancer race with Keytruda-Lenvima win

Of course while Sutent was the appropriate comparator at the time it’s no longer the standard of care in the space. If eventually approved the Keytruda-Lenvima tandem will be going up against a range of combos including Bristol Myers Squibb’s Opdivo-Yervoy duo and Merck’s own combination of Keytruda and Pfizer’s Inlyta (axitinib).

While that latter combo has made headway in the field Merck would prefer to keep sales in the family. In addition to Keytruda it owns half of Lenvima after agreeing to shell out up to $5.8 billion back in 2018.

“Many treating physicians have been quite impressed with the results” that Keytruda and Inlyta have produced Roy Baynes M.D. Merck senior vice president and head of global clinical development. But the profiles of the two Keytruda combos are a little different he pointed out.

“Median (progression-free survival) on the order of two years is really a pretty significant and in many ways unprecedented finding” he said of Keytruda-Lenvima.

Still “we do see both of these as very competitive propositions for patients” he said noting that in some cases it may just come down to physician preference and whether doctors feel more comfortable using Inlyta over Lenvima or vice-versa.

RELATED: How will BMS' new Opdivo-Cabometyx kidney cancer combo fare against Keytruda? It may come down to marketing: analyst

But Merck will have another major player to contend with and that’s archrival Bristol Myers Squibb. Last month BMS and partner Exelixis scored an FDA green light for a pairing of Opdivo and Cabometyx which like Pfizer’s Keytruda-Inlyta and Keytruda-Lenvima combos pairs a PD-1 inhibitor with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Analysts at the time said marketing prowess could make all the difference in that race with both options looking competitive.

And then there’s Bristol’s dual-immunotherapy regimen of Opdivo and Yervoy which was the field’s original I-O entrant. That combo boasts “strong brand value built from stable long-term (four-year) survival outcomes” so stealing share from those drugs “may take longer” SVB Leerink analyst Daina Graybosch wrote ahead of Merck’s Saturday presentation at ASCO GU.

But doing so also won't be totally necessary for Keytruda-Lenvima to see success. ""Commercially we expect Merck and partner Eisai ... will aggressively market add-on of lenvatinib over Pfizer’s axitinib—increasing (renal cell carcinoma) revenue even if they take no share from BMY"" she wrote.",,,,,,,,,,,,

At universities and colleges across the country police are sweeping through encampments supporting Gaza trying to clear protesters from the grounds. But at Brown University’s encampment on the campus’s main green in the middle of Providence Rhode Island the biggest drama last Shabbat was that the candles would not stay lit.

This was more or less the calm atmosphere of Brown’s encampment for the six days it stood; it was not plagued by the antisemitism violence or arrests that have dominated headlines about schools including Columbia and the University of California Los Angeles. There were no clashes with counterprotesters and no police presence. The encampment’s daily schedule included tai chi and a talent show alongside teach-ins and rallies. People tossed frisbees next to the tents.

On Tuesday the protesting students at Brown reached an agreement with the university’s administration and voluntarily dismantled their encampment.

Life on the Ivy League campus wasn’t always so calm. In the wake of Oct. 7 61 students were arrested at various sit-ins. Some student groups celebrated Hamas’ massacre. People took pictures of Israeli students on campus and posted on anonymous social media with captions disparaging them as Zionists.

Fractures deepened after a Palestinian Brown undergraduate Hisham Awartani was shot in Burlington Vermont along with two other Palestinian friends; they were all wearing kaffiyehs. Brown-RISD Hillel put out a statement mourning the shooting but also castigating “a torrent of antisemitic hatred” online saying that Hillel’s “support for Israel and Zionist students is unassailable.”

Some Jewish and Israeli students who had previously been involved with Hillel broke ties calling the email “tone-deaf” and “a disgusting response to a hate crime.” At a vigil for Awartani a speaker said his blood was on the hands of Zionist students.

But around May’s encampment that vitriol seemed to have dissipated. Chants were focused on the activists’ demands — divestment not from Israel as a whole but from companies involved in the oppression of Palestinians — and not on broader statements about Zionism or Israel’s existence. Some of Brown’s most vocal Zionist students members of opposing campus group Brown Students for Israel said that they felt safe.

Students told me that the encampment chose not to chant “from the river to the sea” — common at most protests — because one student who was part of the tent group said it made them feel uncomfortable. (The chant did occur once on the encampment’s final day.)

What enabled this shift? And who planted the seeds for compromise on Brown’s central lawn?

I asked this question of many at Brown students faculty and rabbis and their answers all pointed to a willingness to cross ideological divides. Where protesters at other campuses adopted “do not engage” policies at Brown they kept talking.

“On the periphery of the encampment there were a number of students in conversation with one another some of which I think people might have imagined were unlikely pairs to be having conversations across political differences” said Jason Klein the rabbi for Jewish life in the chaplain’s office. “That’s something I think that Brown students can often do well.”

This isn’t of course to say that everyone approved of the encampment or agreed with its demands. Some students and staff at the Brown-RISD Hillel harshly criticize the campus environment. And many activists call for more extreme measures and more rigid stances — most students I spoke with mentioned more radical factions on campus that don’t fret over upsetting their peers.

But they no longer dominate at Brown.

The encampment maintained a middle ground of sorts in part due to a monthslong committed dialogue organized and run by students to talk through the toughest issues and feelings and try to understand each other.

And many students said that the relative calm and success of the protest was thanks in large part to the deep engagement of Jewish students in the campus’s activist movements.

Jews at the center

The first sit-in for divestment at Brown in November last year was composed entirely of Jewish students. In their first statement in the student newspaper The Brown Daily Herald the group mourned the murders on Oct. 7 and affirmed its “connection to the amorphous spiritual entity” of Israel but declared itself anti-Zionist.

Soon after they named themselves BrownU Jews for Ceasefire Now; many of its members were part of Brown’s encampment. JFCN as most on campus call it has organized protests or actions but also created an independent study course for those grappling with Judaism Jewish identity and Israel; organized dinners for Jews who clash over Israel; and invited other students to come and ask questions of its members promising to cast no judgment. It has also hosted weekly Shabbat services — including the one at the encampment — as well as holiday celebrations.

Maddie a senior with JFCN who spoke on condition that only her first name be used so as not to compromise her employment prospects in the Jewish professional world said the group hosts large Shabbat dinners and has created an “alternative ritual space” for Jews “who don’t want to feel like they’re praying to a flag.”

About 24% of Brown’s student body is Jewish and most of them according to Rabbi Joshua Bolton the head of the Brown-RISD Hillel “exist in a broad center and in fact they don’t necessarily feel represented by activists on either side of this issue.”

Nevertheless Jewish students comprise a significant portion — it’s not clear exactly how large — of pro-Palestinian activists on campus. Their deep engagement and leadership seems to have helped insulate the movement from becoming as divisive as on other campuses.

When an outside group from Providence came to the encampment and handed out flyers urging a global intifada over the weekend students pushed back saying that was not part of their messaging. They kept their chants focused on divestment and criticism of Brown’s leadership.

“The heavy Jewish presence in these pro-Palestine circles ensures that there will never be the extreme blatant antisemitism” said Ma’ayan Stutman-Shaw a first-year student who is not involved with the protests. “And it’s Jews who are really engaged with the Jewish community not Jews who picked up Judaism on Oct. 10 because they wanted to fight for Palestine — Jews who have been thinking about this constantly they are the ones who are leading this movement on campus.”

Of course much of the pro-Palestinian organizing has been led by non-Jewish students as well.

But much of the pushback to pro-Palestinian protests — concerns about antisemitism and what they see as calls to dismantle Israel — have come from Jewish students who are concerned about antisemitism or who have ties to Israel. And that’s where the leadership of Jewish student activists has come in.

“Jewish students are going to have a better understanding of what will trigger other Jewish students” said Asher Radziner a senior who has been leading conversations on campus.

A safety blanket

Many Jewish students I spoke to said the university encouraged conversations among students over Israel and the war but never convened any that students found inviting.

“It hasn’t really provided those spaces” said Eiden Spilker a senior involved with JFCN. “There just haven’t been contexts to engage in good faith.”

So instead students built their own.

Outside the encampment while it stood JFCN students — none of whom were camping on the green — had set up a dialogue space: a blanket and a painted canvas that said “Questions? Comments? Concerns? Come talk.”

Every day that the encampment stood at least two students sat there waiting for people to approach them. The group also facilitated conversations during a student hunger strike in February when 17 students fasted for eight days to protest the refusal of the Corporation of Brown University which governs the investment of Brown’s endowment to hear a proposal for divestment.

JFCN members said they are looking especially to engage with Jewish and Zionist students. Spilker whose father is a rabbi and whose mother is a cantor said JFCN understands where they’re coming from.

“We’ve been there and we’re in a position where we can empathize with that” he said. “It’s less about trying to convince people and more about hearing them and having dialogue and creating a space that ideally Hillel would’ve created but because of their ideology and current leadership have not been able to make.”

(“We are a home for every Jewish student” said Bolton the director of the campus Hillel when told of the criticism from some Jewish students. “That doesn’t mean that we’re a home for every type of program.”)

On blanket duty one recent morning Spilker greeted a student who introduced himself as Kareem not giving his last name and had questions. He asked about the use of the term genocide and the impact of divestment. Spilker thought before he spoke and then drew on theories he learned in classes he’d taken.

“I think it is a question of at which stage do you call it a genocide — is it just at the final stage of mass extermination?” he said.

“That’s a good point” Kareem responded. “I hadn’t heard that before that it’s a process.”

Spilker said he’s had all kinds of people come up to him at the blanket: students from the campus pro-Israel group students from settlements in the West Bank alumni faculty a local imam worried parents of prospective students who had just taken the campus tours that walked by the encampment multiple times a day.

“That was the main goal in setting this up. Like: We’re here to talk to you we’re not a threat to you” he said. “There are people who understand what we’re doing here or may not fully agree but appreciate what’s happening and appreciate that we’re opening up this space.”

Caught in the middle

One of those appreciative students is Stutman-Shaw. She doesn’t feel comfortable being part of the group but said she still agrees with much of what JFCN is doing on campus particularly its work to keep students talking to one another. Those efforts have “made me really proud to go to this school” she said.

At the same time the Jewish involvement in the protest movement has put Stutman-Shaw into a difficult position. JFCN hosts a Shabbat service each week with two options for prayer: a Reform service and a traditional-egalitarian one that uses traditional liturgy but doesn’t divide servicegoers by gender. It’s so popular that it can make it hard for Hillel to field a minyan for its own version of that service several students told me.

But JFCN’s homemade siddur doesn’t sit right with Stutman-Shaw. It has a disclaimer explaining that the word “Yisrael” in prayers doesn’t refer to the country of Israel but to the Jewish people and to the biblical parable in which Jacob wrestles with God. For Stutman-Shaw that’s not how she views her spirituality; when she prays to Yisrael she said she does think of the country and the time she’s spent there.

That means she often finds herself without her preferred mode of prayer; instead she usually attends the Orthodox minyan at Hillel.

“JFCN right now is the best egalitarian service that you can find on campus” she said citing the passion of the students involved. “Part of me feels really happy for that and part of me like that really breaks my heart because I feel like I can’t really be there fully in who I am.”

Stutman-Shaw is attempting to resuscitate the Brown chapter of J Street U which describes itself as “the political home for pro-Israel pro-peace pro-democracy Americans.” The chapter dissolved in the wake of Oct. 7 because the national organization had failed to call for a ceasefire. She hopes it will be a place where student can both condemn Israel’s actions in Gaza and support the existence of the state.

Still while she endeavors to build her own Jewish space on campus Stutman-Shaw said JFCN has been integral to the success of Brown’s pro-Palestinian movement.

“A lot of Israeli students were leading the protests a lot of Jewish students with connection to Israel” she said. “So they were really trying to emphasize the importance of diverse ideological dialogue.”

Dinners across disagreement

Stutman-Shaw has been attending an event called Dinners in Progress created by two other students who hold differing views on the conflict in the Middle East that seeks to bring groups of the not-likeminded students together to talk about Israel Gaza and the atmosphere on campus.

“For the first time since Oct. 7 I see the SJP president who happens to be Jewish and someone who is from the Gush talking about Israel” Stutman-Shaw said referring to the school’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine and a group of settlements in the West Bank. “And that’s so exciting.”

Radziner who is one of the co-founders said the dinners arose from the idea that “it would be great to have a dialogue space that wasn’t controlled by the university that wasn’t run by faculty or adults but run by students for students — not run by an organization like Hillel or even JFCN.”

The office of student life at Brown put him in touch with another student Zoey Fisher and gave them funding to buy dinner which is always a draw for college students.

In the three dinners so far a cohort of 14 Jewish students discussed their personal connections to Israel were able to express frustration with each other and dug deeply into their disagreements.

“It’s very easy for people who feel very strongly about something and want to act on it to get together and take action” Radziner said. “But often that comes at the expense of continued dialogue with people who disagree with you.”

The dinners he said “keep it going.”

‘I’ve had too many bad experiences’

Not everyone feels that the conversation has been quite so welcoming. Rabbi Joshua Bolton the director of the Brown-RISD Hillel critiqued what he saw as students holing up in “ideological fortresses.”

“Wisdom is revealed in places where we know very little where there’s vulnerability” Bolton said. “And so it would strike me that the opportunity before students at Brown is not to build an encampment that keeps everyone of a differing opinion out but really embrace the idea of let us go camping together in the wilderness.”

He blames the Brown faculty in part for building ideological fortresses and setting a bad example for students.

In many ways Hillel has been the target of the worst of the ire from protests. Bolton and the assistant director of the Hillel Molly Goldmeier received death threats several months ago.

“It’s just very hard for me to imagine what I’ve endured” he said “and there not being a major campus revolt on account of it.” he said. The campus he posits would be outraged had the head of the Brown Center for Students of Color received such threats.

“I think that kind of reflects where students are at right now” he added.

Teddy Horowitz a senior said he too feels unwelcome on campus because of his Zionism; he said he’d lost numerous friendships because of his love for Israel and his membership in the campus pro-Israel group Brown Students for Israel.

Horowitz largely agrees with the activists’ demands for a ceasefire and an end to Israel’s occupation but is deeply concerned about antisemitism within the movement. He said the Brown SJP chapter had expressed admiration for Hamas and that he’s seen antisemitism rise on campus social media. He also saw no place to mourn Israelis murdered in the Oct. 7 attack because of the dominance of pro-Palestinian activism on campus.

Many of his activist classmates fall into two groups he said. “There are the Jews and students who think Oct. 7 was a victory and there’s the activists who are willing to put up with that” he said. “And I don’t want to deal with either group anymore; I’ve had too many bad experiences.”

Horowitz turned to the campus Hillel and Chabad where he found community with like-minded friends. But he remains discouraged by what he sees as echo chambers on campus.

To combat this he founded a new publication the Brown Jewish Journal. “When the Jewish Journal started one of the editors was an anti-Zionist and I was really suspicious of him at first” Horowitz recounted. But as they began to read and edit each other’s work that changed. “Now I really look forward to talking about Israel-Palestine with him” he said.

Horowitz who spoke to me in the days before protesters and the university struck an agreement to dismantle the encampment said the climate on campus had improved since the weeks after Oct. 7.

“I’m really pleasantly surprised with how well this protest is going” he said of the encampment. “Recently I’ve come to the conclusion that these people might be pretty chill.”

But he still feels “betrayed” by the campus community. “I love the outpouring of empathy for Palestinians — they need it!” he said. “I just wish some of the empathy was directed our way as well.”

A campus less divided than it looks

Every student I spoke to said they think even the groups at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum on Israel actually well mostly agree.

“You’ll find a lot more in common with BSI members and JFCN members than either of them would ever admit” said Stutman-Shaw.

But they did admit it. When I spoke with them both BSI and JFCN members made the same point — that most of them agree on a lot of points including criticism of the Israeli government horror at the deaths of civilians in Gaza and a desire for a ceasefire.

Talking with students from across the campus’s Jewish community the divides largely came down to details — students who want a ceasefire but are uncomfortable with using terms such as “genocide” or “anti-Zionist.” Or students who are reluctant to try to find common ground or engage with students who reacted to Oct. 7 in a way that upset them.

But many of them on all sides are trying to push through their discomfort to understand each other even when it’s difficult.

“Movements are imperfect” Radziner said. “Once you understand that you’re all working towards the same goal with different ways of getting there it lets you start to not overlook but push through the parts that you disagree with or find challenging.”

That’s what Klein the rabbi in the chaplain’s office hopes will define Brown’s protest movement.

“I was really proud that these students were still really in it and trying to make it imperfect for everyone” he said. “Everyone gets to be uncomfortable everyone gets to learn.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDMvYnVzaW5lc3Mvc3RlcmxpY2h0LWJyb3duLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktZG9ub3IuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire Donor Barry Sternlicht Assails Brown’s Deal With Protesters,"One of Brown University’s major donors the billionaire real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht on Friday sharply criticized the school’s agreement to hold a board vote on cutting investments tied to Israel calling it “unconscionable” and saying he had “paused” donations to the school.

Brown is among a small number of universities that have agreed to discuss their investments in companies that do business in Israel in order to persuade student protesters to dismantle encampments. Mr. Sternlicht in a scathing email to The New York Times which he copied to Brown’s president Christina H. Paxson said the arrangement amounted to sympathy for Hamas which attacked Israel in October and described students protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza as “ignorant.”

“There should never be a vote when people do not have the facts” he wrote. “It’s not education it’s propaganda.”

Mr. Sternlicht 63 said no deal with protesters could be fruitful because the two sides did not agree on “facts and moral clarity” as well as the scale of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in which about 1200 were killed and another 250 were taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent intense bombardment of the tightly packed area has left more than 34000 dead and drawn international condemnation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lci9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why do brown eggs cost more than white eggs? Blame the bird,"New York CNN —

It’s a moment many shoppers grapple with at some point during a grocery run: Why does a carton of brown eggs cost more than a carton of white eggs?

It’s not what you might think. It’s not about one type being healthier or more natural or fancier than the other but really about the nitty-gritty of farm economics. It costs more to keep the brown egg-laying hen happy and well fed.

“Basically there is no difference between a brown egg and a white egg nutritionally. It has to do with the breed of the chicken” explained Daniel Brey owner of Brey’s Egg Farm a fourth-generation family egg farm in Jeffersonville New York. The farm produces more than 200000 white eggs a day.

Some breeds such as White Leghorn chickens lay eggs with white shells while other breeds such as Rhode Island Reds lay eggs with brown shells. According to Brey the cost and taste of the egg you buy – white or brown - is determined by what – and how much – is fed to the hen.

“It has a lot to do with the chicken feed” Brey said. “It costs more to make a dozen brown eggs because the chickens that produce them tend to eat more.”

Egg farmers say brown and white eggs are closely matched in their nutritional value. Edmund McNamara

Edmund McNamara and his wife Rose run Sova Farms in Norwich NY about 200 miles north of New York City’s Central Park. Sova Farms he said is organic certified by the United States Department of Agriculture for its brown eggs and its chicken pork and lamb.

The farm currently produces about 350 brown eggs daily but expects to bump that up to over 1000 brown eggs a day after receiving a delivery of more than 700 pullets (or young hens) on this month.

“All our eggs are brown but every once in a great while a chicken will lay a very light brown” he said adding that the eggs are sold directly to consumers in New York’s Westchester County.

Harder to find

In stores brown eggs tend to carry a premium – even if it’s just because of their color anomaly.

“Eggs come in many colors not just white and brown. Depending upon the breed some are even blue and green” said Joan Frank assistant program director dietetics with the University of California David Department of Nutrition. Still there is no difference in nutritional value of eggs based on the color of the shell she said.

“I think consumers for some reason have come to believe that brown eggs are healthier which they are not” Frank said.

Sova Farms is currently selling a dozen large brown eggs for $8. Store prices for organic pastured brown eggs can be as high as $10 for a dozen while the price of conventional brown eggs is between $4.50 to $6 in most stores.

A dozen white eggs is about $2.50 in stores according to the latest weekly government data up from $1.50 a dozen from a year ago.

Yet McNamara too said “there is really no nutritional difference between white and brown eggs.”

Phil Lempert a grocery industry analyst and editor of SuperMarketGuru.com estimated how much more shoppers typically pay for brown eggs versus their white counterpart. “If there’s brown eggs next to white eggs typically you’re going to pay anywhere between 10% to 20% more for brown eggs regardless of free range or organic” he said.

The egg-onomics of it all

David Anderson professor of agricultural economics (with a specialty in livestock economics) at Texas A&M University has studied egg pricing and factors that affect it on farms and in the supermarket.

Egg prices regardless of the color of the shell generally respond to swings in demand he said. “You have short-term seasonal events such as Easter. We always see holiday demand for eggs. In the fall we also see demand increase for eggs for holiday-related activities such as baking” Anderson said.

Thrown into the mix are other influences on egg prices such as the cost of chicken feed. “Feed costs have been falling This is helping egg producers. We had a record large crop last year in the US and we have much lower corn and soybean meal prices right now he said.

Brown eggs generally cost more in stores than white eggs. It has to do with the cost of the upkeep of the chicken breed that produces brown eggs. Edmund McNamara

On the flip side the latest outbreak of Bird Flu could keep egg prices elevated versus last year. If egg producers aren’t able to meet demand because they’ve had to cull their chicken population due to bird flu then that can raise prices.

Looking specifically at the economics of producing brown eggs versus conventional white eggs Anderson confirmed it does indeed cost more to produce the brown variety. “If it costs more to produce they’ll probably be priced higher to the consumer.”

But as to the “perception” that brown eggs are healthier than white eggs?

“It’s almost like what comes first the chicken or the egg?” Anderson said. “Did the companies advertise that first or did it come from consumers who think that brown eggs just must be healthier?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9qYW5lbGxlLWJyb3duLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtYmlydGhkYXktdHdvLW1vbnRocy1hZnRlci1zb24tZ2Fycmlzb24tZGVhdGgtODY0NDI3ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Janelle Brown Celebrates 55th Birthday Two Months After Son Garrison's Death,"Janelle Brown is marking a milestone two months after the death of her son Garrison Brown.

The Patriots met with Maye on multiple occasions including a trip to North Carolina for the Tar Heels Pro Day. During that trip Mayo and company spoke with longtime and well-respected coach Mack Brown. Mayo specifically said he received a “glowing recommendation” from the Tar Heels head coach and noted how that conversation eased any nerves about drafting Maye.

Brown a 46-year coaching veteran met with a handful of New England reporters on a video conference Monday and relayed what he told Mayo and company during the pre-draft process.

“I’ve learned that I want the high school coach to tell me the truth in recruiting so I’m very honest with the NFL coaches” Brown said. “This is important to them.

“So with Coach Mayo I knew this is huge for him just starting out in this first year. So I just told him ‘If I was the coach of the Patriots I would want Drake Maye. We all put our checks in the mouth of players and that’s what you’re (Mayo) gonna do. And I would rather have Drake Maye than anybody in the country leading my football team.’

I just told him ‘If I was the coach of the Patriots I would want Drake Maye.’ Mack Brown on conversations with Jerod Mayo

Brown’s recommendation to Mayo was echoed throughout the pre-draft process and again Monday. Brown praised Maye for his toughness competitiveness and ability to lead a rocker room with his mix of positive reinforcement and constructive criticism.

Brown even spoke to the Maye athletic and authentic family along with the quarterback’s longtime girlfriend. Maye introduced his three brothers and girlfriend to reporters during his introductory press conference at Gillette Stadium.

“He’s an unbelievable person” Brown said. “He’s one of the nicest toughest most competitive young people I’ve ever been around. I’ve said often I would adopt him. He’s that perfect of a kid. It sounds kind of corny but it’s true.”

Brown also relayed a story as to how Maye included other position groups whenever he was approached with an NIL deal. It was one of the many ways Maye proved his worth as a teammate.

“So if they came and said ‘We want you to do this advertisement.’ He said ‘Well the offensive linemen need to be with me and they need to be paid.’ Or ‘Well we want you to get fed through the seafood company for the year.’ And he said ‘That’s great the receivers and their families need to get fed too.'”

But Brown made it clear to New England’s organization the competitor they were getting too.

“He is not coming to Boston to lose” Brown said.

It seems that message was heard loud and clear throughout the Patriots organization."

The world number three golf star was heard angrily muttering the slur “faggot” at the Sentry Tournament of Champions in Hawaii on 9 January. He was promptly dropped by his main sponsor Ralph Lauren whose clothing he’d worn since he turned pro.

His fall from grace continued on Friday (12 February) as Brown-Forman the company that owns Woodford Reserve confirmed it would not renew Thomas’ contract when it expires in April.

In an internal email seen by WDRB Brown-Forman outlined its efforts to help Thomas learn more about LGBT+ issues and understand the harm his comment caused.

It offered to refer him to “national and local organisations that work to end discrimination against LGBT+ people and other ways in which Justin can make himself part of the solution”.

The Kentucky-based brand which had sponsored Thomas since 2015 has now suspended all shipments of Woodford Reserve Justin Thomas personal selection bottles.

It added: “We are also reviewing and updating all sponsorship agreements to ensure that they make clear our expectations for respect – that it is a core value at Brown-Forman and must be visible in not only how we represent ourselves but also in those we choose to represent our brands.”

Brown-Forman is consistently recognised by the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index for its LGBT-inclusive policies and practices and has received a perfect score of 100 for the last 11 years for these efforts.

Justin Thomas apologised profusely for using the homophobic slur which slipped out when he botched a five-foot putt on the fourth hole.

“There’s just no excuse” he admitted to Reuters. “There’s absolutely no reason for me to say anything like that. It’s terrible. It’s not the kind of person that I am. I need to do better. I deeply apologise to anyone and everybody who I offended and I’ll be better because of it.”

He has since promised to undergo a training programme to “become a better person” vowing to prove to his fans and sponsors that he is not homophobic.

It’s been reported that pro-golfer Justin Thomas has lost another sponsorship after using a homophobic slur during last months Sentry Tournament of Champions.

The American golfer landed in hot water when he was heard saying the word “f****t” after missing the five-foot putt on hole four.

WDRB reported that Brown-Forman has announced they will not renew their Woodford Reserve brand partnership with Thomas going forward.

The news was announced via an internal email from Woodford Reserve Global Brand Director Mark Bacon.

In the email Bacon informed the employees that they will be helping Thomas with LGBTQ+ education while also taking notes from their LGBTQ+ advisory group PRIDE and LGBTQ+ stakeholders.

Their efforts include referring Thomas to “national and local organizations that work to end discrimination against LGBTQI+ people and other ways in which Justin can make himself part of the solution.”

Woodford Reserve has also ceased shipments of the remaining Justin Thomas personal selection bottles.

The letter revealed the steps they will be taking for future sponsorships as well.

“We are also reviewing and updating all sponsorship agreements to ensure that they make clear our expectations for respect – that it is a core value at Brown-Forman and must be visible in not only how we represent ourselves but also in those we choose to represent our brands” the letter states.

This isn’t the first brand to suspend their partnerships with the world No. 3 golfer.

Ralph Lauren announced they would be cutting ties with Thomas last month in a lengthy statement.

“We are disheartened by Mr. Thomas’s recent language which is entirely inconsistent with our values.

“While we acknowledge that he has apologized and recognizes the severity of his words he is a paid ambassador of our brand and his actions conflict with the inclusive culture we strive to uphold” the statement read.

After the incident Thomas released a statement apologizing for using the homophobic slur.

“There’s just no excuse. I’m an adult. I’m a grown man. There’s absolutely no reason for me to say anything like that” he said.",,,,,,,,,

""I felt like I deserved the honesty and respect because I’ve been there for 10 years"" Wall told The Athletic on Saturday. ""I think I did everything I could and gave everything I had heart and soul to the organization on and off the court.""

Wall told The Athletic that he ultimately felt that a trade was coming but was still surprised he was sent to Houston on Dec. 2. He added that the organization that drafted him first overall in 2010 was not truthful with him especially since general manager Tommy Shepard said a week before that there was ""no plans to trade John.""

The last time Wall played at Capital One Arena home of the Wizards was Dec. 16 as he missed the last 47 games of the 2018-2019 season and all of 2019-2020 due to injuries.

""I never turned my back on the organization"" Wall said. ""I played through damn near every injury that a lot of people wouldn’t have played through. I played through broken hands in the playoffs. I think I did everything I could and gave everything I had heart and soul to the organization on and off the court.""

A tribute video from the Wizards is expected during the game but Wall said he wished fans were allowed in the arena because ""the fans can show me appreciation if they want to or don’t want to — which I think they will.""

Pregame notes

Monday’s game is not only a back-to-back for the Wizards but it also marks John Wall’s first game in D.C. since he was traded for Russell Westbrook in December. There’s no doubt it will be an emotional return for the former Wizards and fans. Be sure to have your tissues ready for the video tribute.

In a story by Fred Katz of The Athletic Wall gave an inside look to the Wizards-Rockets trade. Wall gave shared his side of the story and the emotions he felt before and after the trade went down. Wall revealed he didn’t feel like the Wizards organization was honest with him leading up to the trade. “I felt like I deserved the honesty and respect because I’ve been there for 10 years. I’ve been through the bad times when we had shitty teams and when we had good teams in D.C.” Wall said. The point guard said he never “turned his back on the organization” and played through injuries that a lot of people wouldn’t have. “I played through broken hands in the playoffs. I think I did everything I could and gave everything I had heart and soul to the organization on and off the court.”

Wall also shared that he voted for Beal for the All-Star game. “Who the hell wouldn’t wanna watch Bradley Beal?” Wall told the Athletic. Wall mentioned one of his first calls after learning that he was traded was to Beal. Wall described the call as “emotional” and said both he and Beal were crying.

The Wizards are looking to avenge their Jan. 26 loss to the Rockets. Wall led his new team with 24 points in their 107-88 win against Washington. Erin Gordon and Victor Oladipo followed with 20 points each. DeMarcus Cousins added a solid 19 points and a team-high 11 rebounds. For the Wizards Beal led with 33 points. Russell Westbrook had a double-double with 19 points 11 rebounds and 7 assists.

The slumping Celtics (13-12) have lost nine of 14 games after dropping a 108-102 decision to the Detroit Pistons on Friday.

Celtics vs. Wizards spread: Celtics -6.5

Celtics vs. Wizards over-under: 231.5 points

Celtics vs. Wizards money line: Celtics -280 Wizards +240

BOS: The Celtics are 3-6 in their last nine road games

WAS: The Wizards have shot under 30 percent from 3-point range in five straight games

Why the Celtics can cover

Forward Jayson Tatum had scored at least 23 points in 13 consecutive games a string that was snapped when he was limited to 17 in Thursday's win over Toronto. He bounced back with a 33-point 11-rebound effort against Detroit and is averaging 26.6 points 7.1 boards and 4.5 assists -- all career highs. He scored a team-high 32 points in a 116-107 victory over the Wizards last month.

Boston's offense has been more hit-or-miss than many teams in the league. The Celtics are averaging 120.7 points in their 13 wins but they have struggled mightily to score in the 12 defeats averaging a mere 100.2 points. Boston has a chance to get its offense cranking against a Washington defense that ranks last in the league with 120.3 points allowed per game.

Why the Wizards can cover

Bradley Beal was given a rest day and his absence was glaring as the Wizards were held to their second-lowest point total in the 109-91 setback to the Knicks. He has scored at least 31 points in eight of his last 11 games including back-to-back contests in which he erupted for 60 points at Philadelphia and 41 in a nine-point loss in Boston. Beal is by far the leading vote-getter among Eastern Conference guards for the NBA All-Star Game.

Fresher legs may help Beal who was struggling from long range over his last four games connecting on only 6-of-27 3-point attempts. In Beal's absence fellow guard Russell Westbrook came up one rebound shy of a triple-double on Friday while scoring 23 points for the second straight game. Washington has fared well against the Celtics at home winning seven of the last 12 matchups.

Pharmacies may offer more familiarity and proximity for people than other vaccination sites.

Pharmacies will follow local regulations for vaccine priority. If you are eligible check the pharmacy's website for updated information on exactly where you need to go and what you need to have with you.

More people will soon be getting their COVID-19 vaccines at places like Walmart Costco and CVS. The federal government will begin to ship doses directly to retail pharmacies on February 11.

The distribution plan is part of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination which connects both national pharmacy chains and independent pharmacies with states and territories to boost vaccination efforts across the country. The program will start with a small number of retail pharmacies and ramp up to about half the pharmacies in the U.S.

A limited number of community pharmacies have already been administering vaccinations as part of state-allocated doses.

The first shipment will include a million vaccine doses to about 6500 pharmacies around the country according to Jeffrey Zients the White House COVID-19 coordinator who announced the program during a White House briefing for reporters last week. The numbers of doses and pharmacies will increase over time.

“Pharmacies are readily accessible in most communities with most Americans living within five miles of a pharmacy…it’s an important component to delivering vaccines equitably” Zients said. “Sites are selected based on their ability to reach some of the populations most at risk for severe illness from COVID-19 including socially vulnerable communities.”

While neighborhood pharmacies will make the COVID-19 vaccine seem much more within reach for millions of people anxiously waiting experts warn there may be some frustration. “Navigate it with patience” Keri Hurley-Kim PharmD an assistant clinical professor at the University of California Irvine School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences tells Verywell. “People should understand that pharmacies will be held to vaccinating the same groups as outlined in state and county tiers. Do not expect to be able to skip the line.”

Challenges Are Expected

There are about 90000 retail pharmacies in the U.S. and fewer than half will be receiving doses according to Zients.

Appointments must be made—at least for now—through a chain’s website or customer service phone number not on-site.

Pharmacies are anxious about managing expectations. Chris Krese the spokesman for the National Association of Chain Drug Stores tells Verywell that pharmacies are excited to be a big part of the vaccination effort in communities but also worry about a potential limiting factor: enough vaccines.

""We can meet the challenge so long as we have doses to put into arms"" Krese says.

What This Means For You If you’re eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine and are planning to get vaccinated at your local pharmacy it’s critical to pay attention to the information that pharmacy provides. Retailers are already posting frequent updates. For example in a February 2 press release CVS announced the program would start on February 11 but in a subsequent release the date had been moved to February 12.

Each Pharmacy’s Approach Will Be Slightly Different

According to Ilisa Bernstein Senior Vice President of Pharmacy Practice and Government Affairs for the American Pharmacists Association in Washington DC pharmacies are setting up their vaccination stations in different ways both indoors and outdoors leveraging their experience from giving flu shots and other vaccines.

""Just like the state and local programs [that began earlier] pharmacies are using different systems for scheduling and some are easier to navigate than others” Bernstein tells Verywell. “Pharmacies are getting short lead times [on vaccine deliveries] so patients should keep checking for appointments.”

Check the pharmacy's website to see if you can fill out paperwork ahead of time and what form of ID to bring with you.

Sending vaccines to pharmacies is just one piece of the strategy the White House is rolling out to get people in the U.S. vaccinated. During a White House briefing on Tuesday Zients announced that beginning next week the federal government will also start sending vaccine doses directly to community health centers which provide primary care services in underserved areas reaching almost 30 million people.

The White House is expected to roll out other types of vaccination venues such as pop-up and mobile clinics.

“We’ve got to try everything” Leana Wen MD an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University tells Verywell. “Accessibility isn’t the same for everyone and we’ve got to move forward with approaches in order to get as many people vaccinated as we can.”

Senate votes to hear from witnesses in impeachment trial

Former President Donald Trump's legal team launched his defense on Friday in his historic second impeachment trial in the Senate. The defense argued Trump bears no responsibility for the Capitol riot he is accused of inciting saying his speech at a rally before the attack was ""ordinary political rhetoric"" and pointing to instances when Democrats used the term ""fight."" The defense wrapped up within just three hours and the trial looked like it was heading for a quick final vote on Saturday but in a bit of a surprise the Senate voted 55-45 to call witnesses. Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) joined Democrats in the vote. Trump is still expected to be acquitted as only a small handful of Republicans have indicated they are considering supporting conviction.

2. CDC outlines roadmap to safely reopen schools

Schools across the U.S. can be reopened safely amid the COVID-19 pandemic while following newly released ""operational strategy"" guidelines the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. The ""roadmap"" for reopening schools shuttered for public health includes guidance on masking physical distancing measures and cleaning. It urges states to prioritize vaccinations for teachers but says reopenings can happen safely even without a fully vaccinated staff. ""There is nothing in this guidance that is a mandate for schools to open and nor is there anything in this guidance that is a mandate for schools to close"" said CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. President Biden has promised to get most schools back to in-person instruction within his first 100 days in office. Teachers unions appeared to respond positively to the proposal.

3. GOP lawmaker confirms contentious Trump-McCarthy call during Capitol riot

Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump confirmed Friday night the contents of a phone call new details of which were reported by CNN between Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) while the Jan. 6 Capitol riot was ongoing. Herrera Beutler released a statement describing the conversation as it was relayed to her by McCarthy and calling on her colleagues some of whom spoke anonymously to CNN to come forward ""if you have something to add."" During the call McCarthy reportedly urged Trump to ""publicly and forcefully call off the riot"" to which Trump reportedly initially replied by claiming that antifa not his supporters were behind the breach. When McCarthy reportedly dismissed the idea Trump reportedly replied ""Well Kevin I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are."" That reportedly sparked a shouting match between the two.

4. Big pharma companies to claim $1 billion in tax deductions after opioid settlements

Big pharmaceutical companies reportedly plan to recoup portions of opioid crisis settlement payouts via tax deductions this year. Thousands of lawsuits from individuals and governments have challenged opioid manufacturers and distributors for their roles in the deaths of an estimated 70000 people from addiction each year. Four of those pharmaceutical companies — manufacturer Johnson & Johnson and distributors McKesson Cardinal Health and Amerisource-Bergen — are in talks to pay a combined $26 billion to settle many of those cases. But as their financial records reportedly indicate they're planning to claim tax deductions from those payouts this year and bring back around $1 billion each. Tax laws usually prevent companies from deducting legal costs and the IRS may also end up challenging the companies' deductions. But the deductions may work through the $2 trillion CARES Act which opened up billions of dollars in tax breaks to companies regardless of pandemic suffering.

Myanmar's anti-coup protest movement entered its second week Saturday as demonstrators once again took to the street in defiance of the country's military junta. Over the course of the week authorities have become more aggressive in their efforts to break up the rallies — per The Associated Press there have been reports of night raids in which security forces have tried to seize people from their homes during curfew hours though in several cases a large number of neighbors reportedly rushed to the scene to prevent the arrests. On Saturday Myanmar's military issued arrest warrants for seven well-known protesters calling on people to inform the police should they spot any of them and threatening anyone who shelters them. ""I am so proud to have a warrant issued"" Ei Pencilo one of the protesters wrote to her 1.6 million Facebook followers. ""Catch me if you can.""

7. Former ECB chief sworn in as Italy's new prime minister

Former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi was sworn in as Italy's prime minister on Saturday following the collapse of the previous administration and resignation of former Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte last month. Draghi put together a unity government which has the support from most of the country's prominent parties including the far-right League and the populist Five Star Movement both of which The Guardian notes have adopted more moderate pro-European tones in recent days as Italy continues to deal with the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout. The previous government fell apart amid disagreements over how to spend the more-than-200 billion euros it's set to receive from the European Union's COVID-19 recovery fund. Draghi who has been credited with saving the euro during the height of the European debt crisis enjoys a strong reputation in Italy and internationally.

BBC The Guardian

In a statement Friday night White House spokesman Kevin Munoz said President Biden has ruled out requiring COVID-19 testing for all passengers on domestic flights for now. The idea of showing proof of a negative test before boarding a flight had been floated by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky earlier this week but both the White House and the CDC said Friday that the current rules — which include required masking on all public transportation and pre-departure testing and quarantining for inbound international travelers — will remain in tact. Airlines opposed a potential mandate and the heads of several major U.S. carriers met with White House officials Friday. The sides had what Nicholas Calio CEO of Airlines for America described as a ""very positive constructive conversation.""

At the end of Friday's impeachment trial proceedings Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman received a standing ovation from the Senate which then voted unanimously to award him with a Congressional Gold Medal one of the nation's highest civilian honors. Goodman played a pivotal role in protecting Congress during the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. He was initially lauded after a video showed him single-handedly leading a mob away from the Senate chamber during the insurrection and during the trial House impeachment managers unveiled previously unseen security footage showing Goodman running into Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) who was unknowingly heading toward the crowd in a hallway and redirecting him to safety.

After 27 years America’s largest used-vehicle retailer CarMax recently announced it’s exiting the new-vehicle retail business. The Fortune 500 company is dumping its last two franchised dealerships both Toyota to specialize in used-car sales. The news comes after the auto retailer touted its new 24-hour test drives.

Why did CarMax pivot after a quarter-century of selling new vehicles? What will the future hold? There’s a lot to unpack here.

CarMax will revert to its used-car roots

In January CarMax sold Laurel Toyota in Maryland to Sheehy Auto Stores of Virginia. The company told Automotive News it expects to wrap up the remaining Toyota dealership sale in Kenosha Wisconsin this year.

CarMax will retain its Kenosha location for selling used vehicles. The Toyota facility’s prospective buyer would operate out of a proposed new dealership.

It wasn’t a quick decision. Over time CarMax has seen the new-vehicle sales decline. The coronavirus pandemic that began in 2020 only further stifled new-car sales. It also revealed the company’s need to consider online sales.

The auto retailer now plans to concentrate on its used-vehicle business and implementing a digital platform for online car sales.

CarMax rolled out its new omnichannel retail platform at the end of 2020. It has also launched a marketing campaign to get the word out that consumers can buy used vehicles at CarMax online. The new technology allows customers to seamlessly shop in physical CarMax stores or online for an easy and enhanced buying experience.

The pandemic has forced auto retailers to facilitate remote and online sales to stay competitive.

CarMax will specialize in used cars

The pandemic has also boosted used-car sales. And that works out for CarMax because it has been consistently selling pre-owned vehicles. It makes sense that it would become the company’s focus.

In a statement to Automotive News CarMax’s senior vice president of store operations Darren Newberry explained that the new platform would allow the company to serve its core customers on their terms. Whether they want to buy or sell consumers can do so at home at stores or in a hassle-free combination of the two.

Though CarMax had sold new vehicles since the mid-’90s by 2003 the company was beginning to sell off those venues. Others connected to used-car supercenters were moved to independent locations. By 2006 CarMax had only six franchised stores remaining.

The CEO at the time Austin Login said they stayed in the new-vehicle game to “keep an exposure” and maintain relationships with companies that sold new cars.

In 2016 CarMax had four new-vehicle franchises but sold two of them that year. As of December 2020 CarMax had 220 used-vehicle locations in the United States aside from the two Toyota franchises.

But what about the 24-hour test drives?

Most dealerships allow you to test drive a vehicle you’re considering. There’s just enough gas in the car for you to go a few blocks. But how much does a quick drive tell you about a vehicle and its ability to meet your needs?

Recently CarMax announced a new policy. With its “love your car” guarantee you get a 24-hour test drive and a 30-day return policy on all cars.

But despite the company’s exit from new-vehicle sales its 24-hour test drive still stands. The policy seems better-suited to used vehicles anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The planning for this celebration traditionally begins at 11 minutes past 11 on November 11 then party planners take a break over the Advent and Christmas holidays before festivities start in early February. During the celebration street parades balls and stage shows are aplenty and Kölsch (the beloved local beer) flows freely. Children and adults adorn themselves in ridiculous masquerade costumes and the party takes to the streets. All the neighborhoods of the city seem to participate in this very Catholic holiday.

The dates of the Cologne Carnival have been canceled through February 2021. Please check the city's website for updated information on late 2021 and 2022 festivities.

Carnival in Cologne

Carnival gives German Catholics a chance to get a little crazy before going pious for Lent. If you're visiting Cologne you can surely hang in the background and watch this over-the-top holiday event but participating is much more fun. The lavish festivities include parades costumes and fancy evening balls. The most common costume is a jecke (or clown) but people can also be seen in animal or pirate costumes. Drinking is always a favorite activity as most locals tend to imbibe on either glühwein (a famous German après-ski drink similar to mulled cider) or Kölsch. Sweets a frequent indulgence during Carnival include the krapfen (doughnut) and muzemandeln (almond-shaped pieces of fried dough). Enjoy Carnival-inspired music during this time too including local bands that sing about the city the party and the general friendly vibe of the Kölsche. Don't forget to listen closely for cries of ""Kölle Alaaf"" from the crowds. This rallying cheer translated loosely means ""Cologne above everything else.""

Carnival Events in Cologne

Carnival is not considered a national German holiday but in Cologne many shops schools and offices will be closed (or will close early) on Weiberfastnacht (Silly Thursday) all the way through Veilchendienstag (Violet Tuesday) with the exception of Friday which is a regular workday. Even if shops and businesses are open don't be surprised to find people dressed in costume and exuding a festive spirit that can be found throughout the city.

Weiberfastnacht (or Silly Thursday) typically takes place before Ash Wednesday and is reserved as a day for the ladies. Costumed women gather in the streets gleefully attacking the men by cutting off their ties. For their compliance men are rewarded with a bützchen (little kiss). People meet up at Alter Markt (or Alder Maat in the Kölsch dialect) at 11:11 a.m. and three Carnival parade characters the Prince the Peasant and the Virgin join the crowds. Beer is enjoyed by all during the merrymaking. Then after a booze-filled afternoon masked balls and parties take place in various locales come evening.

Carnival weekend carries on in its intoxicated manner under the valor of tradition. A Frühschoppen  or early-morning drink is a respected custom enjoyed on many a morning. For this locals meet around 10:30 a.m. at Funkenbiwak in Neumarkt. By midday the tipsy city of Cologne will be covered in jecke followed by more formal balls and gatherings in the evening.

Rosenmontag (Rose Monday) takes place the following Monday and is a loud wake-up from the hangovers of the weekend. At 11:11 am marching bands dancers and floats strut down the streets with performers tossing sweets known as kamelle (caramels) and tulips to the boisterous crowds. In a show of pointed humor floats often depict caricatures of politicians and famous German personalities.

By the time Veilchendienstag (Violet Tuesday or Shrove Tuesday) rolls around things begin quieting down. While a few parades and goings-on still exist in Cologne's suburbs the city's main event turns its focus to a ceremonial Nubbelverbrennung (burning of the nubbel—a life-size straw figure). This man-sized form is strung in front of many bars and is lit on fire just before Ash Wednesday as a ceremonial offering for the people's sins. The largest of these ceremonies takes place Kwartier Latäng the student district.

When Is Carnival in Cologne?

The carnival season in Germany officially begins months before the actual party. On November 11 at 11:11 a.m. the ""Council of Eleven"" gathers to plan next year's events. Though planning is serious business an air of playfulness can already be seen in the planners' outfits and jaunty fool's caps complete with bells.

The actual party begins 40 days before Easter and usually sometime in February. For 2021 however the Cologne festivities have been canceled.

So just before we get started within the last 24 hours we had some breaking news from Carnival Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean which we will update you on later in the video.

We’ve also got some big news stories from this week including crew members needing to be vaccinated before returning to the ships a world-first feature revealed from MSC Cruises more cancellations from Carnival cruises to nowhere to continue for Quantum of the Seas and more.

180-Day World Cruise Sells Out in a Single Day!

We get started with this impressive news of Oceania Cruises’ 180-day world cruise selling out in just one day! Who said there is no demand in cruising!

Bookings opened for the public on January 27 2021 and even though these types of sailings usually attract loyal cruisers in this case more than one-third of all bookings came from first-timers and those first booking as an Oceania guest.

The line’s 2023 Around the World in 180 Days voyage is the most extensive and in-depth of any world cruise available. Calling on 96 ports in 33 countries across four continents.

The Insignia cruise ship will sail this dream offering departing San Francisco California on January 15 2023. The 684-passenger vessel will end the cruise back in San Francisco on July 13 2023 and the voyage is costing guests over $41000! Let us know what you think of this and if it’s worth the price in the comments.

More Cancellations for Two Carnival Cruise Ships

Carnival Cruise Line has extended its suspension for just two ships that are based out of Australia. This won’t impact the operations out of the United States but will still have a huge impact on the industry down under.

So Carnival Splendor cruises are now cancelled through 28 June 2021. Previously cruises were suspended through May 19 2021. Carnival Spirit cruises are now cancelled through September 12 2021 and previously they were suspended through June 12 2021.

Carnival Cruise Line has already stated that guests who are impacted by the further cancellations should expect an email very soon about their options. It’s just going to take even longer until resuming cruises safely can happen.

For now cruise ships operating in Australian waters with a passenger capacity of over 100 are banned until March 17 2021.

Quantum of the Seas to Remain in Singapore

Royal Caribbean has announced an extension of Quantum of the Seas‘ season of cruises to nowhere out of Singapore. The island nation is one of the few countries where cruising has been allowed to proceed successfully for the last few months.

Royal Caribbean’s decision was expected as Quantum of the Seas was initially scheduled to reposition to Alaska for the summer season. The cruise line has been exceedingly successful with short ocean cruises from Singapore which are limited to Singapore residents only.

Royal Caribbean has been successfully sailing in Singapore since December 2020 and will continue to do so between March 22 and June 21 2021.

Quantum of the Seas is one of the few cruise ships sailing worldwide and is certainly proving that guests can indeed do cruising safely. The line has introduced some groundbreaking measures to provide guests with peace of mind while sailing.

World’s First Humanoid Robotic Bartender at Sea

I thought Royal Caribbean was the cruise line leading the way with robots! Well MSC Cruises has revealed the world’s first humanoid robotic bartender at sea named Rob!

So Rob will be working very hard at the very futuristic venue MSC Starship Club aboard the MSC Virtusoa which was recently delivered to the cruise line on February 1 2021. The club will have 3D holograms an immersive digital art wall and a 12-seat infinity digital interactive table giving guests the opportunity to explore space with their own personalized galactic tour.

There will be specific vertical digital cockpits where guests can make their orders. Rob will then get to work using all his skills to make the perfect cocktail. He’ll be able to cater to many guests thanks to him being able to speak eight languages.

Rob will be able to showcase his dance moves along with telling people jokes riddles and space trivia offering a witty bar experience just like with a real bartender.

The MSC Starship Club has been a concept that’s been in the making for almost six years. The cruise line has been pushing the boundaries and innovations to make it a reality. MSC Virtuosa will begin sailing this April in the Mediterranean.

Royal Caribbean Crew Member Vaccine Requirement

Royal Caribbean has confirmed that crew members will need to be vaccinated before going back to work on the cruise ship. In a letter recently sent to the crew members the company speaks about the new opportunities the vaccine offers for them to go back to work as well as offer protection to their family and the guests onboard.

There is as yet very little known how the cruise company will be administering the thousands of crew members with the vaccine. The process will likely be different depending on where each crew member lives when they are supposed to be boarding and most importantly when ships will be allowed to sail.

Royal Caribbean has said it will continue to update its crew members with the necessary information and has asked for patience to go through the details.

No updates yet on guests needing to be vaccinated. A lot of it depends on the CDC and the requirements needed for the Conditional Sailing Order.

Royal Caribbean Not to Cancel Canada Sailings

Staying with Royal Caribbean it has just come out that the cruise line will not be canceling any of its Canada sailings including departures from the country port visits and cruises to Alaska.

The cruise line says it is working through potential options with the Government of Canada and the USA and the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA). For now the cruise line is asking guests to keep their bookings until an alternative solution is completed. Canada announced recently that cruise ships are banned from its waters for one year.

Carnival Options on Longer Sailings

And we end with a huge development from Carnival Cruise Line. New options have been detailed for those who have a booking on a cruise which is 8-days or longer. A letter has been sent out which details two options.

Option 1 lets guests maintain their exiting booking while the cruise line continues to explore options on the longer sailings. Guests will automatically receive a $100 onboard credit should the voyage still go ahead.

If that cruise is eventually cancelled and guests have not yet received the enhanced value offer they can instead take advantage of what other guests can receive on other sailings during the suspension of operations.

For option 2 guests may choose to cancel their booking any time by March 31 2021 and receive a full refund. The future cruise credit and onboard credit if any can be retained as long as the next cruise is booked by September 30 2021 for a cruise that departs by April 30 2023.

This provides peace of mind for those who were worried about the longer sailings. In November 2020 Carnival announced that cruises over seven days through October 31 2021 were to be temporarily removed as a precaution and while dealing with resolving the details with the CDC.

All the details on the options and our full report on this new development which came out last night can be found on the website.

Pet lovers from around the city gathered on Saturday for an annual event that draws dozens of humans with their furry four-legged companions to compete for best costume.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the street parties and traditional parades at the Sambadrome were canceled to avoid crowds but the dogs had their day anyway with the “Blocao”. The word is a mixture of “bloco” that refers to the traditional Carnival street parties and “cao” — dog in Portuguese.

Dozens of costumed dogs joined their owners for a Carnival parade inside a private club in the Recreio dos Bandeirantes neighborhood. The parade normally takes place along Avenida Atlantica bordering Copacabana beach but this year Rio´s mayor banned any public celebration.

“The Cariocas (as Rio’s residents are called) carry the joy of Carnival in their veins. We invited a restricted audience for a commemorative and distanced event that prevents Carnival 2021 from ending as if nothing had happened” said Marco Antonio Marinho 66 who has been organizing the canine parade for 18 years.

“In this pandemic many people adopted dogs to cure their loneliness in isolation. Faced with COVID-19 we are together with our dogs” he said.

Out on the parade floor were Boquino a dog dressed in a clown costume and Cleo in a Snow White outfit as well as a red-bedecked Sandy.

For many participants the pet parade was an opportunity to leave confinement for a moment and regain some of the usual Carnival joy.

“I could not miss the parade today. It is a spacious airy and very familiar place” said Francisca Freire who joined the parade with a Yorkshire dog Eve dressed like a doctor in a medical apron with a mask and stethoscope. Freire and her dog have participated in the pet parades for six years.

“It is an escape from quarantine.

Listen

BINCHE Belgium — In normal times the small town of Binche in southern Belgium would be bursting with excitement.

It’s this time of the year when craftsmen put the finishing touches to the vibrant costumes ostrich-feather hats and wax mask of performers known as Gilles. The whole town braces itself for the carnival festivities that have been labeled a “Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity” by UNESCO.

Not this year though.

The coronavirus has brought to a sudden halt one of Europe’s oldest surviving street carnivals.

On a frosty morning this week downtown streets were empty of the sound of drum rehearsals and cafes remained shut amid strict anti-coronavirus measures implemented across Belgium.

“All the inhabitants in Binche live and take part in the carnival” said Daniel Pourbaix who heads the association for the protection of Binche folklore. “So when there is no carnival everyone is sad.”

The carnival has roots dating back to the Middle Ages and normally draws thousands of aficionados. It takes place during the three days before Lent reaching its climax on Mardi Gras when the Gilles characters with their green spectacles and thin moustaches dance to the sound of brass and clarinets.

Rather than organizing a cut-rate festival this year organizers have opted for its cancellation. But the Gilles will be present all the same — floating in the air as their gigantic heads have been deployed on poles across the city.

To warm hearts Binche residents have also been invited to set up mimosa displays close to their windows — the yellow flower is a symbol of the carnival — and to wear Gilles face masks.

In addition to the sadness at the cancellation the economic impact will be difficult to swallow for all the craftsmen who rely on the carnival season for their revenues. To help artisans like Karl Kersten go though the crisis Binche’s folklore association has launched a solidarity fund.

Kersten a fourth-generation tailor of Gilles costumes spends all year preparing for the carnival season and rents about 1000 costumes during the festivities. This year his shelves are full.

“It’s quite simple this year we won’t get anything. A big zero” he said. “Hopefully with the vaccines we will be able to resume our activities next year.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vY2Fybml2YWwtY2FuY2VsZWQtcmlvLWphbmVpcm8tZmlyc3QtMTQxNzAwODUyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival is canceled in Rio de Janeiro for the first time in 109 years but performers are already gearing up for an epic ...,"Yahoo Celebrity

The People’s Republic of China has more warships than any other power in the world including the United States and it could have global naval dominance—at least in pure numbers—within a decade. However The People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) still has considerable ways to go to match the power of the United States Navy said Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.

“I want to make clear that China cannot match the United States when it comes to naval power” Esper said at a RAND Corporation event last Wednesday Business Insider reported.

“Even if we stopped building new ships it would take the [People's Republic of China] years to close the gap when it comes to our capability on the high seas” he added. “Ship numbers are important but they don't tell the whole story. They do not address the types of ships and the capabilities of the vessels being counted; the skill of the crews that operate them; the prowess of the officers that lead them; or the ways in which we fight and sustain them.”

The Numbers Game

Those numbers could still be somewhat significant.

The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is now building its third and more importantly its largest aircraft carrier. And unlike its two current carriers this one is more than just a copy of Soviet-era designs. It will still be several years before the carrier is fitted out and years more before it will be ready to begin its sea trials however this third carrier will likely be finished far more quickly than the Shandong the PLAN’s second carrier and the first to be built in China.

Beyond carriers the PLAN currently fields twenty modern Aegis-type destroyers which are supported by eleven older (non-Aegis-type) destroyers. Of those twenty newer warships eighteen were commissioned only within the past seven years.

The U.S. Response: Future Forward

To counter the growing maritime threat posed by China Esper also announced an ambitious plan to expand not just the size but the strength and reach of the U.S. Navy with a range of unmanned and autonomous ships submarines and aircraft. He has laid out a plan that would expand the U.S. fleet from the current 293 vessels to more than 355.

The plan would require adding tens of billions of dollars to the U.S. Navy’s budget between now and 2045. Esper said that increasing the funding for shipbuilding is necessary to maintain readiness and sustain a significantly larger force.

“The future naval force will be more balanced in its ability to deliver lethal effects from the air from the sea and from under the sea” Esper added.

The United States Navy currently operates eleven aircraft carriers which is more than any other nation but a fear is that lower-cost hypersonic missiles and powerful torpedoes such as Russia's nuclear-armed Poseidon could be “carrier killers.” This is where more but smaller ships could be crucial but many could be optionally manned or even fully autonomous.

The future U.S. Navy could be one that would be made up of many smaller surface combatants that could present a major shift in how the United States conducts naval warfare in years and even decades to come Esper suggested.

Such a shift could is already seen in the new guided-missile frigate program which includes ships with increased lethality survivability and capacity to conduct distributed warfare; while new drones such as the Sea Hunter could be used to track and even hunt enemy submarines autonomously for months at a time.

Esper reaffirmed that China is the top U.S. security threat and added that the Indo-Pacific region will be a “priority theater” for the United States. “Not only is this region important because it is a hub of global trade and commerce it is also the epicenter of great power competition with China.”

The global COVID-19 pandemic has forced many airlines to adapt their fleets and networks and to reschedule hundreds of deliveries scheduled not just in 2020 and 2021 but also those in years ahead as airlines look to rework their balance sheets to better prepare themselves for the long run back to profitability. With a decrease in worldwide passenger demand of more than 50% the last thing most carriers want at the moment is having more new aircraft parked preventing them from turning their owners a profit.

In that vein Delta Air Lines has announced it will delay the delivery of its first Airbus A321neo to 2022. The new model was originally expected to be delivered in 2020 but the current situation has forced the American carrier to delay even more of its plans both in terms of fleet restructuring and network growth.

Delta has an order of 100 A321neos slated to be delivered in the next three years. However the carrier is negotiating with the European manufacturer to adapt the delivery schedule. According to the initial agreement Airbus would deliver 18 aircraft in 2021 another 20 in 2022 and the remaining 68 by 2023.

With the delay of one year the airline expects to receive the new aircraft when the market starts to recover. Delta intends to finish all of its Airbus A321ceo — short for current engine option — deliveries by this year the model of which the carrier is the largest operator in the world. Compared to its predecessor the A321neo boasts a 16% cut in fuel consumption up to 75% reduction of noise and 50% lower emissions.

Over the course of this year Delta expects to receive 33 new aircraft: three Airbus A220-100s five A220-300s 22 A321-200s and three Airbus A330-900neos. Those wide-body aircraft are a crucial piece of Delta’s plan to replace its Boeing 767-300ERs which according to planespotters.net are an average of over 22-years-old.

The Atlanta-based airline however does not expect to receive any Airbus A350s this year and will wait until 2022 for the next two additions to the airline’s newest widebody fleet. In January Delta received two Airbus A220s and four A321ceos setting it up as the carrier that received the most aircraft from Airbus that month.

Bamboo Airways First A321neo of 2021

Despite Delta pushing back its A321neo deliveries this week the A321 continues to serve as a bastion of Airbus’s narrowbody portfolio for carriers worldwide. On Feb. 7 Vietnamese low-cost carrier Bamboo Airways added its first unit of 2021 as VN-A222 was delivered from Hamburg Germany to Hanoi Vietnam’s Noi Bai International Airport and began operating the next day. Since then it has been connecting Hanoi with different airports in China as the celebration of the Chinese Lunar New Year continues to strengthen both China’s domestic market and nearly all international routes to and from the country.

With this new aircraft Bamboo Airways is pushing forward with its objective of taking delivery of 30 Airbus A321neos by 2025 as part of its expansion plan to 100 aircraft by that year. The aircraft officially labeled as an A321neo ACF — Air Cabin Flex — includes two business classes plus economy class while its capacity is reduced from the original 244 seats to 223 seats.

This is the second aircraft that Bamboo has received this year after the delivery of an Embraer E190-100LR from aircraft leasing company CDB Aviation.

“As Bamboo Airways eyes further roadmap development anchored in the carrier’s strategy to have a route network connecting all regions of Vietnam we look forward to supporting their efforts to meet the increasing demand from the country’s burgeoning tourism industry” commented Sign Kadouh CDB Aviation’s Head of Asia Pacific in a statement.

While formal binding agreements will not actually come into force until the airline exits bankruptcy protection most lessors have now signed agreements. Fifteen lessors have exposure to Thai to the tune of 40 aircraft according to Cirium fleets data.

“We are at a stage where we have signed all our agreements. We are well beyond LoIs [letters of intent]” one lessor with exposure says.

He adds that his company’s agreement includes a caveat that the lessor if unsatisfied with Thai’s rehabilitation plan could pull its aircraft out and scrap the deal.

“If we don’t like what we see we can walk away” he says. “We have not done [this in the past] because normally we have worked jointly with the lessee to come up with a plan that we are satisfied with.”

A second lessor with exposure says his company has also made agreements with Thai and is now waiting to see the contents of the rehabilitation plan which is now being written by the airline’s plan preparers and has a filing deadline of 2 March. The rehabilitation planners include six people plus EY Corporate Advisory Services.

“I don’t think anyone will make any aggressive movements at this moment… We [ourselves] are just waiting” he says.

In addition a person acting for some of Thai’s lessors says almost all of those lessors have now reached agreement while the ones that have not “are very close”.

In a 21 October virtual meeting with lessors Thai outlined a broad plan for its future fleet and gave lessors a 4 November deadline to submit their best offers. After receiving responses to that tender it began bilateral discussions with each lessor.

The Thai flag carrier has not disclosed publicly which aircraft will remain in its fleet and this is likely to be stated in the draft of its upcoming rehabilitation plan but lessors and people close to the process expect its Airbus A380s Boeing 747s and A330s not to be part of the streamlined fleet.

LESSORS FIRST

With the lessors now largely dealt with Thai’s rehabilitation planners still have several weeks to draft a proposal which will then need to be voted on by creditors.

Alan Polivnick a partner at Watson Farley & Williams who is acting for some of Thai’s creditors says the airline wanted to conclude negotiations with lessors first as this would give clarity on the future fleet thereby simplifying negotiations with other creditors and suppliers.

“Thai is dividing creditors into groups for example with lessors in one group and aviation service providers in another. The airline decided to deal with lessors first given that clarity on the carrier’s future fleet could help it reach agreements with other creditors and suppliers” he tells Cirium.

“Their focus was first on dealing with the lessors partly because I think the issue is: which aircraft are staying in the fleet? Which ones are going out? What’s the model going to be?”

He says for example that engine component suppliers to the airline would need to know whether the 777s are staying in fleet or whether the A350s are staying rather than the 787s.

“To some degree that’s going to determine how you are going to deal with the debts from Thai” he adds. “If the engines are going to continue to be part of the Thai fleet you are going to be more willing to look at some sort of longer-term solution but if you know that the engines are simply not going to be flying anymore and there is not going to be any business from Thai then your focus and your priorities are slightly different.”

TAKING A HARD LINE

Lawyers have been assisting Thai’s creditors in filing debt-repayment applications as part of the restructuring.

“What we’re seeing is to some extent they are taking quite a hard line with the debts and with the negotiations” Polivnick says.

Similarly John Frangos a partner and deputy director of dispute resolution at Tilleke & Gibbins in Bangkok tells Cirium that Thai has objected to almost every single debt-repayment application that his firm has prepared and submitted on behalf of clients which are creditors to the airline.

“It appears to be a clear strategy of the plan preparer to object to many debt-repayment applications as a way to try to reduce the overall debt amount” he suggests.

“[Thai] have been objecting to most applications. At least all the ones that we are working on – almost every single one. It seems to me that it’s part of their strategy to use blanket objections. At least in our cases most of the objections seem meritless.”

Cirium has contacted Thai Airways for comment.

DEALING WITH BONDHOLDERS

Thai disclosed back in July that it had Bt71.6 billion ($2.4 billion) of outstanding debentures a type of unsecured bond due between 2020 and 2034.

A source close to the process adds that now that negotiations with lessors are coming to a close it is other creditors including bondholders that remain to be negotiated with.

The bondholders are a “very mixed bag” of people the person says adding that none of them are keen to have their debt written down.

Buyers of corporate bonds tend to be institutional investors due to the large sums of money involved but could also include unsophisticated investors who invest via mutual funds.

This person thinks that Thai’s unsecured bondholders should be given a debt-for-equity swap after which the government could inject new money into the carrier.

“Thai has got too much debt and just shuffling the debt by saying ‘We will push you out five years’ doesn’t make the debt go away. They really need to do a debt-for-equity swap on the debt” the person says. “The company needs real money not just [to] magic debt into equity. That just removes debt; it doesn’t give cash.”

MEETING THE DEADLINE

Thai as well as the country’s government has been adamant in public statements that it intends to submit a plan and to do so on time. Most recently deputy prime minister Wissanu Krea-ngam expressed his confidence that the airline would submit on time according to a 9 February article in the Bangkok Post.

Earlier in January Thai Airways’ acting president Chansin Treenuchagron who is also one of the rehabilitation planners said the airline was working diligently to submit the plan by its specified timeframe although shortly after that announcement Thai exercised an option under the law to extend its deadline by an additional month to 2 March. Thai is not allowed any further extensions under law.

A lessor with exposure to Thai says the extension was no surprise given that mark-up by the airline on an agreement with the lessor had already reflected a later filing time.

WFW’s Polivnick believes that Thai’s failing to submit a plan by 2 March is a “fairly remote possibility” given the severity of the consequences.

“If they don’t file it and the court ends the rehabilitation the airline will have to file for dissolution and I suspect that creditors all over the world will be bringing claims straight away to seize Thai assets whether in Thailand or overseas” he says.

Thai’s application to enter business rehabilitation was approved by the country’s Central Bankruptcy Court last year on 27 May at which time an automatic “stay” on creditor claims came into effect. That stay restricts the ability of creditors to enforce any security or start any other litigation proceedings against Thai Airways. It also imposes a moratorium on creditors’ rights including – crucially for lessors – the right to pursue action to repossess property that is the subject of lease or hire purchase.

Polivnick adds that the more likely scenario is that Thai submits a draft plan which would then require amendments if creditors give negative feedback.

Despite the law being quite clear that only two one-month extensions are permitted Tilleke & Gibbins’ Frangos does not see the process collapsing if Thai misses the 2 March deadline.

“The law is straightforward here and I know Thai has been adamant that they will submit in time but if they don’t finish and they do legitimately need more time then at least for me personally I can’t see the whole process unravelling because they can’t submit by the deadline” he says.

“Everyone will be frustrated of course that Thai can’t submit the plan by the deadline but practically speaking if they can’t I’m sure they will ask for more time.”

WHAT’S KILLING THE CATERPILLARS?

Most That Turn into Kamehameha Butterflies are not Surviving

(Mānoa Cliffs Restoration Area O‘ahu) – State researchers working to re-establish the population of Hawai‘i’s official state insect the Kamehameha butterfly (pulelehua) are being deterred by predators that are feeding on caterpillars before they have a chance to develop into butterflies.

Several times each week entomologist Will Haines with the DLNR Division of Forestry and Wildlife and Kupu member Jana Maravi hike into this protected restoration area to place the caterpillars of the Kamehameha butterfly onto native māmaki plants their most common food source. They have remote cameras set up in the trees hooked to digital video recorders as they attempt to find out why the caterpillars are disappearing.

Haines explained “The Kamehameha butterfly has been declining in a lot of its historical range particularly in the southern Ko‘olau Mountains on O‘ahu where it no longer occurs naturally. It seems to be good habitat but one of the challenges we are seeing is the presence of so many introduced predators. We’re trying to figure out which of the predators is responsible for the decline. It seems to mostly affect the caterpillar stage of the butterfly.”

The cameras are showing that non-native introduced birds are the likely culprits along with some ant species that Haines said “are very bad predators of caterpillars.” The video evidence of ants as suspects at Mānoa Cliffs is limited but the researchers believe at other locations they are eating the caterpillars before they fully develop into butterflies.

Although the Kamehameha butterfly still occurs on most of the main Hawaiian Islands its range has shrunk on every island. There are few accessible places on Oahu where you can still see the butterfly. Haines said “They are definitely not as abundant as they used to be. If we can figure out the predator piece of the puzzle hopefully we can take steps to reduce the trend.”

People particularly children can learn all about the Kamehameha butterfly in a recently released educational book “Butterfly for a King.” You can read more about the book in this companion news release: https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/blog/2021/02/13/nr21-035/

Koch was the subject of a Journal Star article which ran Nov. 24 on his 102nd birthday. The lifelong central Illinois resident was still exceedingly sharp and he related memories of the area that few are left to recall.

Koch was born in 1918 on a farm in rural Tremont at a time when the fields were still plowed by horses. The Spanish Flu was raging around the world and both he and his mother got sick.

“My mother caught it and I wasn’t quite 2 weeks old” Koch said. “She got it and she was nursing me and her milk went bad. I wasn’t getting any nourishment and the doctor said I wouldn’t make it. He didn’t tell her outright I wouldn’t live but he said ‘I wouldn’t give 25 cents for his chances.’ That’s pretty close to not worth much.”

Both Koch and his mother survived and she went on to have nine more children. All 13 were born on the farm.

Koch started working at Caterpillar right out of high school and worked there for 30 years. He also spent time in Europe during World War II serving as a medic. Though he had many adventures in the service he never saw a shot fired in anger.

Married to his first wife Halo for 45 years and his second wife Nancy for 22 years Koch was surrounded by family and well-tended into his later years. Though his four children live all across the United States his stepchildren and extended family live nearby. They all gathered virtually to celebrate Koch’s 102nd birthday.

“His birthday was a big Zoom call with all of his kids and grandkids from all over the country” said Koch’s son John who lives in Colorado. “He was not his normal self on the birthday call but that was before he knew anything. Normally he’s perky and making jokes and things like that and on the birthday call he was more blah. Then he started complaining to me and my brother the doctor about the lack of taste and he said ‘This is not normal for me I wonder if I have COVID.’”

Cleo Koch got tested the day after Thanksgiving and his other son a physician in the Seattle area retrieved the results over the weekend.

“I had access to his online medical stuff through OSF. When I called him I realized that it might be available so while I was talking to him I checked his results and it was positive” Gary Koch said. “He didn’t feel bad. He didn't have a fever he didn’t have any cough he didn’t have any shortness of breath. He felt tired and he had had some GI symptoms but that was sort of a sensitive part of his physiology but they weren’t terrible.”

That Monday Cleo Koch got an infusion of monoclonal antibodies making him one of the first area residents to receive the newly approved treatment that had just arrived in central Illinois. It ultimately didn’t seem to help John Koch said.

“After a day or two he felt a little bit better then more tired more tired more tired” John Koch said. “On Monday after the infusion my stepsiblings my Tremont family said we need somebody with him 24/7. Bless their hearts they rounded up themselves and also grandkids ... just someone to stay with him at night etc. Then on Friday or Saturday morning I sent everyone an email saying I’m coming to Tremont because I needed to take some of the pressure off them.”

No one anticipated that Cleo Koch wouldn’t pull through. Even though he was 102 he was in very good shape and COVID didn’t seem to be making him that sick. He was the only one who had a sense of what was coming.

“My niece was with him that night Saturday night and Cleo told her ‘I have about eight hours left and I’m not sure I’m gonna see John’ and of course she said ‘Oh come on you are fine you are gonna come out of this.’ This was 4 or 5 in the morning” John Koch said.

On Sunday morning Dec. 6 John Koch was walking through the concourse of the St. Louis airport when he got a call from his brother Gary who gave him instructions on how to care for their father. A short time later Gary called back.

“I was in the rental car driving out of the airport ... and I thought ‘Well that’s odd I just talked to him 20 minutes earlier’ and Gary said ‘He’s gone’ and I kind of couldn’t believe it” John Koch said.

Cleo Koch died about seven and a half hours after making his pronouncement.

“Essentially he just died in his sleep while taking a nap on his favorite couch” John Koch said. “In some respects man wouldn’t we all like to go that way? To be 102 and die in your sleep and never go to a nursing home.”

More:At 102 he has survived the Spanish flu World War II and thus far COVID-19

Though Cleo Koch didn’t suffer the respiratory symptoms that typically cause death in COVID patients there is no doubt in Gary Koch’s mind that his father died of COVID.

“He was in pretty good shape otherwise and we think he would probably have gone ... well you never know but I think it’s quite conceivable that he had another year or two of functionality left possibly longer” he said.

Cleo Koch was buried with a brief graveside service attended only by family who were already in the area but there are plans for a bigger celebration this fall with the hope that the pandemic will finally be under control.

As a very sociable man Cleo Koch didn’t enjoy the social restrictions imposed during the pandemic. He very much missed the family’s annual pork chop fry held each year after harvest on the farm where Cleo Koch grew up.

“That’s when the out-of-towners fly in and we gather on the old family farm. We have a hayrack ride and there can easily be like 250 people there” John Koch said.

This year the gathering will also include a celebration of life for Cleo Koch.

According to DPI Chief Executive James Kruse the retail real estate company has spent the time looking to “preserve protect and renew” its 21 retail properties and two office buildings.



That includes remodeling some of its centers which are located in California and Utah and are often anchored by grocery stores and other daily use stores.



“For a lot of our shopping centers we’re lucky that we have grocery stores dollar stores Big Lots that are open and operating and doing fairly well which anchor most of our shopping centers” said DPI President Fred Vitt. “They’ve been paying their rent. There are a lot of small shopping centers we’re working with; we try to focus on deferrals if we can to help them out.”



Kruse said DPI has been flexible with tenants during the pandemic and at times has granted rent relief. Such moves he explained are in the best interests of both the tenants and DPI.



“It’s important to preserve tenants” Kruse said. “If we were to lose one of our ethnic restaurants … there’s not another one of those restaurant types standing in line waiting to lease” he said. “It’s important to preserve those people … there’s nobody else that we’re going to be able to talk to. The tenant pool is very shallow and not very populated.”





Extensive experience

With a history that dates back nearly 50 years DPI has extensive experience in the retail real estate market.



The company was founded in 1972 by Peter Doerken who later joined forces with industry leader Allen Lynch to grow the business.



DPI’s local properties include the 445 Douglas Building in El Segundo a property that is 100% leased; the 60000-square-foot Norwalk Plaza Shopping Center; and the 81000-square-foot El Dorado Shopping Center in Long Beach.



While the coronavirus has accelerated a decline in retail real estate experts agree that grocery-anchored centers are faring better than other retail assets at the moment.

“There’s been a lot of capital attracted to these grocery-anchored centers” CBRE Group Inc.’s Derrick Moore said.



Newmark Group’s Matt Berres added that grocery stores saw strong sales numbers during the pandemic making centers with these stores more desirable to investors.

Another positive for DPI according to Kruse is the recent elevation of Vitt to the role of president.



“He’s like the Swiss army knife; he’s done it all. His appointment as president was overdue and very well deserved” Kruse said. “He knows everything about the assets and how the company works.”



For a dozen years Kruse added Vitt has headed up all management within the company and has overseen leasing efforts as well.



Open to acquisitions

Although DPI is largely focused on its existing properties the company is open to acquisitions — but only if the deal is the right fit.



“We’ve not really bought a lot not because we don’t want to but things are still very expensive and pricey and the other thing is getting the financing for these acquisitions” Kruse said.



DPI Retail has done some ground-up development but Kruse said he prefers existing center acquisitions.



“There’s a lot of risk in the construction phase and from the ground-up part of the business” he said. “You never know what you will encounter. We like to see what we are buying.”



DPI Vitt added likes to “stay in our lane.”



“That’s our expertise: redevelopment of existing product. The entitlement process can take a long time and a lot of money. We would rather go through and rehab a center” he said.



Kruse added that this approach allows the company to “get our money working for us sooner” rather than having to wait years for a center to be built.



Vitt said DPI looks for centers where the company can add value. This need could come from an anchor store lease that is nearly over a property with a successful anchor but other vacancies in the center refurbishing the area or demolishing some of the center and rebuilding portions of it.



Kruse said that while DPI is looking at new opportunities theaters fitness centers and other stores being closed is a complication.



“Do you have a tenancy to survive the pandemic? There are a lot of folks who are not paying rent” Kruse said of his acquisition criteria.

The share of foreign investment in Swiss commercial real estate fell from 15% before 2011 to 5% between 2017 and 2019 according to new research. The issue of foreigners buying cheap Swiss property during the Covid-19 pandemic is being discussed in Bern.

Foreign investment in commercial buildings in Switzerland reached CHF750 million ($841 million) a year or an average of 11% of the total investment (CHF6.8 billion) between 2011 and 2020 according to research by CBRE Switzerland a commercial real estate services company.

Before 2011 the proportion of foreign investment was higher (15%) especially between 2005 and 2008 when many international investors entered the Swiss market before partly withdrawing after the financial crisis.

The exit of foreign investors from the Swiss market has been more pronounced in recent years (2017 to 2019) CBRE said. This is especially due to the inflation of real estate prices and the high cost of the Swiss franc. Foreign investment represented only 5% of total investment during this period.

2020 stood out as an exceptional year due to “a few very large transactions” CBRE added.

Many of the foreign buyers who invested in Switzerland over the past decade came from Britain Germany France and Israel. Asian investors played a minor role with the exception of the hotel sector it said.

In Bern some politicians are fearful that the coronavirus pandemic may push Swiss companies to sell their properties and that foreign investors could snap them up at low prices.

A legal affairs commission of the House of Representatives proposed in January to temporarily tighten the “Lex Koller” a federal law restricting foreign purchases of Swiss property. The commission agreed to extend the restrictions to buildings intended for a commercial or professional activity. The parliamentary initiative must still be approved by the Senate legal affairs commission.

This growth indicates that occupiers are likely to expand their operations owing to investment-friendly policies of the State government CBRE said.

By Telangana Today Published Date - 14 February 2021 08:03 PM

Hyderabad: Hyderabad’s organised real estate industry has witnessed investments of about $1 billion during 2019-2020 and is expected to see further surge in investments in the coming quarters. Majority of the investments will go into the development of commercial offices and residential skyscrapers.

This growth indicates that occupiers are likely to expand their operations owing to investment-friendly policies of the State government CBRE said. It also expects sustained occupier interest in quality developments in the coming quarters in the city.

CBRE’s Capital Markets & Land division saw India’s largest land deal of 2020 in Hyderabad with one of the top-tier developers in the city Rajapushpa Properties having bought 25 acres of land in Narsingi Western Hyderabad. The deal includes 18 acres of direct purchase and seven acres of joint development together proposed for development of a high-end residential township.

The Rs 800-crore land deal assumes significance as the real estate demand and investor confidence returned to Hyderabad real estate market post the pandemic-induced lockdown. Scheduled to be launched in the first quarter of 2021 the project intends to capture the accelerated demand in India’s top-performing real estate market that will give an economic fillip to the sector’s revival.

Rajapushpa Properties holds a large portfolio of residential and commercial office projects in Hyderabad and aims to dedicate a large part of this proposed high-end residential project to greenery and landscape through state-of-the-art planning world-class amenities and infrastructure.

Anshuman Magazine chairman & CEO-India South East Asia Middle East & Africa CBRE said “We at CBRE are optimistic that the real estate market is going to bounce back with immense resilience that it has shown in the last few months.

Hyderabad is one of the top-performing real estate markets in India owing to the infrastructure pro-active government and robust office space take-up by MNCs. The market remained resilient with the residential market in its recovery phase with volumes coming back to pre-Covid levels. Also the unit sales and capital values across micro-markets continue to remain strong and expected to further escalate over the next few quarters CBRE noted.

Updated 2:30 p.m. CT Friday

Water has returned throughout Houston but it will still take more time for pressure to go back to normal according to Houston Public Works.

“We are making steady sustainable progress on bringing the system back up” said Public Works Director Carol Haddock. “We are confident we will be able to maintain this progress. It's going to take time to do it in a measured manner.”

Downtown buildings have begun to see pressure restored as well as the Texas Medical Center which late Thursday told the city it had enough pressure to repressurize its own system Haddock said.

The system saw “less than a couple hundred breaks” due to the pipes being larger and underground Haddock said. Public Works fielded almost 3000 calls by the end of the day Thursday for water breaks the majority of which were in homes and businesses.

The state of Texas requires a minimum pipe pressure of 35 pounds per square inch or PSI for normal operations. The minimum for emergency operations is 20 PSI.

Houston dropped below 20 PSI this week triggering a boil water advisory.

Pressure has since returned somewhat rising above 26 PSI late yesterday. Once pressure comes back to normal the city will pull samples and send them to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality which typically sends back results within 24 hours before lifting the advisory.

The goal is to have water pressure back to 35 PSI by the end of the day Friday and to lift the boil water advisory by Monday — though if more pipes burst in that time it could push back the timeline Haddock told Houston Matters on Friday.

“Realistically there will be 36-48 hours before we get the all-clear” she told host Craig Cohen. “The mayor has been saying that he's hoping we are out Monday. We are on target for getting this out on Monday if we continue on the progress that we are on today.”

Haddock added that lack of funding for public utilities played a role. Houston is under a revenue cap which limits the growth of property tax revenue the city can collect something Mayor Sylvester Turner has said makes it difficult to invest in such upgrades.

""Most utilities are underfunded” Haddock told Cohen. “The city of Houston itself does have a significant backlog of infrastructure that needs to be upgraded and replaced. We continue to work on that.""

HERE’S WHAT WE KNOW While water pressure in Houston continues to rise after plummeting due to the extreme cold the city remains under a boil water notice through at least Sunday. Much of Harris County is also under a boil water notice.

All 254 counties in Texas are under a disaster declaration.

Gov. Greg Abbott made the power outage crisis an emergency item for this legislative sessions and asked the legislature to prioritize weatherizing the grid.

House Speaker Dade Phelan R-Beaumont has called for a hearing on ERCOT’s response.

HISD schools and offices will remain closed through at least Friday. Other districts colleges and universities in the region have also modified their schedules due to the storm. See the full list.

Fort Bend County has set up a system to report price gouging during the winter storm amid reports of skyrocketing prices for necessities across Texas.

County residents can fill out a form online or call 832-471-1600 to report an incident of price gouging.

A similar system set up Wednesday in Houston for residents to report incidents of price gouging received more than 450 complaints in less than 20 hours Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee the chief civil attorney for Texas’ largest county told the Associated Press.

""The main types of things we’re seeing is hotels setting prices at ridiculous rates” Menefee told AP. ""We’ve seen allegations of packs of water being sold for two to three times the normal price or packs of water being divvied up and the individual bottles being sold at excessive prices.”

The Texas Attorney General’s Office urged residents who suspect they are victims of price gouging to file a complaint with their office. Violators may be required to reimburse consumers and can face civil penalties of up to $10000 per violation. Additional penalties of up to $250000 can be imposed if the victims are elderly.

Houston and Harris County will resume COVID-19 testing and vaccinations this weekend after being put on hold this week due to the winter storm.

The Houston Health Department said it was contacting 4784 people Friday and Saturday for second-dose appointments this weekend for those who received a first dose between Jan. 18 and Jan. 23. Those who received doses at that time who don't hear from the city by Saturday afternoon should call 832-393-4220.

The department will schedule new appointments next week.

Harris County announced second-dose vaccinations will take place Friday noon-6 p.m. for people scheduled. All morning appointments were moved to noon according to Harris County Public Health. Normal COVID-19 vaccination operations resume Saturday at 8 a.m. for both first and second scheduled doses.

The M.O. Campbell San Jacinto Central and Lonestar College Cypress Center COVID-19 testing sites will also reopen at noon Friday. All HCPH mobile testing sites remain closed but the county said it expects all testing sites to reopen as normal beginning Monday.

The city had not announced plans to resume testing as of Friday morning.

Electricity remained on for most of Houston during the freeze overnight and into Friday morning after days of outages that left more than a million people without power in freezing temperatures across the region.

CenterPoint Energy's outage tracker showed more than 99% of customers with power as of 5:30 a.m. as the company continued to repair equipment damaged by the storm.

Remaining outages in the region are due to repair issues not lack of power generation Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said on Thursday.

Gov. Greg Abbott confirmed on Twitter that no residential power outages across the state are due to power generation issues.

As of this afternoon there are no residential power outages due to lack of power generation. If any residence doesn't have power it is due to downed power lines or the need for the power company to manually reconnect. If you don't have power contact your local power provider. — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) February 18 2021

Updated 6:12 p.m. CT Thursday

About 27000 Houston-area customers of CenterPoint Energy this week opened their email to an unpleasant surprise: a whopping $202102.16 bill from the electricity provider.

As you might imagine the bill was generated in error due to a technical issue the company said Thursday.

“Customers who received an e-mail notification showing an amount due of $202102.16 for natural gas should disregard and not pay it as they don't owe this amount” according to a statement from the company. “We are sorry for the inconvenience. This was only an email message error not a billing error.”

Customers were told to log in to their accounts online and view “current amount due” for the real total. Customers can expect an updated bill notification email Friday which will reflect the correct amount the company said.

So while people across the region are dealing with any number of problems related to the storm “paying $200000 to the energy company” is thankfully not one of them.

Faith leaders across the state are calling on legislators to winterize the Texas energy grid and supply people with food water and shelter.

In a press call religious leaders said their parishioners have been cold hungry and now many have busted pipes and permanent damage to their homes.

Others have dealt with the loss of family members.

""One of our member's sister and brother-in-law perished in a fire caused by not having electricity and by using other modes of heat"" said Jacqueline Hailey with New Hope Baptist Church of Houston.

Gov. Greg Abbott has asked the Texas legislature to update the state’s power generators after failures across the electric grid led to outages across Texas.

Millions of Texans this week lost power after record demand on the state’s power grid led to widespread sustained outages in part because power plants across the state were not prepared for the frigid weather. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas struggled to manage the grid as generators were dropping as fast as they were coming back online.

On Thursday Abbott told the legislature to make sure that doesn’t happen during future storms by placing new emergency items on the agenda tasking legislators with mandating and funding the weatherization of generators in the power system.

The move comes two days after Abbott made investigating ERCOT another emergency item for the legislature calling for reform in the wake of days of outages.

The state also announced Thursday that about 13 million Texans are under a boil water notice nearly double the total from Wednesday.

""We are not yet out of this but we're closer to this challenge being behind us” Abbott said at a Thursday press conference. “We will not stop until normalcy is restored to your lives. Until that moment comes though I ask all texans to continue your efforts to take the proper precautions needed to stay safe and to stay warm.”

Power has been returned to about 98% of Fort Bend County residents according to Fort Bend County Judge K.P. George. But despite the return of power to most residents many in the county continue to undergo frequent power and water outages George told Houston Matters host Craig Cohen on Thursday.

The biggest concerns people have are a boil-water notice price gouging and waiting for power to be completely restored. George said he has even gotten calls from residents boiling snow in order to flush their toilets.

""Some people are not just frustrated they are angry"" George said.

The county judge continued to tell residents to be patient as they waited for power to fully return. Those struggling the most are the elderly and families with newborn babies he said.

Growing uncertainty is beginning to take a toll on the residents who have been calling George with comments and concerns. George said he's unsure how to address many of the concerns himself as there was no estimated time of availability of when power will be restored.

“I'm not trying to blame anybody at this point but I hope we learn from our mistakes so we can at least better plan” George said.

George said he is doing what he can to listen to the voices of local residents and encourages those to reach out to other elected officials as well.

""I have been sleeping in my office the last three days so I can constantly communicate with our citizens"" he said.

A Houston boil water notice will likely be in effect until at least Monday as water pressure continues to slowly rise again throughout the city Mayor Sylvester Turner said.

Water pressure Wednesday dropped below 20 pounds per square inch a pressure point that triggered a requirement by the city to issue the notice. By 9 a.m. Thursday pressure returned to 23 PSI and at 10 a.m. the average was 26 PSI across the system according to Houston Public Works.

The city is now working to stabilize pressure at that level and build on that throughout the afternoon.

But while things are improving Turner said the city also has to continue testing the water in the coming days and said water would not be back until Sunday at the earliest though he expected Monday to be more likely.

Updated 7:50 a.m. CT Thursday

Power was restored overnight and this morning for thousands of Houstonians.

As of 7:30 a.m. Centerpoint Energy's online tracker showed some 46000 customers without power. That's the lowest number since early Monday morning when more than one million households had their power shut off as Houston was hit by severe winter weather and below-freezing temperatures.

GREAT NEWS: Most Harris County homes have power right now. 46k in our region are still down.

There's still a possibility of power losses but that has been reduced. Centerpoint tells me that everyone cut because of #ERCOT orders is back on. Crews are working on remaining homes. — Lina Hidalgo (@LinaHidalgoTX) February 18 2021

Still boil water notices remain in effect for millions of Greater Houston residents.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said water pressure should be back to normal by this afternoon but it may not be safe to drink by then.

""We probably won't be clear of having to boil the water until sometime Saturday morning. If we can do it before then we probably will"" Turner said to Town Square's Ernie Manouse.

City brought on a # of generators to increase water pressure. As more facilities come online water pressure should increase. Please report water main breaks. See water coming from someone's home please report especially if they are not there. Conserve water boil b/f using. st — Sylvester Turner (@SylvesterTurner) February 18 2021

The public health and infrastructure damage from the severe weather continues to be far reaching.

Since Monday Houston Public Works has received over 1500 calls reporting water leaks and water main breaks.

The combination of the freezing weather and lack of electricity has also caused a spike in carbon monoxide poisoning cases in Houston.

The Houston Fire Department has responded to over 100 calls of carbon monoxide poisoning during the last few days according to Fire Chief Samuel Peña.

Peña says using stoves ovens or grills as a heat source inside the home will likely lead to carbon monoxide poisoning.

“It is extremely dangerous it doesn’t take much for the carbon monoxide to build up in your homes and cause sickness and even death"" he said.

Harris County as a whole has documented more than 300 cases of carbon monoxide poisoning since temperatures plummeted Sunday night.

Dr. David Persse Chief Medical Officer for the City of Houston said we’re currently seeing an unprecedented number of cases in a very short time.

“We’ve had more carbon monoxide poisonings here recently than I can remember any other time in my career"" he said.

Carbon monoxide is tasteless and odorless. Warning signs include headaches fatigue and nausea.

Houston area officials say water and power could be restored in the next few days.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said water pressure should be back to normal by Thursday afternoon but it may not be safe to drink by then.

“We probably won’t be clear of having to boil the water until sometime Saturday morning. If we can do it before then we probably will” Turner said to Town Square’s Ernie Manouse.

Boil water notices have continued to impact millions of Greater Houston residents. In addition to Houston cities in Harris County that have issued official notices include Pasadena Clear Lake Baytown Tomball and Deer Park. The city of Galveston issued its own boil notice and has shut off water due to major water line breaks. The cities of Pearland Magnolia and parts of Sugar Land also have boil notices in effect.

Turner also said it will take a couple more days to get power back as well — though he said that the electric grid manager ERCOT just released an additional 900 megawatts to Centerpoint Energy which will restore more homes with electricity in the Houston area.

Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said despite the increase residents still need to be prepared to go a couple of days without power.

""The current increase may not be enough to cover every resident"" she said. ""We are in a direction where we see some hope.""

As of 5 p.m. some 1 million Centerpoint customers were still without power in the Houston area but Hidalgo said it’s a significant improvement from earlier in the week.

""That's actually the least number of customers out of power since that Monday morning around 1 am where so many neighborhoods lost power"" she said.

Nearly 80% of Galveston County was still without power as of Wednesday afternoon and county officials there say they’re not getting clarity on when power will be restored to most of their residents.

Nearly 80% of the County is still without power due to ERCOT mandated power outages. We continue to pressure the State and power providers to restore service to County residents ASAP. None of these entities have provided estimates on when power will be restored. — Galveston County TX (@GalvCoTx) February 17 2021

On Twitter Galveston County officials said they’re continuing to pressure the state and power providers to restore services to residents as soon as possible but they have not received estimates on when that will happen from either the state or ERCOT.

On a media call earlier today ERCOT officials said they still don't have a timeline for when power will be fully restored. But they hope that by tomorrow they'll have enough power to be able to rotate outages.

""The best case at this point is that today or tomorrow we're able to at least get back down to the point where all the consumers are experiencing outages that are no longer than say 30 minutes to an hour at a time"" said Dan Woodfin ERCOT's director of system operations.

The power outages combined with the boil water notices have also forced numerous grocery stores across Houston to close due to lack of power and low water pressure.

A spokesperson from HEB said the stores that are open are prioritizing eggs bread water and milk while a representative from Kroger said that they have 200000 pallets of water currently coming in the coming days.

As residents are trying to restock on essentials County Judge Lina Hidalgo said they’re seeing attempts at price gouging such as charging $1000 a night for an Airbnb with electricity.

""To those out there that are thinking they can make a quick buck out of our community’s pain know that we will not tolerate price gauging on our watch"" she said.

She said the County Attorney's Office is launching a new task force to investigate price gouging. Residents can report price gouging at readyharris.org or by texting 436-354-7459 with the complaint pictures and receipts.

There's a $10000 fine per violation of the law with fines totaling up to $250000. There can also be an additional quarter-million-dollar violation if the price gouging is against people 65 and older

Houston water pressure should start to return to normal by Thursday city officials said.

According to Houston Public Works Director Carol Haddock the city's water pressure plummeted after the system's generators failed due to the extreme cold. The agency is prioritizing the restoration of the city’s water pressure Wednesday.

""Our team is working around the clock to get these generators all back in service and to make sure that our wells are all operational"" she said.

The news comes after the city issued a boil water notice as a result of low water pressure. The city's water pressure began dropping Tuesday afternoon and the notice was issued after it became apparent that the city was not going to be able to recover the water pressure after it dropped below 20 pounds per square inch Haddock said.

The city is now on track to get back to normal water pressure levels Thursday by bringing additional wells back into service. Haddock added that the water pressure coming from the city's east water purification plant is back up after the process was slowed down Tuesday due to chemical feed lines being frozen.

""We believe that we're on a path right now to have pressures restored system wide enough today that most people will be able to use toilets and normal operations around their house"" she said. ""By the end of the day tomorrow we should be system wide full operational pressures that we normally see throughout the city.""

As water pressure is restored across the region Haddock said Public Works was prioritizing water pressure within the Texas Medical Center and other medical complexes.

""It is imperative that they have the ability to keep basic sanitation needs in these areas for the people they're currently serving"" she said.

Haddock is urging residents to reduce water demand while the city's pressure is being stabilized by using water for critical uses only.

Updated 11:23 a.m. CT Wednesday

Houston and much of Harris County’s nearly 5 million residents are under a boil water notice as harsh weather and frigid temperatures continue to impact infrastructure in the region and across Texas.

The city and county advised anyone with water access to boil it for at least two minutes and cool before drinking. Residents without running water have been asked to use bottled water.

The City of Houston is under a boil water 💧 notice. Do no drink the water without boiling it first. Bring all water to a boil for at least two minutes. Let it cool before using. More information: https://t.co/r4c3zdaZgg pic.twitter.com/1pKjVSZhjr — Houston Public Works (@HouPublicWorks) February 17 2021

In addition to Houston cities in Harris County that have issued officials notices include Pasadena Clear Lake Baytown Tomball and Deer Park. The city of Galveston issued its own boil notice and has shut off water due to major water line breaks. The cities of Pearland Magnolia and parts of Sugar Land also have boil notices in effect.

All parts of Harris County should assume they’re under a boil water notice unless their local municipality has advised them otherwise Hidalgo said Wednesday.

She added that widespread power outages have affected generators and the low water pressure and busted pipes are affecting first responders.

""Our hospitals our firefighters are facing low water pressure” Hidalgo said. “And it’s an enormous problem for them.”

These water issues are happening as 3 million people in Texas are still without power.

The operator of the state's electric grid ERCOT says it was able to restore some power to the grid last night — enough to power about 700000 households.

But the grid also lost power when the Midwest had its own emergency and ERCOT was no longer able to import some 600 Mega Watts from there.

The main problem is still the generators that went offline because of the weather.

ERCOT is holding a media call RIGHT NOW and we’ll bring you new details coming up in our Noon newscast.

She asked residents to turn off their faucets since the temperature has risen and freezing pipes are no longer a major risk.

The other main threat to the region besides ongoing power outages continues to be poor weather. But Hidalgo suggested people take advantage of the rising temperatures and safe roadway conditions during the day to stock up on food and supplies as needed — though she asked shoppers not to hoard supplies.

""There are so many people in this region and everybody’s going through the same thing” Hidalgo said. “So please only purchase enough supplies to get you through the weekend.""

There’s no timeline on when full power will be restored though forecasters have predicted temperatures in the 50s and 60s on Saturday afternoon with a possibility of Sunday highs in the 70s.

""It’ll be just less tragic less terrible than it is right now"" Hidalgo said before adding later ""We’re not through yet.""

Kent Prochazka with the National Weather Service in Houston said that freezing temperatures are likely to last until Saturday. A cold front is moving through the region Wednesday evening bringing the possibility of a bit more snow and sleet.

Thursday night and Friday morning will also be cold before temperatures begin to rise again Prochazka said.

""On Saturday we’re looking for things to begin to improve dramatically"" he said. ""Should be the last morning of freezing temperatures. But the winds become more southeasterly and southerly during the day on Saturday. And that’s really going to boost temperatures up""

Saturday afternoon will see temperatures in the 50s and 60s and Sunday could even climb into the 70s.

More than 43% of CenterPoint energy customers — 1350881 in total — were without power as of 5 a.m. Wednesday according to the company's online outage tracker.

On day three of frigid temperatures Texas still does not have the electricity supply to restore power to all homes and businesses. As many as 2.7 million electricity customers across Texas are still without of power according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas the state's energy grid manager.

The harsh weather has made it difficult for ERCOT to handle the state's power supply. Generators continue to come on and offline forcing prolonged and sporadic outages across the state.

“We haven’t been able to add as much back during the course of the day as we’d like to” said Dan Woodfin senior director of system operations at ERCOT on a Tuesday afternoon call with reporters. “And what we have added back we’re hoping to keep online but if additional generation doesn’t become available as the day goes on we might actually have to take some of it back offline to maintain that power supply balance.”

The grid manager on Wednesday said it directed utilities to restore 600000 households overnight.

A winter storm warning has been extended through Thursday morning for the Houston area. Freezing rain in College Station is expected to hit Katy by 6 a.m. according to the National Weather Service.

The frigid cold has led to hazardous road conditions with Houston TranStar reporting more than 160 locations with ice on roadways Wednesday morning. There have been hundreds of traffic crashes over the last few days due to the winter weather.

Houston officials also say they've seen hundreds of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning with more than 300 in Harris County since Monday as people without electricity look for other heating sources.

Officials have also been responding to fires in the greater houston area and urging people to use flashlights instead of candles if possible.

Updated 6:35 p.m. CT Tuesday

Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo warned residents to prepare for the possibility of prolonged outages in the wake of the state energy grid manager's erratic response to the severe winter storm in Texas.

Hidalgo who said the county will have some hard questions for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas after the current power outages are over said the utility should not to be overly optimistic in its predictions of how quickly the crisis will be resolved.

Until ERCOT's more optimistic estimates for power generation start to pan out for more people ""we have to assume the worst"" Hidalgo said.

""Every night since this started we've seen less generation not more"" she said. ""So let me give it to you straight based on the visibility I have: Whether you have power or not right now there is a possibility of power outages even beyond the length of this weather. There's a generation shortfall right now and it's a matter of when ERCOT's going to get that power up and running.""

Roughly 1.2 million customers remained without power due to ERCOT's forced shortages as of 5 p.m. Tuesday.

The county judge also said there have been at least 300 emergency calls reporting carbon monoxide poisoning since the power outages began calling it ""a disaster within a disaster."" Those include at least two deaths.

Many of those are due to using ovens and grills indoors as a heat source and turning on cars inside garages for warmth Hidalgo said.

She also noted that freezing temperatures are having an effect on water pressure and safety.

""Check with your local utility district to see if there's a boiled water notice"" she said. ""If you still have water remember to preserve some.""

The Galveston County Medical Examiners Office has requested refrigerated trucks to accommodate for what could be an influx of weather-related deaths.

A spokesperson for Galveston County Judge Mark Henry said two trucks are on the way after local funeral homes lost power during the winter storm. The county is expanding capacity to 50 bodies in case the need arises.

Henry’s office could not confirm the exact number of deaths or where they occurred. The medical examiner's office also serves Brazoria County.

At one point during the storm 95% of Galveston Island was without power though officials say power is being restored to homes that have been without for more than 24 hours. That includes parts of downtown and the east and west ends of the island.

In a video posted to Twitter Henry called the response from the state’s grid manager “unacceptable.”

“The Energy Reliability Council of Texas has proven to be anything but reliable"" Henry said. ""And it's not like they didn't know this was coming. The forecasted ice storm was in the forecast for at least a week prior to the event.""

Unfortunately it doesn't appear the transmission companies or ERCOT are placing any priority on getting @GalvCoTx customers back online with power today. pic.twitter.com/GeRz7Zi9gc — Galveston County TX (@GalvCoTx) February 16 2021

Henry also said in the video he would ask for accountability from Austin lawmakers.

Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday had already announced he would make the power outage crisis in Texas an emergency item for this legislative session. He called on lawmakers to investigate the widespread power outages to make sure they never happen again.

Separately House Speaker Dade Phelan is scheduling a joint hearing next week with the House State Affairs and Energy Resources committees in an attempt to find out why more than 4 million Texans lost power during the winter storm.

Another Republican Chris Paddie who leads the House State Affairs Committee said the blackouts raise questions about the reliability of the state's electric grid and if it can withstand extreme weather events in the future.

A city-run warming shelter at the George R. Brown Convention Center is completely full even after nearly quadrupling capacity form what was originally expected when the storm first hit according to Mayor Sylvester Turner.

Turner said the city expected about 200 people to seek shelter at the convention center though the space was prepared for up to 500. That capacity was nearly reached within hours of opening Monday.

By Tuesday afternoon nearly 800 people were inside seeking relief from the cold the mayor said.

The shelter wa sinitially intended just for the city’s homeless population. But because of power outages across the region that knocked out peoples’ heating systems that had to be expand Turner said. And that expansion is limited by the still-surging coronavirus pandemic in Houston.

“One of the reasons why we just can’t add additional people to the George R Brown is because of the health care protocols” Turner said. “We still have to have the social distancing the sanitizers. I mean all of the medical protocols we have to adhere to. So that’s critically important.”

Metro buses are transporting those in need to other warming centers including Lakewood Church which still has plenty of space Turner said. Pastor Joel Osteen said anyone is welcome at that center.

Jim “Mattress Mack” McIngvale offered up two of his Gallery Furniture locations as shelters for people escaping the winter chill.

The 6006 North Freeway location in Houston the 7227 W. Grand Parkway S. location in Richmond are both with electricty and will both provide hot food and water to people without power.

COVID-19 safety protocols will be in place and McIngvale asked people to bring extra masks for those who don’t have one.

There are also warming locations across Harris and surrounding counties. Anyone who needs a warm place to stay should call 311 to find out which places are open.

At least two unhoused people in Harris County died Monday night according to county and city officials.

Harris County sheriff’s deupties discovered the body of a 60-year-old man at the overpass of I-10 East at Sheldon Road just before noon Monday. The Sheriff’s office said members of its homeless outreach team had previously offered to take the man to a shelter but he refused. The cause of the man’s death has not yet been confirmed by an autopsy but the sheriff’s said his death was “possibly from exposure.”

Houston police Chief Art Acevedo also confirmed the death of a man found at the 3500 block of Spur 527 near Bagby Street. The unidentified man was discovered by someone passing by who called HPD. The man was dead when officers arrived Acevedo said.

Two others died of carbon monoxide posioning Acevedo said.

The Houston Fire Department has responded to more than 90 calls related to carbon monoxide posioning in the city according to Fire Chief Samuel Peña. There had been 56 fire calls over a last 24-hour period as of noon Tuesday.

The city’s vaccination sites will also be closed Wednesday with Thursday questionable Mayor Sylvester Turner said.

Harris County-run COVID-19 vaccination sites will be closed Wednesday and Thursday due to the cold weather and the possibility of snow and ice according to the county’s public health department. The changes also impact all COVID-19 testing vaccination sites an extension from the closures on Monday and Tuesday as officials are recommending residents to stay off the roads.

The Harris County Public Health Department also announced all of its clinics would be closed in the coming days. The provider was expected to test more than 10000 people for COVID-19 this week and administer 9000 first doses of the vaccine.

All appointments will be rescheduled officials said.

First responders from the Harris County Sheriff’s Office fielded more than 7000 calls on Monday as frigid temperatures stressed the state’s electricity grid and knocked out power in more than 1 million homes around Houston.

The office of Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said it fielded 5080 calls to 911 and 2125 calls to its non-emergency line more than double the volume of an average day. The calls were largely driven by reports of outages the office tweeted out Tuesday.

CenterPoint Energy reported that as of 9 a.m. Tuesday an estimated 1.4 million customers were without power. The company said it was complying with an order from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas which asked it to shutdown power for a swath of customers. The company said it had restarted the process of rotating outages last night but stopped once additional generators went offline.

Meanwhile Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan R-Beaumont called for a joint hearing of the House State Affairs and Energy Resources committees to find out what led to the loss of 10000 megawatts of electric generation and the blackouts that followed.

In a statement Phelan asked the two committees to convene next Thursday Feb. 25 to better understand what went wrong and how to prevent it from happening again.

“We must cut through the finger-pointing and hear directly from stakeholders about the factors that contributed to generation staying down at a time when families needed it most what our state can do to correct these issues and what steps regulators and grid operators are taking to safeguard our electric grid” Phelan said.

As Houston entered day two of below-freezing temperatures more than one million residents in the area were still without power.

Centerpoint Energy reported some 1.37 million customers continue to experience outages Tuesday morning while another 120000 Entergy customers are also without power.

The state’s electricity grid manager ERCOT said on top of high demand it also lost significant supply when generators were tripped offline both Sunday night and Monday night. Power outages are expected to continue today and it’s unclear when electricity will come back online for the more than 3 million Texans impacted.

Weather more generation outages last night bring load shed to 18500 MW. For today...generators to return renewable output to increase = increased customer restoration. — ERCOT (@ERCOT_ISO) February 16 2021

Officials continue to warn drivers in the Houston area to stay off the roads. Some ice may have melted throughout the day yesterday but many roadways likely froze again as temperatures dipped into the teens.

Houston remains under both a wind chill warning and a hard freeze warning until at least noon on Tuesday. Forecasters say to expect sunny skies with highs in the low 30s. Another winter ice storm is set to impact the area starting at 6 p.m. tonight through 6 a.m. Thursday.

The two airports in the area Bush Intercontinental Airport and Hobby Airport will remain closed through at least 4 p.m.

Power outages in the Houston area are expected to continue until tomorrow according to Centerpoint.

“If you are out of power right now you should expect to be out of power for the rest of today and into tomorrow"" Jason Ryan a Senior Vice President of Centerpoint said at a press conference.

Some 70000 people in the Houston area lost power due to damage to the local electrical system while 1 million people are out of power due to state grid failures according to Centerpoint.

This comes as meteorologists warn that temperatures are expected to drop to 5-10 degrees tonight.

""Tonight is going to be the second portion [of the winter storm] which is the extremely cold air” said Jeff Lindner the meteorologist with the Harris County Flood Control District.

Roughly 3.5 million Texans across the state are still without electricity.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) the state's primary grid operator said Monday afternoon that it has started restoring some of the power lost during the severe winter storm event.

ERCOT said they are able to restore power to some 500000 households.

""ERCOT and Texas electric companies have been able to restore service to hundreds of thousands of households today but we know there are many people who are still waiting"" ERCOT President and CEO Bill Magness said in a press release.

ERCOT officials said the grid has lost some 34000 MW of power generation because of the severe weather. Multiple energy sources powering the grid were knocked offline last night the majority of which were powered by natural gas coal or nuclear energy.

The state grid was already facing some shortages because of frozen wind turbines and limited gas supply.

Because of the severity of the power shortage local electricity providers are not able to rotate outages between different service areas which is why some people are seeing prolonged power outages.

""We started to quickly see that our ability to function with rolling outages was not going to last because just the magnitude of generation that went offline in a short period of time required us to instantly take more power out and more power out"" Centerpoint Executive Vice President Kenny Mercado told Town Square.

Mercado said he isn't able to give an exact estimate of when people can see their power come back on. ""In some cases it could take another four to eight to 12 to 24 hours. I just can't predict that"" he said.

The widespread power outages have also prompted several school districts to change their lesson plans again.

Some districts such as Klein Humble and Spring Branch had planned for some remote learning Tuesday. Those plans are now canceled due to the collapse of the state's power system.

""Klein ISD just received word from the Texas Education Agency that any school district experiencing widespread power outages due to inclement weather will be eligible for a missed school day waiver and not be required to make-up the day"" according to the district's website.

Several districts said they were trying to help curtail power consumption to ease the electricity crisis amid the coldest temperatures in the Houston region since 1989.

""In partnership with CenterPoint Energy Humble ISD dropped the temperatures in our schools to reduce power consumption for the greater community"" Humble ISD explained in an alert.

Charter school networks YES Prep and KIPP Texas also canceled online classes Tuesday as did Prairie View A&M University.

Major Houston freeways remain closed as ice and snow continue to cover large areas of the region.

This includes I-45 downtown (the Pierce Elevated) US-290 at Hollister I-610 at US-288 and at Scott the inbound lanes of the Katy Freeway at I-45 and I-69 north of downtown Houston police Chief Art Acevedo said.

He said HPD was responding to seven minor crashes as of 1 p.m.

The Houston Fire Department's call volume is up 50% mainly for EMS HFD Chief Samuel Peña said.

He warned Houstonians not to be fooled by the sun melting some of the snow and ice.

""That is going to freeze over and you're going to get ice on these roads"" Peña said. ""They're going to be even more dangerous than last night so please be mindful of that.""

Peña also asked people not to use space heaters that run on propane or charcoal as they can produce lethal carbon monoxide. He also said not to turn on a car to get warm inside a garage for the same reason.

Mayor Turner asked people to continue to avoid roads and hunker down at home.

He asked critical care patients who rely on battery-powered medical devices to call 211 or 311 if they need help.

""I would ask people relatives neighbors friends to check on our seniors"" who may not be following the news Turner said.

Airfields at both Hobby Bush and Intercontinental airports remain closed until at least noon and 1 pm tomorrow respectively.

Some 1 million Houston-area residents have lost power during the winter storm Mayor Sylvester Turner said Monday. Among those are two emergency warming centers for unhoused Houstonians: a Salvation Army location and the Fonde Community Center Turner said. The mayor made the comments in an interview with ABC 13.

The George R. Brown Convention Center was at full capacity Monday morning but Lakewood Church still had available space and electricity Turner told the station.

About 95% of Galveston is also currently without power according to Galveston City Manager Brian Maxwell. Maxwell said all city facilities are still operational and they’re currently looking for a facility large enough to shelter people from the cold. He added that the city was trying to find someone to speak to after their Centerpoint representative didn’t have much information to provide.

Statewide millions of Texans woke up Monday morning without power with what the state grid operator ERCOT called targeted ""rolling blackouts"" to help relieve historic grid usage during the severe winter storm. On a media call Monday morning ERCOT officials said these outages are expected to continue throughout Monday and at least until Tuesday morning with the potential to last all day Tuesday as well. Dan Woodfin the Senior Director of System Operations at ERCOT said in addition to high demand they've experienced a loss of power generation due to natural gas supply wind turbines icing and generators tripping offline overnight. “As more generators tripped offline we had to implement more of these controlled outages to protect the system as a whole” he said. Woodfin said because of the severity of the situation local electricity providers haven't been able to rotate outages between different service areas which is why some people are seeing such prolonged outages. “As the night progressed it wound up being such a big number that the transmission providers are having difficulty doing the kind of normal rotation of one area and then switching to a different area being out a different area being out” he said. “They just don't have enough options.” Woodfin said they're working to get additional generators back online and they're also asking people with power to conserve energy use.

More than 2.3 million people were without power in Texas early Monday morning as generators went down and local utilities enacted rolling blackouts to lessen an unprecedented strain on the power grid from the ongoing winter storm.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas the state's grid manager announced a statewide power emergency due to ""record-breaking electric demand.""

Texas' power grid lost several generating units which went offline due to the extreme cold according to ERCOT.

The controlled rotating outages are designed to avoid longer more widespread power outages the company said.

About 97500 CenterPoint customers in Harris County were without power as of 5 a.m. according to the energy provider.

Outages could last from 15 minutes to more than an hour ERCOT said.

To reduce strain on the grid ERCOT recommended:

Setting thermostats to 68 degrees.

Closing shades and blinds to reduce the amount of heat lost through windows.

Turning off and unplug non-essential lights and appliances.

Avoiding using large appliances (i.e. ovens washing machines etc.).

Businesses should minimize the use of electric lighting and electricity-consuming equipment as much as possible.

Large consumers of electricity should consider shutting down or reducing non-essential production processes.

Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo has signed a disaster declaration for Harris County ahead of an Arctic blast that’s set to drop temperatures into the teens. The move would give the county felxibility with resources to handle the severe weather event she said.

“Let’s see this as an extended hurricane” Hidalgo said. “Right now we have to hunker down and be very careful. Our roads continue to have ice on them so driving is the last thing you want to do right now.”

Mayor Sylvester Turner who said he had also signed a city declaration said at a press briefing Sunday evening that a Houston-run warming shelter for unhoused Houstonians at the George R. Brown Convention Center was already near capacity. The city had planned for 200 people but the number of people seeking shelter was approaching 500 he said.

Turner added that he would open additional emergency centers but did not specify the locations saying the city would rely on emergency personnel and homeless outreach groups similar to Harris County’s plan.

Lakewood Church is also set to open its doors to those who need shelter from the cold the mayor said.

Houston Fire Chief Peña reported three fires in the last 24 hours due to inappropriately placed space heaters. The chief advised those planning to use space heaters to place them three feet away from combustibles and plug them directly into the power outlet.

The KHOU 11 team is tracking the potential for wintry icy weather yet again north and west of Houston early Wednesday morning as another round of precipitation sweeps through the state. We're also tracking millions still without power statewide and very low water pressure — including some who have no water at all.

Will it freeze in Houston again today? Will there be ice here? Meteorologist Chita Craft says the freezing rain line is essentially Tomball to Livingston. Points north will get it — points south may luck out and will likely get only a cold rain today. She says spots north of that Tomball line — Brenham College Station Huntsville etc — could get half an inch to an inch of ice today. Watch the latest forecast and view live radar here.

A second Winter Storm Warning was issued for the northern and central areas of southeast Texas starting midnight Tuesday through 6 a.m. Thursday. Our team of experienced KHOU 11 meteorologists is tracking the winter storm around the clock.

As of 2 p.m. the Emergency Medical Services Authority had responded to 14 vehicle collisions in the Oklahoma City area. It was about double what EMSA typically sees on a Sunday.

EMSA continues to be concerned about cold exposure and hypothermia calls because of freezing temperatures.

The agency urges people to stay home but if going outside is necessary residents are urged to wear at least three layers of clothing: an outer layer to break up the wind and allow some ventilation; a middle layer of wool down or synthetic pile to absorb sweat and retain insulating properties when wet; and an inner layer of cotton or synthetic weave to allow ventilation and escape of perspiration.

EMSA encourages people to pay special attention to protecting their feet hands head and face. Wear boots or shoes that protect against cold and dampness. Footwear needs to be insulated and fit comfortably with several layers of socks. Keep a fully charged cell phone with you at all times.

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship. There's the recent ""Catholic Prayer for Trump"" a $1000-a-plate dinner at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said. They understand that in Benedictine's small mostly closeted gay community. Like the young man once deeply religious who suffers in silence as people on campus casually throw around anti-gay slurs. He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality. He's seen the joy that people can get from Benedictine how some will move back to Atchison after graduation just to stay close. But not him. ""I don't think I'll come back to Atchison — not ever.""

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

(WIS) - The West Columbia community is now rallying around one local Church that was vandalized with graphic images and messages of “Save Gaza” and “Free Palestine” amid the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Since the Suburban Baptist Church was hit with vandalism late Thursday night the West Columbia Police Department has begun to help clean up the mess by replacing the front sign and painting the front doors at the church.

“I was very shocked” said Megan Hobbs a member of the congregation at the Suburban Baptist Church.

Hobbs and other members of the Suburban Baptist Church couldn’t believe what they woke up to on Friday morning as they found pro-Palestine messages and profanity spray painted on the front and side doors of the church building.

The Church’s Mission House across the street which houses their food pantry was also vandalized.

Senior Pastor Tracy McGee said he started getting phone calls around 4 a.m. on Friday morning that his church had been vandalized. He and Assistant Pastor Elijah Smalls were in disbelief to learn about and see what had happened.

“When I got here and saw all the spray paint on the doors I couldn’t believe it” Smalls said.

“That stuff happens in New York City; it doesn’t happen in West Columbia” McGee added.

McGee says the graphic nature of the spray paint was jarring. In his 17 years at the Church he’s never seen anything like this.

“(I’m in) disbelief that something like this would happen and how far the craziness in this world has come” McGee said.

Luckily efforts to divide the Church’s congregation and damper their faith were unsuccessful as they held Sunday Service as normal the same week of the incident.

On Saturday McGee says a West Columbia Police Sergeant came to personally repaint the doors of the Church building. On Sunday churchgoers walked through the doors without having to stare at the profanity.

“He was up here and the pornography and the ‘Save Gaza’ was taken off the doors so we didn’t have to walk through that this morning” Mcgee said “What a strong revelation.”

Since the incident McGee has gotten phone calls from pastors across the country reaching out from as far as Austin Texas with messages of solidarity.

West Columbia Mayor Tem Miles also came out to Sunday Service to show his support and help their faith triumph over the hate.

“At the end of the day we need to all figure out a way to be better to each other and take care of each other while we’re here” Miles said.

Tracy also says despite the vandalism this incident won’t stop the church’s efforts and they’ll be back for service again next Sunday.

As of May 5th 2024 West Columbia Police says they have not charged anyone with vandalizing the property but that the investigation is ongoing.

I had hot sweats. It was really scary.” During the four days she was in hospital she took comfort in messages from childhood friends. “They were all texting me saying ‘We hope you get better we wish we could see you.’”

Months later these same friends began flouting lockdown rules. “It started with a few of them posting anti-lockdown tweets saying that it was fine [to break the rules] because only a small percentage of people were dying.” Still drained from being ill she focused instead on her studies. But then Christmas rolled around and while most of the country was under tier 4 restrictions Page saw her friends throwing parties and posting pictures of them on social media. “They were all gathered at their family houses with three households together. Then in the evening new people arrived. It was like there was no pandemic.”

She unfollowed or muted them on social media but didn’t confront them. “I don’t want to argue I feel like Covid has been a breeding ground for arguments.” Still those friendships are effectively over. “It’s sad because they’ve been a massive part of my life since I was six or seven. But I’ve seen what their morals are and I don’t want to be friends with people who would put other lives at risk.”

As a nation we have become fearful and fed-up – and often we take it out on each other. Friends have fallen out for all kinds of pandemic-related reasons: for rule infractions; for being insufficiently attentive on the weekly Zoom; or for being always bored and grouchy. “There’s a lot of frustration right now” says Mahzad Hojjat of University of Massachusetts Dartmouth co-author of The Psychology Of Friendship. “People may have lost their jobs. They are tired of a pandemic which feels like it is never going away.” The past year has laid bare fundamental differences in our values attitudes and priorities; many of us have seen friends in a new light. “People view their friends breaking the rules as a personal attack” says Holly Roberts a psychotherapist with the charity Relate.

My colleague’s bubble suddenly had 15 people in it. I thought – this is lunacy

It wasn’t always this way. At the beginning of the pandemic many of us reconnected with friends and acquaintances or joined Covid-19 mutual aid groups. Geoff a 69-year-old retired graphic designer from Cheshire was one of those people. “I set up a WhatsApp group among our friends” he says. “I thought that we could share worries and fears and jokes. Within three weeks I had bailed out of my own group.” It all went wrong when he started to criticise the government’s response to Covid. “I got a comment back from one friend saying ‘We all have to be a bit more positive.’” He realised that most of the group only shared baking photos and weren’t interested in chatting about politics. So he checked out. “I can make pitta bread now” he says “but I’m not interested in sharing a picture of it.”

Since then Geoff has grown further estranged from his friends mostly because of what he sees as their liberal interpretation of the lockdown rules. “It’s been lots of seemingly small incidents that collectively leave my partner and me feeling isolated from people we thought shared our values for 30 years. It feels like we’re the only ones complying.” He fell out with one former work colleague because of her decision to form multiple support bubbles with neighbours (she lives alone). “One bubble suddenly contained 15 people” he says. “You think I don’t want to cause big arguments but this is lunacy.” Another couple decided to travel from a tier 4 to a tier 2 area justifying it as “no big deal” because they weren’t planning to leave the house much.

Some might think he is judging his friends too harshly but others who have lost loved ones or who are still living with Covid’s lingering after-effects would share his frustration. “The reason Covid is so divisive is because it’s a moral issue” explains Roberts. “If people are hanging out with others and spreading the virus that is harmful. It can be hard for people to accept that their friends are behaving in that way and when you lose respect for someone that’s difficult to come back from.” Like Page Geoff has avoided challenging his friends. People become defensive he says. “They snap back at you. You think OK I’ll back off.”

Roberts advises caution if confronting a friend on rule-breaking behaviour. “The main thing is to try not to be accusatory” she says “or to shame someone. Everyone has their own circumstances and deals with things in different ways. Start from the place of saying ‘I am letting you know how your behaviour is affecting me and I’d like to hear your point of view.’ You can have a conversation rather than a shouting match.” Hojjat advises calmly and carefully referencing the bigger picture and the effect their actions could have on vulnerable people. “Explain that this isn’t just about one person’s behaviour. It’s a public health issue.”

It was like I was a stranger to her or a traitor. She said ‘Why are you thinking like this?’ She doesn’t call me

That said it is not always worth getting into it with friends. “You should make a distinction between long-term friendships that you really treasure and acquaintances” says Hojjat. If you have been friends since primary school for example “you should think twice before breaking that friendship and try and work things out. But if they are people you aren’t that close to it might be easier to just move on.”

Of course such conversations only work if both parties accept the reality of the pandemic. Attempting to reasonably engage with your conspiracy-theorist friend can only be deeply frustrating. Edward Farrow a 47-year-old bank communications worker from Rochester fell out with a childhood friend over his anti-lockdown views. “Blocking him [on social media] wasn’t a decision that I took lightly. But he’s tweeting this extraordinarily dangerous stuff that isn’t backed up by evidence.”

Friends since school the two men had followed a similar path into adulthood. They met up regularly for drinks when they both lived in London; and after Farrow left the city stayed in touch online. Farrow knew his friend was a contrarian by nature. “He’s always had that propensity” he says. “But I liked that he’d sometimes challenge me and we’d have interesting debates.”

Now when Farrow attempted to challenge his view that Covid is a hoax he became ill-tempered. “He told me that he was ‘disappointed in me’ for being swept up in this ‘propaganda’. He got quite aggressive.” After he shared a Laurence Fox tweet urging the public to take off their masks and gather in groups Farrow blocked him effectively bringing an end to a friendship of 30-plus years. He occasionally thinks about trying to deradicalise his old friend but there doesn’t seem to be any point. “It wouldn’t go anywhere” says Farrow. “And I would lose my mind.”

And of course conspiracy theorists are likely to feel just as alienated from their friends as people whose views are grounded in reality. Fatima a 28-year-old account executive from London spreads misinformation about Covid online. “At the end of the day it’s a cold” she tells me. “The death rate is not as extreme as people are making it seem. A lot of the people [who died of Covid] were meant to die [anyway].”

When she shared these views with her best friend from school in April the relationship dwindled. “It was like I was a stranger to her or a traitor. She said ‘Why are you thinking like this?’ She doesn’t call me as much. I would love to stay friends with her. I hope that when Covid is over we can talk it out face to face.”

Many of the people I spoke to shared a sense of loss even grief at realising that people they were friends with for decades might not be any more. “I avoid going places where I might bump into them” says Page of her former friends. “I don’t want to have to make conversation and I definitely don’t want to argue. I keep myself to myself.” Geoff worries about what will happen when normal life resumes. “My real concern is how comfortable I’m going to feel meeting these friends again . How will I move on with people when this is over?”

Some rifts will be irreparable. If there is someone in your life you just can’t respect any more advises Roberts tell them – kindly. “Ghosting is horrible” she says. “Don’t do that. Tell them they are doing something you disagree with and you are choosing to end the friendship.” She also advises us to remember that for those lucky enough to survive the pandemic Covid will one day be a distant memory. “Take a step back” she counsels “and remember why you became friends with that person in the first place. Everyone’s emotions are heightened at the moment. Maybe in a few months you’ll be able to reestablish a relationship when you’re feeling a bit more positive and the pressures of lockdown aren’t there any more.” If you can salvage a friendship do. You might need them on the other side.

Xavier submitted the request back in October but it was only recently approved for 9% capacity which is a maximum of 922 fans Xavier told The Enquirer.

Prior to Saturday the Musketeers were only allowed to admit approximately 300 fans inside Cintas Center for home games.

Fans will still be required to socially distance and wear masks except when eating or drinking.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvbXBhcy5pZC9iYWNhL29waW5pLzIwMjEvMDIvMTMvYWt1LWNpbnRhLWtlcGFkYS1rYW110gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aku Cinta kepada Kamu,"Kata ”pada” dan ”kepada” adalah dua kata yang berbeda baik secara arti maupun fungsi. Jika salah menggunakannya kalimat bisa menjadi rancu. Misalnya pada kalimat ""Aku cinta padamu"".

Analogi Cupid dewa cinta dan gairah erotis dalam mitologi klasik Romawi yang lumer oleh asmara dari kutipan romantis itu kerap diandalkan pejuang cinta untuk mengungkapkan perasaan.

”Cinta tidak terlihat dengan mata tetapi dengan pikiran. Dan karenanya Cupid bersayap dicat buta.”

Kerap terdengar orang mengatakan ”Aku cinta padamu.” Secara gramatikal penggunaan kata pada dalam kalimat ini tidak tepat.

Pada Hari Kasih Sayang setiap Februari kalimat mutiara dari pujangga William Shakespeare tersebut menjadi favorit pernyataan sayang sang empunya cinta kepada tambatan hati saat memberikan kado unik Valentine sembari berkata ”Aku cinta padamu.”

Kata pada secara semantis berperan sebagai penanda hubungan tempat dan penanda hubungan waktu.

Sekilas tidak ada persoalan dalam kalimat aku cinta padamu. Akan tetapi dalam perspektif bahasa ada kerancuan pada kata padamu. Kenapa rancu? Kira-kira begini teorinya.

Kata pada berkelas kata tugas. Dalam frasa ataupun kalimat kata itu berperan sebagai preposisi atau kata depan. Dari segi bentuk pada merupakan preposisi tunggal sebab hanya terdiri atas satu kata. Kata ini berkawan dengan di ke dari.

Kata pada secara semantis berperan sebagai pertama penanda hubungan tempat.

Berbeda dengan kata depan di ke dari yang bertugas secara otentik untuk menyatakan tempat yang sebenarnya preposisi pada memiliki penanda hubungan tempat secara semu atau bukan nama tempat yang sesungguhnya.

KOMPAS/Lasti Kurnia Perayaan Hari Kasih Sayang biasanya akan diwarnai dengan ucapan ”Aku cinta padamu.” Dari perspektif bahasa penggunaan kata padamu dalam kalimat itu menimbulkan kerancuan.

Berikut contoh penerapannya:

Kado cokelat dan buku harian ini bukti bahwa perasaan sayang masih ada pada dirinya.

Ia rela pergi ke Jakarta untuk bekerja pada perusahaan penerbitan.

Kedua berfungsi sebagai penanda hubungan waktu. Kata depan serumpun dengan pada yang berfungsi untuk menyatakan waktu antara lain hingga sampai sejak dan menjelang.

Contoh kalimat:

Mereka pergi pada hari Minggu untuk merayakan perkawinan perak.

Sejak maghrib keduanya bercengkerama di pinggir pantai.

Di samping preposisi tunggal (seperti di ke dari pada) ada pula preposisi gabungan baik gabungan secara berdampingan maupun berkorelasi.

Contoh preposisi yang berdampingan antara lain kepada daripada oleh karena dan selain dari. Contoh preposisi yang berkorelasi antara lain antara … dengan … dari … ke … dan sejak … hingga ….

KOMPAS/BAHANA PATRIA GUPTA Contoh penggunaan kata kepada dalam kalimat. Penjual menyiapkan bunga mawar di kawasan penjualan bunga di Jalan Kayun Surabaya Selasa (13/2/2018). Hari Kasih Sayang biasanya diwarnai dengan pemberian hadiah kepada orang tersayang.

Fokus telaah

Penulis akan fokus menelaah kata depan kepada sebagai ”pintu masuk” untuk menguliti pernyataan bernada retorik pada judul tulisan ini.

Kata depan kepada merupakan dampingan antara kata ke dan pada. Kata kepada menandai makna ’arah’ atau ’penerima’.

Berikut disajikan penerapan kata depan kepada ke dalam kalimat:

Oleh Rosdi cokelat itu diberikan kepada tetangga.

Erna meminta bantuan kepada psikolog untuk mengatasi persoalan rumah tangganya.

Dalam kegiatan berbahasa ragam formal preposisi kepada memiliki variasi dengan akan dan terhadap sehingga bisa saling dipertukarkan karena memiliki kemiripan makna.

KOMPAS/DIAN DEWI PURNAMASARI Contoh penggunaan kata kepada dalam kalimat. Setiap kali melihat bunga mawar Kus teringat kepada sang mantan.

Contoh:

Semua suami tentu sayang kepada/terhadap istrinya.

Kus teringat kepada/akan sang mantan yang tinggal di Jakarta Selatan.

Akan tetapi pertukaran tidak bisa dilakukan ketika menemukan kalimat berikut.

Pemimpin perusahaan memberikan bonus kepada (bukan terhadap) karyawan yang telah memberikan kinerja terbaik.

Kata kepada pada kalimat tersebut memiliki makna ’tujuan’ ’penerima’. Adapun kata terhadap tidak memiliki makna keduanya.

Pemimpin perusahaan berhak memberikan penilaian terhadap (bukan kepada) kinerja karyawan.

Pilihan jatuh pada aku cinta kepadamu karena gramatikal: sebuah ungkapan perasaan dari seseorang yang ditujukan kepada seseorang dengan alasan tertentu.

Kata terhadap pada contoh itu bisa diganti dengan perihal atau mengenai sehingga menjadi Pemimpin perusahaan berhak memberikan penilaian mengenai kinerja karyawan.

Dari uraian ringkas di atas penulis kurang sependapat dengan kalimat aku cinta padamu semata bukan karena manasuka. Akan tetapi pilihan jatuh pada aku cinta kepadamu karena gramatikal: sebuah ungkapan perasaan dari seseorang yang ditujukan kepada seseorang dengan alasan tertentu.

Jadi pernahkah Anda mengungkapkan perasaan cinta secara gramatikal kepada pasangan? Atau cukuplah dengan bukti bukan sekadar kata dan janji.

Namun Pemkot Blitar akan mendeklarasikan 14 Februari sebagai Hari Cinta Tanah Air.

Pementasan drama kolosal selalu digelar Pemkot Blitar setiap tanggal 14 Februari malam. Biasanya bertempat di monumen PETA puluhan seniman mahasiswa dan pelajar berbaur memerankan beragam tokoh dalam cerita perjuangan Sudanco Supriyadi yang memimpin pemberontakan PETA Blitar kala itu.

Saat pandemi agenda ini ditiadakan karena berpotensi menimbulkan kerumunan. Namun Pemkot Blitar menggantinya dengan kegiatan lain yang tak lepas dari esensi peringatan perjuangan tentara PETA dalam memperjuangkan kemerdekaan Negara Indonesia.

""Drama kolosal ditiadakan. Jadi besok pagi ada upacara sederhana di Monumen Potlot yang tak bisa dilepaskan dari rangkaian pemberontakan PETA Blitar. Kemudian juga ada webinar tentang PETA dari Kemensos KemenkumHAM Yapeta dan juga zoom meeting yang kami lakukan di gedung Kusuma Wicitra"" tutur Wali Kota Blitar Santoso Sabtu (13/2/2021).

Selain acara itu Pemkot Blitar juga mendeklarasikan tanggal 14 Februari sebagai Hari Cinta Tanah Air. ""Dengan deklarasi Hari Cinta Tanah Air ini diharapkan para pemuda mengimplementasikan makna hari kasih sayang itu kepada Indonesia sebagai tanah airnya. Kembali menanamkan nilai-nilai cinta tanah air di kehidupan saat ini"" lanjutnya.

Santoso mengakui hal ini tak mudah dan butuh waktu bertahun-tahun. Seperti tanggal 1 Juni sebagai Hari Lahir Pancasila juga digagas seniman Blitar sejak 19 tahun silam. Dan baru diterima negara sebagai hari nasional pada tahun 2014.

""Seniman Blitar mendeklarasikan 1 Juni sebagai Hari Lahir Pancasila itu butuh waktu 12 tahun sampai diterima negara. Bahkan 2015 Presiden Jokowi hadir di Kota Blitar untuk memperingatinya. Nah kami berharap pemerintah akan segera menerima tanggal 14 Februari yang lahir di Kota Blitar ditetapkan sebagai Hari Cinta Tanah Air secara nasional juga"" pungkasnya.

The appointment has garnered interest from different quarters of the finance world in Pakistan thanks to Citi’s long history of influence on the country’s financial outlook. As an advisor to the Pakistan government and the bank that has produced the most financial leaders in Pakistan.

The bank counts amongst its most influential alumni two former federal finance ministers – Shaukat Aziz and Shaukat Tarin. Out of these two Aziz went on to become Prime Minister. They also include two provincial finance ministers – Murad Ali Shah of Sindh and Hashim Jawan Bakht of Punjab – out of whom Shah went on to become provincial chief minister.

Until this most recent appointment Ahmed Bozaid had been the Chief Operating Officer for the EMEA Emerging Markets (EMEA EM) cluster based out of Dubai. He has previously worked with Citi in Pakistan Greece and the United Kingdom in a number of areas including Corporate Banking Treasury & Trade Solutions and Operations & Technology.

“I am delighted to return to Pakistan after almost twenty years and particularly excited with this opportunity to lead Citi’s franchise” commented Ahmed on his appointment. “Together with the Citi Pakistan team we will continue to provide the highest standards of innovation and banking solutions to our clients and fulfil our role as an active member of the Pakistani banking community.”

Bozai is one of the more significant new faces that has arrived after the retirement of former Chief Executive Officer of Citi in Pakistan Nadeem Lodhi. Lodhi retired in October 2020 after he reached the age of superannuation at Citi. While his replacement had not been announced in the meantime Moiz Hussain Ali the Markets and Securities Services Head for Citi has been officiating as the acting Chief Executive Officer of Citibank Pakistan.

However as CCO Bozai will be reporting directly to Elissar Farah Antonios who has been recently appointed as the Head of Citi’s Middle East and North Africa (MENA) cluster.“Ahmed’s diverse international experience and his knowledge of our Pakistan operations will be of great value to our clients in Pakistan” said Atiq Rehman CEO-Citi EMEA EM cluster about the appointment. “As we celebrate our 60th anniversary in the country this year we are confident that under Ahmed’s leadership the franchise will continue to flourish and support the needs of our local and global clients.”

As a Profit feature has pointed out almost a year ago while Citi is not by any stretch the oldest foreign bank in Pakistan it is the one that has most captured the Pakistani imagination. Historically the bank in Pakistan has been much smaller compared to its competitor Standard Chartered but holds more prestige as a place of employment. In recent times Citi has reaped the rewards of a consistent and against the grain strategy.

Back in the early 2010s foreign banks were closing shop in Pakistan. RBS Pakistan which had acquired ABN Amro’s assets in Pakistan sold off its operations in the country to Faysal Bank in June 2010. HSBC had announced its intention to sell off its Pakistan branches in early 2012 as well. And at the time it had become widely understood that Barclays was struggling in Pakistan and likely to exit the market entirely. So the idea that Citibank might be thinking of exiting Pakistan – while still a shock – was not entirely inconceivable.

Despite everyone around them leaving Citi persisted and in the eight years since 2012 has proven to be correct in their faith. The global bank remains committed to its corporate and investment banking operations in Pakistan and – in 2019 – passed an important milestone: it earned higher profits than at any point in the last two decades and likely in its history in the country.

Bozai will be hoping to continue the same trend. Citi has a proud history internationally and is a leading international bank with approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citi provides consumers corporations governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services including consumer banking and credit corporate and investment banking securities brokerage transaction services and wealth management.

Operating in Pakistan since 1961 for the last six decades the bank has been offering a full range of corporate and investment banking services to major local and global corporations Public Sector entities and financial institutions operating in the country. Citi has also been an active corporate citizen with a particular interest in supporting financial education and microfinance in Pakistan. From the initial messaging that has come from the bank after Bozai’s appointment there are not really any big changes in the offing.

With their recent success in terms of profits it will be hoping to cement its place in Pakistan even further. As Citi’s former CEO Nadeem Lodhi once expressed at an event in February 2019 Citi is “a trusted advisor to the government of Pakistan. The first Sukuk bond was in 1996 with Citi (a floating rate bond). We have led every [bond offering] transaction for the sovereign.”

Among the major global capital markets players in the world – it is the only one that has a longstanding presence in Pakistan and one that it has used in order to help the government of Pakistan gain access to cash from global investors for its bonds and to help Pakistani companies gain access to global investors. In addition to this Citi has always had a model in which they have innovated for the Pakistani financial market and has at different times led innovation in Pakistani banking including basic moves such as being the first to introduce credit cards to Pakistan.

Despite its roots running deep within the city community members find themselves struggling every day to access the same services and opportunities as the rest of their fellow Flintstones.

The Latinx Technology and Community Center has witnessed this first-hand. On regular basis center staff is met with members of the community in search of access to translation services healthcare and in the last year financial support due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Set in what used to be an old Citizens Bank building on the east side of town the tech center has gone through several permutations in the last two decades.

Originally a chapter of the American G.I. Forum a Hispanic veterans advocacy group the center spent much of the last two decades known as the Hispanic Technology and Community Center. Despite its change in name and leadership (at one time being overseen by both a G.I. Forum steering committee and Mott Community College) the center has remained a staple in the community.

Asa Zuccaro the tech center’s director since 2018 said he is proud of the work that’s gone into making the center what it is today.

Despite having to keep the center closed to the public due to the COVID-19 pandemic tech center staff still teach remote English as a Second Language classes to children of all ages. Zuccaro and the staff continue to apply for grants seeking anything from general funding to community gardens and other city beautification projects.

Even socially distanced events like last year’s Day of Action a collaborative effort between local organizations like the Sylvester Broome Empowerment Village and national organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union have been hosted by the center.

Though Zuccaro said programming like this helps toward establishing the center as a community hub therefore granting legitimacy to the Latinx community Zuccaro believes it’s not nearly enough.

His vision for the center isn’t anything grandiose. He isn’t looking for a flashy downtown location or access to a billion-dollar endowment. What he does want is a center that can serve as a place to educate citizens on the history and beauty of Latinx culture. He wants what the Latinx community of Flint deserves.

“We want the community to feel proud right? Whether you’re Hispanic Latino Latina Latinx whatever it is you identify as you deserve the right to say ‘I have a community center in Flint in Genesee county and it’s fantastic’” Zuccaro said.

As Zuccaro has found out that vision reasonable as it may be is unattainable without the proper support.

“The issue I found after taking this position is it’s all administrative work. You get bogged down so much that you have little capacity to implement some of these things that you want to do and that’s what I struggle with” Zuccaro said.

He said the administrative tasks are a full-time job. Any work aimed toward improving and furthering the center’s programs is almost always off the clock. “If I want to get some of my vision in there” said Zuccaro. “ it’s 60 or 70 hours (per week) … that’s how we’ve gotten to where we are today.”

The extreme hours have paid off he said but progress has been too slow. The lack of necessary resources has meant the center can only focus on a handful of projects at a time.

One example of this Zuccaro said is the state of the center itself. While the inside of the building feels clean and modern sporting a common area with conference tables a projector and white-erase board a computer lab and even a classroom for children the building’s exterior gives no indication of the work done inside.

Brightly colored murals make the building stand out but many of its windows are boarded over. “Inside we’re working hard outside you might think we’re an abandoned building” Zuccaro said.

This lack of visibility exemplifies the way the Latinx community is seen throughout the city–or rather not seen.

Zuccaro knows he and the community as a whole are still stuck at “Go.” Their turn for a seat at the proverbial table is yet to come. But he has a clear vision for what he thinks the community ultimately needs to be served and to be allowed to grow.

“I have this hope that our local community will be culturally relevant linguistically … and won’t let immigration status be a barrier to services” Zuccaro said.

To him lack of access to services due to language barriers is the single greatest issue the Latinx community faces.

The most visible way in which these barriers manifest themselves Zuccaro says is in the field of public health.

Most Spanish-speaking individuals will have a hard time seeking out health services simply because of the lack of properly trained bilingual staff in the area.

Those who make it past the language barrier are then questioned about their residency status. Legal or not this question alone is enough to dissuade some from seeking further assistance. Simply put: “Lack of access creates health disparities” Zuccaro said.

Lisa Lapeyrouse an Associate Professor of public health at The University of Michigan-Flint has spent her career studying racial and ethnic inequities in healthcare access among Latinx communities.

She said the issues the Latinx community in Flint faces in terms of visibility exist on a national scale. Despite being the largest minority group in the country making up about 18.5 percent of the U.S population Lapeyrouse said academic studies and therefore understanding of the inequities the population faces are largely misunderstood and unrecognized.

“Those conversations are very much couched in black and white” Lapeyrouse said. “Even though Latinx people are the largest ethnic minority group. … You could just Google Scholar the number of articles on African American health inequities and then those among Latinx people and there is a wide gap between the two.”

This fundamental misunderstanding of the U.S’s Latinx population is perhaps most broadly underscored by the fact the U.S Census Bureau with the exception of the 1930 census that included a Mexican race category did not include a Hispanic option until 1980.

Lapeyrouse said this systemic lack of information has lead to the existence of very little infrastructure designed to address the needs of Latinx communities. In Flint she said it’s no different.

For this reason Lapeyrouse said the effects of public health emergencies like the Flint water crisis can be compounded for members of the Latinx community.

“Because we lack that infrastructure there is a delay in getting the information and services to the community … most places don’t have a Spanish speaker or translator on staff. That means once the information gets to the agency or the health department they need to take that information and they need somebody to advocate and say ‘hey don’t forget about this community’ and then they need to find somebody to translate it.”

Lapeyrouse explained how during the water crisis entities involved with disseminating critical information about the water resorted to using Google Translate “which was a nightmare” Lapeyrouse said.

Even when accurate and helpful translations were obtained Lapeyrouse said organizations still faced the task of distributing the information a task made doubly difficult by the fact little to no Spanish speaking media existed in Flint.

“While the larger population has this infrastructure where they can turn on the six o’clock news or they can listen to the radio…we are again at a disadvantage. We become reliant on knowing who those key people are who those community partners are that are going to disseminate that information. That’s going to be a much slower process” Lapeyrouse said.

She said those who are not connected to the people in the community capable of dispersing the information necessary to stay safe and healthy “may go without information or services for a very long time. That can contribute to not only health risks but the severity with which they experience illness and disease.”

Zuccaro recognizes the city’s lack of infrastructure makes the center and therefore him as the director one of the key figures in advocating for these large-scale structural changes.

Despite this he fears the politics that make up Flint’s extensive web of nonprofits healthcare organizations advocacy groups and municipal entities put Zuccaro at a disadvantage when it comes to representing his community.

“I came into this position when I was 25. I’m brown my ears are pierced I have a tattoo on my hand I wear two chains … that’s why I do anything to be perceived as less intimidating frightening whatever you want to call it. That’s why I dress up to try to appeal to the dominant culture” Zuccaro said.

He knows these aspects of his personality are likely to be looked down upon in certain circles. On top of this his lack of experience in the field of nonprofits and placemaking he feels takes away from his authority and ability to speak out for the needs of his community.

“I recognize my youngness” Zuccaro said. “Who am I to be calling out these organizations and their directors with their master’s degrees or Ph.Ds? I’d be instantly shut down and disregarded.”

Zuccaro has learned that while there are a plethora of problems plaguing his community bringing these issues up to organization leaders is not as simple as well bringing them up.

To achieve his goals for the center Zuccaro knows he needs help. Getting that help he quickly learned requires more than good intentions and an impeccable track record.

“Unfortunately the way it all works is very political. There is politics in absolutely every part of it … the relationships of how you’re perceived how your organization is perceived the desire to work with one another” Zuccaro said.

Perception is everything in politics and the Latinx community’s seemingly low placement on the totem pole has forced Zucarro to play “the game.”

“If I call organizations out about how they do not have the ability to serve somebody because they have … nobody with the linguistic skills and they just don’t understand the perspective of somebody outside the culture then this organization is completely inequitable and has no capability of serving our community. If we call them out for that that’s not good. That’s going to create an enemy.” Zuccaro said.

Instead Zuccaro has chosen to play it safe by appealing to the leaders of these organizations and using existing efforts to highlight the need for greater Latinx representation and awareness in the city. His go-to example recently has been the Mass Transit Authority’s implementation of Spanish language signage online and in its stations.

By underscoring Latinx-oriented changes like these Zuccaro said he is able to point service organizations in the right direction. “If I say ‘hey let’s look at the MTA. One thing they do really well to service our community is that they have notices and signs that are bilingual.’” he said.

Though few and far between these examples allow him to ask service organizations to “look at where else we have the opportunity for growth.”

Tactics like these are as much about bringing awareness as they are about inciting action.

Zuccaro says working with service organizations and others of the like isn’t just about receiving grant money or other forms of financial support. It’s about making internal changes to the organizations themselves changes that allow them to better cater to the needs of the communities they serve.

He and his staff are not equipped to handle medical issues legal issues or domestic disputes for example. Yet it is often the case that individuals facing these types of circumstances are turned down by the entities designed to help them and sent back to the center for assistance.

“We get different organizations or service providers that reach out to us and they’ll say ‘hey we received … a phone call from this individual can you translate the phone call? Can you take the phone call?’” Zuccaro said. “It’s always puzzling organizations reach out to us and my immediate response is ‘well I would send them to you.”

With no tools at their disposal to help in cases like these except to act as interpreters tech center staff is forced to send individuals away. They can either go back to face the circumstances they were looking to escape or to the organizations that originally sent them to the center to begin with.

Victoria Arteaga a retired immigration lawyer and volunteer staff attorney at the International Affairs Center in downtown Flint said has had similar experiences.

“We do immigration and translation services” said said. “That encompasses a lot of things. I’ve done everything from doctor’s appointments to going to Detroit for interviews that people have (with immigration officials).”

Arteaga has also dedicated a lot of her time to bill assistance in the last year. As she notes the economic instability the COVID-19 pandemic has created has been immeasurably worse for individuals whose residency status has made it impossible for them to receive any sort of government assistance.

“They don’t have the same reach. If I am a citizen and I got laid of from my job I would get unemployed I would get the stimulus. If you’re undocumented you just get laid off.”

Arteaga notes that in her experience working mostly with family immigration mixed-status families or households made up of both legal and illegal residents often miss out on these government benefits out of fear they might expose themselves.

This mistrust of government agencies at the local state and federal level further worsens the situation for many Arteaga said.

Other members of the community like Father Paul Donnelly of Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Flint said he has fielded similar requests for translation services and help with navigating the U.S immigration system.

“The requests we most often get are related to immigration status. People ask me for a letter expressing that they are members of the church and that they contribute to our shared life” Donnelly said.

He receives similar requests to those of Zuccaro and Arteaga for translation services.

“Sometimes people have come with translation barriers. They don’t understand for instance something that came to them in the mail” he said.

While these shared experiences shed a positive light on the closeness and caring nature of the Latinx community in Flint they also underscore Lapeyrouse’s observation that in Flint not knowing the right person to go to for help can lead to devastating consequences. More to her point the lack of bilingual services within already established service organizations is putting an undue burden on organizations like the tech center.

Despite experiences like these Zuccaro said he believes the lack of awareness or of Latinx-oriented solutions in the city isn’t a product of intentional racism or malice at a wide-spread level. Rather there is a severe lack of understanding of the needs of the Latinx community and the effort it takes to make the necessary changes.

“I think the majority of people want to serve but really don’t put in the effort or resources or even have the know-how. That’s what I hope to be able to produce going forward.” Zuccaro said. “How can we create this equitable plan for Genesee county from our perspectives?”

Therein lies Zuccaro’s deep-held belief that while yes the Latinx community needs support to thrive its ultimate goal should not be to put further strain on existing service organizations but rather to build toward a community able to care for itself.

“I think our community has everything it needs to support build and service itself to higher intellect prosperity and community … it exists right now” Zuccaro said. “I hope that we can be reliant on other institutions but we will also hold on to this recollection that we need to build something for ourselves.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vamFwYW4tZm9yd2FyZC5jb20vYm9va21hcmstamFwYW5lc2UtY2l0aXplbnNoaXAtb3ItZHVhbC1uYXRpb25hbGl0eS1ldmVyeXRoaW5nLXlvdS1uZWVkLXRvLWtub3cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,[Bookmark] Japanese Citizenship or Dual Nationality? Everything You Need to Know,"~~





Bookmark is a JAPAN Forward feature that gives you long reads for the weekend. Each edition introduces one overarching thought that branches off to a wide variety of themes. Our hope is for readers to find new depths and perspectives to explore and enjoy.







On January 21 the Tokyo District Court issued the first decision on a lawsuit brought by six individuals who had lost their Japanese citizenship and two who feared they would. They are challenging as unconstitutional a provision in the Japanese Nationality Law that says “A Japanese national will lose Japanese citizenship when the individual obtains a foreign citizenship on his or her own will.”

Headlines in both English and Japanese news media generally misrepresented the significance of the decision with wording that implied that it covered multiple citizenship in general. For example Kyodo had the headline “Court rules in favor of Japan’s ban on dual nationality” and an Agence France-Presse story was headlined “Japan court upholds ban on dual citizenship.”

The decision in fact only dealt with one limited situation in which Japanese law does not permit multiple citizenship: the case where Japanese citizens intentionally take citizenship in another country. Only one foreign report — that of Reuters — explicitly noted the very limited scope of the lawsuit.

The text of the citizenship law (available in English) makes it clear that the court ruled on a section of the nationality law that does not apply to people who have involuntary or unintentional dual citizenship by birth or naturalized Japanese from a country that does not allow its citizens to relinquish their citizenship.

More generally especially in English language media the issue of multiple citizenship in Japan is phrased in terms of these two cases not the intentional expatriation that was at issue in the Tokyo District Court Decision.

The decision by Naomi Osaka to take Japanese citizenship in 2020 because she had turned 22 is a widely reported example of unintentional dual nationality.

What the Plaintiffs Were Seeking

Six of the plaintiffs were seeking monetary compensation equivalent to $5160 for the “suffering” caused by having to give up their Japanese citizenship as a result of taking foreign citizenship (variously Switzerland or Liechtenstein) for their work. Two were seeking assurance that they would not lose their Japanese citizenship if they did the same.

The lead plaintiff and apparent instigator for the lawsuit is Hiroshi Nogawa a resident of Switzerland since his 20s and citizen since 2001. At a press conference he gave to the Foreign Correspondents Club Japan on July 6 2018 I asked him why he needed Swiss citizenship rather than just permanent residency the holding of which would not result in any threat to Japanese citizenship.

His answer was vague — that he needed Swiss citizenship “to bid on government contracts.” But numerous sources say that Swiss citizenship is needed only to bid on contracts for infrastructure with military significance. In the absence of a clear statement to the contrary from Nogawa it must be assumed that he wanted to retain Japanese citizenship while being able to bid on military-related contracts as a Swiss citizen.

Access to military-related research funds also led Shuji Nakamura a 2014 winner of the Nobel Prize in physics to take U.S. citizenship after he moved to the University of California in Santa Barbara.

Given that permanent residency in a country usually permits the same range of activities as those allowed citizens except in the political military and intelligence sectors it is hard for me to see official acceptance of Japanese citizens acquiring foreign nationality as progressive. If anything it is retrograde in terms of the Japanese “peace Constitution.”

The court decision recognized that a prime consideration behind the provision for loss of Japanese citizenship was to forestall problems with Japanese dual citizenship holders being subject to the draft or getting involved in military matters in another country. The court also noted dual citizenship in such cases “could cause conflict in the rights and obligations between countries as well as between the individual and the state.”

Don’t Ask Don’t Tell

Although the clause of the nationality law at issue here says unequivocally that “you will lose Japanese citizenship” in reality “you might lose Japanese” citizenship if you are unlucky or flaunt the fact that you have taken foreign citizenship without going through the procedure to relinquish your Japanese citizenship.

This explains why while waiting to speak to Nogawa’s lawyer after the press conference I heard people speculating about what Nogawa had done to attract the attention of Japanese authorities in Switzerland.

As with foreign nationals who acquire Japanese citizenship without following the legal mandate to make an effort to relinquish your other citizenship the Japanese government has no way of knowing whether you have done this and makes no proactive effort to find out. This is not just tacit policy but something that government officials have admitted on the record.

This is also indicated by the tiny number of Japanese citizens who relinquish their citizenship or have it canceled in any given year.

There are late filing penalties for expatriating Japanese who do not file the required paperwork within the specified time limit. However in practice these do not seem to be applied.

Widening the View

Comments on social media such as Twitter used the court decision as an excuse for criticism of Japan as backward and out of touch with 21st century reality. It is a line that has been taken generally in prior English and Japanese language writing on this subject. Almost invariably they treat dual or multiple citizenship as something good and progressive.

The reality of multiple citizenship and its recognition is quite different.

Although a few countries have long recognized multiple nationality it is only in the 1990s that an increase in the number of countries doing so attracted attention. Academic studies show the movement for acceptance is not easily tied to whether a country is progressive or conservative as seen by pundits.

A major reason for countries moving to accept dual nationality has been the hope that it would help integrate large migrant communities into the social and political fabric of the host country. This incentive has been completely lacking in Japan.

Norway widely cited as one of the most socially and politically progressive countries in the world only moved to accept dual nationality in 2020.

Some countries that allow dual nationality do this only on the basis of reciprocity agreements specific historical connections only for certain minority groups etc. Spain has dual citizenship recognition for natural born citizens and countries with which it has bilateral agreements but not in general. It requires U.S. citizens for example to renounce their U.S. citizenship.

Elected Officials ー the Renho Case

Another pattern that is commonly found among nations that generally allow dual nationality is a prohibition on dual nationality for holders of national government positions.

In 2016 there was a flap over Renho (Renho Murata) a member of the upper house of the Japanese Diet (House of Councillors) who held both Republic of China (Taiwan) and Japanese nationalities. Although the site that called attention to her situation is known for apolitical muckraking criticism of Renho was labeled sexist or even racist.

The real issues were two. First as a lawmaker it did not look good that she was in nominal violation of a well-known albeit toothless law and held citizenship in a country the very existence of which is highly politicized and open to challenge.

Second she had built a reputation during the years (2009-2012) when the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) held power for her sharp questioning of government officials that made them squirm but when she herself was questioned she gave waffling and evasive answers.

I had been a fan of Renho and had hoped that she would stand as a candidate for governor of Tokyo. But after seeing her response on this issue I came to feel she was good at applying heat to others but unable to deal with it when it was directed at her.

In any event she did the paperwork to relinquish her ROC citizenship and went on to lead the DPJ to a stunning defeat in 2017.

The debate about sexism would not have happened in Australia because while that country generally recognizes dual nationality it has an absolute prohibition on holding citizenship in a country other than Australia ー whether that citizenship was accidental or intentionally acquired ー without regard to countries such as Britain or New Zealand with which Australia has close ties and numerous reciprocal arrangements.

Dual Citizenship in Practice and Public Policy

Writers who advocate that Japan get on the dual nationality bandwagon are nominally correct in saying that more countries allow “some form” of dual or multiple nationality than those that do not. But there are two things hidden by a simple country count.

On a population-weighted basis the picture is very different. Neither of the two most populous countries on the planet allow dual citizenship. China and India both prohibit it. In the cases of India the prohibition is enshrined in its constitution.

That China and India each with a population of approximately 1.4 billion do not allow dual citizenship is far more important in terms of impact than the fact that Liechtenstein (population 38557 in 2019) allows dual citizenship in some cases.

Specifically in Liechtenstein’s case it is allowed only on a reciprocity basis and forbidden for naturalized citizens. This makes the claims of those plaintiffs who took Liechtenstein citizenship look that much more absurd.

Aside from other countries’ practices both journalistic and academic writing on the issue of Japan and dual or multiple citizenship is almost entirely superficial or one-side advocacy writing. Dual or multiple citizenship is almost invariably assumed to be a “good thing” and this is either simply asserted without evidence or if evidence is given only supportive evidence is provided.

My own view as a naturalized Japanese with one and only one citizenship is that dual or multiple citizenship is not a good thing primarily because of the inequality aspect. Recognizing multiple citizenship in the case of purchase or investment clearly favors the wealthy and widens the class gap among citizens but that is also true of birthright citizenship.

There is considerable evidence that income and asset inequality is growing in Japan. There is no good reason for exacerbating this growing divide by giving general formal legal recognition to dual or multiple citizenship. If there are two Japanese citizens one with only Japanese citizenship and the other with a second birthright citizenship the second is in effect a member of a minor aristocracy with privileges and prerogatives not available to the first.

Citizenship for Sale

Writers who advocate that Japan accept dual or multiple citizenship see non-Japanese citizenship as arising from having a parent with non-Japanese citizenship or the result of having been born in a country such as the U.S. or Canada that gives citizenship to anyone of any parentage born within the national boundaries.

These writers are ignoring another route to citizenship that has appeared in the last few decades: purchase.

Advertisement

Citizenship for sale can be just that: a cash payout for citizenship and a passport. Typically the sale is disguised as investment in land or job creation. In either case the key determinant for acquiring citizenship immediately or on a fast track basis is money ranging from tens of thousands to millions of dollars.

Countries that sell citizenship are not necessarily poor developing countries. Austria an exceptionally wealthy country sells nationality to the investing principal a spouse and up to two minor children for an amount that is generally €2 million EUR ($2.425 million USD) or more. Cyprus grants citizenship in exchange for a substantial purchase of government bonds.

The sites that give advice on citizenship through purchase give at least three reasons for seeking an additional citizenship and passport: a haven if you need to bail out of your home country greater freedom of movement than your first passport might allow and tax management.

The widely cited Henley Passport Index already considers a Japanese passport the best in the world in terms of movement without having to get a visa for each and every country you visit.

Tax management is a euphemism for tax evasion. Related to this but not overtly mentioned in advice sites is money laundering. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has in fact questioned the wisdom of member countries giving blanket recognition to dual or multiple citizenship precisely because of the potential for tax evasion and money laundering.

Some countries offer “golden visa” programs that can be a fast track to citizenship although this is not guaranteed. These too can be used for money laundering and tax evasion. A special visa scheme for big ticket investors in Britain was halted in 2018 after it became clear it was being used for money laundering.

Costs for the Individual: Military Service

Just as they ignore potential costs for countries in recognizing dual or multiple citizenship advocates ignore the same for individuals.

A number of countries have compulsory military service for all males. Israel has it for all citizens over the age of 18.

Having a second citizenship in a country without compulsory military serviceー such as Japan ー does not automatically exempt you from service in the country that has it.

The United States has not drafted anyone for 40 years but it still has compulsory male registration for the draft. Failure to register can cause problems with access to financial aid and certain jobs in the U.S. A male Japanese with a secondary U.S. citizenship could be in for an unpleasant surprise or two if he moves to the U.S. having not thought to register because he was resident in Japan.

The possibility that draft registration will be extended to females in the name of gender equality should not be ruled out.

Costs for the Individual: Taxation

Of possible secondary citizenship for anyone Japanese or otherwise the U.S. is easily the least desirable of all because the U.S. is the only country that taxes you on your worldwide income even if that income is not earned in the U.S. and you do not reside there.

While you can exclude foreign income up to $107600 (2020) from your taxable income you are required by law to file a U.S. tax return each year ー even if you have no U.S. tax liability.

If you do this yourself it is quite time consuming. If you pay a tax account to prepare your filing it is quite expensive especially in Japan where accountants with the required knowledge cater to well-heeled expats and charge accordingly.

If you have the dollar equivalent of $10000 USD or more in financial assets in an overseas account you must file a FBAR (Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts). Few people get into trouble for failure to file but those who do face truly draconian penalties.

Further since the advent of FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) signed into law in 2010 by Barack Obama foreign financial institutions that also do business in the U.S. have been required to report on the financial assets of American citizens or face punitive penalties.

The requirement that foreign banks report your holdings applies even if you are only an accidental U.S. citizen do not live in the U.S. and have no income or assets there.

FATCA has led to numerous reports of banks in various countries terminating the accounts of customers with U.S. citizenship and refusing to accept new accounts from U.S. citizens.

Accidental citizenship is a particular problem for Canadians who have U.S. citizenship because they were born in U.S. hospitals just over the border. Many have never thought about filing U.S. tax returns.

Even before Janet Yellen was confirmed as Secretary of the Treasury American expats sent her a letter pleading for relief from U.S. filing requirements and FATCA. The European Union also made an unheeded appeal in 2019.

Relinquishing U.S. Citizenship

Relinquishing U.S. citizenship is an expensive and convoluted process. It requires at least two sessions at a U.S. embassy or consulate. These are at their convenience not yours and only a small number of slots are available each week. Currently the fee is $2350.

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic thousands were waiting for a first appointment in some countries. The situation has worsened with the result that it can now take several years to quit a second citizenship you have never exercised and might not even know you had.

Consular Representation: Maybe Not

There are other disadvantages to U.S. citizenship. As stated on the U.S. Embassy Japan website:

While recognizing the existence of dual nationality and permitting Americans to have other nationalities the U.S. Government does not endorse dual nationality as a matter of policy because of the problems which it may cause. Claims of other countries upon dual-national U.S. Citizens often place them in situations where their obligations to one country are in conflict with the laws of the other. In addition their dual nationality may hamper efforts to provide diplomatic and consular protection to them while they are abroad.

The issue of consular representation is not U.S.-specific. It is noted in the official statements of other countries that accept dual or multiple citizenship.

Acquiring Japanese Citizenship

Reading the complaints of long-term foreign residents who could not easily enter Japan for some months in 2019 — an issue that received repeated coverage in the Japan Times — I could not help wondering why they had not taken Japanese citizenship because the right to freely enter and exit Japan is one that all postwar governments appear to have scrupulously upheld.

Aside from removing the curse of FBAR FATCA and the IRS in the case of U.S. citizens there are other specific benefits to having Japanese nationality. It gives you the right to vote to stand for election and given COVID-19 restrictions on foreign nationals other than “special permanent residents” (essentially Korean citizens born in Japan) the “right of abode.”

Compared to U.S./U.K. citizenship that of Japan is relatively easy to acquire although the apparent near-100% acceptance rate is deceptive. As with the “99% conviction rate” in Japanese court cases it is the result of marginal cases being weeded out at an early stage.

The minimum requirements for naturalization are:

Five years domicile (residence) in Japan with a valid status of residence; 20 years of age or more (18 beginning 1 April 2022); Good conduct as evidenced by having no serious criminal record paying taxes etc.; Livelihood either as individual or family income or assets; No nationality or prepared to “in principle lose their nationality” except in cases where “nationality of the country cannot be lost regardless of the intention of the person”; Compliance with the Constitution of Japan.

Further “some of the above naturalization conditions [are] relaxed for foreign nationals (those born in Japan or who have a Japanese spouse Japanese child or once had Japanese nationality) who have a special relationship with Japan.” In other words unlike the U.S. or Canada you are not automatically a citizen just by being born in Japan but if you were it is relatively easy to get Japanese citizenship.

Koreans born in Japan who do not have Japanese citizenship sometimes refuse to apply for Japanese citizenship for ideological reasons. They are not denied citizenship but rather do not take advantage of the fast track that is available to them.

Other requirements for naturalization all involve documentation. There is a minimal common list of required documentation plus documentation that must be supplied on a case by case basis such as proof of a divorce settlement.

All documentation not originally in Japanese must be translated with both the original and the translation submitted. Rendering archaic British legalese such as appears in property deeds was a real challenge in my case.

It is also worth noting what is not required. In striking comparison to the U.S. and the U.K. there is no charge at any stage of the application process. Local governments in Japan have to provide required documentation at no charge.

There is no trivia contest or pub quiz style national knowledge examination as required by the U.S. U.K. Australia and other countries.

There is no minimum Japanese language competency specified. It is measured indirectly by your ability to deal with the required interviews and hand copy a statement you have prepared explaining why you wish to acquire Japanese nationality.

Being severely disabled or having a chronic disease does not prevent you from acquiring Japanese nationality unlike some allegedly liberal countries that have been known to deny applicants on the basis that they would be a burden on the national health system.

Conclusion

Thanks to the excellent site Becoming Legally Japanese a Japanese language book written for legal scriveners who help prepare citizenship applications and assistance from my wife in translating U.S./U.K. documents into Japanese I was able to complete my successful application with zero expenditure on professional legal or other assistance.

When asked whether I have any regrets about taking Japanese citizenship my stock reply is: “Yes. I have one great regret. I should have done it much sooner.”

The number of cards both debit and credit is still very nominal in Bangladesh. The number of people with banking accounts is also below average. So for cashless payments the mobile financial service (MFS) has opened the window for numerous consumers to experience touchless payments facilities.

The transformation started years ago and thanks to digital innovations the MFS industry has taken a new shape allowing people to combat the challenge of Covid-19.

The digital transformation has touched many sectors of the country over the years along with the financial industry helping the financial service to rise to the next level.

Even a couple of years ago it was unthinkable to open a financial account sitting at home only using digital tools. But it's now a ground reality. The wait for three to seven days has come down to only a few seconds and filling up of two to 10 pages of form have vanished from the process.

The introduction of digital KYC (know your customer) played a key role in this process. Banks that are conventionally conservative also embrace this facility and have started opening their regular banking accounts with this innovation.

In my view this has been the most significant innovation from the transformation point of view in the financial industry of Bangladesh in recent years. Credit also goes to the Bangladesh Bank for accepting the digital KYC which was developed by the local youths at Nagad and inaugurated by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on March 26 2019.

There is another innovation of Nagad that made the industry vibrant and very popular for account opening and caught the attention of international experts. Nagad account opening is now only a matter of dialling *167# from a mobile phone. We partnered with mobile phone carriers and hope this innovation will empower people and allow us to bring in those who were not part of any sort of financial services. In the digital age partnership with digital companies is very vital for transformation as well.

Riding on these facilities the overall number of registered mobile money clients stood close to 10 crores at the end of December 2020 in the country and almost half of the population is financially included with these payment facilities. The share of bank accounts to the inclusion segment is close to 20 per cent who are also using the mobile money service.

So the credit also goes to the mobile money industry that helps the fast-growing nation to push the financial inclusion agenda forward a major pillar of the Sustainable Development Goals. And we the industry people would also thank the government for the policy support extended to disruptive technology adoption.

With the advancement of mobile financial carriers particularly Nagad the citizens of the country can now transfer money make payments and pay all kinds of bills electronically. This is contributing to making money available to the people whenever they need it thus bringing about socio-economic development. There is no available data on how many ways mobile payment companies are pushing economic growth but it is also true that in the early stage of the pandemic in the country when everything was almost off MFS has played a vital role to run the economy especially for the SMEs.

When we launched our partnership with the Bangladesh Post Office two years back our initial target was to upgrade citizens' lives by digitising the payment system. I think we have done quite well in this segment. Other carriers also did their part and combining all these efforts people are now enjoying easy access to digital payment facilities.

A few days ago I went through a report of the UK where it mentioned that currently 50 per cent of the country's total sales are online and people also can do 40 per cent of their regular official activities sitting at home. We are still far from that but at least we can achieve this very near future.

MFS carriers particularly Nagad are now working with blockchain and artificial intelligence and this will expand the horizon of the service and ensure convenient digital life to users. Using MFS transactions the credit rating will be easier and the financial industry will leapfrog. This will ease distributing funds securely and transparently.

In October 2018 Gartner the world's leading research and advisory company predicted that digitalisation would make 80 per cent of traditional financial firms irrelevant by 2030. Two years have passed since the prediction was made and 10 years are left.

In Bangladesh the changes are already taking place. I will not be surprised if Gartner's forecast turns into reality even before 2030.

Indeed before and after Covid-19 there have been two separate worlds in every aspect not only in the financial sector. Technologies started reshaping the financial industry even before the pandemic and the process accelerated after the health crisis hit the globe. Digital adoption took a quantum leap at both organisational and customer levels in just a few months. This can be seen in users' transaction pattern and volume.

The Covid-19 crisis brought about changes in the way companies in all sectors and regions operate. Traditional sectors like education health and finance embrace technology and will be forced to change – which may not have happened in the next few years. These benefits industries such as the MFS that try to improve people's lives.

During the pandemic customers shifted dramatically towards online channels. We offered various facilities for the traders and the users to adopt digital payments. And only because of the reason there is no queue in the banks for utility bill payments as people are quite happy to pay their bills with the MFS platform. Nagad users frequently use the platform to meet daily payment needs including buying and selling things online paying bills for e-shopping depositing insurance premiums paying internet and utility bills tuition fees and much more. Some philanthropy organisations are using this payment system to collect donations helping them run their operations smoothly.

The mobile financial carrier has solved the challenges the government had faced in disbursing funds under the safety net programmes. The ultimate result is ensured transparency improved efficacy and time saved. This transformation is empowering people.

In Bangladesh we are awaiting digital banking regulations. We hope regulators will act fast to introduce this kind of banking which has already been introduced in India and has been available in the developed countries for years. Nagad is an interested party to take a digital banking licence. If we are awarded the licence our service level will improve and users will get all the banking facilities on their mobile devices at cheaper rates.

Banks are gradually moving online. Still most of the banking services are dependent on documents and people need to visit branches for most of their banking activities. If the digital banking regime is introduced everything will be available on mobile phones and the economic growth will accelerate.

At least 22 stocks on the entire S&P 500 list fall into that category.

Many other non-S&P stocks also have ties to cryptocurrency.

Several of the largest S&P 500 companies are leveraging cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

Big Tech & Payment Companies Lead the Way

Several Big Tech companies offer enterprise blockchain services. Microsoft (#2 by market cap) offers blockchain-as-a-service through its Azure marketplace. Amazon (#3) offers a comparable service through AWS and is also exploring crypto payments.

Additionally Facebook (#4) is backing the Diem Association and its stablecoin while Google (#5) is running public blockchain nodes through its Google Cloud division.

Tesla (#6) has just invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and is considering adding cryptocurrency as a means of payment.

Lesser tech companies like AT&T (#28) Cisco (#29) and Oracle (#59) offer enterprise blockchain services. Intel (#20) and IBM (#66) are involved in the Hyperledger blockchain project while Salesforce (#26) has built its own blockchain on Hyperledger Sawtooth.

Financial Institutions and Payment Processors

Leading payment companies are heavily involved in cryptocurrency. Visa (#12) is working with several partner companies to support crypto payment cards. PayPal (#14) has supported crypto trading since October and is planning to expand its offerings. Mastercard (#17) has recently announced plans to support crypto conversions.

Banks and financial institutions are turning to crypto as well. JPMorgan (#10) offers its JPMCoin stablecoin and Liink blockchain; Wells Fargo (#53) also offers its own stablecoins. BlackRock (#71) is making plans to introduce crypto funds. Goldman Sachs (#69) and BNY Mellon (#198) are planning crypto custody services.

Meanwhile CME Group (#112) offers crypto futures trading while ICE (#118) offers crypto futures trading through its Bakkt unit. Related to this the coffee chain Starbucks (#58) is working closely with ICE and Bakkt to accept Bitcoin payments.

Other Noteworthy Stocks

Numerous other crypto-related companies offer stocks but are not included on the S&P 500. Square for example handles Bitcoin and owns $200 million of BTC. Alibaba and SAP both offer blockchain-as-a service Samsung develops a mobile crypto wallet and Cloudflare operates an Ethereum gateway.

Future actions could also create more stocks. Crypto exchange Coinbase is planning to go public and could plausibly rank among the 500 largest stocks even if it is not included in the S&P 500.

Twitter (#131 on the S&P 500) is reportedly considering a Bitcoin investment but has not yet made a purchase.

A number of low-ranking crypto mining companies are also publicly traded including Riot Blockchain Marathon Patent Group Canaan and Hive Blockchain Technologies. However all of these stocks are far too small for inclusion in the S&P 500.

Over 22 Stocks Have Crypto Ties

Based on this data at least 22 companies in the S&P 500 can be considered companies involved in crypto or blockchain. At least 11 of those stocks are within the S&P 500’s top 25 stocks.

Looking beyond the S&P 500 at least 31 publicly traded stocks can be considered crypto-related investments.

This is particularly worthy of consideration as some commentators see stock market capitalizations as a point of comparison for the crypto market. With a market cap of $890 billion Bitcoin itself is currently comparable to Tesla a top ten stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,

That's because both the drinks have their distinct effect on the blood pressure and when combined may confuse your internal system. According to a 2018 study the two beverages can lead to a change in the diameter of the blood vessel to a dangerous level. The vessel dilation was on average 5.1 per cent in diameter before the energy drink and later changed to 2.8 per cent which could increase the risk of acute impairment in vascular function.



Another 2016 study revealed that the combination can lead to a significant increase in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The drastic change in the blood pressure may be particularly bad for all those already suffering from the problem of high blood pressure.

Fluctuation in the blood pressure on a regular interval can put extra pressure on the heart and may increase the risk of stroke heart attack and heart disease.

NEW DELHI: Taking a leaf out of Reliance Industries Ltd's playbook state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation ( ONGC ) is forming a new subsidiary for gas business that could be used to bid and buy gas from the firm's own fields.The board of ONGC at its meeting on February 13 approved creation of a new wholly-owned subsidiary company for gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) business value chain subject to necessary approvals according to the firm's third quarter earnings announcement.""The company is being formed with the objective of sourcing marketing and trading of natural gas LNG business Hydrogen enriched CNG (HCNG) gas to power business bio-energy/ bio-gas/ bio methane/ other biofuels business etc"" it said.ONGC may use the new subsidiary to buy any new gas that the firm produces from fields such as KG-D5 in the Krishna Godavari basin people with direct knowledge of the matter said.The government had in October 2020 allowed affiliates of gas producers to buy the fuel in open auction.This policy change allowed Reliance to buy two-thirds out of the additional 7.5 million standard cubic metres per day of gas it along with partner BP plc of UK plans to produce this year from the new fields in KG-D6 block.""ONGC too can look at this option now. The new subsidiary can participate in any auction that ONGC will do for incremental gas from KG-D5 block"" a source said.Besides ensuring competition and fair price discovery the ONGC subsidiary can then sell the gas so sourced to firms such as Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) at a margin.This would help ONGC earn better margins on the gas produced.""Right now gas is a loss-making business for ONGC. The government controls gas price which is less than cost of production"" the source said.The government has fixed a price of USD 1.79 per million British thermal unit for ONGC's fields. This is half of the cost of production.It allows a higher rate of USD 4.06 per mmBtu for difficult fields such as deepsea fields (KG-D6 and KG-D6) but even that is less than the cost of production from highly capital intensive projects.The current regulation means even if Reliance discovered a price equivalent of USD 6-7 per mmBtu for the 7.5 mmscmd of new gas from KG-D6 it would get only USD 4.06 till March 31.The same would apply for ONGC. It might discover a rate higher for the 15 mmscmd incremental gas planned from KG-D5 block but it can get only USD 4.06 as per current price.""So essentially the ONGC's gas subsidiary can bid and buy KG-D5 gas. It will pay ONGC USD 4.06 per mmBtu but can sell to MRPL or any other customer at a price higher than that ensuring that the gas business becomes a viable proposition"" the source said.The government has given operators the freedom to discover market prices but this rate is subject to a pricing ceiling or cap that the government notifies every six months. The cap for six months to March 31 2021 is USD 4.06 per mmBtu.In the February 5 auction Reliance O2C Limited an affiliate of Reliance Industries Ltd picked up 4.8 mmscmd out of the 7.5 mmscmd gas auctioned.State gas utility GAIL (India) Ltd won 0.85 mmscmd of supplies while Shell picked up 0.7 mmscmd.Adani Total Gas Ltd got 0.1 mmscmd Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) 0.2 mmscmd and Torrest Gas 0.02 mmscmd. Other buyers included IRM Energy (0.1 mmscmd) PIL (0.35 mmscmd) and IGS (0.35 mmscmd) they said.Sources said the gas was bought at a price of USD 0.18 per million British thermal unit discount to JKM (Japan/Korea liquefied natural gas import price) that is price of JKM (minus) USD 0.18 with tenures ranging from 3 to 5 years.Reliance O2C is the new unit that holds the firm's refinery and petrochemical assets.Earlier in November 2019 5 mmscmd of natural gas was sold at a price in the range of around 8.6 per cent of Brent crude oil for tenure ranging from 2 to 6 years. That gas went to buyers like Essar Steel Adani Group and state-owned GAIL.Reliance-BP started production of gas on December 18 last year from the R Cluster ultra-deep-water gas field in block KG-D6 off the east coast of India.The duo are developing three deep-water gas projects in block KG-D6 -- R Cluster Satellites Cluster and MJ -- which together are expected to meet around 15 per cent of India's gas demand by 2023.ONGC is developing a set of discoveries in the KG-D5 block which sits next to Reliance's D6 area.ONGC's fields which began production last year at a limited rate of 1 mmscmd are estimated to have peak production rates of 16 mmsmd of natural gas and 80000 barrels per day of oil.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hdXRvL25ld3MvYXRoZXJzLWdyb3d0aC1yZWxpZXMtb24tbmV3LWZhY2lsaXR5LTQ1MC1zZXJpZXMtdGllci0yLW1hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODA4OTcyOTguY21z0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2F1dG8vbmV3cy9hdGhlcnMtZ3Jvd3RoLXJlbGllcy1vbi1uZXctZmFjaWxpdHktNDUwLXNlcmllcy10aWVyLTItbWFya2V0cy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODA4OTcyOTguY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ather’s growth relies on new facility 450 Series tier-2 markets,"Tier-2 market penetration

450 twins still in the driver’s seat

90% localization and the job opportunities

Ather’s manufacturing prowess

Current portfolio

NEW DELHI: Ather Energy is not far from becoming a household name when it comes to EVs. Despite not revealing the sales and the current bookings the automaker seems to have bet high on the Ather 450X and Ather 450 Plus . Scaling up the annual production to 1.1 lakh scooters and 1.2 lakh battery packs and also committing to invest Rs 635 crore in its new facility over a period of 5 years speaks volumes about the current demand for Ather Energy’s portfolio in its stronghold market the Tier-1 cities and the growing demand in the newly explored target market the Tier-2 cities.As Ather Energy has now begun production at its new facility in Tamil Nadu and seems to be betting high on its Tier-2 market appeal and the new facility itself TOI Auto got into a conversation with Tarun Mehta CEO Ather Energy to understand how challenging was it penetrating into the Tier-2 market and what change in strategy did it actually require.Ather Energy confirmed its presence in 27 cities across 15 states. The automaker currently delivers its electric scooters in Tier-1 cities like Bangalore Chennai Mumbai Pune Delhi Hyderabad Kolkata and Ahmedabad. And apart from the already established network in the Tier-1 cities the automaker now boasts a comprehensive network in 19 Tier-2 cities that include Kochi Coimbatore Calicut Mysore Hubli Jaipur Indore Panaji Bhubaneshwar Nasik Surat Chandigarh Vijayawada Visakhapatnam Guwahati Nagpur Noida Lucknow and Siliguri. And Ather is expected to expand to 40 cities by the end of 2021.To penetrate into the Tier-2 market Ather Energy adopted a completely new strategy and instead of opting for an Ather-controlled or owned outlet they chose to collaborate with retail partners. This move has allowed the automaker to increase scale-up its footprint at a faster pace.“We’re now working with retail partners. Instead of setting up Ather-owned or controlled or managed experience centres we’re collaborating with retail partners. It is allowing us to expand our footprint quickly and this is the biggest change in our strategy” said Tarun Mehta.Ather Energy is focused on scaling up the production and the distribution of its current portfolio which includes the Ather 450X and the Ather 450 Plus. Other than the 450 twins the automaker has no plans to introduce any new offerings or enhance the current portfolio for some time.“The focus is to scaling the production up along with the supply chain and the distribution for the current portfolio” said Mehta.When asked if the automaker is working towards offering more bang for the buck in any aspect Mehta simply replied that the previous range improvement came sometime back and that there’s nothing down the pipeline in this particular area.Ather Energy has managed to achieve 90% localization with its current portfolio. The automaker boasts a comprehensive supply chain and has also managed to localize the production of the battery pack. According to the automaker majority of its supplier base is in Tamil Nadu making Hosur an ideal place to set up the production facility in.“Apart from the lithium-ion cells that go inside the battery pack everything’s manufactured locally. And the TFT touch screen and the entire dashboard is manufactured in Chennai” said Mehta.While the 90% localization is definitely a feat achieved the job opportunities that the automaker has created in the region is also commendable. The lithium-ion battery manufacturing is a key area of focus for the automaker and Ather Energy is already working on training more than 4000 employees with the relevant skillset over the next 5 years.Ather Energy has set up its mega-factory in Hosur Tamil Nadu using Industry 4.0 principles and it boasts a production capacity of 110000 scooters per year and 120000 battery packs per year. Ather Energy has also managed to become one of the only EV-makers in India to make their own battery packs. The automaker has filed around 13 patents on the design and manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries.While the current demand limits the production to around 90 units a day the automaker’s mega-factory is capable of producing around 333 units a day.Ather Energy’s current portfolio includes the Ather 450X and the Ather 450 Plus. The 450 twins share a 2.9 kWh battery with the 450X getting a usable capacity of 2.6 kWh and the 450 Plus boasting a usable capacity of 2.23 kWh.The Ather 450X gets a maximum power output of 8.1 PS and delivers a peak torque of 26 Nm. While the top speed is electronically limited to 80 kmph the electric scooter clocks 0-40 kmph in 3.3 seconds. The 450X gets 4 riding modes- Warp Sport Eco and Ride. In Ride mode the 450X is claimed to offer a range of 70 km while in Eco mode the range is expected to be around 85 km.The Ather 450 Plus on the other hand gets a maximum power output of 7.3 PS and delivers a peak torque of 22 Nm. The top speed of this model is restricted to 80 kmph too while it can clock 0-40 kmph in 3.9 seconds. The 450 Plus gets 3 riding modes- Sport Ride and Eco. The 450 Plus offers a range of 60 km in Ride mode while it is claimed to offer a range of 70 km in Eco mode.The key highlight of the 450 twins is their 7-inch TFT LCD touchscreen. The display comes with a Snapdragon 212 Quadcore processor with 1GB RAM and 8GB storage. The dashboard gets features like OTA updates navigation auto indicator off guide-me-home lights connected mobile app side stand sensor and a time-based adaptive screen brightness adjustment. Apart from this the mobile app offers features like ride stats push navigation live location and vehicle state tracking and a few more.When it comes to charging the 450X and 450 Plus can charge from 0-80% in 3 hours 35 minutes at home and the 0-100% takes close to 5 hours 45 minutes.",,,
KO,Coca-Cola Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L2NvY2EtY29sYS10ZXN0LW1hcmtldC1wYXBlci1ib3R0bGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coca-Cola to test market paper bottle prototype in limited trial,"The Coca-Cola Company has announced it will be trialing a paper bottle prototype in a limited run of 2000 later this year. The test sales of the plant-based beverage AdeZ will be conducted in Hungary through the e-grocery retailer Kifli.hu.

Selling beverages in paper containers is as old as the milk carton which was called a paper bottle back in 1915. However they aren't suitable for all beverages and certainly not for carbonated ones that need something a bit more robust. That being said a paper bottle is very attractive from an environmental point of view since paper is biodegradable and relatively easy to recycle.

In 2020 Coca-Cola's R&D division in Brussels along with the Danish startup Paper Bottle Company (Paboco) and working with Carlsberg L’Oréal and The Absolut Company came up with a bottle consisting of a hard paper shell lined with a bio-based plastic that is also used for the cap.

Coca-Cola emphasizes that the bottle is still in development as the company assesses the prototype bottle's performance durability and ability to protect its contents. That being said Coca-Cola wants to go ahead with consumer testing to determine how it performs in the real world and measure how well people take to the new receptacle.

The ultimate goal is to produce a 100-percent recyclable bottle for beverages and other products that can stand up to liquids carbon dioxide and oxygen. Ideally the bottle would be made entirely from recycled materials and could be recycled itself as paper.

""The trial we are announcing today is a milestone for us in our quest to develop a paper bottle"" says Daniela Zahariea director of technical supply chain and innovation Coca‑Cola Europe. ""People expect Coca‑Cola to develop and bring to market new innovative and sustainable types of packaging. That’s why we are partnering with experts like Paboco experimenting openly and conducting this first in-market trial.""

In the second quarter of the year 2000 domestic customers will be able to meet the new type of packaging solution.

During the first European market test Coca-Cola’s plant-based beverage AdeZ will be presented in a new paper bottle and will reach consumers through a partnership with Kifli.hu one of Hungary’s fastest-growing online food retailers.

According to Pénzcentrum the paper bottle prototype developed in collaboration with scientists at Coca-Cola’s research and development laboratory in Brussels and the Danish Paper Bottle Company (Paboco) is part of the soft drink manufacturer’s “A World Without Waste” strategy. The commitments of the project include that by 2030 Coca-Cola will collect and recycle 100% of its packaging materials.

One of the goals of the “A World Without Waste” project is to develop innovative packaging solutions that enable a circular economy.

The technology developed by Paboco aims to create 100% recyclable bottles made from sustainably sourced wood with a bio-based liner suitable for storing liquids such as carbonated and non-carbonated beverages beauty products and other everyday consumer products. In the current prototype in addition to the paper cover the lining and cap are made of recyclable plastic.

The ultimate goal is to develop a bottle that does not contain plastic in its liner and that can be fully recyclable as paper.

As we wrote before Coca-Cola already came up with several projects aiming for sustainability and environmentally-friendly packaging. The manufacture of lighter aluminium cans and the replacement of the shrink-wrap was one of the main projects of the company realised in Hungary read more HERE.

“We see the consumer test announced today as a milestone in our efforts to develop paper bottles” said Daniela Zahariea Coca-Cola Europe’s Director of Technical Supply Chain and Innovation.

“Consumers of the AdeZ plant-based drink are particularly characterised by a strong focus on sustainability and an interest in developments and innovations in said area. That is why we think that given the brand’s messages and product the AdeZ brand is a good choice to test the prototype and reception of our new paper bottle in a fierce market environment” added Katalin Halász the European Marketing Director responsible for Coca-Cola’s Nutrition category.

It never seems to take long for immaculate and shiny baking trays to take a turn for the worse.

A couple of food spills and a few trips in the often leaves burned-on stains and scorch marks that feel impossible to budge no matter how hard you scrub.

TikTok user @Sisterpledgecleans shared a video of a baking tray that had definitely seen better days with almost the entire surface left dark in colour after a lot of use.

But rather than simply binning it for a replacement they shared a simple solution to restore the trays using Coca-Cola - and the results are impressive.

In the clip titled: ""Clean burned baking trays with cola"" Diet Coke is poured into the tray with just enough to cover the entire bottom surface before being left overnight to work its magic.

The tray is then scrubbed with soapy water as they add the ""burned bits"" should now just flake off restoring the metal to a silver colour once again.

The before and after images of the baking tray show a huge improvement so it may be worth a try if all else has failed.

Previously a tip shared in a cleaning group on Facebook went viral after one woman managed to bring her baking tray back to life simply using a 2p coin.

She wrote: ""Don't bin baking trays. I spend a fortune on baking trays because I buy the cheaper range and they don't last long being marked by tough cooking stains.

""Rub the baking tray with the 2p and then wash as you would with daily dishes. It works takes away the burnt marks left from baking/cooking. No more binning and replacing.""

Thus they were cognizant of India as a civilisational nation whose unity and integrity was primarily informed by Sanatana Dharma eons before they assembled to frame the Constitution. Therefore the moral obligation of the Constitution was largely to nurture our ancient civilisation and its values with a view to reintegrate our nation and its people. For bereft of those there will be no “India” in India as a mere geographical lump alone does not make a nation.

GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HINDU TEMPLES IS ANTI-CIVILISATIONAL

Temples and muths are life and soul of Hinduism just as churches and mosques are for Christianity and Islam. The institutional capacity for self-correction and self-defence sustenance of the priestly class artistes and various service occupations and crafts has traditionally come from the perennial income generated by the temples and muths. They helped organic growth of religious leadership and of resource capacity to serve the needy and destitute in terms of education hospitals orphanages and old age homes.

A secular state by definition cannot control and manage religious institutions that too of only one religion. Article 26 of the Constitution bestows the fundamental right on all religions irrespective of majority or minority to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes to manage their own affairs and to own acquire and administer property thereof.

If there were allegations of mismanagement in certain temples then government intervention could be only for a very limited period as per Article 31A(1)(b) of the Constitution to set things right in that temple. The honourable Supreme Court has also reiterated the same in the Chidambaram temple case.

Despite constitutional provisions Hindu temples continue to be controlled and routinely taken over by state governments whereas mosques and churches are allowed to be exclusively managed by the respective communities even though Article 26 confers the right equally upon all sections of citizens.

Moreover the state control of temples is doubly prejudicial for Hindus in that they have not only lost control of their temples to the government but because of that very reason of temples being under the control of government it becomes a part of “the State” as per Article 12 of the Constitution. As a result the centuries-old religious customs festivals and practices get challenged and interfered with selectively and unduly.

Sabarimala is a prominent case in point. Had the Sabarimala shrine not been under government control Part-III of the Constitution would not have been applicable to it and there would not have been judicial intervention into the age old religious customs and practices of Sabarimala.

Evidently with the denial of the right to manage their own temples the “majority” Hindus in India fare no differently from minority dhimmis as in certain theocratic countries. Deprived of resources and institutions Hinduism has been decaying. Clearly the religious rights of Hindus count for nothing and states can trample on them at will. So much for religious freedom for majority Hindus.

GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HINDU TEMPLES IN KERALA

Five Devaswom Boards namely the Travancore Devaswom Board the Cochin Devaswom Board Malabar Devaswom Board the Guruvayoor Devaswom Board and the Koodalmanickam Devaswom Board have been constituted by the Kerala government under the Travancore-Cochin Hindu Religious Institutions Act 1950 the Madras Hindu Religious Act and Charitable Endowment Act 1951 the Guruvayoor Devaswom Act 1978 and the Koodalmanickam Devaswom Act 2005 respectively to take over and manage Hindu temples. In 2015 the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act was enacted to provide for common recruitment to various posts in all Devaswom Boards and their institutions.

A total of 3002 Hindu temples are managed by the Travancore Devaswom Board (1249) the Cochin Devaswom Board (403) Malabar Devaswom Board (1337) the Guruvayoor Devaswom Board (12) and the Koodalmanickam Devaswom Board (1). All these temples together have tens of thousands of crores worth properties. Their combined annual income is more than Rs 1000 crore. The Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple which has hundreds of crores of wealth and a substantial annual income is managed by the Travancore royal family.

This has completely crippled Hindu society and its institutional capacity and resource ability to be self-sufficient and in presenting a unified front to address the religious problems both from within and outside.

Ruling parties of all hues have used Hindu temples to dole out political patronage in appointments of their party persons to the temple boards thereby serving the vested political interests rather than Hindu society and Hindu Dharma.

Further the government-controlled temples have been turned into commercial enterprises whereby the devotees have to pay for darshan and every other activity in the temple. This is outrageous and is nothing but religious tax or jaziya imposed on Hindus.

Proselytizers cite the government-imposed system to vilify Hinduism by saying that Hindus have to pay money to visit their gods/temples to lure Hindus to convert.

Government control of temples has also led to a lot of perversions in temple management including appointment of non-Hindus or atheists misuse and misappropriation of temple lands and properties interference in age old rituals customs traditions etc.

HINDU SOCIETY ALONE SHOULD MANAGE TEMPLES DEMOCRATICALLY WITHOUT GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE

A secular government has no business to take over and mange Hindu temples and their properties. Just as Christians Muslims and Sikhs manage their own places of worship without government interference it is high time that the government freed all Hindu temples to be managed by Hindu society democratically and without government interference. The Sikh gurudwara management model with suitable modifications can be an apt democratic model for governance of Hindu temples.

One of the authors of this piece M. Nageswara Rao IPS (Retd) has drafted a Model Temple Management Bill which provides for:

(i) The access to Hindu religious institutions of public character to all classes and sections of Hindus with due regard to the religious customs of each such institution;

(ii) The management of Hindu religious institutions and administration of their properties through a body consisting of Hindu religious persons and Hindu representatives of electoral colleges consisting of Hindus elected for the purpose for each such institution or for a group of such institutions with the State exercising no control over the management or affairs of such institutions or administration of their properties;

(iii) The appropriation of funds properties and all resources of Hindu religious institutions only for the purposes of maintenance development and construction of Hindu religious institutions; for the religious well-being of Hindus and the Hindu community; and for the preservation promotion and propagation of Hinduism;

(iv) The prohibition of non-Hindus from taking part in the management administration or any other activity whatsoever of the Hindu religious institutions and their properties;

(v) The protection by the State of all Hindu religious institutions and their properties from encroachment or illegal destruction;

(vi) The creation of state district and local level Hindu Dharma Sabhas consisting of both religious and elected representatives of Hindu religious institutions for the purposes of guidance preservation promotion and propagation of Hinduism.

As Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev recently and rightly said “We live in times where we understand the government should not manage airlines airports industry mining and trade. But how is it that sacred temples can be managed by government. What qualifies them?”

We therefore appeal to Honourable Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and his Kerala government to free all Hindu temples and religious institutions from government control by enacting a law providing for their democratic management by Hindu society without any government interference. We will be happy to assist the government in this exercise.

After four years with a physicians’ group providing primary care for low-income patients in rural West Virginia she came to Ann Arbor in 2011 to join Integrated Health Associates (IHA) the giant physician network affiliated with St. Joe’s. But after eight years she says she tired of seeing twenty patients a day while “checking boxes in the electronic health records.” She left IHA in 2019 and last August opened a one-‘woman office in her home west of town.

Until recently solo practices seemed doomed in part because only groups like IHA have the systems and specialists needed to navigate the insanely complex medical billing rules required for insurance reimbursement. But Klaes bypassed that entirely. She’s practicing a new concept called “direct primary care” (DPC) which doesn’t require her to send bills or accept insurance. Instead her seventy patients pay flat fees of $30 to $90 a month depending on their age.

For that she says “they have access to me when they need me” via text email phone video or in-person visits–“whatever works.” For testing she connects them to companies that provide “lab and imaging for a huge discount–up to 90 percent” for direct payment.

Amy Blondin a patient of Klaes from IHA was one of the first to sign up. “I didn’t have insurance for several years” she says “and was paying for everything out of pocket … I didn’t go as often because I couldn’t afford all the fees and costs.”

DPC physicians typically recommend that patients buy “major medical” insurance that will kick in if they need expensive specialized care or hospitalization. Through her employer Blondin now has that. And when she sees Klaes she says “I can relax [knowing] I’m not going to have to pay $150 out of pocket if I come to see her about my sore knee.”

Klaes says some of her patients have no insurance at all. Just having regular access to a physician she says is “a big step up for them.”

Jeff O’Boyle who opened a DPC practice on Packard in 2018 knows all about that. “During my medical school I was completely uninsured” he says. “Working in the wards of the biggest hospital systems in Chicago I could not access the care I was providing … my wife worked as a paralegal and we made too much money to qualify for Medicaid but not enough money to afford any health insurance.”

After a residency at Beaumont Hospital O’Boyle says “I worked briefly in a hospital-based clinic for about a year and let me tell you I was absolutely miserable … It’s all about the turnover because in the insurance fee-for-service system the more people you see the more money obviously you’ll make.

“You’ve got to see between twenty and twenty-five people a day you get on average about eight minutes with each patient and you know there’s just mountains of paperwork to satisfy the insurance companies. You end up working for the insurance companies! You don’t work for the patients! I kid you not. I’m in my thirties and I told myself I was going to quit medicine altogether and do a different career if this was my life.”

But then he heard about direct primary care from a colleague and “thought that was absolutely fascinating … I put about four or five months of research into it opened my clinic and have been going strong ever since.”

He currently has 300 patients paying $30-$80 a month. For them he says DPC is “sort of like Netflix but for medicine.” Like Klaes he’s negotiated direct-payment discounts at independent labs for testing and imaging. He also buys medication wholesale–“the same place Walmart Kroger CVS buy them”–then “sell[s] those medications wholesale back to my patients.”

O’Boyle has a medical assistant and plans to hire a second doctor as the practice grows–his goal is 600 patients. But he wants that second doctor “to buy into the fact that we’re not just going to turn people out every ten-fifteen minutes” he says. “We want to sit down and listen to our patients and get to know them.”

Patient Lisa Profera appreciates that O’Boyle goes “above and beyond” to be accommodating like meeting her on a Saturday to give her a Covid test. A former IHA pediatrician who now helps people “look better and feel better” at her aesthetics and lifestyle practice ProjuvuMD she also appreciates the money she’s saving. Her husband is also self-employed and they had been paying $25000 a year for health insurance. Now she says they’re paying about $5000 a year for primary care plus a major medical plan for themselves and their two grown daughters.

“Yes we’re doing this because we want to make a living doing this” says O’Boyle. “But we’re also doing this because we’re good at what we do. … In any business the way you get more business is to connect with your customers. And DPC is on the forefront of that for health care in the foreseeable future.”

Klaes says she’s still “filling out” her practice and is making only a fraction of what she did at IHA–but “luckily that doesn’t have to be my goal.” And to her surprise she says she loves having her work “more seamlessly integrated with my life.”

She thought that working at home might mean “blurring lines in a way that I wouldn’t like. But it really feels very natural. I enjoy it much more than I thought.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYWx0aGFjdGlvbi5vcmcvY2FzZS1zdHVkaWVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Case Studies,"Amazon is hosting pop-up vaccine clinics at their Seattle headquarters and has offered vaccine distribution support to the Biden administration.

The Marguerite Building pictured here in 1890 was one of three buildings former Norwich Mayor Timothy Murphy constructed and named after his three daughters Marguerite Alice and Marion. Only the Alice Building which sits on Main Street remains today. The Marguerite which sat on the corner of North Main Street and East Main Street at Burnham Square fell into disrepair due to neglect. It was a unique building because trains ran under the back of the building causing severe vibration. In the late 1900s parts of the building started falling onto the railroad tracks below. After becoming a safety problem the building was condemned by the city and demolished in 1996.

(NYSE:CAG)?,"If you want to know who really controls Conagra Brands Inc. (NYSE:CAG) then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. Institutions often own shares in more established companies while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. Companies that used to be publicly owned tend to have lower insider ownership.

With a market capitalization of US$17b Conagra Brands is rather large. We'd expect to see institutional investors on the register. Companies of this size are usually well known to retail investors too. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below) it seems that institutions own shares in the company. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Conagra Brands.

See our latest analysis for Conagra Brands

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Conagra Brands?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

Conagra Brands already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Conagra Brands' historic earnings and revenue below but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Conagra Brands is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Capital Research and Management Company with ownership of 12%. In comparison the second and third largest shareholders hold about 11% and 6.9% of the stock.

On further inspection we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 10 shareholders suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Conagra Brands

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Our information suggests that Conagra Brands Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1% we can see that board members collectively own US$63m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public holds a 14% stake in Conagra Brands. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

After the Quaker Oats Company purchased the Aunt Jemima Mills Company in 1926 — which was then known for its ready-made ""self-rising pancake flour"" — it eventually introduced Aunt Jemima syrup 40 years later. It's one of the most recognizable brands of ""fake syrup"" which is made from corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup that is dyed and processed to mimic the appearance and flavor of pure maple syrup which is made from maple tree sap.

As The Washington Post reported in 2015 most Americans overwhelmingly prefer the taste of artificial syrup. Seventy percent of the 1000 consumers surveyed by the publication indicated that they would rather reach for a brand like Aunt Jemima or Mrs. Butterworth's than pure maple syrup. A large part of that preference can be attributed to price; you can purchase a gallon of Aunt Jemima for $16.80 on Amazon whereas a gallon of Grade-A maple syrup starts at $59.99.

Out with Aunt Jemima in with the Pearl Milling Company

Amid nationwide Black Lives Matters protests Quaker Oats announced plans in June 2020 to remove the image of Aunt Jemima from its packaging and changing the name of the brand. This week the company announced that it had decided on a new name: The Pearl Milling Company.""

For many the change is long overdue — but the shift continues to raise questions about Black representation on mainstream products as well as the afterlife of racist imagery and the continued romanticization of the Antebellum South.

""We recognize Aunt Jemima's origins are based on a racial stereotype"" Kristin Kroepfl vice president and chief marketing officer of Quaker Foods North America said in a news release in June. ""As we work to make progress toward racial equality through several initiatives we also must take a hard look at our portfolio of brands and ensure they reflect our values and meet our consumers' expectations.""

At the time other brands announced similar changes: B&G Foods announced that it would conduct a review of Cream of Wheat's packaging which depicts a Black chef who was originally based on Rastus a racist caricature portrayed in minstrel shows. (The company changed the mascot in the 1920s to portray Barbados-born chef Frank L. White but some say the connotation still remains.) ConAgra Brands released a statement saying it had ""begun a complete packaging review"" of the Mrs. Butterworth syrup brand as the bottle was reminiscent of Mammy caricatures.

Mar's announced that it would evolve the ""visual brand identity"" of Uncle Ben's products which also originated in racist stereotypes and imagery and currently depict an elderly Black man. Dixie Beer Brewery and Eskimo Pie voiced similar initiatives too.

There was some pushback specifically from white consumers who didn't view the Aunt Jemima logo on the more contemporary packaging — the character's ""mammy"" headscarf was removed during a 1989 update — and name as racist. According to Toni Tipton-Martin the James Beard Award-winning food writer and author of the book ""The Jemima Code: Two Centuries of African American Cookbooks"" the Aunt Jemima character and trademark ""was used to create wealth for people that did not include the very people that the trademark was based on — and that would be African American women.""

""Today it's an innocuous figure which is why I think we're seeing the blowback and the questioning of her removal because people see faces on packages all the time"" she told Salon at the time. ""If you are talking about the origin story then there was a significant message being telegraphed to the buyer — and M.M. Manring talks about this in the book 'Slave in the Box.' There's this concept of assuring the home cooks who no longer had Black women in their kitchens through emancipation they could still maintain the high quality cooking with the purchase of this product.""

Referred to in Tipton-Martin's book ""the Jemima Code"" focuses on the descriptions of and codes surrounding Black women who lived and worked in the plantation South especially the caricature of Aunt Jemima. The logo signaled the quality of the product within to white consumers — without serving as a reminder of the cruel reality of enslavement in pre-Civil War America. Tipton-Martin said there was a message for Black shoppers as well.

""It would serve to remind African Americans that your options are limited"" she said. ""You will always be the 'slave in the box' hence the title of that excellent book. And those two concepts fused over the years so that only African Americans feel that identity pain and loss of agency associated with characterizing African American female cooks as those who do the hard labor in the kitchen.""

Fast-forward to February 2021 and Quaker Oats announced that the official name is changing from ""Aunt Jemima"" to ""Pearl Milling Company."" PepsiCo which owns the Quaker Oats brand explained the story behind the new name in a Tuesday statement.

""Though new to store shelves Pearl Milling Company was founded in 1888 in St. Joseph Mo. and was the originator of the iconic self-rising pancake mix that would later become known as Aunt Jemima"" the statement read.

The rebranded Pearl Milling Company also said in the statement that its new name was ""developed with inclusivity in mind"" and workshopped with ""consumers employees external cultural and subject-matter experts and diverse agency partners.""

While removing racist imagery from products is imperative some relatives of the women who portrayed Aunt Jemima throughout the product's history are worried that the rebrand will contribute to the erasure of the legacies of female Black professionals.

Descendants of Lillian Richard who portrayed Aunt Jemima alongside 11 brand ambassadors starting in 1925 claimed that the company decided to rename the brand without consulting the families of the women who brought the character to life according to WBUR.

While Vera Harris Richard's niece supports the decision and the Black Lives Matter movement Aunt Jemima represents a part of history for her family and the town of Hawkins Texas.

""Erasing my Aunt Lillian Richard would erase a part of history"" Harris who serves as family historian for the Richard family of Hawkins told the station. ""All of the people in my family are happy and proud of Aunt Lillian and what she accomplished.""

In Hawkins a historical marker commemorates how she made a career during a time in history when Black women had very few opportunities. To keep her aunt's legacy alive Harris told WBUR that she hopes Quaker Oats comes out with a commemorative box or bottle to recognize the many women who portrayed Aunt Jemima over the years. The back of the box could list their names and put a spotlight on one of the women each month she suggested.

Harris would like to see the box include a photo of her aunt dressed as Aunt Jemima with the scarf — but also a photo of Richard looking like herself to show people a more complete picture.

""She was an intelligent young vital beautiful Black woman that took the job"" Harris said. ""She understood the times that she lived and she just wanted to work.""

Brand recommendations plus Salon's favorite recipes featuring maple syrup

Pearl Milling Company products won't officially be on the shelves until June according to the company's release. This combined with the increased attention on the racist roots of Aunt Jemima has inspired many consumers to look for Black-owned maple syrup companies.

One such brand is Michele Foods which was founded and is owned by Michele Hoskins of South Holland Ill. Her company which saw a 78% increase in sales following news of the Aunt Jemima rebrand sells gourmet maple syrup (as well as butter pecan syrup and honey creme syrup). The packaging also features an illustration of Hoskins on the bottle.

Deven and Marquita Carter are the owners of Blanket Pancakes & Syrup which is located in Charlotte N.C. They sell original vanilla bean and cinnamon syrups which are free from preservatives and high-fructose corn syrup.

(Progressive Farmer image by Syngenta)

Playing the role of fortune-teller Syngenta's head of global seeds research might foresee an exciting future for crop varieties and traits thanks to big advances in plant breeding.

""Looking into the future transgenic technology will be accelerated by the new innovation that is happening in biotech areas such as genome editing"" Gusui Wu says. ""We believe gene-editing technology will have a big impact in the years to come.""

Advancements in gene editing and biotechnology are being driven by multiple seed companies in their efforts to improve agronomic attributes and yield to name just a few.

Jonathan Phillips head of weed and pest-control research in plant biotechnology for Bayer Crop Science predicts researchers have only scratched the surface of gene editing. He predicts the big change going forward is how new technology and traits are deployed.

Tom Greene agrees. The global leader of trait discovery with Corteva Agriscience says plant transformation and gene editing will continue

to evolve.

""I think we will continue to see an evolution of molecular-based technologies that target genome modification in different ways. Improvements in the efficiency of moving large sequences of DNA to enable the improvement of alleles from one background to another will facilitate trait development"" he says.

""Researchers will continue to look at efficiencies of different versions of CRISPR technology [see ""Altered Plants"" on page 10] and base-editing technology to expand the utility of these technology platforms.""

HI-EDIT

At Syngenta Wu contends HI-Edit technology which the company recently patented is the next big thing in plant transformation and trait development. HI-Edit is short for haploid-induction editing. Wu says it could reduce the time to develop commercial hybrid varieties by 70%.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although Miami Vice was the king of the cameo during the '80s the show wasn't alone in seeking out top talent.

On Feb. 11 1986 long-running action show The A-Team booked '80s pop star Boy George to appear in an episode called ""Cowboy George.""

The plot was music-focused: Faceman (Dirk Benedict) has hired the highly touted group Cowboy George and the Range Rats to play at a low-key venue called the Floor 'Em. However the musician who shows up is Boy George who's under the impression he's playing the Arizona Forum.

That mistake naturally doesn't go over well with the club which was expecting a different act (""I booked Cowboy George and some turkey in a sequined coat shows up"") and figures the new waver wearing ""eyeball glitter"" isn't going to sell tickets. The singer also isn't thrilled with the mix-up noting with cheerful passive-aggression about the venue ""Excuse me I can't play this place because it's a certified toilet.""

He later comes around however: After another pointed dig (""This place is really American but I think people will like us once they hear the music"") he and the rest of Culture Club end up performing two songs in the episode. First up was their current single ""Move Away"" which eventually became the band's last Top 40 single peaking at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100; later as the episode ends the band returns for a spirited lip-sync of the mega-hit ""Karma Chameleon.""

Watch Boy George on 'The A-Team'

In between these performances George gets involved with another subplot involving the A-Team springing into action to fight off bad guys.

Memorably Murdock (Dwight Schultz) enlists the musician to help jimmy a locked door; George gives a bobby pin and moral support. When Murdock notes ""A really honest man doesn't have an appetite for this"" as he struggles to open the door George says ""Who needs honesty?"" and then kicks the door in himself.

Unsurprisingly Boy George's The A-Team appearance has become legendary over the years – and in interviews he's revealed plenty of nuggets about his role. The singer revealed that his Culture Club bandmates initially wanted to be on the red-hot Miami Vice although it wasn't meant to be. ""I think because of me - we were a little too camp for Miami Vice"" he said during a 2020 interview

In a 1995 appearance on Late Night With Conan O'Brien he talked about the financial reasons his role came about. ""First of all they offered me a lot of money to do it"" he said and while he couldn't remember the exact amount he said it was ""close to"" $100000. ""It was something very alluring.""

""The thing was when I got there they gave me this script which was a total valley-girl script"" he added. ""And it was like 'I wouldn't say things like this.' But I thought 'Well they're paying me loads of money so I guess I'll go for it.'""

Watch an 'A-Team' Promo With Boy George

In his 1995 autobiography Take It Like a Man he recalled the actual filming was also a bit rough: ""I had to stay stoned to get through the experience.""

Among other things while The A-Team costar Mr. T was ""fabulous"" the icon had a big ego: ""There was some fun hiding from Mr. T who would charge into my Winnebago every morning and talk about how wonderful he was."" Mr. T and actor George Peppard (who played Hannibal) also didn't get along which caused mild stress although George has fond memories of Peppard and his wife.

And while George's kicking in the door has become an iconic move in the moment things were different. ""The last day's filming was the pinnacle of cringe"" he wrote. ""I felt and looked like a total prat. For the rest of the day everyone was calling me Rambo.""

Food giants Walmart Costco and Kroger – which together totalled net sales worth more than half a trillion dollars last year – are selling Brazilian beef products imported from JBS the world’s largest meat company which has been linked to deforestation.

Brazilian beef has been identified as a key driver of deforestation in the Amazon where swathes of forest are cleared for pasture used for cattle farming. The Amazon is a crucial buffer in stabilising the regional and global climate. Experts say preserving the world’s rainforests is essential if further intensification of the climate emergency is to be averted.

Research by the Guardian the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the nonprofit data analysis agency C4ADS established that in recent years the JBS subsidiary Sampco Inc has imported thousands of tonnes of Brazilian beef destined for grocery chains and other food companies into the US.



The products include shredded and canned (corned) beef as well as frozen meat and steaks. In December Sampco-branded shredded beef produced in a JBS factory in São Paulo was being sold online by both Walmart and Costco and shipping data pinpoints JBS exports of Brazilian corned beef being supplied for sale in Kroger stores.

Between July 2017 and November 2019 Sampco imported more than 5000 consignments of Brazilian beef products totalling 7884 tonnes records obtained by C4ADS show.

Responding to these findings campaigners called on the grocery chains to take swift action to rid supply chains of deforestation-linked products.



“Supermarkets need to go beyond their sustainability rhetoric by setting strict requirements for their suppliers banning deforestation monitoring their suppliers for compliance and dropping contracts with the worst offenders like JBS” said Lucia von Reusner senior campaign director of international campaign organisation Mighty Earth.



Costco declined to answer questions but pointed to its sustainability policies which state: “Our intent is not to source beef from high-risk deforestation regions until comprehensive traceability and monitoring systems are in place.”

A Walmart spokesperson said: “Walmart takes these allegations seriously and will review the claims made. We believe healthy forests sustain biodiversity support livelihoods and play an important role in mitigating climate change. Walmart is working with suppliers on certification monitoring supporting sustainable sourcing regions promoting collaborative action and advocating for effective policy.”

A spokesperson for Kroger said: “We take deforestation seriously as demonstrated by our no-deforestation commitment and continue to engage our suppliers in pursuit of this commitment and to ensure no deforestation is happening in our relevant supply chains.”



JBS beef exports have been linked to farms involved in up to 115 sq miles (300 sq km) of deforestation a year. The company slaughters almost 35000 cattle a day in Brazil.



A JBS spokesperson said: “The spurious allegation that JBS exports are linked to deforestation is irresponsible and based on flawed superficial analysis of the correlation between the concentration of deforestation at municipality level and the location of our plants. Correlation is not causation.”

Campaigners said the latest revelations highlighted the urgent need for US laws that combat deforestation. To date there has not been any significant proposal in the US for federal legislation outlawing agricultural imports linked to tropical deforestation unlike in Britain and the EU where momentum for new rules has recently gathered pace.

“The US is complicit in driving global deforestation through its sales of beef products from Brazil” said Sarah Lake Mighty Earth’s vice-president and director for Latin America. “The Biden administration has an opportunity to advance legislation to restrict the import of products linked to deforestation just as the EU the UK and France are already doing.”

Brian Schatz Democratic senator for Hawaii said before the Covid pandemic that he planned to introduce such legislation. And last week a bill was introduced to the California state assembly that would require contractors supplying products to the state to ensure they are not linked to deforestation overseas.

Alex Wong / Getty Images News via Getty Images

Where did the name Walmart come from? Costco? Best Buy? McDonald’s? Target was given its name by a publicity director at the company which at the time was the retailer’s parent company–Dayton’s Company. The date was May 1 1962.

Dayton later Dayton-Hudson Corporation was founded in 1902 by George Draper Dayton. It was originally based in Minneapolis MN. It remained Minnesota-based for decades. Through a series of several mergers it spread its geographic footprint. By the time it merged with J.L Hudson of Detroit in 1969 it was one of the 15 largest retailers in the country.

Dayton had a problem. Its department stores were not discount stores and therefore did not draw customers based on price. The term “Target” was meant to change that. As the plan emerged to build stores with huge footprints in terms of square footage that focused on “value” Dayton’s publicity chief Stewart K. Widdess thought up the name to differentiate it from the company’s core department store locations. Over the years Target’s size and its number of stores have dwarfed its original parent.

The first Target store opened in Roseville Minnesota. The rapidly growing retailer went public on October 18 1967.

Currently Target has 1897 stores in all 50 states. (It finally added a store in Vermont in 2018). According to the National Retail Federation’s “Top 100 Retailers 2020 List” Target is the 8th largest retailer in America based on revenue of $77 billion. That puts it behind Walmart Amazon Kroger Costco Walgreen’s Home Depot and CVS.

According to Target it has 350000 employees. Seventy-five percent of the American population it claims is within 10 miles of a Target location. Target’s market capitalization is $96 billion.

Since most of the retailers larger than Target are not classic discount stores its real competitors are Costco and Walmart. Since Costco is a “paid membership” retailer Walmart is the only actual competitor. Like every retailer in the country Target faces Amazon’s online dominance.

All large retailers including Target faced revenues that were battered by the drop shopping brought on by the pandemic. Even before that Target’s growth had slowed most likely because of the move of retail consumers online. Since that movement has accelerated in the last year Target faces a challenge harder than it has in years–or perhaps since it was founded.

5ft 8in tall Frigidaire has been in service at castle for nearly all of Queen’s reign

But it seems Royal model bought by Queen Mother in 1954 is few months older

Even by the standards of the Royal Family it has been a loyal servant supporting first the Queen Mother and then Prince Charles for 67 years.

Indeed the Frigidaire fridge still going strong at the Castle of Mey in Scotland may be the oldest in the realm.

After The Mail on Sunday reported how Edmund Garrod’s fridge has served him faithfully for 56 years readers inundated us with stories of long-lasting appliances.

Mr Garrod of High Wycombe Buckinghamshire was thought to be the owner of Britain’s oldest fridge – a 1954 General Electric Company DE30 – but it appears that the Royal model is a few months older.

Loyal: Prince Charles’s Frigidaire at the Castle of Mey. It is believed the Queen Mother personally selected the fridge and approved its purchase from a supplier in nearby Wick

The 5ft 8in tall Frigidaire has been in service at the castle in Caithness for nearly all of the Queen’s reign – it was made the year after her 1953 Coronation – and it is even a feature of interest for tours.

The fridge was bought by the late Queen Mother in 1954 two years after she purchased the Castle of Mey. It is put to most use when her grandson Prince Charles visits every August.

The only known blip in its service was when modern technology was introduced at the castle. Underfloor heating installed in 2000 appeared to upset its temperature control. It was then put on blocks and has worked perfectly since.

Shirley Farquhar the castle’s managing director said the fridge was an ‘essential part of the kitchen. It was certainly built to last’.

It is believed the Queen Mother personally selected the fridge and approved its purchase from a supplier in nearby Wick despite her reputation for frugality.

The Queen Mother who died in 2002 at the age of 101 rented a TV set and video recorder for her annual stay at the remote castle which was the only home she ever owned.

She first saw what was then Barrogill Castle in 1952 while mourning the death of her husband King George VI. Falling for its ruined isolated charm and hearing it was to be abandoned she declared: ‘Never! It’s part of Scotland’s heritage. I’ll save it.’

The Mail on Sunday revealed last month how fridges washing machines and TVs will in future have to be guaranteed to last longer amid concern over environmental damage.

Plans include a legal requirement to stock spare parts for seven years after devices are sold labelling to set out an appliance’s expected lifespan and a new Union Flag kitemark to uphold a ‘world-beating standard’.

Meanwhile Mail on Sunday readers continue to send it stories of their hero appliances. Retired hairdresser Allan Newing has a Vesta hairdryer in its original packaging from the 1930s.

Mr Newing who ran a chain of salons in Kent and had finalists in the Royal Albert Hall’s annual hairdresser competitions said it was ‘still as new’.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdGVsbHltaXguY28udWsvaW0tYS1jZWxlYnJpdHktd2lubmVyLWdpb3Zhbm5hLWZsZXRjaGVyLXNwaWxscy1hbGwtYWJvdXQtY2FzdGxlLWxpZmUtYWZ0ZXItaGVyLXZpY3Rvcnkv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWxseW1peC5jby51ay9pbS1hLWNlbGVicml0eS13aW5uZXItZ2lvdmFubmEtZmxldGNoZXItc3BpbGxzLWFsbC1hYm91dC1jYXN0bGUtbGlmZS1hZnRlci1oZXItdmljdG9yeS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I’m A Celebrity winner Giovanna Fletcher spills all about castle life after her victory,"Giovanna Fletcher has spoken about her victory on I’m A Celebrity 2020.

It was author and podcaster Giovanna who won I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here in Friday night’s final.

Following her victory Giovanna spoke to Vick Hope on The Daily Drop on ITV Hub.

Speaking via video link of her win Queen Giovanna said: “No it hasn’t sunk in. I don’t think it’s going to sink in for a little while. It’s the most bizarre thing ever. We’ve been in a castle for three weeks and now there are people I’ve got a crown on my head. It doesn’t feel real at all.”

Of how her children will have reacted she said: “I can just imagine their little faces now. I imagine the older two have stayed up and watched. They’re not going to believe it.

“I can already imagine that trials are happening at home. We’re going to be taking inspiration from them and making up games. If they’ve not already. I can imagine snakes being made and all sorts.”

Asked what’s next she said: “Tomorrow back into it all with a bang. Give it a few tantrums and I’ll be wishing to be back in castle life.”

And of how she’ll celebrate she said: “Soon as I’m home I’m just going to have loads of kisses and cuddles and immerse myself back into reality. And just normality normal life. It feels weird because we don’t know what’s going on in the world.”

Speaking about her favourite parts of camp life she continued: “Everything. I think when you go into it you don’t know what it’s going to be like and what those 11 other people are going to be like and what they’re going to make of you or anything like that.

“I didn’t expect to have as much fun. It’s been a strange year for everyone and the biggest part was human connection; the hugs the chats. We got deep and serious sometimes other times it was just absolutely ridiculous and talking about body parts and ridiculous things. You just never knew what was going to come – and pub night was insane.”

Asked if she feels she’s proved mums are strong she said: “I definitely do. Without mums nothing else is possible. So I feel like I showed that mums can do anything and mostly I hope I made my kids proud. I guess I’ll find that out when I get home.”

With everyone turning to Giovanna she said of who she turned to: “I found it difficult any time home was brought into the equation. I feel like I can compartmentalise in a strange way – this is what I’m doing I’ve got to make the most of it and have fun because home will still be there when I get out and I’ll love that then – but anytime there were treats from home that was really tough not getting that.

“But every camp mate you can turn to anyone. And anyone will give you a hug or a wise and comforting word.

“Vic interestingly we’ve found that we hug in a really nice way – we hug and sway. That’s our way of hugging and reassuring each other. Just having those hugs has been amazing.”

Cummins has announced Tony Satterthwaite is being named vice chairman and Jennifer Rumsey will succeed Satterthwaite as president and chief operating officer effective March 1.

Rumsey’s promotion is particularly significant in that she is the first woman ever named president and chief operating officer for Cummins company officials said.

“Technology is evolving more rapidly now than at any other time in history and Jen’s extensive technical experience and leadership make her ideal for the role of president and chief operating officer” said Linebarger. “Jen has served in a variety of business and technical leadership positions at Cummins and has been incredibly successful in every role. She has been instrumental in developing some of the most important products and technologies Cummins has created.”

In 2016 Rumsey was named Cummins’ first female chief technical officer and was then among just a few women who had risen to the highest levels in the Cummins hierarchy. She is also homegrown talent graduating from Columbus East High School in 1992 and earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from Purdue University in 1996. She then earned a master’s degree in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1998.

She gravitated toward math and science while in school with family and teachers suggesting that she should consider engineering as a career. “My father is a mechanical engineer and I was in Columbus — so there were a lot of engineering role models around me” she said.

When she went to Purdue she wasn’t sure she would stay in a technical career — instead looking at engineering as a great education that could lead to many different professional opportunities.

“And then because I worked at Cummins as an intern when I was going to school at Purdue I actually got to see what an engineer does. And I realized it was a pretty interesting profession.”

In an interview then Rumsey said she didn’t see herself as a pioneer as far as being a woman in a high-level position for an international company because there were so many women before her that broke down a lot of the barriers she said.

“Yes I’m the first one who has risen to this position (at the time technical officer) but I did have other female role models fortunately” she said. “And so I do think that I am clearly a role model to continue to increase the number of women in engineering at Cummins and I hope even outside of Cummins.

Rumsey joined Cummins in 2000 in controls and has held a variety of leadership roles over the course of her career including roles in advanced engineering product development and quality. She has served as the vice president of engineering for the Engine Business chief technical officer for Cummins and most recently as the company’s president of the Components business.

“Jen leads with high integrity and she is a tireless advocate of Cummins’ mission and values around the world. From science technology engineering and math (STEM) advocacy to the advancement of women to strengthening emissions standards around the world Jen has dedicated her career to making a positive difference for our employees customers and the environment” said Linebarger. “I am looking forward to working with her to power a more prosperous world in the years ahead.”

Prior to joining Cummins Rumsey worked on fuel cell development with Nuvera Fuel Cells. She earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from Purdue University and a master’s in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Rumsey serves on the board of directors for Hillenbrand Inc. and is a member of the Purdue College of Engineering Advisory Council. Rumsey resides with her family in Columbus.

Rumsey will take Satterthwaite’s job as he moves to the vice chairman position.

“I am thrilled to have Tony join the chairman’s office and confident he’s the right leader for this role given the significant opportunities in front of us” said Tom Linebarger Cummins chairman and CEO. “Tony understands our business at all levels and has a truly global view having lived for extensive periods in Asia Europe and the U.S. He’s a well-respected leader strategist mentor and thinker and an asset to our company.”

Satterthwaite joined Cummins in 1988 and began in product planning and sales.

Over the course of his career he has held leadership positions across the company’s global businesses and operations including serving as president of Power Generation president of the Distribution Business and most recently as president and chief operating officer.

Prior to joining Cummins Satterthwaite was an engineer with Schlumberger. He earned a bachelor of science in civil engineering from Cornell University and an MBA from Stanford University. Satterthwaite serves in leadership positions on several public company and not-for-profit boards including IDEX Corp. the National Association of Manufacturers and the Cornell Engineering College Advisory Council.

In a conversation with ESPN Cricinfo's ‘The Cricket Monthly’ Cummins admitted that Pant has is aware of his game and his scoring areas.

“It is kind of a flip of the coin because while Pujara was there the game was not moving too quickly but you know once Rishabh walks in it is going to start moving quickly either way. It is one of those exciting times I find where you hope it works in your favour but if it does not it is going to be a bit of fun for the next hour or so either way” said Cummins.

“He is a class player he takes the game on and to the outside it might look like it is quite slapdash but he knows his game really well he knows when to attack and what his scoring areas are so before the next series we will need to spend a bit of time on that” he added.

Earlier in the third Test in Sydney Pant had played a knock of 97 runs. But once he was dismissed India decided to shut shop and as a result the match ended in a draw.

An outstanding first half saw the Sea Eagles rip the home side apart through some fine work by the forwards led by prop Noa Faatui and hooker Ollie Cummins.

Their hard work allowed the likes of exciting young five-eighth Latu Fainu and centre Josh Feledy to cause havoc out wide.

Souths opened the scoring in the sixth minute when a short kick on the last tackle was dropped in goal by Manly captain Josh Feledy for full-back Aaron Macey to score near the posts. Five-eighth Cooper McGrath converted for a 6-0 lead.

The Sea Eagles came close to scoring twice in the 11th minute but lock Mitchell Taotua and Fainu were held up over the line.

The pressure on Souths finally told when Fainu put a clever grubber kick in behind the defence for the ball to sit up perfectly for Feledy to score two minutes later. Cummins converted for a 6-all scoreline.

Two minutes later the Sea Eagles produces some razzle dazzle in the rain when Fainu offloaded to Feledy who put a kick through for the ball to again sit up perfectly for Cummins to score. Cummins converted from in front of the posts for a 12-6 lead after 18 minutes.

Manly then capitalised on a drop ball from Souths when from a scrum win Fainu and Feledy combined to send winger Calvin Lehy over in the corner. Cummins converted from the sideline for an 18-6 lead after 24 minutes.

Manly punished Souths' right edge when second-rower Drew Williams offloaded for Feledy to race away to score behind the posts. Cummins converted for a 24-6 lead with two minutes remaining before half-time.

The Sea Eagles finished off a fine first half when second-tower Dylan Coutts crashed over our wide. Cummins converted for a 30-6 lead at the break.

South Sydney took advantage of Manly being a man down with Cummins injured in back play when Moustafa Sankari dived over from dummy half on the last tackle. McGrath converted for a 30-12 scoreline after 35 minutes.

Manly centre Eli Sagla then put his light frame on the line when he absolutely smashed Sankari in a tackle that delighted those in the crowd.

The Sea Eagles then lost their way a little through some basic handling errors instead of trying to rebuild the strong platform they laid in the first half.

Manly Coach Adam McEwan would have been happy with the first half but disappointed with the lack of execution in the second half.

The Sea Eagles did play the majority of the second half without Cummins before the smart hooker returned late in the match after recovering from a knock to the groin region.

The win leaves the Sea Eagles undefeated after two rounds heading into next week’s bye.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhcmJhZG9zYWR2b2NhdGUuY29tL25ld3MvYmFyYmFkb3MtdG91cmlzbS1ib2FyZC1hbm5vdW5jZXMtbmV3LWNoYWlybWFu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Barbados Tourism Board announces new chairman | Barbados Advocate,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhcmJhZG9zYWR2b2NhdGUuY29tL25ld3MvYmFyYmFkb3MtdG91cmlzbS1ib2FyZC1hbm5vdW5jZXMtbmV3LWNoYWlybWFu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyb2FyLmNvbS5hdS9jcmlja2V0L3ZpZGVvL2ZhcmNpY2FsLXNjZW5lcy1hcy1tYXNzaXZlLXRoaXJkLXVtcGlyZS1icmFpbi1mYWRlLXJvYnMtZW5nbGFuZC1vZi1hLXdpY2tldC0xMTE0MzY4Lz9jb21tZW50X2lkPTc3NTMwNjjSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcm9hci5jb20uYXUvY3JpY2tldC92aWRlby9mYXJjaWNhbC1zY2VuZXMtYXMtbWFzc2l2ZS10aGlyZC11bXBpcmUtYnJhaW4tZmFkZS1yb2JzLWVuZ2xhbmQtb2YtYS13aWNrZXQtMTExNDM2OC9hbXAvP2NvbW1lbnRfaWQ9Nzc1MzA2OA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Farcical scenes as massive third umpire brain fade robs England of a wicket,Build your own fantasy cricket team and put it to the test with Draftstars daily fantasy competitions.

Dr. Virginia Banks an infectious disease specialist is part of a group of Black physicians and scientists who are focused on ways to solve health-care disparities. Dr. Virginia Banks

Dr. Virginia Banks says if the U.S. really wants to bring the pandemic to an end it's going to take mobile vans of vaccines in neighborhoods where people don't have transportation — and even giving shots at hair salons and barber shops. As thousands of pharmacies get shipments of doses and start vaccinations at their stores this week the country is taking a significant step toward reaching more Americans. Public health officials and advocates however say that won't go far enough in communities where people have been the sickest. More Black and Hispanic Americans have been hospitalized and died from Covid-19. They often face bigger barriers to get vaccine too: A lack of transportation. A juggle of multiple jobs. Hesitance because of past mistreatment by the medical community. CVS Health and Walgreens will play a bigger role in the effort as a federal program ships doses to more of their stores and those of other retail pharmacies. The expansion represents a business opportunity for the nation's two largest pharmacy chains as they get paid for each vaccine and draw more foot traffic to stores. The vaccine rollout will also test the companies' commitment to expanding health-care access in Black and Hispanic communities. Banks an infectious disease doctor in Ohio is part of an interest group of the Infectious Diseases Society of America that's made up of Black physicians scientists and public health officials focused on addressing health-care disparities. She said health-care providers will have to get creative and show commitment. She said they should set up clinics in familiar places such as churches and enlist ""trusted messengers"" like pastors and community leaders. ""You've got to look at from a cultural standpoint 'Where are we?' and come to us"" she said.

More than fairness

The vaccine's rollout in the U.S. has been slow and complex. Demand for doses has far outweighed the number of shots available to jab into arms. Online appointment systems have been tricky to navigate and bogged down by heavy traffic. Only two vaccines have emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration so far and they must stored at cold and ultra-cold temperatures. And only some Americans qualify for the shot with each state having slightly different criteria to weigh factors like a person's age medical conditions or job. About 48.4 million vaccines have been administered in the U.S. as of Friday according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 12.1 million people have received both doses of the vaccine — just a small fraction of the 331 million people who live in the U.S. The country's goal is to vaccinate between 70% and 85% of the U.S. population — or roughly 232 million to 281 million people — to achieve herd immunity according to Dr. Anthony Fauci the president's chief medical advisor.

The messy rollout has led to some getting shots and not others. Most of the nearly 13 million people given at least one shot of a Covid-19 vaccine within the first month of the drugs' distribution were women age 50 or older and likely non-Hispanic and White according to a CDC study.

For vaccine distribution equity is not only a matter of fairness. It's also a crucial way to slow the spread in communities where Covid-19 cases hospitalizations and deaths are higher. Black and Hispanic Americans are 3.7 times and 4.1 times more likely be hospitalized from Covid than White Americans according to data reported by the CDC in late November. Both of the minority groups are 2.8 times more likely than White Americans to die from the disease. In a hard-hit neighborhood each shot's impact can be even greater — reaching people who are more at risk as they work in grocery stores or at other frontline jobs or live in a dense apartment or multigenerational households.

Vaccine hesitance is higher among Black and Brown people too stemming from the medical community's history of mistreating minority groups and opening fewer health-care practices in their neighborhoods. A poll of New York residents conducted by the Association for a Better New York found that 78% of White residents would take the vaccine as soon as they could compared with 39% of Black residents 54% of Hispanics and 54% of Asians.

'Put their money where their mouth is'

For providers like CVS and Walgreens having more doses of the vaccine is a business opportunity. They will get paid for each vaccine and the government will pick up the cost if a person does not have health insurance. Jefferies estimated that each shot will have a $13 to $15 gross margin and could yield about $1 billion in incremental gross profits for CVS over the next year. Both drugstore chains have pinned their strategy on adding more health-care services from primary care clinics to diabetes screenings. They have also stepped up commitments to address racial inequities in response to George Floyd's killing and nationwide protests. CVS plans to invest nearly $600 million over five years to support public policy initiatives and internal efforts such as mentoring Black employees and offering free health screenings for blood pressure and cholesterol at stores.

Walgreens started a pilot project in the Chicago area that aims to reduce hospitalization rates by making it easier for patients to take their medications get free deliveries of prescriptions and have more regular contact with health-care professionals about their medical conditions. It recently hired former Starbucks Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer as its next CEO. When she steps into the role in mid-March she will be only Black woman leading a Fortune 500 company. Karyne Jones CEO of the Washington D.C.-based National Caucus and Center on Black Aging said expanding vaccines to hard-hit communities is a way for CVS and Walgreens to ""put their money where their mouth is."" Her organization is a founding member of the Covid-19 Vaccine Education and Equity Project a coalition of nonprofits and trade groups that's backed by vaccine-maker Pfizer . Jones said she would like to see CVS and Walgreens open 24-hour vaccination sites and set up tents in neighborhoods where people don't have transportation. ""If you really want to show good corporate responsibility this is the time to say we have got to put resources toward alleviating this pandemic"" she said.

We have pharmacy deserts. We have grocery store deserts. We don't have church deserts. Dr. Virginia Banks Infectious disease specialist

Banks the infectious disease doctor said it will take outside-of-the-box strategies such as rerouting bus routes to go by vaccine clinics. She pointed to an effort where pharmacists paired up with barber shops to detect high blood pressure when Black men went for a haircut — a clinical study that helped detect the condition and intervene earlier. She said she's hopeful that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — which requires just one dose and can be transported more easily — could be a game changer for distribution and make it easier to give shots where people are. The company requested emergency use authorization from the FDA last week. ""We have pharmacy deserts"" she said. ""We have grocery store deserts. We don't have church deserts.""

Doses in more neighborhoods

Walgreens and CVS have given Covid vaccines at thousands of nursing homes and assisted living facilities. They have administered shots at some stores after getting vaccine doses from states. With the federal program they will offer shots in more neighborhoods. Walgreens has Covid vaccines at stores in 15 states and two additional jurisdictions New York City and Chicago. It will provide shots in 1800 stores as part of the federal program — or roughly 20% of its U.S. stores a company spokeswoman said. CVS has them in 18 states and Puerto Rico. As of Friday about 420 of its approximately 9900 stores will give the shots with doses from either a state or the federal program a company spokesman said. Both pharmacy chains said they have chosen stores in neighborhoods with greater need. About half of each companies' stores with Covid vaccines are located in medically underserved areas or places that rank high on the CDC's social vulnerability index which is based on factors like the prevalence of poverty lack of vehicle access and crowded housing.

Walgreens will also allow people to schedule appointments in person or by phone so people are not excluded if they don't have internet or a computer said Rina Shah Walgreens group vice president of pharmacy operations. CVS has a 1-800 number as its alternative to booking online. Walgreens struck a partnership with Uber to provide free rides to vaccine appointments to people who live in underserved parts of major cities such as Atlanta and Chicago. Charitable partners will help identify people who need transportation. CVS is taking proactive steps to make sure locals can get vaccine appointments at their nearby store said Chris Cox the company's senior vice president of pharmacy. He said staff are calling some customers to schedule their appointments particularly those who are lower income and older. Along with enlisting pharmacies the Biden administration will ship doses to community health centers next week that serve millions of Americans who live below the poverty line and are racial minorities. The vaccination program allows CVS to powerfully demonstrate how it can provide health care in places where it typically is not accessible Cox said. ""Everything we do is really with the intent of helping people on their path to better health"" he said. ""What this opportunity really gives us is to demonstrate to our patients and to other stakeholders what we've been saying for several years which is that community pharmacy has a big role to play in health care."" Many patients see their pharmacists more often than their doctors since they need to pick up high blood pressure pills or other maintenance prescriptions he said. Those frequent interactions mean that CVS can play a larger role in making sure people take their medications properly or can intervene before potential complications. As Walgreens gets more supply Shah said it will expand its hours and offer shots on weekends for people who can't skip a day of work. It will open clinics at community centers like it does for flu shots. Shah said its pharmacists can play a key role as they educate and answer questions so people are eager for the shots rather than apprehensive. But she said the company ultimately needs more supply to reach more people in minority communities. ""Our biggest opportunity is getting more vaccine"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbG9jYWxwcm92LmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvaW4tY2FzZS15b3UtbWlzc2VkLWl0LXJpcy1jdnMtcmVzcG9uZHMtdG8tc25sLXBhcm9keS1za2V0Y2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Valentine’s Day Redux: Saturday Night Live’s CVS Parody,"Valentine’s Day Redux: Saturday Night Live’s CVS Parody

Pharmacies may offer more familiarity and proximity for people than other vaccination sites.

Pharmacies will follow local regulations for vaccine priority. If you are eligible check the pharmacy's website for updated information on exactly where you need to go and what you need to have with you.

More people will soon be getting their COVID-19 vaccines at places like Walmart Costco and CVS. The federal government will begin to ship doses directly to retail pharmacies on February 11.

The distribution plan is part of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination which connects both national pharmacy chains and independent pharmacies with states and territories to boost vaccination efforts across the country. The program will start with a small number of retail pharmacies and ramp up to about half the pharmacies in the U.S.

A limited number of community pharmacies have already been administering vaccinations as part of state-allocated doses.

The first shipment will include a million vaccine doses to about 6500 pharmacies around the country according to Jeffrey Zients the White House COVID-19 coordinator who announced the program during a White House briefing for reporters last week. The numbers of doses and pharmacies will increase over time.

“Pharmacies are readily accessible in most communities with most Americans living within five miles of a pharmacy…it’s an important component to delivering vaccines equitably” Zients said. “Sites are selected based on their ability to reach some of the populations most at risk for severe illness from COVID-19 including socially vulnerable communities.”

While neighborhood pharmacies will make the COVID-19 vaccine seem much more within reach for millions of people anxiously waiting experts warn there may be some frustration. “Navigate it with patience” Keri Hurley-Kim PharmD an assistant clinical professor at the University of California Irvine School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences tells Verywell. “People should understand that pharmacies will be held to vaccinating the same groups as outlined in state and county tiers. Do not expect to be able to skip the line.”

Challenges Are Expected

There are about 90000 retail pharmacies in the U.S. and fewer than half will be receiving doses according to Zients.

Appointments must be made—at least for now—through a chain’s website or customer service phone number not on-site.

Pharmacies are anxious about managing expectations. Chris Krese the spokesman for the National Association of Chain Drug Stores tells Verywell that pharmacies are excited to be a big part of the vaccination effort in communities but also worry about a potential limiting factor: enough vaccines.

""We can meet the challenge so long as we have doses to put into arms"" Krese says.

What This Means For You If you’re eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine and are planning to get vaccinated at your local pharmacy it’s critical to pay attention to the information that pharmacy provides. Retailers are already posting frequent updates. For example in a February 2 press release CVS announced the program would start on February 11 but in a subsequent release the date had been moved to February 12.

Each Pharmacy’s Approach Will Be Slightly Different

According to Ilisa Bernstein Senior Vice President of Pharmacy Practice and Government Affairs for the American Pharmacists Association in Washington DC pharmacies are setting up their vaccination stations in different ways both indoors and outdoors leveraging their experience from giving flu shots and other vaccines.

""Just like the state and local programs [that began earlier] pharmacies are using different systems for scheduling and some are easier to navigate than others” Bernstein tells Verywell. “Pharmacies are getting short lead times [on vaccine deliveries] so patients should keep checking for appointments.”

Check the pharmacy's website to see if you can fill out paperwork ahead of time and what form of ID to bring with you.

Sending vaccines to pharmacies is just one piece of the strategy the White House is rolling out to get people in the U.S. vaccinated. During a White House briefing on Tuesday Zients announced that beginning next week the federal government will also start sending vaccine doses directly to community health centers which provide primary care services in underserved areas reaching almost 30 million people.

The White House is expected to roll out other types of vaccination venues such as pop-up and mobile clinics.

“We’ve got to try everything” Leana Wen MD an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University tells Verywell. “Accessibility isn’t the same for everyone and we’ve got to move forward with approaches in order to get as many people vaccinated as we can.”

Healthcare organizations have to contend with the coronavirus pandemic and its lingering impacts and shifting consumer demands for fast and convenient services. Healthcare players are being forced to move on their digital transformation efforts and Alphabet Amazon Apple and Microsoft are lending their tech-savviness to become partners for the job.

The Big Four tech companies are accelerating their pursuit of the healthcare market. Insider Intelligence

The Big Four tech companies — Alphabet Amazon Apple and Microsoft — are accelerating their pursuit of the healthcare market and they're starting to hone their strategies in on specific corners of the ecosystem. Below we break down how these players are ramping up their efforts to reshape healthcare by developing and collaborating on new tools that could be a boon to consumers medical professionals and insurers.

Amazon Healthcare

Amazon has been aggressively infiltrating as many healthcare sectors as possible over the last few years. It's relying on its cloud arm Amazon Web Services (AWS) and voice tech expertise to get through hospital doors and it's using acquisitions and large-scale partnerships to launch new healthcare projects.

Team collaboration on Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare. Microsoft

Microsoft is facing off against Alphabet and Amazon in the race to control the healthcare cloud market. Microsoft is largely staying out of the consumer-facing realm with its health play—zeroing in on Azure and enabling providers and payers to target specific pockets of populations for better health outcomes and helping to optimize data storage.

How Microsoft is changing healthcare

Microsoft's health play hinges on its cloud platform Azure and the data analytics prowess it can provide healthcare firms. These efforts stem mainly from its Healthcare NExT program which aids in providing the company with a focused brand as it explores how its tech can be used within the healthcare setting.

Future of tech in healthcare

Alphabet Amazon Apple and Microsoft have been dipping their toes into the healthcare industry and some of their endeavors have the potential to change healthcare at large.

As the Big Four move steadily onward into healthcare it's necessary for legacy players (hospitals insurers pharma companies health IT firms) to know exactly what their strategies look like and what they stand to lose and gain.

Here are some key takeaways from the report:

Alphabet Amazon Apple and Microsoft are gunning to carve out spaces within the healthcare market and each is targetting its own set of sectors to transform or disrupt.

Microsoft is focused on its race with Amazon and Google to lay claim to the healthcare cloud market Apple is knuckling down on clinical research initiatives via its wearables Alphabet is focusing on its AI expertise to drive precision medicine and Amazon is shaping up to disrupt the pharmacy virtual care and telehealth realms.

Their moves into healthcare are providing health systems with tech needed to patch up interoperability and data sharing gaps giving healthcare payers a chance to collect a more comprehensive set of health data for members and granting pharma companies the ability to streamline drug development and manufacturing.

But tech giants' forward march into healthcare is in some cases troubling incumbents. Amazon's prescription delivery play has traditional pharmacies looking for ways to retain their customer bases for instance and Alphabet is building an ecosystem that we think could put it at odds with top dogs in the EHR industry.

And their inroads into the healthcare space may be stymied by consumers' meager trust in tech companies handling their health information as well as a rampant cybersecurity crisis that could have healthcare firms holding off on tech investments.

“We are one of the largest in vitro diagnostics companies in the world” President Julie Sawyer-Montgomery told the Business Journal.

“When anything comes up in the world that has a diagnostic need we naturally feel responsible to act and that was certainly the case with the pandemic.”

Beckman the Brea-based independent operating company of Washington D.C.-based Danaher Corp. has an installed base of 100000 analyzers around the world and estimates about half a billion tests are performed on its equipment every week.

Beckman one of Orange County’s largest medical companies in March sent its local workforce of about 850 employees to work from home. Collaboration never stopped among its 11000 associates worldwide Sawyer-Montgomery said.

It received emergency use authorization for its first COVID antibody test in June and launched a COVID antigen test with the aim to increase daily testing capacity in the U.S. by 40% in December.

With the emergence of new COVID variants and the rollout of vaccines testing remains a central component of defeating the coronavirus Sawyer-Montgomery said.

“We need to move from what is largely happening now—symptomatic testing—to a more serial population-based testing of employers K-12 universities and such to better control the virus” she said.

“We believe our antigen test is the key to mass-scale testing.”

Barriers Addressed

Beckman’s latest product a COVID antigen test that goes to laboratories for just $4 apiece was designed to address several testing barriers Sawyer-Montgomery said.

The U.S. performs about 2 million COVID diagnostic tests per day which is about 10-50% of those recommended by experts according to Beckman.

PCR and antigen tests detect genetic material or molecules that imply active viral infection. Antibody tests by comparison detect the presence of antibodies as a result of prior infection.

PCR tests considered the “gold standard” of diagnostics because of their high sensitivity have several disadvantages when it comes to mass testing. Tests are more expensive and sent out to centralized testing labs resulting in 24- to 48-hour turnaround times according to Sawyer-Montgomery.

By contrast antigen tests are affordable; automated and can produce results in as little as 30 minutes she said.

“Beckman Coulter can make 25 million antigen tests a month and essentially increase the number of reported tests in the nation by 40%” Sawyer-Montgomery said.

“And we can do it at a very affordable price—just $4 per antigen test at a workflow that is highly scalable.”

Beckman’s antigen assay has proven 93% positive percent agreement within seven days of symptom onset and 100% negative percent agreement.

Incoming President

Sawyer-Montgomery was named president of Beckman last January.

She previously led Beckman’s $2 billion developed markets business across North America Europe and Latin America as well as global marketing research and development for the firm.

Prior to joining Beckman the Harvard Business School alumna—who also has a master of music degree in viola performance—held marketing and business development positions at Hospira Infusion Systems (now part of ICU Medical) and Boston Scientific.

Sawyer-Montgomery last January traveled to China for business and on her way home via a connection in Portugal received a call from her China general manager who described the outbreak of an unknown virus as “different” and “unusual.”

“Being part of a global company helped us understand some of the implications a bit earlier because [COVID] wasn’t part of the national dialogue yet” Sawyer-Montgomery said.

“That got us clued into following the scientific dialogue closely and beginning those early discussions for where our technology could plug in.”

Expedited Process

When Beckman sent its employees to work from home “like many companies we held our breath to see how that would work” Sawyer-Montgomery said.

“It was an experiment we’d never tried before but our team members showed amazing resilience in adapting very quickly and I’d say we didn’t miss a beat.”

Associates set up from home and became extremely familiar with Microsoft Teams. Leadership instituted daily management calls to set and stretch goals and move to meet them quickly.

Beckman developed its first COVID antibody test which measures IgG antibodies in just seven weeks and received emergency use authorization for the product in June.

These types of products generally take 15 months to three years to get to market Sawyer-Montgomery said.

“The level of passion problem solving and global collaboration between our research and development teams and operations associates to innovate new assays and bring them to market in such record time made me very proud” she said.

Associates were encouraged to develop multiple prototypes at once rather than working on one prototype at a time.

“That way of thinking made our teams more agile and nimble through this process. That’s also a really fun way of working and we want to apply that way of working to everything that we do.”

Essential Work

Diagnostics has always been critical to the healthcare system; tests inform 70% of medical decisions. That fact has become more apparent amid the pandemic Sawyer-Montgomery said.

“I still get chills when I think about those early early days—seeing the pictures of our China team followed by our Italian team—our people suiting up and going into labs to install or fix equipment to keep hospitals running” she said.

“Our associates understand how critical what we do is to the functioning of the healthcare system. Without our equipment emergency rooms shut down. You can’t do the diagnostics you need. Seeing our people gown up mask up and going into hospitals when we didn’t understand the disease was very powerful.”

Beckman has seen its engagement levels among associates rise throughout the last year in part because of their role in tackling the pandemic she added.

“Our associates are essential workers. It feels good to be essential to something so critical” she said.

Sawyer-Montgomery said she also believes the pandemic will have a long-term impact on the diagnostics industry.

“When your industry is on the front-page of a newspaper every day I think it makes people understand how critical laboratory medicine really is. As a result I think we’ll continue to see increased investment in diagnostic laboratories.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

A vision of growth materialized in November as Manson reopened its only grocery store bringing life back to Calhoun County as it emerged from the grips of a growing food desert in rural Iowa. The opening was a capstone to many new developments in town over the year.

Nearly a year after the small Heartland Market chain closed locations in Manson and Rockwell City Manson Hometown Grocery bounced back with a nonprofit model to try its luck in the town of 2000. So far the signs are promising.

“There’s been a lot of people who it took them a bit” said Manson Mayor Dave Anderson reflecting on concerns about changed shopping habits as Manson shoppers adjusted to getting their groceries in Fort Dodge temporarily. “A lot of (residents) work in Fort Dodge. It’s all about habits. But we have a nice clean store it’s well stocked. People are coming around.”

Compared to pricing at local competitors he said Manson Hometown Grocery is right on par or cheaper.

As the store moved away from prepackaged meats it also started to reap one of the benefits of the nonprofit model: cheaper prices.

One benefit of the model is that as long as customers continue to shop there and keep revenue up the store can lower prices.

“(Being nonprofit) is the biggest advantage we have” Anderson said. “The wholesalers have taken all the money out of it. It’s a tough business. The margins are so thin.”

Though Manson didn’t quite reach its initial $200000 fundraising goal the more than $180000 it did raise was sufficient to bring the vision to life: a model built by the community for the community with some old-fashioned elbow grease from volunteers. The nonprofit model the first of its kind in at least Calhoun and Webster counties was custom developed by Drake University Law School students in Des Moines.

“Knowing that the community got together to do this we want to make sure we’re behind the community making this work and doing what we have to do to keep the doors open” said co-manager Jessica Teague at the store’s opening. “We’re all about community here.”

With former experience at nearly every other relevant retail chain in the area — Walmart Target Casey’s General Store and Dollar General — she believed the new team of nine employees and the grocery store’s volunteer board of directors had the knowledge they needed to make the effort a success even up against formidable chains like Dollar General that Nick Graham the owner of Manson’s last store blamed for much of its demise.

Now the store is more than a place to shop it’s a block of stability that is already paying dividends.

And groceries are great but Manson has a whole lot more going on.

State of the Art custom signs and decor opened on Main Street in 2020. Debbie’s Cafe and Main Line Boutique are opening early this year Divine 0 Nine Salon became S & J Salon and the old Foley Building at 1012 Main St. was stabilized for resale thanks to a Derelict Building grant.

After gaining ownership of the Foley Building the city of Manson received $35000 in a matching Derelict Building grant. With $70000 the city put a new roof on the iconic downtown front many generations grew up shopping in stabilized a beam in the building and had asbestos removed.

“Now we have a stabilized building we can sell to a business that would be vital and complement our community” said Thelma McGough director of Manson Economic Development. “We didn’t want to have a building fall in or be bought for cheap and not taken care of.”

KC Nielsen Ltd. a John Deere dealership reopened after a devastating fire destroyed its building Star Energy transitioned ownership to Growmark and four new homes were built.

The list could go on for a while on the big changes happening in a small town.

“I’ve always admired Manson for what they had going on” said Anderson reflecting on the environment that has cultivated success. “We’re so close to Fort Dodge. A lot of our population works in Fort Dodge but yet they want everything in town all the amenities.”

To him the success in challenging times says there are a lot of folks who think outside of the box.

“For the grocery store we put together a board of individuals and in all honesty I never would’ve guessed those people in one group could do it — they did awesome” he said. “As far as local businesses they have fairly strong followings.”

During the height of pandemic restrictions consumers stepped up to support those in need through things like curbside service.

“Manson’s very good at supporting its own” Anderson said.

“The community is very positive. The success of the fundraising for the grocery store really brought the community together” McGough said. “The ones opening new businesses are people that are raising families in Manson or who have (before). They believe in community. That’s where they want to stay and want to grow.”

She said the completion of the city’s Main Street Streetscape project in 2019 preceded business success in 2020 by showing Manson that the city was committed to community betterment. A newly constructed Main Street and infrastructure investment in turn may have proved that a new updated look makes for an attractive business environment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcGVycnluZXdzLmNvbS9kZXMtbW9pbmVzLXBhaXItYXJyZXN0ZWQtZm9yLWRlY2VtYmVyLXRoZWZ0cy1pbi1wZXJyeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Des Moines pair arrested for December thefts in Perry,"A Des Moines man and woman face theft charges in Dallas County after allegedly stealing a utility task vehicle from Van Wall Equipment near Perry in December but abandoning the UTV when it ran out of gas before they got it home.

Justin Roy Gerlach 40 of 5225 Merced St. Des Moines was arrested Friday on warrants for violation of probation and for first-degree theft second-degree criminal mischief and two counts of trespassing-injury or damage greater than $300.

Amanda Lee Gerlach 31 of 5225 Merced St. Des Moines was arrested Jan. 29 on a warrant for first-degree theft second-degree criminal mischief and two counts of trespassing-injury or damage greater than $300.

Justin Gerlach could be called the 12/12 thief. When he was arrested as a suspect in the Dec. 12 2020 theft he was on probation for a conviction for third-degree burglary in connection with a Dec. 12 2019 incident in which he stole four television sets from the community room of the Strathmore Apartments in West Des Moines.

Shortly after midnight Dec. 12 day the Gerlachs allegedly “did go onto the property at 1223 Willis Ave. and attempt to steal a gas station globe and a wall sign” according to court records. Their afternoon theft at the Perry Oi Co. was “unsuccessful” but they “did admit to attempting to steal the items.”

The Van Wall incident began about 1:30 a.m. on the same day Dec. 12 2020 when the Gerlachs allegedly entered the property at 22728 141st Dr. near Perry and made off with “a John Deere Gator” valued at $27080.45 according to court records.

The Gerlachs “did admit they took the Gator and planned on keeping it but it had run out of gas” and so the Gator was “abandoned in rural Dallas County” where it was later recovered and returned to its owner according to court records.

In the course of the alleged theft the Gerlachs also allegedly “caused damage to a skidloader a UTV and two snowmobiles” with repair costs “estimated at $5138.66” according to court records.

An arrest warrant for Justin Gerlach was ordered in Dallas County District Court Jan. 17 and served Feb. 12. He is currently held in the Dallas County Jail on a $20000 cash-only bond. He is scheduled for a hearing Feb. 19 in Dallas County District Court.

Justin Gerlach was convicted of first-degree theft and two counts of third-degree burglary in 2020 in Polk County District Court. He was convicted of third-degree burglary in 2020 in Dallas County District Court. He was convicted of attempted third-degree burglary in 2019 in Dallas County District Court. He was convicted of third-degree burglary in 2013 in Polk County District Court. He was convicted of second-degree theft and ongoing criminal activity in 2013 in Polk County District Court. He was convicted of fourth-degree burglary in 2012 in Polk County District Court.

An arrest warrant for Amanda Gerlach was ordered in Dallas County District Court Jan. 17 and served Jan. 29. She was held in the Dallas County Jail before posting a $15000 cash or surety bond. She is scheduled for a hearing Feb. 15 in Dallas County District Court.

Amanda Gerlach was convicted of fourth-degree theft in 2013 in Polk County District Court. She was convicted of trespassing in 2015 in Polk County District Court. She was convicted of fifth-degree theft in 2014 in Polk County District Court.

On Friday morning Delta officially created ""a new Spirit"" to celebrate its employees paying homage to the airline's first Boeing 767 named The Spirit of Delta.

Ship 3502 an Airbus A350 — one of the airline's new flagship aircraft — is now called the Delta Spirit and is being dedicated to Delta employees around the world who demonstrated ""continued resilience and indomitable spirit during the coronavirus pandemic.""

The idea to rededicate The Spirit of Delta originated in November with Joe McDermott the managing director of people development and culture in technical operations.

""It's about resetting as an airline — reflecting where we were and what we're going to be as we move forward"" McDermott said in a statement. ""This recognizes the work everyone has put in to guide this airline to successfully emerge stronger and better than before.""

This tribute is an exciting new chapter in The Spirit of Delta mythos which originated in 1982 — a turbulent time of deregulation surging fuel prices and a weak economy according to the Delta Museum.

That's when current and former Delta employees and friends of the airline banded together to raise $30 million to purchase the airline's first Boeing 767. Ship 102 was christened The Spirit of Delta on Dec. 15 1982 nearly four decades ago.

The original Spirit of Delta was retired exactly 15 years ago on Feb. 12 2006 following a 12-stop farewell tour. The iconic aircraft now resides at the Delta Museum in Historic Hangar 2.

Two years later Delta took delivery of its first Boeing 777-200LR jet Ship 7101 which was named the Delta Spirit in a nod to the airline's employees and accomplishments. Delta retired its final Boeing 777 in November an early demise triggered by the onset of the pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzE0L2RlbHRhLWRlbGF5cy1maXJzdC1hMzIxbmVvLWFzLWJhbWJvby1haXJ3YXlzLXBpY2tzLXVwLWl0cy1maXJzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Delays First A321neo As Bamboo Airways Picks Up Its First,"[ Aircraft Orders and Deliveries ] By Arturo Higueras

The global COVID-19 pandemic has forced many airlines to adapt their fleets and networks and to reschedule hundreds of deliveries scheduled not just in 2020 and 2021 but also those in years ahead as airlines look to rework their balance sheets to better prepare themselves for the long run back to profitability. With a decrease in worldwide passenger demand of more than 50% the last thing most carriers want at the moment is having more new aircraft parked preventing them from turning their owners a profit.

In that vein Delta Air Lines has announced it will delay the delivery of its first Airbus A321neo to 2022. The new model was originally expected to be delivered in 2020 but the current situation has forced the American carrier to delay even more of its plans both in terms of fleet restructuring and network growth.

Delta has an order of 100 A321neos slated to be delivered in the next three years. However the carrier is negotiating with the European manufacturer to adapt the delivery schedule. According to the initial agreement Airbus would deliver 18 aircraft in 2021 another 20 in 2022 and the remaining 68 by 2023.

With the delay of one year the airline expects to receive the new aircraft when the market starts to recover. Delta intends to finish all of its Airbus A321ceo — short for current engine option — deliveries by this year the model of which the carrier is the largest operator in the world. Compared to its predecessor the A321neo boasts a 16% cut in fuel consumption up to 75% reduction of noise and 50% lower emissions.

Over the course of this year Delta expects to receive 33 new aircraft: three Airbus A220-100s five A220-300s 22 A321-200s and three Airbus A330-900neos. Those wide-body aircraft are a crucial piece of Delta’s plan to replace its Boeing 767-300ERs which according to planespotters.net are an average of over 22-years-old.

The Atlanta-based airline however does not expect to receive any Airbus A350s this year and will wait until 2022 for the next two additions to the airline’s newest widebody fleet. In January Delta received two Airbus A220s and four A321ceos setting it up as the carrier that received the most aircraft from Airbus that month.

Bamboo Airways First A321neo of 2021

Despite Delta pushing back its A321neo deliveries this week the A321 continues to serve as a bastion of Airbus’s narrowbody portfolio for carriers worldwide. On Feb. 7 Vietnamese low-cost carrier Bamboo Airways added its first unit of 2021 as VN-A222 was delivered from Hamburg Germany to Hanoi Vietnam’s Noi Bai International Airport and began operating the next day. Since then it has been connecting Hanoi with different airports in China as the celebration of the Chinese Lunar New Year continues to strengthen both China’s domestic market and nearly all international routes to and from the country.

With this new aircraft Bamboo Airways is pushing forward with its objective of taking delivery of 30 Airbus A321neos by 2025 as part of its expansion plan to 100 aircraft by that year. The aircraft officially labeled as an A321neo ACF — Air Cabin Flex — includes two business classes plus economy class while its capacity is reduced from the original 244 seats to 223 seats.

This is the second aircraft that Bamboo has received this year after the delivery of an Embraer E190-100LR from aircraft leasing company CDB Aviation.

“As Bamboo Airways eyes further roadmap development anchored in the carrier’s strategy to have a route network connecting all regions of Vietnam we look forward to supporting their efforts to meet the increasing demand from the country’s burgeoning tourism industry” commented Sign Kadouh CDB Aviation’s Head of Asia Pacific in a statement.

What is about the White House if anything that keeps Bastian away?

Delta CEO Ed Bastian Skips Another White House Meeting

Yesterday airline officials from all major U.S. airlines joined a video conference with the White House to discuss domestic flight testing. All airlines were present…except Delta.

During the Trump Administration Bastian skipped two airline summits at the White House. Even though these summits were on issues of direct importance to the Delta CEO he was unable to attend either meeting. Once he claimed it was due to a pre-planned family vacation that could not be modified. The second time it was due to the death of his mother.

A family vacation and a funeral are not just good but excellent reasons to skip meetings. It is not clear why he skipped the White House meeting this week which did not even require his in-person attendance because it was held via video conference.

It makes me wonder whether Delta feels face time with those in power is actually counterproductive. The notion of “out of sight out of mind” comes to mind though Delta certainly was not shy about approaching lawmakers and federal officials about the need for further bailouts (even though Delta did not even furlough any flight attendants).

My own life experience has taught me that work is primarily accomplished based upon the relationships you have. I would think that whatever his politics cultivating a relationship with White House leaders of both parties could pay dividends later. You take the meetings you can get.

CONCLUSION

Perhaps I underestimate the power of Bastian. Maybe he can pick up the phone and secure an audience with the White House at a moment’s notice. But I still find it curious that Bastian seems to put a low priority on White House meetings especially in an age in which Executive Orders are becoming so much more prevalent.

But chances are you never thought working on a math problem or bringing a birthday cake on board could result in you getting the boot. The reality is that there's plenty of gray area in an airline's contract of carriage including the right for a flight crew to kick you off the plane if they find you to be ""uncooperative"" or a threat to the ""safety of other passengers or the crew."" These broad definitions have led to some truly bizarre (and often unreasonable) instances of people getting kicked off planes.

If you have an upcoming flight that you really can't miss (or simply want to be entertained by some real-life in-flight horror stories) it might pay to read up on some of the truly unusual reasons people have gotten kicked off planes.

Smelling Bad

All three major U.S. airlines — American United and Delta — note in their contract of carriage that people who have an offensive odor can be asked to get off a flight. According to Delta you may be kicked off a plane if your ""hygiene or odor creates an unreasonable risk of offense or annoyance to other passengers."" As you'd imagine what constitutes a scent that is offensive or annoying to other passengers isn't easily determined.

Weighing Too Much

A man on a 2016 United Airlines flight from Las Vegas to New Jersey was kicked off the plane because of his weight. The passenger Errol Narvaez was assigned a new seat after boarding even though he paid for a preboard ticket. Then Narvaez's new seatmate said something to a flight attendant resulting in the flight supervisor asking Narvaez to get off the aircraft. A spokesperson for United Airlines told HuffPost that they have a right to remove people who can't safely fit in their seat adding that Narvaez was removed ""for the safety and comfort"" of other people on the flight.

Kissing Your Girlfriend

The L Word actress Leisha Hailey and her girlfriend were kicked off a Southwest Airlines flight in 2011 for kissing. According to the actress and her girlfriend who released a statement through their band Uh Huh Her ""It was one modest kiss."" In response Southwest released a statement saying ""Initial reports indicate that we received several passenger complaints characterizing the behavior as excessive. Our crew responsible for the comfort of all customers on board approached the passengers based solely on behavior and not gender. The conversation escalated to a level that was better resolved on the ground as opposed to in flight.""

Bringing a Birthday Cake On Board

A family flying from New York to Las Vegas for a birthday celebration brought along a birthday cake — not knowing that it would lead to their expulsion from a JetBlue flight. When a flight attendant asked that they move the cake out of the overhead compartment and set it under the seat in front of them the family complied but then a second flight attendant intervened confronting the first attendant.

The JetBlue customer Cameron Burke told ABC7 News after the 2017 event that ""She was pointing to her 'Did you tell him he couldn't put anything in the overhead compartment?' I had approached them and I said everything was fine and she said 'Sir this does not involve you.' When she told me I had been noncompliant then I said 'Ma'am had you been drinking?' Because her behavior was not normal.""

Eventually the Port Authority Police Department was called the entire aircraft deplaned and the Burke family was not permitted to fly.

Wearing Sagging Pants

Wearing sagging pants may sound like an absurd reason to get booted off a flight but it was a reality for Billie Joe Armstrong guitarist for the punk band Green Day. On a 2011 Southwest flight from Oakland to Burbank California a flight attendant asked Armstrong to pull up his pants. He responded by saying that she should worry about more important things. In response Armstrong was kicked off the flight.

Earlier that same year college football player Deshon Marman was removed from a U.S. Airways flight for refusing to pull up his pajama bottoms.

Having a Bathroom Emergency

A man on a Delta Air Lines flight was forced to get off the plane after he got up to use the bathroom while the aircraft sat on the runway. According to ABC News Kima Hamilton asked a flight attendant if he could use the bathroom and was told no. He waited another 30 minutes while the plane was delayed on the tarmac before finally getting up to use the restroom. After returning to his seat a Delta employee kicked him off the plane even as Hamilton explained it had been a bathroom emergency.

Doing Math

On an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Syracuse Guido Menzio an Ivy League economist was reported to the crew for scribbling in his notepad. According to The Washington Post Menzio's seatmate couldn't figure out what he was writing so she reported him to the flight's staff. As a result Menzio was asked to leave the plane for questioning where it was discovered that he was an economist and that his ""scribblings"" were just advanced math equations.

Showing Too Much Skin

All the major U.S. airlines have a policy around passenger dress — specifically against clothing that is ""lewd obscene or offensive"" according to United. As a result there have been instances of people being kicked off the plane for wearing clothing deemed to be inappropriate. In 2016 a JetBlue passenger was removed from the plane for wearing short shorts and in 2017 a controversy broke out between a woman who claimed she was booted off a Spirit Airlines flight for showing too much cleavage while the airline said it was because she was intoxicated."

It's safe to say that the butt crack leggings from TikTok have taken over — we're seeing them everywhere from targeted Facebook ads to influencer Instagram posts to lines at the grocery store. This virality however has overshadowed another just-as-flattering pair of leggings that social media users were obsessing over first: those that have a cross waist.

Unlike the now-mainstream booty lifting leggings these ones focus on your waist. The slimming cross cut glides up and across your hips to really emphasize your figure and your curves. It creates an even more pronounced hourglass shape without cinching your skin.

Posts about this attractive style started popping up in the fall when users like @hannahschlenker gained attention and admiration for the bottoms. They were originally identified as Aerie's Real Me Crossover leggings but just as news of the butt crack leggings took over a slew of other similar fashions are appearing — for half the price. This makes now perhaps the perfect time to give these pants the credit they deserve.

For example these cross waist leggings from Amazon cost under $21 and come in both full and capri lengths. The affordable pair have close to 1300 reviews and maintain a solid 4.1-star rating. Plus with 39 styles to choose from they come in basically every color you could want like black and gray staples and bold purple and pink hues.

""I have to be honest I was not expecting them to be this amazing"" wrote one five-star reviewer. ""But they really freaking are! I've been searching for good leggings for so so so long. Years. And these are so comfortable. [They're a] stretchy material but [it's] breathable and it doesn't flatten your butt like some leggings. The crotch doesn't ride up either which is always amazing. I'll definitely be ordering more.

These are the kinds of leggings that'll make you feel confident enough to rock that crop top without a single doubt. They're the kind that'll inspire a mid-day dance session around the house because you'll be feeling that good. And according to reviewers they're the kind that'll have you coming back to buy multiple pairs.

Blockchain-Powered Real Estate,"LABS is a digital securities issuance platform working on a protocol that seeks to build a unique and complete ecosystem for security token issuers and investors and provide an end-to-end real estate tokenization system for any fund company or asset.

Real estate investments have always been mostly unavailable to retail traders. Why? There are too many barriers to entry with much of it coming from the cost of making such an investment. Thankfully blockchain technology can create a structure that will allow anyone to make these types of investments through fractional ownership. LABS is tapping that function to make these opportunities available to everyone across the globe.

What is LABS?

LABS is a digital securities issuance platform working on a protocol that seeks to build a unique and complete ecosystem for security token issuers and investors. It aims to provide an end-to-end real estate tokenization system for any fund company or asset.

Their goal is to facilitate an experience where users can fully manage the lifecycle of regulatory-compliant security tokens: from issuance to being traded in various exchange platforms.

LABS utilizes the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) technology to create a digital representation of physical assets on the blockchain. NFTs represent an investor’s share of an underlying asset which is tradeable on the platform’s secondary market.

Why Digitized Securities?

Digital Securities operate using security tokens backed by real-world assets. This drives the token’s value away from the nearly unpredictable and volatile crypto market. The tokens represent a tradable unit of ownership in a company and are managed through a blockchain.

Since they function the same way a traditional “security” does they are bound by securities laws and regulations. What makes them different from traditional security is the fact that they let investors bypass middlemen (i.e. bankers) thereby reducing transaction time and financial costs on the investors’ and issuers’ part.

Interested investors from other parts of the globe can also find it easier to participate in investment opportunities from other countries through security tokens. This gives greater exposure to companies that choose to securitize their assets through the blockchain. Through licensed security token trading platforms investors can easily liquidate their security tokens whenever they choose to.

Advantages of Using LABS

Through the fractional ownership model LABS uses which is also employed on multiple cryptocurrency technologies anyone could easily make investments with lower barrier to entry and lower cost. This opens up the opportunity of investing in real estate markets even to those who do not have a lot of capital to start with.

LABS securities are also linked to secondary markets in order to make cross-border investments available. Its connection with other blockchain projects help establish the liquidity that their market needs. Coupled with the implementation of smart contract technology the platform rids itself of third-party mediators that could potentially control the investments made by individuals.

In LAB’s securities everyone is free to select which type of real estate investment fits them such as residential industrial commercial or hybrid investments. They could also easily manage their investments according to their risk profiles and plan out their strategy.

In addition even real estate projects could benefit from the tokenization of securities through LABS. Through tokenization fractionalized real estate investments and listing in secondary markets more projects could tap a bigger customer market that they weren’t able to access in traditional investment markets. Since anyone can make small investments in real estate projects the risk of losing capital also lowers because of investor diversification as well.

Liquidity

A common issue among trading platforms and tokenization projects is liquidity. In order to address these concerns LABS established an ecosystem that makes it easier for even retail investors to manage their holdings.

Secondary Market

LABS securities offer an exchange that is fully licensed and regulatory-compliant. Anyone who wants to tokenize a share of their project can make it available on LABS’ exchange. It can be traded anytime with instant settlement.

Through LABS managing your investments and executing your strategy can be done real-time. As opposed to traditional markets investors do not have to wait for trading hours to open before they can be able to reposition their investments. They also do not have to spend as much as 30 days before their exchange is settled.

Real Estate Swap Marketplace

In the near future LABS will open its property swap function which will allow investors to swap some of their holdings in a particular property to another helping them diversify their portfolio as they please. This can be made peer-to-peer where different investors can exchange their assets instantaneously.

Lending

LABS has its own stablecoin and utility token. These tokens can be used to access collateralized lending that can go as high as 75% of the tokens they pooled. This function allows users to leverage on their assets and make greater gains on their investments while also adding liquidity to the platform’s exchange.

Tokenomics

LABS Token

LABS token is the platform’s native utility and governance token. It can be used as a medium of exchange payment for transaction fees and a representation of a holder’s voting power over the governance of the platform. Some of the protocol parameters that users can vote upon are:

Voting on the rights to what investment is released

Voting on new additions to add to the LABS platform

Vote on staking pools

The right to put up new real estate projects of interest

Another benefit of holding a LABS token is that it entitles the user to priority access in real estate investments. They do not have to compete with traditional investors in early crowdfunding rounds.

There are also rewards given to LABS holders in the form of investment discounts. The discount that they are given depends on the amount of LABS they are holding.

Staking

To further support the liquidity of the platform and provide additional earning opportunities for users LABS opened a staking pool. Users can lock their assets to the staking pool to earn rewards from the profit of the platform in proportion to the amount of their stake.

But in addition to the amount of their stake LABS also factors in the amount of time that the wallet has staked. Users are required to have staked for a minimum of 30 days before they are allowed to receive their share from the rewards pool. The purpose is to prevent people from staking at the last minute with large amounts of LABS to take over the whole pool.

LABS token which will be used to reward the stakers will be distributed either daily or quarterly to the holders. Holders can also vote as to how much of the platform’s profit can be distributed to the stakers reward pool.

LABS Stable Token (USDL)

USDL token is LABS’s stable token pegged at 1 USD. These tokens are collateralized by the Security Tokens. In the future LABS is planning to use USDL in order to issue dividends and payments that need the stability of a stable token.

USDL is also available on the LABS Security Exchange. It can be used to liquidate their asset tokens which can be exchanged into fiat currency. The benefit of transacting with USDL is that users get discounted transaction fees.

LABS Security Tokens

LABS Security Tokens (ST) is the token that represents a user’s ownership of digitized assets. Dividends from their investment will be issued in either USDT or USDL. There are qualified projects for double dividends as well. If a user has made an investment in those they can receive dividends from their real estate investment as well as earn rewards with LABS Utility Tokens.

Roadmap

LABS is continuously working on expanding its investment options. Today it is working with real estate developers who want to digitize their projects. With more projects digitized investors can benefit from diversifying their global investments by getting the exposure to as many projects as they want.

Conclusion

The LABS project is a promising take on the initiative of securitizing assets on the blockchain. What most makes it unique is its decentralized nature which most real estate platforms do not implement. Here we are looking at a community-governed platform where users also have a say as to the direction of the project. They can also stake their tokens to further support the platform and earn rewards from that. This is what sets the project apart from the rest.

If the LABS project is successful it will represent the power of decentralized finance in disrupting the world of traditional finance. While its promise to make real estate investments available to anyone across the globe regardless of how much capital they have seems ambitious the fundamentals of the project look strong and sound.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the time it takes to finish reading this paragraph the pod accelerated to 100 miles per hour (160 km/h) down a length of track before delivering its first passengers to a safe stop. The ride lasted only 15 seconds and was in no danger of breaking any land-speed records but Virgin Hyperloop One nevertheless made history as the first company that has successfully tested hyperloop technology.

A hyperloop as you may have heard is a super speed ground-level transportation system in which people could travel in a hovering pod inside a vacuum tube at speeds as high as 760 mph (1220 km/h) just shy of the speed of sound. Virgin's system includes magnetic levitation much like the technology used in advanced high-speed rail projects in Japan and Germany.

As a concept for fast transportation vacuum tube transit systems have been around for a surprisingly long time. In 1845 Isambard Kingdom Brunel an engineer in Britain and the Elon Musk of his time proposed building a tube in southwest England that would propel trains at a then-dizzying speed of 70 mph (110 km/h). The project proved unfeasible due to lack of materials that would sustain it and Brunel’s concept was abandoned.

Despite Brunel's efforts it was more than a century before Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk turned the world’s attention back to tubular transit technology. In 2013 he published a 58-page technical paper that outlined the design of Hyperloop a solar-powered transportation system which he described as ""a cross between a Concorde a railgun and an air hockey table.""

Musk claimed that the vehicle could make the 350-mile (560-kilometer) journey between Los Angeles and San Francisco in just 35 minutes for $20 a ticket and estimated the cost of the infrastructure at $6 billion. He also said that the new transit system should be safer than any current mode of transport immune to weather and resistant to earthquakes. Musk never devoted many resources to making the project a physical reality but released his Hyperloop Alpha as an open-source design for universities and companies to research and develop.

In 2014 Virgin Hyperloop was founded on the premise of making Musk’s vision of a futuristic transportation system a reality. The company has made substantive technical changes to Musk's initial proposal and chose not to pursue the Los Angeles–to–San Francisco route the billionaire envisioned. But Virgin wants to keep the futuristic vehicle environmentally friendly with vegan leather seats and some of the pod materials made from recycled content.

How Does a Train-in-a-Tube Work?

At its core a hyperloop system is all about removing the two things that slow down regular vehicles: friction and air resistance. To do away with the former the pod needs to hover above its track making hyperloop a magnetic levitation (maglev) train.

To put it in the simplest terms maglev trains use two sets of magnets: one set to repel and push the train up off the track and another set to move the floating train ahead taking advantage of the lack of friction. Once two sets of magnetic waves are established they work in tandem to push the vehicle forward says Sam Gurol former director of Maglev Systems at General Atomics an energy and defense corporation based in San Diego California.

“The advantage of maglev is that it allows you to go to very high speeds in addition to having a very nice ride quality” Gurol says. “It’s like riding on a magic carpet.”

The super speed of hyperloop however is achieved through drastically minimizing air resistance. Passenger pods move through a low-pressure sealed tube which contains vacuums that suck out nearly all of the air. The air pressure inside the chamber is so low that it mimics the conditions of being at about 200000 feet (61000 meters) above sea level. By virtue of being in a tube the system is protected from the weather and can operate in almost any weather conditions.

Examining the Hyper Problems

Although the technology addresses problems of friction and air resistance hyperloop projects have suffered from a different kind of drag: economics. Financial and transportation experts have expressed the belief that Musk’s $6 billion price tag dramatically understates the cost of designing developing constructing and testing an all-new form of transportation. Leaked financial documents in 2016 suggested that Musk’s Hyperloop would cost as much as $13 billion or $121 million per mile.

Like any form of transit hyperloop transport carries inherent risks and contingencies for any unforeseen disasters still need to be engineered into the system. At high speeds even a small earthquake or the slightest breakage of a vacuum tube would pose a significant danger to passengers and crew. In addition to safety assurance a hyperloop system must offer the kind of pricing that would draw paying passengers away from current modes of transportation.

With large-scale projects like this good engineering needs to co-exist with good politics. Back in the 1990s and early 2000s Gurol’s company collaborated with a German firm Transrapid to build a maglev-based high-speed train from Las Vegas to Anaheim. In 2007 former U.S. Senator Harry Reid (Nevada) became the Senate majority leader and decided the state had more important priorities.

“That’s the kind of political change that can just reverse any progress. Hundreds of engineers and fifteen years of work and the project just died.” Gurol says.

According to Financial Times in 2018 Saudi Arabia pulled its $1 billion deal with Virgin Hyperloop after the company’s ex-chairman Richard Branson criticized the kingdom over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Still as of May 2019 the company had raised $400 million from private investors and plans to begin commercial operations in 2030 (pushed back from early predictions that envisioned a passenger-ready hyperloop in 2021).

Besides Virgin the companies working out the hurdles of this transportation method include the Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HyperloopTT) a U.S.-based startup that signed an agreement in China to build a test track Hardt Hyperloop in the Netherlands and TransPod a Canadian company.

Until these companies raise hundreds of millions of dollars in funding acquire the massive tracts of land needed for a viable system and prove that the system can be operated safely hyperloop remains a near-future dream.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYmVya2VsZXloaWdoamFja2V0LmNvbS8yMDIxL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2V0aGljYWwtZmFzaGlvbi1zdHVkZW50cy1kaXNjb3Zlci1uZXctd2F5cy10by1zaG9wLXN1c3RhaW5hYmx5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ethical Fashion: Students Discover New Ways to Shop Sustainably,"In the 2019-20 Berkeley High School (BHS) yearbook a photo spread titled “Fashion” featured students wearing everything from snake-patterned pants to neon socks to leather skorts and everything in between. The message was clear: BHS students have a diverse and nearly uninhibited range of fashion styles.

Many students source their clothing from shops surrounding the school with second-hand stores like Goodwill and Out of the Closet located just blocks away and vintage clothing stores on Telegraph five minutes away by bus. In recent years thrift stores have grown in popularity along with the re-selling of thrifted clothing. Online marketplaces like Depop and Mercari have become staples for both buyers and sellers and new vintage shops are popping up everywhere.

For those who thrift by choice as opposed to necessity this burgeoning popularity raises an important question: how do we balance sustainable shopping with ensuring those who rely on thrift stores due to financial circumstances have access to what they need?

For Amelie Martin a senior in Communication Arts and Sciences (CAS) the answer lies in the cyclical nature of thrifting. “Before I go to a thrift store like Goodwill I make sure that I’ve donated my own clothes within the past month because I think that you have to give before you get” she said.

She explained “It’s a good way to be conscious and making sure that you’re not being selfish or oblivious to why thrifting was created in the first place.”

Martin has also recently been trying to limit how often she goes to thrift stores that offer discounted clothes instead purchasing through online marketplaces and vintage stores. “In my opinion there’s a difference between vintage thrifting and thrifting at Goodwill” she said. “The goal of vintage thrifting is not to offer cheap clothing alternatives to people who can’t afford to buy first hand clothes.”

The origins of thrifting are certainly something to take into account. Both Salvation Army and Goodwill began as a way to employ people with disabilities and financial instability while providing those in the working class with affordable clothing. The Salvation Army was launched out of the basement of a men’s shelter in 1897 and Goodwill was created with a similar purpose in 1902.

By the 1920s thrift stores had become widespread and were as structured as department stores. People had also swapped the term “junk shop” for “thrift store” which increased the appeal to the middle class. During both the Great Depression and World War II the demand for thrifted clothing far outweighed the supply. Thrift stores flourished at the time of the postwar economic boom and specifically-catered vintage stores also took hold of the clothing scene. Today thrift stores are part of a 17.5 billion dollar resale industry in the US and make up a large portion of the clothing market nationwide.

In the past decade thrifting has taken on a completely new dimension: sustainability. Many shoppers turned to thrifting to reduce their negative environmental impact by avoiding “fast fashion” clothing that’s been produced by way of mass production. As such there exists a definite balance between caring for the environment and caring for those who rely on discounted clothing.

Similar to Martin BHS freshman Lula Rosenbach believes that the balance lies in conscious thrifting. “If you donate clothes back to Goodwill that’s a really great action to compensate for what you might be taking” she said. “I think we just need to be really conscious. … When you’re thrifting think ‘Who else could use this’ and ‘Am I taking this away from someone who needs it more than me?’ ”

Rosenbach’s mother has thrifted since she was a teenager and thrifted most of Rosenbach’s baby clothes. She began taking Rosenbach with her when she was in elementary school. “Since then I pretty much thrift all my clothes … partly because thrifting is so much better for the environment and also because there’s more unique pieces and it’s easier for me to find things I love” said Rosenbach.

Rosenbach like Martin has recently relied more on online marketplaces using apps like Mercari and Poshmark. However both students try to be aware of the complex nature of resale.

Many people question the morality of upselling thrifted clothing. “Vintage shopping can be tricky because a lot of vintage shops don’t say whether they’re getting their clothes from discounted thrift stores and non-profits” explained Martin. “I’m very suspicious of how some of these stores are sourcing their product.” Martin feels that upselling thrifted clothes is something that should be avoided because it takes advantage of resources designed for lower-income communities.

Jolie a “shop-baby” at Indigo Vintage Co-op felt differently. “I think that it’s many peoples’ jobs and they make a living off of it which is okay as long as they’re not running the Goodwills dry.” She explained that exhausting Goodwill’s clothing supply “is basically impossible because Goodwill has an endless supply of clothes and every year a ton of clothing ends up going straight to the dump and not even hitting thrift stores.”

Indigo Vintage is a woman-run cooperative with several locations each of which feature multiple independent vendors. Jolie shared “Each vendor finds their clothing they all have different sources and it really changes vendor to vendor.”

When asked about finding a balance between sustainable shopping and moral thrifting Jolie said “I think it’s just really being conscious about what you’re buying; making sure that you’re not taking something that someone else will really need.”

Aside from conscious thrifting Martin also advocated for creativity. “I really encourage people to get into making their own clothes too and recycling the clothes they have. … What I do is cut up my old clothes and make new things” she said.

By re-working the clothes she already owns Martin bypasses both the fast-fashion industry and the supply of discounted clothing. “I encourage people to get creative if they want to be sustainable” she said.

Overall it seems that for those who can afford first-hand clothing but prefer to thrift for environmental economic and other reasons buyer-awareness is essential. When we shop at discounted thrift stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army we are taking away from the clothing supply for those who rely on these stores for economic reasons. However we are also reducing our negative environmental impact and funding the humanitarian aid of these non-profits. Thrifting when done with care can benefit the environment and our communities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9ib29rcy93aGF0LXRvLXJlYWQvb25lLWxlYWRpbmctdm9pY2VzLXZpY3Rvcmlhbi1lcmEtZGlzY292ZXItcmVhbC1lbGl6YWJldGgtYmFycmV0dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'One of the leading voices of the Victorian era': discover the real Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"When Wordsworth died in 1850 and the post of Poet Laureate became vacant one name that was widely canvassed in the press as his replacement was that of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. In the end the honour went to Tennyson; it would take until 2009 for the first woman Carol Ann Duffy to fill the post.

That Barrett Browning was in the running says much about her status in her lifetime though her literary reputation declined after her death. Her only poem that remains widely known today is the lyric “How do I love thee? Let me count the ways”; her magnum opus of 1856 Aurora Leigh a book-length verse narrative about the life of a fictional woman writer is largely unread except by academics. During the 20th century she was sentimentally repackaged in the play The Barretts of Wimpole Street which inspired more than one Hollywood treatment. It painted her as a delicate flower escaping from her overbearing father into the arms of her fellow poet Robert Browning.

It’s true that Barrett Browning suffered from poor health; that her father was strange; and that she eloped to marry Browning with whom she spent the rest of her life in Italy. But this new biography shows that she was also determined ambitious and engaged in the public debates of her day. It restores her to her proper place as one of the leading voices of the Victorian era.

Born in 1806 she was a poetic prodigy from an early age encouraged by her wealthy family who called her “Ba” (in a family obsessed with nicknames she got off lightly compared with her sister “Addles” and her aunt “Bummy”).

Her childhood home was a country house built in the style of an extravagant gothic folly but the Barretts were outsiders not landed gentry. The money came from slave plantations in Jamaica; although the slave trade had been abolished in 1807 slavery itself remained legal in the Caribbean into the 1830s.

Some have concluded that Barrett Browning had mixed-race heritage the result of some ancestral relationship between a master and an enslaved woman. Fiona Sampson finds no objective ­evidence for this. However she confronts the troubling source of the wealth that ­enabled the embryonic young poet to devote herself to the life of the mind and she goes on to show how Barrett Browning came to espouse the abolitionist cause.

Sampson also explores how 19th-century stereotypes of femininity affected Barrett Browning in her self-creation as a writer. It would be interesting to find out more about how her literary voice compares with those of the other female poets of her era. In 1835 for instance she addressed one of her earliest published poems to the already famous English poetess Letitia Landon while her decision in Aurora Leigh to focus on the life of a fictional female poet harked back to Madame de Stael’s 1807 bestseller Corinne.",,,,,,

The first started just before 7:30 a.m. at the Jamaica Avenue location of the Dollar Jackpot in Richmond Hill a one-story building the FDNY said.

“Our units responded in 3 minutes” FDNY Chief of Department John Sudnik said of the “heavy fire conditions” with “fire blowing out the storefront windows.

“Our units made an aggressive push to put the fire out but there was just too much fire for them to handle” Sudnik said.

With the threat of potential combustible items in the store making the situation “very dangerous” the crews were pulled out to a “defensive position” outside the blazing building he said.

The inferno was upgraded to a five-alarm fire about an hour after the first call with at least 44 units and 198 firefighters responding.

The flames were finally contained just before 10 a.m. more than two and a half hours after they started.

“They prevented fire from extending to the adjacent buildings” Sudnik said of his crews’ operation.

Two firefighters and an unidentified civilian were taken to local hospitals all with non-life-threatening injuries the FDNY said. One of the firefighters was treated and released officials said.

The department’s press office said at one point that a Bravest at the scene suffered “serious life-threatening injuries” but a spokesman later said this was inaccurate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lc3Nlbmdlcm5ld3MubmV0L3Byb2dyZXNzMjAyMS9wcm9ncmVzczIwMjFyZWdpb24vMjAyMS8wMi9tYW5zb24tYnVpbGRpbmctYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy11cC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Manson: Building businesses up | News Sports Jobs,"MANSON — With a new grocery store and several new businesses you wouldn’t guess Manson’s Main Street is going through the same challenges many other towns are experiencing amid a pandemic downturn in consumer confidence.

A vision of growth materialized in November as Manson reopened its only grocery store bringing life back to Calhoun County as it emerged from the grips of a growing food desert in rural Iowa. The opening was a capstone to many new developments in town over the year.

Nearly a year after the small Heartland Market chain closed locations in Manson and Rockwell City Manson Hometown Grocery bounced back with a nonprofit model to try its luck in the town of 2000. So far the signs are promising.

“There’s been a lot of people who it took them a bit” said Manson Mayor Dave Anderson reflecting on concerns about changed shopping habits as Manson shoppers adjusted to getting their groceries in Fort Dodge temporarily. “A lot of (residents) work in Fort Dodge. It’s all about habits. But we have a nice clean store it’s well stocked. People are coming around.”

Compared to pricing at local competitors he said Manson Hometown Grocery is right on par or cheaper.

As the store moved away from prepackaged meats it also started to reap one of the benefits of the nonprofit model: cheaper prices.

One benefit of the model is that as long as customers continue to shop there and keep revenue up the store can lower prices.

“(Being nonprofit) is the biggest advantage we have” Anderson said. “The wholesalers have taken all the money out of it. It’s a tough business. The margins are so thin.”

Though Manson didn’t quite reach its initial $200000 fundraising goal the more than $180000 it did raise was sufficient to bring the vision to life: a model built by the community for the community with some old-fashioned elbow grease from volunteers. The nonprofit model the first of its kind in at least Calhoun and Webster counties was custom developed by Drake University Law School students in Des Moines.

“Knowing that the community got together to do this we want to make sure we’re behind the community making this work and doing what we have to do to keep the doors open” said co-manager Jessica Teague at the store’s opening. “We’re all about community here.”

With former experience at nearly every other relevant retail chain in the area — Walmart Target Casey’s General Store and Dollar General — she believed the new team of nine employees and the grocery store’s volunteer board of directors had the knowledge they needed to make the effort a success even up against formidable chains like Dollar General that Nick Graham the owner of Manson’s last store blamed for much of its demise.

Now the store is more than a place to shop it’s a block of stability that is already paying dividends.

And groceries are great but Manson has a whole lot more going on.

State of the Art custom signs and decor opened on Main Street in 2020. Debbie’s Cafe and Main Line Boutique are opening early this year Divine 0 Nine Salon became S & J Salon and the old Foley Building at 1012 Main St. was stabilized for resale thanks to a Derelict Building grant.

After gaining ownership of the Foley Building the city of Manson received $35000 in a matching Derelict Building grant. With $70000 the city put a new roof on the iconic downtown front many generations grew up shopping in stabilized a beam in the building and had asbestos removed.

“Now we have a stabilized building we can sell to a business that would be vital and complement our community” said Thelma McGough director of Manson Economic Development. “We didn’t want to have a building fall in or be bought for cheap and not taken care of.”

KC Nielsen Ltd. a John Deere dealership reopened after a devastating fire destroyed its building Star Energy transitioned ownership to Growmark and four new homes were built.

The list could go on for a while on the big changes happening in a small town.

“I’ve always admired Manson for what they had going on” said Anderson reflecting on the environment that has cultivated success. “We’re so close to Fort Dodge. A lot of our population works in Fort Dodge but yet they want everything in town all the amenities.”

To him the success in challenging times says there are a lot of folks who think outside of the box.

“For the grocery store we put together a board of individuals and in all honesty I never would’ve guessed those people in one group could do it — they did awesome” he said. “As far as local businesses they have fairly strong followings.”

During the height of pandemic restrictions consumers stepped up to support those in need through things like curbside service.

“Manson’s very good at supporting its own” Anderson said.

“The community is very positive. The success of the fundraising for the grocery store really brought the community together” McGough said. “The ones opening new businesses are people that are raising families in Manson or who have (before). They believe in community. That’s where they want to stay and want to grow.”

She said the completion of the city’s Main Street Streetscape project in 2019 preceded business success in 2020 by showing Manson that the city was committed to community betterment.

The incident occurred at about 4:30 p.m. when the eagle seemingly flew down for prey — but dove instead through the windshield of a Perdue Farms truck that was headed south on Worcester Highway according to a spokesperson for Maryland Natural Resources Police.

The driver was able to pull to the side of the road unharmed but the truck was ""totaled"" due to damage according to police.

A five-alarm inferno burned a Queens dollar store to a crisp on Sunday.

Three people including two firefighters were injured during the blaze that broke out at about 7:27 a.m. on Feb. 14 inside the Dollar Jackpot store located within a one-story structure at 107-12 Jamaica Ave. in Richmond Hill.

The flames quickly spread throughout the structure and grew into a five-alarm fire within about an hour. Nearly 200 firefighters from 44 units were called to the scene.

“Our units responded in three minutes” said FDNY Chief of Department John Sudnik. “There were heavy fire conditions heavy fire blowing out the storefront windows. Our units made an aggressive push to put the fire out but there was just too much fire for them to handle.”

Sudnik said the firefighters worked relentlessly to contain the blaze fearing that combustible stock within the store might burst and cause the flames to spread to adjoining buildings. Luckily they avoided major damage to the adjoining structures.

One civilian and two firefighters were hospitalized with injuries not considered life-threatening Fire Department sources said.

“We’re here to support and take care of any patients that are generated. We’ll remain on scene and stand fast” said FDNY Chief of EMS Lillian Bonsignore.

Using three hose lines from tower ladders among other techniques the blaze was brought under control at about 9:54 a.m. Sunday.

The cause of the fire labeled suspicious due to its rapid spread is now under investigation by FDNY marshals.

It was the second major fire along Jamaica Avenue in Richmond Hill since December when dozens of people were displaced by a six-alarm inferno that broke out two blocks away at 109-25 Jamaica Ave.

By Julie Johansen

With the recent resignation of council member Shala Hunsaker Ferron City needed to appoint someone to the open seat for the remainder of 2021. Following the notice letters of intent were received from four candidates.

Three of the candidates Wayne Urie Becky Nelson and Brad Richman were present at Thursday’s city council meeting and were given some time to introduce themselves to the council. The council then voted with silent ballots. Brad Richman won the popular vote taking the oath of office as he was sworn in by Ferron City Recorder Brittany Yeates.

Next up Desertview Federal Credit Union was recognized as the business of the month. Desertview was established in 1960 with the philosophy of “people helping people.” The Ferron Branch of Desertview was added in 2003 to extend the availability to their membership.

Mayor Adele Justice remembers when Desertview expanded to Ferron and how ecstatic the city was to have them there. She said they especially appreciate the service of the wonderful tellers and their desire to be part of the community.

Then the discussion of security systems which started in the last meeting in January was continued. Verkada seemed to have more than the city felt they needed Bryan Christensen recommended to stay with what they had and decided not to bid. Wayne Roberts submitted a bid of $1304.18 to put two cameras in the fire station. The bid was accepted by council.

Becky Nelson then requested that locks be added to the cupboards that store medication. The recorder showed a new bid from Superior Security Systems for the doors at the city hall and she is requesting bids for the restrooms as well. The city will then apply to the county for the return of some CARES Act funds to cover the expenses.

A motion was made to accept six members to the fire department who have cleared their background checks. They include Dusty Justice Jennifer Price Willard Hawks Eddie Deto Andy Nelson and Wayne Urie. The motion was approved. Ferron City Fire Chief Dell Mead said they still need to arrange for drug screens.

Sherrie Swasey told the council that the Southeastern Utah Jr. Livestock Show is going to be hosted this year. She requested a $175 donation to sponsor the “Best of Emery County “ buckle. The request was granted. Council member Troy Winter later announced that the county-only stock show will be June 24-25 and then the annual show will be July 6-10.

Council member Winter also asked if there needed to be a height limit on headstones at the cemetery. The council did not think this was something they needed to pursue at this time. Winter also commended council member Chris Winn for the work he did on the sidewalks to San Rafael Middle School.

New council member Richman is also on the planning commission and he reported about the trails plans they had presented to them last week. Mayor Justice stated the preferred routes are from the fairgrounds on Canyon Road up to Millsite and one following State Street to Clawson.

The mayor also announced that Dollar Tree has interest in coming to Ferron. She cautioned council member Winter to be careful with spring cleanup at the cemetery giving the example of what happened in Price with the recent cleanup confusion.

The recorder reported that she spoke to Rocky Mountain Power about changing to LED lights and received a quote of $30000. The option of replacing the lights as they burn out was chosen by the council.

In citizen comments Wayne Urie said that he had spent many hours working on a Community Development Block Grant grant to purchase a new truck with the funds but was told just a couple of days before the deadline he could not submit it. He wanted the city to come up with a plan to see that this doesn’t happen again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBpY2hhZnVuZXJhbGhvbWUuY29tL29iaXR1YXJ5L2Nhcm95bGUta21ha9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Caroyle Jeanne Kmak of Wisconsin Dells Wisconsin,"Caroyle Jeanne Kmak July 8 1944 - February 9 2021

Caroyle Jeanne (Walling) Kmak age 76 of Wisconsin Dells WI passed away Tuesday February 9 2021 at St. Clare Meadows in Baraboo WI. Caroyle’s husband and children were all able to visit and say goodbye during her final days.

The Mass of Christian Burial will be held Saturday February 13 2021 at 11:00 a.m. at St. Cecilia’s Catholic Church in Wisconsin Dells with Fr. Eric Sternberg celebrating. The service will be live streamed on https://www.facebook.com/dellscatholic/ St. Cecelia’s Facebook page. Burial will be at Calvary Cemetery in Wisconsin Dells. Visitation will be held at St. Cecilia’s Catholic Church on Saturday from 9:00 am and memories shared at 10:50 am until the time of Mass at 11:00 am.

Caroyle Kmak was born July 8 1944 in Anthon Iowa to Edwin and Priscilla (Stansberry) Walling. Caroyle attended school in Antioch California before moving with her family to Crossett Arkansas in 1955. She graduated from Crossett High in 1962 and from Arkansas State Teachers College in 1966. That same year she became postulant in the Order of Servants of Mary (Servites) professed temporary vows in August 1967 and took final vows in 1970 as Sr. Mary Redempta. Her teaching career began in 1967 and ranged from primary school in New York to junior high in Detroit Michigan. Caroyle was teaching at a Catholic High School in Detroit where Fr. Howard Kmak happened to be stationed teaching in Servite Seminary. Howard was assigned to give the sisters in the convent a short retreat. Once the retreat concluded Caroyle approached Fr. Howard complimented him on the retreat and the rest is history. Howard and Caroyle were married at St. Cecilia’s Catholic Church on August 14 1976 in Wisconsin Dells where they built their lives. She was a stay-at-home mom during her children’s young childhood and elementary school years. She rejoined the field of education working at Baraboo and Portage school districts. She served on the Wisconsin Dells School Board from 1989-1998 and the CESA 5 Board from 1989-1995. She finished her teaching career in the Wisconsin Dells School District from 2000 until she retired in 2010. She has always been an active member of St. Cecilia’s Parish from being the director of religious education to planning the funeral luncheons for parish members. During her retirement she worked at the Dandelion shop in Wisconsin Dells and continued to work as a substitute teacher in the Dells school district until she no longer physically could.

Over the years Caroyle’s hobbies included cooking sewing arts and crafts woodworking puzzles coloring being sassy exercising her sarcasm story telling exaggerated versions of the truth sitting on the back porch with an iced tea which transitioned to a Southern Comfort or a B&B by 4:00 pm and finding treasures at the Dollar Tree and the local St. Vincent DePaul.

Caroyle is survived by her husband Howard; daughters Monica Kmak (Larry Owen) Julia Thoe (Eric Thoe) Cynthia Kmak (Mark Winston) Katrina Kmak (John Burdick IV) son Joseph Kmak (Claire) siblings James Walling (Sally Walling) Claudia Walling Randall Alan Walling (Clare Ann Walling) Brian Walling (Barbara Walling) sister-in-law Julia Hall Walling grandsons Adrian and Jamison Thoe and John Burdick V as well as many nieces nephews friends and family. She is preceded in death by her parents Priscilla Yvonne Stansberry Walling and Edwin Francis Walling and brothers Edwin Lloyd Walling and Michael Wayne Walling.

I decided to put the superstore to the test using the Shopsavvy App to discover which purchases are cheapest at Walmart. If you’re looking for a good buy I’ve rounded up 10 everyday items from Walmart that rival the competition’s equivalent on price.

Aveeno Clear Complexion

If Aveeno is your skincare go-to you can save by getting your favorite cleanser at Walmart. Aveeno’s Clear Complexion foam cleanser was available at Walmart for less than at Target or Amazon. It’s not big savings at about $0.35 less but every little bit adds up.

Dove Go Fresh Deodorant Dry Spray

Don’t get sweaty running from store to store to find your favorite Dove deodorant on sale. Walmart came in first on price over Target pricing their bottles at $6.14.

American Crew Classic Firm Hold Styling Gel

Fans of American Crew Styling Gel can rejoice. The gel will help your locks stay put while locking up the lowest price at Walmart. They again trump Target by over $3 with the Walmart price coming in at $10.80 and Target’s at $13.99.

Clariol Nice’n Easy Permanent Hair Color Crème

If you dye your hair on a regular basis or just get a color pick-me-up every so often consider picking up Clariol. I found it at Walmart for only $4.73.

SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo

Keep your locks hydrated for less just by shopping at the right store. Get savings of $1.05 on this cult favorite hydrating shampoo if you pick it up at Walmart for $8.94 instead of at Target for $9.99.

Energizer Max Batteries AA

It’s a good idea to stock up on batteries because you always want to have some on hand in an emergency like a power outage. If your flashlight doesn’t work you’re stuck in the dark. You can also be stuck paying high prices to purchase more when you’re in a pinch. Walmart has a 24-pack of AA batteries for only $16.24 — hefty savings when compared to Target’s smaller 20-pack which sells for $15.99.

Ajax Ultra Triple Action Orange Liquid Dish Soap

Know that when you cut back the grease when rising pots and pans you are also cutting back on how much you spend. Grab a 52 oz. bottle for less when you shop soap at Walmart and not Target or Amazon. Compared to Amazon Walmart offers this classic soap for a whopping $8.80 less!

Q-tips Cotton Swabs Anti-Bacterial

Though not recommended for your ears cotton swabs are great for cleaning hard-to-reach places like buttons on an office phone or a television remote control. They’re also great for applying makeup and can be used for craft projects. I think of them as a household staple. Get a 300-count pack of Q-tips’ anti-bacterial swabs for $2.47 at Walmart compared to $2.97 on Amazon.

Centrum Multivitamin/Multimineral

Your mother may have told you to take your vitamins but she might have forgotten to tell you that they cost less at Walmart. You can score a 130-count pack that contains one bottle of 100 vitamins and the other with 30 vitamins a deal that isn’t even offered at Target or Amazon.

Eucerin Daily Hydration Broad Spectrum 15 SPF Body Lotion

Keep your skin protected and your cash in your pocket when you purchase your Eucerin lotion at Walmart. Walmart sells a 16.9 oz. bottle for $9.54.

Unless you’re an avid couponer or you have your finger on the pulse of a store’s markdown schedule head over to Walmart for the items listed above. Their budget-friendly finds on everyday items might crystallize your decision to shop there on a regular basis.

Which items do you find are cheaper at Walmart and which ones are cheaper elsewhere?

SOUTH CHESTERFIELD Va. – Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) Richmond District crews continue their work to address icy conditions on state-maintained routes. Friday night and Saturday morning roads were continuously treated with salt to melt icy patches and sand to improve traction for vehicles. Although pavement may be bare in many areas conditions could be dangerous until temperatures rise and roads dry.

“We are still urging drivers to stay home today” said Sean Nelson Richmond District Maintenance Engineer. “Conditions may look favorable but ice can be invisible at times and our crews need time and space to address slick roads. We appreciate everyone’s patience during this longer duration storm.”

In addition to slick road conditions ice can weigh down heavy tree limbs and power lines causing them to fall into travel lanes and could also lead to power outages. VDOT has tree crews on the lookout for debris and Dominion Energy crews are responding to outages as safely and quickly as possible.

“We share VDOT’s commitment to safety and appreciate their work to keep roads safe in our communities” said Charlene Whitfield senior vice president of power delivery Dominion Energy. “We will work around the clock until all of our customers have their power restored. The work that VDOT does to clear roads helps our crews be at our best when our customers need us most.”

Conditions can change rapidly with even slight variations in air temperatures. Staying home and off the roads is the safest option until conditions improve.

Report icy conditions by calling 800-FOR-ROAD (367-7623) or visiting https://my.vdot.virginia.gov/. Check for the latest road conditions near you by visiting http://www.511virginia.org/ or the free 511 mobile app. Cities and towns provide their own road maintenance and Henrico County maintains its own secondary system (routes numbered 600+).

NORFOLK Va. — A lot of people are without power across the Commonwealth of Virginia.

More than 220000 customers have lost power since 4 a.m. Saturday according to Dominion Energy spokesperson.

Crews have been working around-the-clock to restore power as safely and quickly as possible to the 145000 customers who remain without power as of 7 p.m. Saturday Dominion Regional Director Bonita Harris said in a news release.

Dominion Energy officials tell us the main trouble areas are in Central and Northern Virginia crews are out in full force working to restore power.

Dominion Energy said the main trouble areas in our viewing area are in Williamsburg and James City County.

You can view a map showing area outages at https://outagemap.dominionenergy.com/external/default.html

Harris said they are working to restore power to homes parts of the Sentara Williamsburg Regional Medical Center and the York County Emergency Operations Center.

""Things may get worse before they get better with the weather continuing through the night"" said Harris. ""We want our customers to be prepared for the possibility of power outages over the next couple of days.""

Harris said crews plan to get power turned back on in Williamsburg by Saturday night depending on conditions. It's been a challenge.

“As soon as our crews get the wire back up the ice brings them back down” said Harris.



Harris reminds people to treat every downed power line as a live wire.



“We want to make sure that people stay at least 30 feet from any downed wires because they are dangerous and you can get seriously hurt or even killed if you come in contact with a live wire"" said Harris.

Dominion Energy Dominion Energy crews work to restore power after an ice storm on Feb. 13 2021.

""We are in those hardest hit areas asking our customers to plan for a multiple day restoration event"" said Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton.

The thought of no power for potentially several days did not sit right with Marylinn Minor.

""I'm in a hotel because I have no heat"" said Minor.

She checked herself into a room with no clear timeline on when her Hanover home will have its power restored.

""Getting here was not that easy either. There were several trees down and the roads are still icy"" Minor explained. ""I had to do something. I couldn’t stay there without any heat.""

WTVR Christian Tabernacle Bishop Kenneth Hicks

For those who can't afford a hotel say people like Kenneth Hicks are stepping in to offer safety shelter and food.

""We need to be in place to meet the needs of the people"" said Hicks.

After learning about power outages in the Tri-Cities the bishop and his wife invited anyone impacted by the storm to Christian Tabernacle in Petersburg for a warm place to sleep overnight and a filling meal.

""I slept in the pulpit. I got up and walked the floor"" said Hicks. ""And just to see people snug and warm and comfortable no worries. I mean it's just one of the greatest feelings in the world as a pastor.""

WTVR Christian Tabernacle

While crews work to restore power across the region Dominion is asking folks to be patient.

""Just because there’s a work location or there’s an outage in your neighborhood and you don’t see a line crew working doesn’t mean we don’t have people out there"" said Slayton.

Dominion patrol teams are still assessing damage and gathering data in some areas. Once that's complete they'll have a better idea on when people's power could be restored."

If you're planning a cosy night in this weekend or just don't fancy cooking for yourself than Aldi's takeaway range is the perfect treat - and on a budget.

The supermarket has upped its fakeaway game and has now added a dessert option - Carlos Takeaway Chewy and Gooey Cookies that cost less than a third of the price of Domino's equivalent.

Inspired by Domino's they have a crispy outside with an oozing centre of cookie dough and chocolate chips and cost just £1.49 - compared to Domino's £4.49.

They're sure to sweeten up any fakeaway night in and are in store now. Aldi says that they are best served warm with ice cream while on the sofa.

The cookies are a perfect finale to Aldi’s Carlos Takeaway Stuffed Crust Pizza at £1.59 with the delicious cheesy pizzas working out over 80% cheaper than the price of a stuffed crust medium-sized pizza from Dominos which start at £16.98. Available with classic toppings such as Cheese Feast and Double Pepperoni.

Not fancying the stuffed crust? Aldi has you covered with the new Carlos Takeaway Pizza (£1.69) which comes in two o flavours: BBQ Chicken and Pepperoni.

Of course no pizza order is complete without a side of garlic bread. And Aldi has the answer with its famous Garlic Pizza Bread (99p 145g) which bears a remarkable likeness to the Dominos £4.99 version at a slice of the price. Topped with oozing mozzarella tangy tomato and punchy garlic it’s served inside a takeaway-style box and is the ideal fakeaway fix.

The perfect partner for any garlic bread or pizza is Aldi’s creamy and tangy Garlic & Herb Dip (49p 100g).

Customers have been going wild for this dipping delight with some social posts racking up thousands of comments from people who couldn’t believe how much it tastes like the one from the popular takeaway joint which costs more than double the price (£1.19).

One satisfied shopper on Extreme Couponing and Bargains UK said: ""I personally thought it tasted exactly the same as Domino's"" while another added: ""Best dip I've had in ages!! I need to get more.""

The total cost of this full Aldi fake-away menu is under £10 coming in at £6.25 which is a whopping 84% cheaper than the Dominoes price at over £40. With the Aldi price saving shoppers more than £34 we’ll let the maths here speak for itself!

Brendan McDermid | Reuters

For all the unprecedented events and unforeseen consequences of the past year market conditions today rhyme rather closely with those of mid-February 2020 when stocks peaked right before the Covid crash. In the six months leading to the Feb. 19 2020 crest in the indexes the S&P 500 had gained 15.8% to a series of new all-time highs. Today the index is up 15.9% the past six months and has been clicking to new records for most of that span.

Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards

Much of the talk around the market is similar too: Worries that too much of the market is dominated by a few huge growth stocks (the top five S&P stocks were 20% of the index then and are 22% today) and that investor sentiment had perhaps grown too complacent. Then as now the S&P was at a 20-year high in terms of valuation the forward price/earnings ratio then just above 19 and now surpassing 22 – yet for those who choose to compare equity earnings yields to Treasury yields the gap is pretty close: 3.7 percentage points then versus 3.3 now. The spread on high-yield bonds has made an almost-perfect round trip in the past year sitting right at extreme lows which fits into a sense that generous credit markets are lubricating the economy and markets.

Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards

Here's how this equity-asset support from forgiving debt capital markets was characterized in this column one year ago this weekend: ""Real investment-grade corporate bond yields are scarcely above zero. The Chicago Fed National Financial Conditions Index shows the liquidity backdrop is as loose as it's been this cycle...A clear majority of S&P 500 stocks have dividend yields exceeding the 10-year Treasury yield. While no perfect relative-value indicator this tends to provide a buffer underneath equity valuation."" All of that is true today as well. And so is the fevered buying in a clutch of expensive ""story stocks"" which excites younger and more-aggressive investors while making the traditionalists a bit nervous. A year ago: ""A cluster of what might be called 'idiosyncratic speculative-growth' stocks are also acting quite frisky this year a sign that investors are grasping aggressively for the next big thing (or perhaps just the next quick buck). "" Then it was Tesla Beyond Meat and Virgin Galactic. Today it is several-dozen names from GameStop to Canadian cannabis to fuel cells to early-stage fintech apps.

What's different now

So the echoes are pretty clear as this anniversary approaches. The differences though are several important and make the current market more dynamic in ways both favorable and – potentially eventually - hazardous. Let's be clear that noting the similar market set-up now is not remotely to predict anything like a repeat of the market collapse and economic calamity that began to unfold in late February of last year. The coronavirus spread was a genuine external shock the forced global economic halt a first the five-week-35% freefall unprecedented. Which brings us to some of the more crucial differences between now and a year ago. The collapse reset the clock on the economic cycle and policy stances. From 2019 into 2020 Wall Street was caught in a late-cycle vigil with the economy near peak employment the Treasury yield curve flat corporate profit margins near peak earnings projected to be flat. The Fed was on hold indefinitely in February 2020 with short rates at 1.5-1.75% but a significant minority of Fed officials was projecting a rate hike in 2021. The flash recession and profit collapse prompted some $5 trillion in deficit-financed fiscal support with more likely and turned the Fed maximum easy for a long time to come intent on waiting for a return to full employment and a lasting rise in inflation before making any tightening moves. So yes valuations are higher now and investor expectations could be growing unrealistic. But Corporate America refinanced itself for years to come at invitingly low rates against a Fed backstop earnings will be back above their prior peak this year government is eager to run the economy hot and (arguably) policy makers just executed a repeatable process for short-circuiting a recession.

Smaller investors rush in

Another way that things have changed in a year is the headlong rush of smaller investors into the market feeling invincible after making it through the crash and riding a near-80% rebound in the S&P 500. Investors' willingness to gorge on leveraged upside bets in the form of call options in unprecedented volumes and the instant mark-up of new IPOs such as DoorDash Snowflake and AirBNB to multi-tens-of-billions in market value at towering revenue multiples shows a new more aggressive and risk-tolerant ethos to the tape. Some of this energy was already starting to flow a year ago but it hadn't gained nearly as much momentum or taken on as much of a viral character. The Russell Micro-Cap Index is up 65% in 3 ½ months. Penny-stock volumes have quintupled over the same period. Overall trading volumes are surging even with the indexes rallying – the reverse of the typical pattern and harkening back to a similar pattern from the late 1990s. Equity inflows in the latest week set a new record. Social-media stampedes took GameStop shares from $12 to $400 back to $52 the past two months and then ran Tilray from $18 to $63 back to $29 in two weeks. Meantime volumes in staid S&P 500 ETFs has sunk toward multi-year lows apparently not racy enough for the marginal buyer. That entire litany describing the untamed animal spirits coursing through Wall Street says both that this is a powerful and well-sponsored bull market and that risks of a wild overshoot are building. Then again everyone is aware they are building and have been sounding alarms for a while.

Bank of America indicator nearing sell territory

Does the fact that subsectors of Reddit stocks and faddish green-energy plays get overblown and then punctured without undermining the big-cap indexes say they aren't dangerous? Or is the fact that a few days of headlong buying in small short-squeeze stocks late last month triggered a quick 4% S&P 500 spill a warning that the erratic tremors can't always be safely dissipated through the market's foundation? A year ago Bank of America global strategist Michael Hartnett was telling investors to keep playing risk assets ""until investors grow more clearly 'euphoric' which he expects will mark the moment of 'peak positioning and peak liquidity.'"" Hartnett is holding that same vigil now his Bull & Bear Indicator correctly keeping investors involved but inching up to a contrarian Sell threshold (which has preceded corrections in the past and was last hit in early 2018).

Onetime Trump voters in Florida Georgia Colorado Missouri North Carolina Ohio and other states have all made attempts at forming their own iterations of a Patriot Party in recent weeks.

A couple have run into problems when they tried to file documents with the Federal Election Commission and the Trump campaign has had to disavow connections with them.

Although the parties seem to have been formed separately and without coordination what many of these novice politicos share they said in interviews is a deep frustration with the GOP and a desire to create an alternative to the two-party system — with or without Trump’s help or participation.

Florida patriots

Last week the American Patriot Party of the United States — or TAPPUS for short — formed as a political party committee with an address in St. Petersburg Fla.

The group’s statement of organization filed with federal campaign finance regulators lists it as the brainchild of St. Petersburg health insurance broker Brian Dow Denver-area information technology worker Joe Faletra and Larry Glenn of Reynoldsburg Ohio who has a background as a treasurer.

They’ve also enlisted Wendy Robbins a Tampa-area public affairs professional to handle press requests.

In an interview Dow said he and Glenn served in the Marines together and Faletra is an old high school buddy he recently reconnected with online but they all found themselves thinking similarly about starting a new political venture.

Dow ticked off a list of party platform planks that sound much like what the GOP offers — lowering taxes balancing the budget restricting undocumented immigration — but said unlike the GOP this party will deliver.

“I’ve had an awful lot of people jumping up and down yelling at us ‘Don’t you know you’re going to take votes away from the Republican Party?’ And my answer to that is in the words of Trump ‘What have we got to lose?’” Dow said.

“The Patriot Party is a repudiation of the GOP for the central fact that they weren’t very supportive of the president they had the majority once upon a time over the last four years and they failed to do the things that need to be done for the American people.”

Still though Dow said he voted for Trump twice and likes the policies the former president pursued the idea to start this political party came before Trump mused he might start such a party. Dow doesn’t want Trump to be the party’s head honcho anyway because he’s too personally divisive.

The party hopes to start small by recruiting candidates to run for a few local positions and then hopefully branch into a meaningful political player he said.

GOP turbulence

These kinds of nascent efforts are unlikely to strike fear into the hearts of the leaders of the Republican Party but there are other signs of dissatisfaction among Republicans in the wake of Trump’s exit from the White House.

That was reflected in a recent CBS/YouGov poll which found that 70% of Republicans would at least consider joining a Trump party.

GOP leaders have potentially more serious worries at the center-right of their party. Dozens of former officials including people who have served as White House and congressional staff met recently to discuss starting a breakaway political party to distance themselves from the Trump wing of the party according to Reuters.

In the meantime TAPPUS has some competition just an hour-and-a-half drive south along Florida’s Gulf Coast. There in Punta Gorda another former Marine Jim Davis founded the MAGA Patriot Party late last month although he listed the group’s headquarters in San Antonio Texas.

Davis a local government employee said he founded the party to “get the attention of the Republican Party that really we felt they weren’t representing us anymore.”

“Everybody had a lot of anger and we were trying to focus that anger into something more positive” Davis said in an interview. “We were kind of listening for what Trump potentially would do so when he mentioned he was considering the Patriot Party a lot of us are already considering it.”

Davis got a rude awakening though: When he filed with the Federal Election Commission to form his version of the party he didn’t really know what he was doing and accidentally formed a political action committee affiliated with Donald J. Trump For President the president’s official campaign arm.

The Trump campaign filed a statement with the FEC disavowing the Davis’ group not long after.

“At first we were disappointed” Davis conceded. “But I think in the end it was like ‘Well you know this is not about Trump anymore this is about the people.’ And so we don’t really care what Trump does as far as what his plans are we’re going to continue with ours because we can’t put all of our hope on one person.”

Despite the hiccup Davis said he’s retracted the political action committee and plans to refile properly soon as the Constitutional Patriot Party. He said he’s working with cohorts from Georgia all the way out to Colorado.

Georgia North Carolina patriots

Davis wasn’t the only Patriot Party founder to have made that exact filing error.

One state north in Grovetown Ga. Army veteran and firefighter Michael Gaul tried to create a political party but accidentally formed a political action committee he claimed to be affiliated with Trump.

He said in an interview that happened because he simply didn’t know how to work the FEC website. A disavowal letter from Trump’s presidential campaign came soon after.

No matter though. Gaul has filed to run for president himself as a standard bearer of the Patriot Party.

And that’s not where the run on Patriot Parties ends. In Mt. Gilead N.C. the Patriots Party was created in January by a man whose other claim to fame is owning a once-popular live action roleplaying game.

In Illinois the group du jour is the Patriots Party for USA.

That’s not to mention Donald Magyar who held the patent for “Patriot Party” from 2007 to 2017 and tried to renew it in January 2020 — only to be followed by several other attempts to trademark the phrase or something similar for use as a political party early this year.

The Patriot Party frenzy mostly began after Trump mused in January about starting a new party and suggesting it could be called the Patriot Party according to the Wall Street Journal.

Still it may have been much ado about nothing. Later that month Trump met at his Mar-a-Lago resort with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and the two men said in statements after the huddle that they discussed Trump helping Republicans win back seats in Congress in 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8xMy9tZWRpYS90ai1kdWNrbG8tcmVzaWducy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gE6aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMS8wMi8xMy9tZWRpYS90ai1kdWNrbG8tcmVzaWducw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,White House deputy press secretary resigns after threatening reporter over story about him,"CNN —

White House deputy press secretary TJ Ducklo who threatened a reporter who asked about his relationship with another reporter has resigned.

“We accepted the resignation of TJ Ducklo after a discussion with him this evening” said Jen Psaki the White House press secretary in a statement. “This conversation occurred with the support of the White House chief of staff.”

Ducklo released his own statement on Twitter saying in part “I know this was terrible. I know I can’t take it back. But I also know I can learn from it and do better.”

Ducklo was suspended Friday for one week without pay after Vanity Fair story published earlier that day a reporter from Politico was working on an article about his romantic relationship with a reporter from another news outlet.

Multiple White House officials described the situation as untenable because they did not feel a one-week suspension was sufficient. Another source familiar with the situation said no one expressed that sentiment directly to the leadership of the press and communications office. This person said Ducklo’s resignation was a result of a realization by the press and communications leadership that there needed to be a conversation with Ducklo about what was best for President Joe Biden and whether his remaining on the job represented the standard this administration tried to set.

Biden was made aware of the situation involving Ducklo late Saturday afternoon a White House official said and the President supports his decision to resign.

Psaki said Ducklo apologized to the reporter he threatened Politico’s Tara Palmeri over the incident. She had reported on Tuesday that Ducklo had been in a romantic relationship with Axios reporter Alexi McCammond.

Axios told Politico that McCammond “disclosed her relationship” with Ducklo in November and was “taken off the Biden beat.” But Palmeri pointed out that McCammond’s beat includes covering Vice President Kamala Harris and that she had commented glowingly on Biden after he was inaugurated.

The Vanity Fair story said that Ducklo had threatened Palmeri over her piece vowing he would “destroy her” if she published it. Ducklo according to the story also made misogynistic comments to Palmeri and referenced Palmeri’s own personal life accusing her at one point of being “jealous” about his relationship with McCammond.

CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described where some White House officials shared their concerns about Ducklo’s suspension. A source said they did not share those concerns directly to the leadership of the press and communications office.

Generally speaking as a company grows institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely insiders often decrease their ownership over time. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership.

Downer EDI isn't enormous but it's not particularly small either. It has a market capitalization of AU$3.8b which means it would generally expect to see some institutions on the share registry. In the chart below we can see that institutions own shares in the company. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Downer EDI.

See our latest analysis for Downer EDI

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Downer EDI?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

We can see that Downer EDI does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Downer EDI's earnings history below. Of course the future is what really matters.

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Downer EDI. The company's largest shareholder is Fidelity International Ltd with ownership of 7.4%. The Vanguard Group Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.1% of common stock and Nikko Asset Management Co. Ltd. holds about 5.4% of the company stock.

A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Downer EDI

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business but the CEO will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Downer EDI Limited. Keep in mind that it's a big company and the insiders own AU$17m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is good to see board members owning shares but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

General Public Ownership

With a 41% ownership the general public have some degree of sway over Downer EDI. While this group can't necessarily call the shots it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Downer EDI better we need to consider many other factors. For example we've discovered 3 warning signs for Downer EDI (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.

Jon Mast CEO of the Manatee-Sarasota Building Industry Association said this year’s event will feature 86 single-family homes and nine communities. The three featured developments are Lakewood Ranch The Islands on Manatee River and North River Ranch.

Many of the area's top builders are participating including Neal Communities Taylor Morrison Meridian WCI/Lennar Medallion Stock Development John Cannon David Weekley M/I Homes DR Horton Pulte and Toll Brothers.

New this year is a custom home division featuring two distinctive homes and two entries in the remodelers’ category. A total of 46 subcontractors’ work will be on display. In all over 140 properties will be featured Mast said.

Model homes from Parrish to North Port and Englewood are open during the annual Parade of Homes event. Builders also compete for awards with judging occurring Feb. 20 after a Realtor preview on Feb. 17.

The winners will be announced at the parade’s socially distanced “Awards and Gala” event March 4 at the Hyatt Regency Sarasota. COVID-19 social distancing protocols mean that only about 150 people will be able to attend the gala compared to 380 in years past Mast said.

The popular parade is a self-guided tour of properties that extends through March 14. Most models in the Parade of Homes are open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday and from noon to 5 p.m. on Sunday. The MSBIA suggests calling the models to check on times. Model phone numbers are listed on the individual model pages in the Parade of Homes guide and on the Parade of Homes website.

Low interest rates and a seemingly endless supply of retiring baby boomers are fueling the housing market in Southwest Florida. Mast said a sellers’ market continues in the area and nationwide leading to an overwhelming demand for homes.

“Some builders are hitting the pause button on sales so the parade's hitting at an odd time because prices and materials continue to rise"" he said. ""It's a good time to be in the business whether you're a Realtor or a builder. But it's really a seller's market at this point because there's so many buyers that want to buy.”

Prices are up nationwide and in Southwest Florida. According to CoreLogic single-family home prices in the North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton Metropolitan Statistical Area increased 7.57% in November compared with November 2019. Prices were up 0.68% from October’s values.

The median sales price for a single-family home in Sarasota County surged 19% to $349695 up from $293750 in November 2019. The average sales price was $541339 up from $409733 in November 2019 a 32.1% increase.

Manatee County experienced more modest increases both in median and average sales prices in November. The median single-family sales price of $350500 was up 7.2% from $327000 a year ago.

Real estate analysts expect the trend to continue despite economic difficulties and unemployment caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Two of the area’s communities made a national best-sellers list and the Sarasota area continues to garner attention as a top retirement destination.

Lakewood Ranch in Manatee and Sarasota counties and Wellen Park in North Port were ranked No. 2 and No. 4 respectively on John Burns Real Estate Consulting and the RCLCO lists of the 50 top-selling master-planned communities in the country.

Lakewood Ranch ranked second in the nation with 2149 home sales in 2020 up 30% from the 1648 sold in 2019. The 33000-acre community features miles of trails and paths parks offering a disc golf course watercraft launches and dog parks along with nationally recognized sports venues like the Premier Sports Campus and the Sarasota Polo Club.

Wellen Park formerly known as the West Villages ranked fourth just behind Summerlin in Las Vegas. Wellen Park recorded 1415 home sales in 2020 up 11% from 1273 sold in 2019.

Sarasota also was named the Best Place to Retire by U.S. News & World Report for 2020-21 and the 16th Best Place to Live.

Once they pass the squat test and have proven themselves comfortable enough to move in they also have to pass the no-show test. And thanks to sheer fabrics and panty lines that's a lot harder than it seems... unless you decide to nix the undies altogether. But is that a good idea? According to Jodie Horton MD an OB/GYN and chief wellness advisor for Love Wellness  it depends on the leggings.

""A warm wet environment after a sweaty workout can be a breeding ground for a vaginal infection by disrupting the normal bacteria of the vagina and causing an overgrowth of harmful bacteria (like bacterial vaginosis) and yeast"" explains Dr. Horton. She notes that some fabrics and styles encourage this sort of breeding ground than others. ""You want to choose materials that allow the vagina to breathe but keep moisture from pooling around your vulva and vagina which can make it a breeding ground for infections"" she says. With that in mind keep reading to find out which types of leggings are (and which ones are not) gyno-approved for underwear-free workouts.

The best leggings for working out commando

The cardinal rule of commando workouts? ""No matter what type of workout you're doing or how long you plan to work out it's always best to wear breathable moisture-wicking fabric with a cotton crotch to allow airflow to keep you cool and dry"" says Dr. Horton. As far as crotch-friendly styles go seamless leggings are likely your best bet since they'll ""prevent camel toe or constant rubbing of the seams against the labia leading to swelling and irritation"" she says. If you do want something with seams look for leggings with a cotton gusset which is a piece of crotch-reinforcing fabric that prevents leggings from riding up and improves their fit and comfort. Since cotton is naturally moisture-wicking this will help keep the area dry and well ventilated. Your other option says Dr. Horton is to choose a pair of leggings made from one of these breathable fabrics:

1. Polyester and nylon

""These are your best choices for keeping moisture away and keeping the vagina dry even during the sweatiest workouts"" says Dr. Horton. She prefers these materials to spandex since they can be just as stretchy with a whole lot more breathability. But it's worth noting that just because they're breathable enough to sweat in without underwear it doesn't mean you should sit around in them for hours post-workout. ""The downside is that synthetic fabric can hold on to fungus bacteria and odors"" says Dr. Horton. ""So make sure you wash your workout clothes after each workout.""

2. Bamboo

Bamboo is another one of Dr. Horton's favorite fabrics and though it's slightly pricier than some of the synthetic options it has the added benefit of being environmentally friendly. ""Bamboo is moisture-wicking odor-resistant temperature-regulating super-soft fabric"" she says. Shop a few of our favorite pairs here.

3. Silver

Look for leggings that have silver woven into the material. ""Silver is an antibacterial agent that helps reduce bacteria buildup and odor in performance fabrics decreasing the risk for infection"" says. Dr. Horton. Many popular brands such as Lululemon use silver in their styles to prevent any post-sweat funk.

4. Rayon

Rayon is a breathable fiber derived from natural cellulose/plant sources. ""In general these fabrics are soft strong absorbent and allow for good temperature control"" says Dr. Horton. Look out for words like Tencel or Lyocell on your labels to know you're on the right track.

Leggings you should *always* wear underwear with

Spandex may be the leggings world's MVP in terms of stretch and comfort but it's the LVP when it comes to keeping your bits dry during commando workouts. ""It isn't the most breathable fabric option or the best at wicking moisture"" says Dr. Horton.

In this case—and in any other case in which you do decide to wear underwear with leggings—she suggests layering on a pair of breathable underwear (emphasis on breathable) since the only thing worse than one sweaty fabric between your legs is two of them piled on top of each other. ""Workout leggings plus synthetic non-breathable underwear don't allow sweat to dry"" says Dr. Horton. ""It can potentially add another layer that can trap moisture."" Cotton is a great option but really any fabric that dries easily will do the trick.

In addition to choosing the right fabric for the underwear you're exercising in you'll also want to pay attention to their style. Dr. Horton suggests opting for bikinis hipsters or boy shorts which will give you full coverage and prevent irritation around your groin. ""You want to get something that hugs the body enough to stay in place without riding or bunching up"" says Dr. Horton adding that seamless styles can prevent chafing as you move. Just be sure to stay away from thongs. ""The friction and movement can cause bacteria from your anus to travel along the thong to your vagina and cause a vaginal or bladder infection"" says Dr. Horton. And of course whether or not you wear underwear when you work out is entirely up to you but now you're armed with the knowledge you need to make the best decision for your body.

The production of cement the binding element in concrete accounted for 7% of total global carbon dioxide emissions in 2018. Concrete is one of the most-used resources on Earth with an estimated 26 billion tons produced annually worldwide. That production isn’t expected to slow down for at least two more decades.

Given the scale of the industry and its greenhouse gas emissions technologies that can reinvent concrete could have profound impacts on climate change.

As engineers working on issues involving infrastructure and construction we have been designing the next generation of concrete technology that can reduce infrastructure’s carbon footprint and increase durability. That includes CO2-infused concrete that locks up the greenhouse gas and can be stronger and even bendable.

The industry is ripe for dramatic change particularly with the Biden administration promising to invest big in infrastructure projects and cut U.S. emissions at the same time. However to put CO2 to work in concrete on a wide scale in a way that drastically cuts emissions all of its related emissions must be taken into account.

Rethinking concrete

Concrete is made up of aggregate materials – primarily rocks and sand – along with cement and water.

Because about 80% of concrete’s carbon footprint comes from cement researchers have been working to find substitute materials.

Industrial byproducts such as iron slag and coal fly ash are now frequently used to reduce the amount of cement needed. The resulting concrete can have significantly lower emissions because of that change. Alternative binders such as limestone calcined clay can also reduce cement use. One study found that using limestone and calcinated clay could reduce emissions by at least 20% while also cutting production costs.

Apart from developing blended cements researchers and companies are focusing on ways to use captured CO2 as an ingredient in the concrete itself locking it away and preventing it from entering the atmosphere. CO2 can be added in the form of aggregates – or injected during mixing. Carbonation curing also known as CO2 curing can also be used after concrete has been cast.

These processes turn CO2 from a gas to a mineral creating solid carbonates that may also improve the strength of concrete. That means structures may need less cement reducing the amount of related emissions. Companies such as CarbonCure and Solidia have developed technologies to use these processes for concrete poured at construction sites and in precast concrete such as cinder blocks and other construction materials.

At the University of Michigan we are working on composites that produce a bendable concrete material that allows thinner less brittle structures that require less steel reinforcement further reducing related carbon emissions. The material can be engineered to maximize the amount of CO2 it can store by using smaller particles that readily react with CO2 turning it to mineral.

The CO2-based bendable concrete can be used for general buildings water and energy infrastructure as well as transportation infrastructure. Bendable concrete was used in the 61-story Kitahama tower in Osaka Japan and roadway bridge slabs in Ypsilanti Michigan.

The challenge of lifecycle emissions

These cutting-edge technologies can start addressing concrete infrastructure’s carbon footprint but barriers still exist.

In a study published in 2021 three of us looked at the lifecycle emissions from infusing CO2 into concrete and found that estimates did not always account for emissions from CO2 capture transportation and use. With colleagues we came up with strategies for ensuring that carbon curing has a strong emissions benefit.

Overall we recommend developing a standard CO2 curing protocol. Lab experiments show that CO2 curing can improve concrete’s strength and durability but results vary with specific curing procedures and concrete mixes. Research can improve the conditions and the timing of steps in the curing process to increase concrete’s performance. Electricity use – the largest emissions source during curing – can also be reduced by streamlining the process and possibly by using waste heat.

Advanced concrete mixes bendable concrete in particular already begin to address these issues by increasing durability.

Merging infrastructure and climate policy

In 2020 a wide range of companies announced steps to reduce their emissions. However government investment and procurement policies are still needed to transform the construction industry.

Local governments are taking the first steps. “Low embodied carbon concrete” rules and projects to reduce the amount of cement in concrete have cropped up around the country including in Marin County California; Hastings-on-Hudson New York; and a sidewalk pilot in Portland Oregon.

In New York and New Jersey lawmakers have proposed state-level policies that would provide price discounts in the bidding process to proposals with the lowest emissions from concrete. These policies could serve as a blueprint for reducing carbon emissions from concrete production and other building materials.

Nationally the crumbling of federally managed infrastructure has been a steadily growing crisis. The Biden administration has tried to address those problems as well as climate change and create jobs through a strategic infrastructure program.

Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg declared in 2021 that there were “enormous opportunities for job creation equity and climate achievement when it comes to advancing America’s infrastructure.” Policies that elevate low-carbon concrete to a nationwide climate solution could follow.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As of 10:10 a.m. the vehicle was removed from the pond. One body that of an adult male has been recovered at the scene. Divers spend several hours searching the pond to confirm there were no other occupants in the vehicle at the time of the crash.

The driver has been identified as 22 year-old Luis Angel Alvarado Correa of Wimauma. He was driving a 2015 Toyota Camry westbound on State Road 580 when he lost control hit the curb and veered into the pond. The vehicle came to rest upside down in about 8 feet of water. There were no other occupants.

Tyvek is a water-repellent tear-resistant and paper-soft material developed by DuPont and is used widely in fields ranging from medical to construction. You’ve probably come across it most frequently by using a Tyvek mailing envelope or perhaps you’ve gone full Naomi Campbell and bought one of its PPE suits.

Regardless the material now finds itself dressing up as a Converse Chuck 70 Hi. On the lateral side you’ll find two kinds of Tyvek branding — one looking like the sheets that can be used for construction purposes and the other looking like its shipping boxes. The medial sports a red “cut here”-esque look alongside oversized Tyvek branding while the typical All Star roundel now appears washed-out and barely visible.

Other unique additions include a change to the sole unit looking as if the Tyvek box’s “tear here” strip runs the perimeter of the midsole. There’s a singular blue eyelet on either side of the shoe a blue leather heel stripe and a washed-out license plate on the rear of the heel.

The Converse Chuck 70 Hi DuPont Tyvek edition is available in limited quantities and can be purchased at stockists such as Sivasdescalzo now for €110 EUR (approx. $133 USD).

Dupont stinks of rugby',"ANTOINE DUPONT’S COACHES had a problem. The clearly talented youngster on their hands was fast becoming bored with the game and was considering a switch to football. Rugby was proving too easy. He needed something more.

Worried about the prospect of losing such a precocious talent they came up with a better idea. They plucked him out of the U8 grade and pitted him against the bigger faster U10s. No joy. Dupont was still a level above to the point where new rules requiring a minimum number of passes had to be introduced in order to stop him just running the length of the pitch anytime he got on the ball.

Franco Smith’s Italy could have done with a similar intervention last weekend. In Rome Dupont was at his scintillating best with a try and four assists before being replaced midway through the second half. The TV cameras focused in on him as he slouched into his seat on the sideline. Arms folded feet up not a care in the world. Another game where he made it all look so easy.

You know you are doing something right when Aaron Smith is taking notes. France fullback Brice Dulin says the team have had to adapt to him as “he is one step ahead of us.” Prop Cyril Baille calls him ‘The Martian’ because “he comes from another planet.”

This is the man Ireland need to try shackle in Dublin tomorrow.

@Dupont9A this guy is on another level! No one is near him atm. He’s the point of difference for both his Club and country. He’s helping me look at parts of my game to improve #Respect #9Gang — Aaron Smith (@Te_Nug) February 10 2021

At just 24 Antoine ‘Toto’ Dupont is still in the infancy of his Test career following a steady rise through the French rugby ranks. Growing up in the small town of Castelnau-Magnoac at the foot of the Pyrenees Dupont was barely the size of a rugby ball when he took up the sport at the age of just four and became a regular sight playing outside the family hotel with his favourite toy.

Family and friends sensed he was gifted enough to pursue sport as a career. At the age of 14 he was playing 40 kilometres away from his home town at Auch before earning his first big break in 2014. He was picked up by Castres the 2013 Top14 champions and it was here where Dupont really began to catch the eye.

Former Scotland backrow Johnnie Beattie was part of that Castres team and says the player he first encountered as a teenager was remarkably similar to the one now ripping it up on the world stage.

“He was explosive dynamic could step off both feet could bump could fend could chuck big French forwards out of the way” says Beattie who still lives in the south-west of France where he co-hosts Le French Rugby podcast.

“Physically he was a complete monster for a 5’8″ kid. I mean you see how he is on the field now he has not changed at all.

Former Scotland international Johnnie Beattie played alongside a young Antoine Dupont at Castres. James Crombie / INPHO James Crombie / INPHO / INPHO

“Then mentally lovely guy smart a real family down-to-earth normal bloke. He’s just a really really good egg. Not afraid to take the mickey out of others you get quite a lot of boys who come in from the Academy that are shy but he was confident enough in himself that he would rip into people that had been at the club 1012 14 years and give as much as he got.”

The path to the starting team wasn’t easy with France scrum-half Rory Kockott in his way but Dupont soon began to make his mark. He came off the bench to earn a European Cup debut at the age of 17 against Leinster – the first of many battles with the Irish provinces – and before long was helping Kockott manage the gruelling slog of Top14 rugby. If needed in true French style he could effortlessly switch to out-half and prove just as effective.

“Even early on it was very very clear that he was going to be special” Beattie continues.

“I remember in his first couple of games he sat down Julien Dupuy a French legend in the Top14 he sat him on his backside. Then in his third or fourth start in the Top14 he played at 10 for us. In France they say; “il pue le rugby” which means he stinks of rugby and that was very much the case even as a young guy coming through which at the time was rare because there was so much emphasis placed on foreign talent which is changing now.”

Dupont became a mainstay of the Castres team until to some surprise he left for pastures new in 2017. He was viewed as a particularly exciting signing in a neat summer’s work by Toulouse which also saw All Black prop Charlie Faumuina and South Africa’s Cheslin Kolbe join the club. Two seasons later the club were Top14 champions for the first time in seven years.

The move to Toulouse coincided with his next steps as an international player. He had impressed at underage level with France but faced a senior team chock full of scrum-halves. He made his Six Nations debut at the age of 20 in 2017 and won his first French starts against New Zealand and South Africa at the Stade de France later that year. It would be over a year before he would wear the France No 9 again with his four caps in 2018 all coming from the bench replacing Maxime Machenaud Baptiste Serin and Morgan Parra.

Dupont had shown glimpses of his potential but continued to work hard behind the scenes polishing up the less glamorous sides of his game. By the end of the 2019 Six Nations he had established himself as France’s first-choice scrum-half and hasn’t looked back. Of his last 17 caps 16 have been starts.

Central to that is the license he has been given to play as part of the overhaul of the French team. At 24 he is already emerging as one of the leaders in Fabien Galthié’s youthful exciting side and has captained Toulouse.

“You can see now his decision making his kicking his leadership and his defensive stuff which wasn’t even a point of his game at 18 or 19 but the learning curve that he has gone on to add layers to his game has been outstanding” Beattie says.

“The defensive work that led up to tries against Italy like him shutting down a four-on-two on the outside channel forcing an error a dominant tackle on an outside back then obviously the genius to finish it off with the skillset and the offload. But it’s all those little bits that he has added on over time that are even more impressive. Clearly he was going to be wonderful to a certain level but the depths he’s gone to with the nuts and bolts he’s added has taken him to another level completely.”

Last year Dupont was named Six Nations Player of the Tournament receiving almost half of the final votes. One week in to the current championship he’s already the man to beat again. That’s why his name has never strayed too far from the conversation this week.

It is too simplistic to say that stopping Dupont stops France but it’s certainly a good place to start.

“When you’ve got a nine like Dupont if you can prevent the opposition getting that quick ball prevent the offloads take away the options in the way they want to attack speed of ball then someone like Dupont becomes less effective” says Ireland defence coach Simon Easterby who only has to look as far back as their most recent Six Nations meeting in October to be reminded of the damage he can do.

“Dupont is world class he makes France tick. They have got a number of very very very good players in their ranks as well so we also have to really focus on what we can prevent on the day but I think it is a team thing it is a collective thing that allows us to negate France’s threat.

“If we focus on him only then we offer space and opportunity to other players to get a strike on but there is a combination of things that will allow him to not get the free run that he might get on other games from those playing against him.”

That ‘team effort’ element of defending Dupont will be crucial.

“As a team we will be looking at what we can do – that we are making sure that we are well set around the ruck good spacing and that we are keeping an eye on him” says Ireland flanker Josh van der Flier.

“I have played him maybe seven times now. I know what he can do. He is a world-class player. He is one of those players you have to be very very aware of especially around the ruck. But then you see him running those support lines you have to be very aware of him away from the ball as well.”

Wing James Lowe unsurprisingly is also a fan.

“Dupont is a common theme into everything that goes well with this French side” says Lowe. “He’s an amazing player. To me the world’s best player at the moment… He’s the key man and someone that we have to try to limit his damage. He’s the one we’re going for.”

A nightmare to defend but one presumes a joy to play with?

“Phenomenal” says Beattie.

“The amount of games that he won single-handedly for us at Castres by producing a piece of magic. Players like that are gems. They are absolutely rare. Antoine is now clearly one of the best in the world if not the best in the world.

“But I think there’s also a lot to be said about the way that Toulouse have changed and their structures under Ugo Mola and also the French side who have been perennial underachievers for a decade. Now they’ve actually got a proper coaching staff they defend properly there are turnovers to be had there’s unstructured broken up play that appears and Antoine is one of maybe seven or eight game-breakers that they can call upon.

“If something is seen and there is a gap they are gone. Which in the past wasn’t the case because as a team they weren’t performing or doing all the sort of off the ball work-hard bits that other teams were doing which meant that even though they had supremely talented athletes when they came together and there was 15 of them on the pitch they were average.

“Now they press hard they turn over ball there is space all over the pitch and when you’ve got Teddy Thomas Antoine Dupont Gabin Villière and they get half a step of space they’re gone.

“So for Antoine I think it’s exciting to be part of a team (that plays that way). The timing is perfect for him and this generation because it’s the first time they’ve had a proper entourage and a proper coaching staff around them that allows them to flourish.

“The French rugby public over here are absolutely delighted to see them back at a decent level and it’s fantastic for the tournament and for French rugby in general.”

Antoine Dupont the French halfback is racking up highlights for fun and for the past year it seems defensive patterns at both club and country have not found a way to deal with him.

We should first acknowledge that France use their halfbacks in a different way to the rest of the world.

The concept of ‘le petit general’ directing play off nine rather than ten has long been embedded in the way the French play the game. Indeed France coach Fabien Galthié played this very role as France tipped up the All Blacks at semi-final time in 1999 so Dupont is going to be given licence to run the game with greater authority than some of his recent predecessors and certainly more so than his current group of opponents.

If you took the number off Dupont’s back and watched his highlights you would have a hard time picking exactly what position he was playing. He certainly doesn’t play halfback in the way any of the southern hemisphere sides play the game.

He doesn’t go ruck to the ruck often leaving clearance from the base to whoever happens to be closest. He does have a pass off the ground but we rarely see it ripped out in anger pinning defenders while runners are put away outside. When he defends you are more likely to see him two or three channels wide sticking hits on than defending at the ruck itself.

Rather from the base of the scrum he plays super flat taking sideways steps looking for that lazy defender to beat or finding his ball runners who now run more at gaps than bodies and then run aggressive support lines. His starting position for moves is regularly from the ten or 12 spots.

Sports opinion delivered daily

In my initial viewing I thought he simply gambled well on halfback lines and was rewarded as such. But it is much more than that.

He does link really well with his loose forwards and his inside backs but the number of times he interchanges passes with his wingers is just extraordinary. This is down to sheer hard work and excellent leg speed.

He doesn’t look like a sprinter with that low centre of gravity that allows him to launch into tackles and bump defenders who don’t apply themselves correctly but he has some serious toe over 20 or 30 metres.

He runs the support lines of a halfback an inside back and a loose forward dependent on his starting position.

This clip is three minutes long but well worth your attention. It is the diversity of outcomes I found most impressive.

Among the plethora of videos on Dupont this is the one that best represents his overall game. There are not a lot of highlights from traditional halfback passing but those support lines are impressive.

While he is a creative genius in his own right he is also benefiting from the explosion in attacking intent from the French loose forwards. Galthié has the French loose forwards playing totally differently from all the other Six Nations loose forward trios.

Firstly they have reverted to the traditional role of the loose forward. They play with real attacking intent when they have the ball unlike other trios who have sadly become almost purely defensive units. They use Gregory Alldritt superbly as a ball carrier in space and they link and transition with their halves like we haven’t seen for some time.

Captain Charles Ollivon is a try-scoring menace while Alldritt – who was man of the match in all three of France’s home games in the 2020 Six Nations – carried 66 times for 400 metres in that tournament.

Top carrier CJ Stander led with 78 runs and did not register on the top metre eaters. The French are running at gaps like no other just in time for the faster game being promoted by World Rugby.

Ollivon and Alldritt have played 19 Tests each for a combined try total of 11. No one in the Six Nations is playing like this.

Dupont the loose forwards and the speed of the French back line have been a breath of fresh air for international rugby in the last 12 months. With some key players missing for Ireland this weekend the defensive organisation close to the ruck is likely to suffer. Enter the entertainers.

This weekend Ireland need to find a way to reduce the number of second touches that Dupont gets. This is where the danger comes. He creates space by running sideways and then follows his ball runners expertly.

Ireland will need to make sure they stick him with those first tackles and then make sure he is not getting off the ground fast enough to get that second touch. Watch for him being buried under ruck after ruck in the early stages.

It is easier said than done of course. You have to catch him first.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbGxzLmllL3J1Z2J5L2phbWVzLWxvd2UtaXJlbGFuZC10YXJnZXQtYW50b2luZS1kdXBvbnQtNDYxMTMy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Lowe Admits Ireland Will Target 'World's Best' Antoine Dupont,"If Ireland weren't already facing a major test against France their task has been all the more difficult by the absence of a number of key players. Johnny Sexton Conor Murray James Ryan and Peter O'Mahony are all unavailable.

On the other hand the French will be able to call on perhaps the world's most in-form player. Antoine Dupont was in incredible form during his nation's opening weekend victory over Italy producing a number of moments of magic.

The 24-year old is an incredible player one Ireland will have to limit the impact of if they are to get a win on Sunday.

Speaking ahead of the match in Dublin Ireland winger James Lowe admitted Andy Farrell's side would be attempting to limit Dupont's influence on proceedings.

Dupont is a common theme into everything that goes well with this French side. He's an amazing player. To me the world's best player at the moment. I saw that [New Zealand scrum-half] Aaron Smith actually just came out and said openly he's watching Dupont what's he's done for Toulouse and this French side. He's the key man and someone that we have to try to limit his damage. He's the one we're going for.

Ireland will need to secure a positive result in this game to have any chance of winning this year's Six Nations but the French will certainly fancy their chances of ending their ten-year winless run in Dublin.

SALISBURY — Sitting in his office on West Innes Street Conrad Eaton is surrounded by sheds.

That’s how it’s been for most of his life.

When he was just 14 years old he started working alongside his younger brother Merritt at their father’s shed and storage business hammering together huts and tearing shingles off roofs. Growing up in a Mennonite-Baptist household Conrad’s days were structured. He didn’t watch TV or play video games. Even if his parents had allowed it there wouldn’t have been much time.

“I would go to work all day and come home and do school at night and then have chores on top of that” Conrad said. “We were always very busy.”

Conrad continued to work for his father’s company Liberty Storage Solutions until he was 29. That’s when he decided to step out on his own and build his own shed business.

“When I initially told my dad he was taken back because it was hard for him” Conrad said. “I used to work in his business. So I went from being involved in his business to actually being a competitor.”

Conrad’s father Bobby Eaton soon came to terms with the move and has been supportive of his son’s venture which is named in part to honor him.

“The reason I named my business Legacy Shed Company is to build a legacy in our community a legacy of hard work and dedication as well as of integrity and quality” Conrad said. “Also to continue my dad’s legacy. My dad has always been a hard worker.”

Bobby always taught Conrad and Merritt along with their six other siblings how to grow a business which is what Conrad has been doing since he opened Legacy Shed Company in late 2019.

After starting with just a few employees Conrad has grown his team to around 30 people. In 2020 Legacy surpassed $2 million in sales and was building $150000 worth in units per week as the demand for sheds skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company now sells and delivers sheds in North and South Carolina Georgia and even Alabama.

“Shed sales have shot through the roof” Conrad said. “Across the industry we’ve seen record sales. Basically factories are unable to keep up. Last year we were as far as eight weeks behind on orders. It’s a rapidly growing industry.”

The shed business has been expanding for years Conrad said but the recent growth has been spurred mainly by the COVID-19 pandemic.

“A lot of people have been forced to be at home. Now they’re cleaning out their garage and doing garden work and doing the ‘daddy do’ lists and finally getting stuff done” Conrad said. “And then of course you have people buying them as little office spaces because now people have to work from home. They’re no longer going into their business so they buy a little building and finish it out not as living quarters but as a little man cave or to get out of the house and do office work quietly and alone away from the kids.”

The high demand for sheds has allowed Conrad’s company to expand while competing against both his father’s business and the company started by his brother Merritt called Heritage Shed Company and also located in Salisbury.

“We’re all actually competitors but we get along great” Conrad said. “There’s more than enough to go around. It’s an interesting family dynamic because we’re all competitive but in a good way. We don’t avoid talking about business when we’re all together no matter what we do. It’s always a good thing to be like that to where we aren’t fighting each other.”

The Eatons aren’t just competing with family. There are dozens of shed companies in and around Rowan County that are taking advantage of the shed boom including Sheds by Design.

Started by Silas Bowling in late 2018 Sheds by Design is a small family-owned operation located in Cleveland. Bowling learned how to build sheds originally while working for Liberty Storage Solutions and before eventually his own business.

The first six months of owning his own shed company were difficult Bowling said. Now that the industry is booming so is his business.

Bowling said he prides himself on being able to build and deliver custom sheds quickly which has been more difficult as of late due to supply chain issues and sky-high material prices driven up by the pandemic.

Although lumber prices have dropped from hitting a record settlement of $928.20 per 1000 board feet on Sept. 1 Bowling said that accessibility to lumber is still an issue.

“They say one of the biggest risks is not necessarily the price I’m paying for lumber but the lack of supply” Bowling said.

Those same issues have slowed progress in Conrad’s shed-building facility in Pickens South Carolina which is run by his business partner and cousin. The major dilemma for Legacy Conrad said is keeping shed prices affordable despite the high cost of lumber.

“It’s about still trying to be affordable as a company and profitable and having a good product” Conrad said. “It has been very very stressful.”

Conrad estimated that up to 90% of his sheds are purchased on rent-to-own payment plans while Bowling said that about 40% of his customers are on rental contracts.

Affordability and quality are the attributes that Conrad has tried to instill in his business which he said he models after a local Salisbury restaurant.

“Legacy is trying to be like Hap’s” Conrad said. “We’re trying to serve hotdogs and burgers and do a really good job to where people will line up out of the door for a good product. We don’t offer as many options as far as fancy goes but we offer a superior quality and we’re trying to stay in our lane as far as what we offer.”

Like Hap’s Grill Conrad hopes that the shed boom continues and that customers will continue to line up for years to come.

Musical productions are social shows; friendly and grand productions featuring full-cast numbers with intricate choreography and supported by a rousing orchestra. But this year Greeley Central’s production is more introverted because of COVID-19.

The students many of whom are good friends with a deep interest in theater and the performing arts sign in when they arrive for rehearsals so show leaders can chart attendance in case contact tracing is needed. The young performers wear masks and keep their distance while waiting for their turn on stage during rehearsals. They use hand sanitizer frequently and take breaks to wash their hands.

Since late January the Greeley Central cast and crew has been preparing to perform “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” a COVID-19 friendly production scheduled to run in mid-April. Released in 2005 the spelling bee musical is the story of several socially awkward youngsters finding joy heartache and purpose in competing in the regional spelling bee according to a synopsis on www.playbill.com.

“My freshman-year me would have never imagined doing our senior year show this way” said Mascarenas who has a lead in the role Miss Rona Lisa Peretti former spelling bee champion turned moderator. “It’s better than nothing. Since freshman year it’s where I see my friends and the thought of not having that for my senior year would’ve been heartbreaking. We can’t have all of the fun we used to have.”

Greeley Central is planning six live performances April 14-17. But even as rehearsals are well underway the future of Central’s production remains uncertain. The pandemic closed last year’s musical weeks before opening night.

In scholastic performing arts this year COVID-19 is the conductor director and choreographer of productions from musicals and plays to band and choral concerts. Students and staff involved with local high school shows which are integral components of the school experience similar to athletics want nothing more than to be seen live in a traditional format.

Yet they understand they perform at the mercy of a virus and the shows won’t look as they have in the past.

“I think the word performing is in performing arts for a reason” Eaton High School band director Logan Doddridge said. “We can’t have performances as we normally do and that is taking the heart out of the arts and we’ve re-invented ourselves. We’re fighting and doing everything we can to have a performance. I think artists around the world and musicians are struggling and I guess that lights the fire even more.”

A COVID FRIENDLY SHOW

Mascarenas and fellow senior Armando Flores Montenegro are grateful to have Putnam County this year for all of the changes from the norm. As recently as late in the first semester they didn’t know if they’d get another chance to perform in a musical at Central.

They were in the cast of last year’s production of the comedy “Something Rotten” before spring activities were shut down. The disappointment surrounding the cancellation had an extra layer for the Central students. The school was one of two high schools nationwide to earn the amateur rights to perform the show.

The 17-year-old Flores Montenegro who shares the role of William Barfee in Putnam County said the experience this year has been stressful at times given the limitations and needed protocols. But he said he expects the production to be “a good compromise” rather than enduring another year without a musical production.

“I want to show Central is putting on some sort of arts and not succumbing to what the virus is forcing us to do” Flores Montenegro said. “This feels like we can do this and be safe.”

Safety was key in the minds of director Brian Humphrey and choreographer and arts magnet coordinator Christy O’Connell-Black in figuring out how to put on a musical in a pandemic.

Greeley-Evans School District 6 Assistant Superintendent of Secondary Schools Anthony Asmus said the district remains “cautious but extremely excited” with the improvement of state and county data surrounding the spread of COVID-19. Earlier this month Weld County moved to a more open yellow status on the state’s COVID-19 dial. The effect then on shows such as “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” could be significant.

Asmus said there was a concern among district officials about the fate of performing arts events when the county remained on red status earlier this year. Given the improvement Asmus said at this point the district will allow two parents per student performing to attend the shows which is not an option the district has had since the start of the school year.

Students in drama choir and band must continue to follow the guidelines of 6-feet on social distancing.

“It is important to District 6 to try as best we can to be as safe as we can be to provide opportunities for our students to feel part of the school culture” Asmus said. “It would be easy to shut everything down. We want to keep as much of the student experience as normal as possible during the pandemic.”

“The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” allows the Greeley Central performers to maintain a sense of normality. O’Connell-Black said the show features only nine roles. About 30 Central students auditioned and 20 were cast to allow for more participation while adhering to safety protocols. And because the show is about a spelling bee students have to step forward and away from other performers to sing or speak their parts.

The one-act show requires minimal choreography and “zero touching” O’Connell-Black said with a running time of about 90 minutes.

“It was the COVID-friendliest show we could come up with” she said adding the show also lends a right tone for the times. “We wanted something light and comedic.”

THE BANDS PLAYS ON

After winning a state championship in 2019 the Eaton High School Marching Band was out of competition for the majority of the fall 2020 season.

Director Logan Doddridge who has overseen a growth spurt in the band program since his arrival nearly eight years ago wanted to maintain the momentum from the state victory. Eaton gathered with a couple other Weld County bands to create competitions.

With planning the Eaton marching band played on through the fall as the school’s football team won a state title. Doddridge said he and the students also wanted a normal season and they worked hard to create guidelines and follow them.

The Eaton concert and jazz bands also continue with adjustments. The robust Eaton band program has five bands: two concert bands two jazz bands and a marching band. The jazz and concert bands are preparing for concerts in late February and early March.

“The main word is distance” Doddridge said. “We’ll do everything we can to keep it alive. The main priority is to keep everyone safe.”

Doddridge said band parents made masks for the musicians to use when they play inside. Bell covers are used on the brass and woodwind instruments — such as the clarinets saxophones trumpets trombones French horns and tubas — to prevent the spread of airborne droplets but with minimal effect on the collective sound.

“The kids have gotten used to playing with them and now they sound great” Doddridge said.

At times bands use the high school gymnasium to rehearse in a bigger space. When practicing in the band room the area is rearranged as necessary to allow and create social distancing Doddridge said.

The musicians also practice outside as the weather permits including the concert and jazz bands. The winter concert in December was an online virtual event.

“We’ve had to kind of reinvent what a concert is” Doddridge said. “We’ve had to reinvent that and go outside. The challenges there are to get the right audio equipment and to have the kids be comfortable outside” in an less familiar environment for some of the musicians.

GREELEY WEST GOING DIGITAL

Instead of staging a musical production this year Greeley West will try a different approach. Theater teacher and director of theater Peggy Freemole and her students are going with an all-digital production.

The school will perform “A Killer Party” a digital murder mystery created during the pandemic for the unusual times. The show has 20 student actors with eight leads and a full ensemble.

“They’re learning something new and we’re making it work” Freemole said of the students. “It’s difficult. It’s been a difficult time for them.”

For “A Killer Party” the student performers are recording their parts and the show will be mixed and edited with the goal of an April release date. But given the unfamiliarity of the digital process Freemole said she does not know how the show will be released. Freemole suggested they might attempt to host viewing parties and maybe outside depending on COVID-19 restrictions.

Freemole and the students are receiving assistance from high school choir teacher Angela Slaughter orchestra director Thomas Nugent and band director Chet Arthur. She said Slaughter worked with students outside on singing and Nugent led an orchestra recording music from the show. Slaughter and Nugent are pitching in to help Freemole on the technical elements of gathering and assembling the vocal and instrumental components.

“We’re all working together” Freemole added. “With this musical a lot of it is technology that is new to me. They (Slaughter and Nugent) are running with that.”

Like at Greeley Central the Greeley West students didn’t get a chance to put on their spring musical in 2020. They also lost out on a fall play.

The school planned a “large-scale production” of the musical “Matilda” Freemole said. Costumes were completed for “Matilda” and sets remained on stage as of earlier this year.

Freemole arrived at Greeley West in 1988 and has annually been involved with the production of at least two shows a year — a fall play and a musical. A group of 15 theater students also missed the chance on a trip to Edinburgh Scotland in August. They were going to perform a musical review at The Edinbugh Festival Fringe which is touted as the world’s largest arts festival.

“I feel sorry for the kids” Freemole said of the performing arts students. “I have such an incredibly talented senior class and it’s crazy. We’re good. We’re OK but they’re fully aware of what they lost.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2NhbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vaW5kaWEva2FybmF0YWthL2hhbC1haW1zLXRvLWRyaXZlLXVwLWluZGlnZW5pc2VkLWNvbnRlbnQtb2YtbGNhLXRlamFzLTk1MTIzOS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HAL aims to drive up indigenised content of LCA Tejas,"""Even when we talk about LCA and for that matter our rotary wings the LUH and LCH there are many items we still have to get from outside because off-the-shelf I am not getting those items in India.

But the once-happy couple has been breaking up for years — and on Valentine’s Day some sellers may no longer be able to sell items on eBay at all without connecting an old-school bank account instead.

This morning I received a final warning that I would need to add a bank account by February 14th or else “your ability to revise or relist existing listings or create new listings will be disabled.”

eBay tells The Verge this isn’t the deadline for every seller — it’s rolling out in phases and a quick scan of the web shows it’s been going on for at least a couple years. This isn’t the final phase either as eBay tells us the rollout won’t be complete until 2022. But I suspect it’s moving fast: I got this message despite rarely ever selling items on eBay and company tells me the “majority of sellers” will have eBay-managed payments by the end of this year.

Digging up a bank account and plugging it into your profile may not be the only annoyance here by the way. You could be waiting a lot longer for your money as eBay’s managed payments site points out:

Three to six business days is a long time to theoretically wait for money that could have instantly popped into your PayPal. (That said my last eBay sale didn’t immediately release my funds to PayPal either. Shrug emoji.)

On the plus side eBay says most sellers should actually pay lower fees than before and provides a variety of case studies at this page — but it’s not like eBay’s really passing along the savings. Previously eBay would typically take a 10 percent cut and PayPal would take a 2.9 percent cut for a total of 12.9 percent of your take; now eBay will take a 12.35 percent cut in the same situations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzIvZWJheS1hdXRoZW50aXF1ZS1uZXctc25lYWtlci1zY2VudGVkLWNhbmRsZS11bmJveGluZy1mcmVzaC1zaG9lcy12YWxlbnRpbmVzLWRhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,eBay's Authentique Candle Smells Like New Sneakers,"Didn’t get your other half a brand new pair of kicks for Valentine’s Day? Well there’s no need to worry as eBay has announced the launch of its new scented candle Authentique.

With scents of warm pebbled leather glue EVA foam and an accenting touch of cotton blossom Authentique is designed to smell just like a brand new pair of box-fresh sneakers. That smell you get from unboxing a new pair of shoes can now fill your home with its intoxicatingly bad-but-good aroma enticing the thrill of getting your hands on a new pair.

The small-batch production of candles means that this is a truly limited piece of eBay memorabilia coming packaged in a sneaker box inspired design and sporting a label that’s reminiscent of a shoe box’s label. On the tag you’ll find information such as its 35-hour burn time and net weight of 220g.

Alongside the launch of its Authentique candle eBay has expanded its Authenticity Guarantee offering to all new Nike and adidas sneakers worth $100 USD or more. The eBay Authentique candle is dropping on a dedicated website this Valentine’s Day and costs $25 USD.

Our generation prefers online shopping for sold out rare pieces any day over waiting for the traditional in-store seasonal collection sales. This has allowed us more freedom and accessibility as a not only a buyer but also as a seller. In fact resale culture has become an entity of its own which operates on an extremely fast-paced basis. Let’s be real not many of us are looking to buy life-long investment pieces anymore. Instead we’re all interested in a circular economy where an item is bought for a short amount of time to then be re-sold to someone else. Out with old and in with the new. So we have rounded six of the best sites to shop that sold-out piece you’ve been obsessing over.

1-eBay

Though eBay may not immediately make you think of high fashion and streetwear it is still an essential destination for all fashion fanatics. Acting as a founding father for all resale websites eBay holds some of the best hidden gems. Though there is quite a bit of filtering to be done to determine fakes from reals as of last year eBay has launched a sneaker authentication program. The way it works is quite simple. As a seller you can ship your sneakers to a third party authentication expert who will rigorously check your shoes. Once they’ve been approved the shoes will receive an official eBay hashtag ensuring its authenticity to any potential buyer. So from certified YEEZY listings to vintage Margiela jackets you can find anything on eBay with the right key terms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMTMvaG93LXRvLXVzZS1kcm9wc2hpcHBpbmctd2l0aC1hbWF6b24tYW5kLWViYXkuaHRtbNIBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzAyLzEzL2hvdy10by11c2UtZHJvcHNoaXBwaW5nLXdpdGgtYW1hem9uLWFuZC1lYmF5Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dropshipping: How to use Amazon and eBay to become your own boss,"Maybe you've seen videos circulating online of people who have quit their corporate jobs to pursue a dream of entrepreneurial success. One of the most popular forms nowadays revolves around a concept in e-commerce known as dropshipping.

Dropshipping is a business model that allows entrepreneurs to sell products to their customers without ever having to stock inventory themselves. In this growing niche the retailer is a middleman between buyer and supplier.

There are many advantages to this method. According to a dropshipping explainer from e-commerce company Shopify  the model allows entrepreneurs to take more risks on products. Because there is no overhead for storing the product retailers can experiment with different products and product lines. Retailers are also not tied to a physical location meaning they can sell products to any market in the world so long as they can find a supplier who can ship to that market.

However there are also several pitfalls. The barrier to entry is quite low meaning that anyone with enough money saved up can enter the market increasing competition and making it harder to stand out. The margins are also low. Because the retailer does not store nor own the product they have to pay the third party collecting a fraction of the selling price.

Tom Cormier or eCom Tom as he is known is the co-founder of Dropshipping University. Cormier who graduated with a degree in chemical engineering in 2016 was looking for a way to earn some extra money along with his paycheck. ""I was like I want some money on the side. And I think I always just had the idea that I never wanted to work full time for a job ever.""

Cormier's journey into dropshipping started with re-selling old video games and eventually lead to reselling cell phones — until an exchange went south and Cormier was robbed. The experience made Tom reconsider how he would earn extra money.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb21tZXJjZWJ5dGVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzEzL3NlbGxlcnMtY2hvaWNlLWF3YXJkcy0yMDIxLW1lcmNoYW50cy1yYXRlLXRvcC1vbmxpbmUtbWFya2V0cGxhY2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sellers Choice Awards 2021: Merchants Rate Top Online Marketplaces,"Welcome to the 12th annual EcommerceBytes Sellers Choice Awards. Each year we invite sellers to rate and review the marketplaces on which they sell and they use the opportunity to tell companies (and each other) what’s working and what isn’t.

As in past years we let readers nominate their top choices and then opened up the voting to the top 10 nominated venues.

Readers rated the finalists in four key areas – profitability customer service communication and ease of use. Respondents were also asked how likely they were to recommend each marketplace as a selling venue to a friend or colleague.

As they do every year sellers pointed to specific policies and practices that affected them.

There was great diversity of sellers responding. Some were newbies or low-volume; others noted they were longtime pros. Some were artisans and some used fulfillment services.

The Results



eBay again topped the list this year overall followed by Bonanza and Ruby Lane. The rankings take into account four key criteria – profitability customer service communication and ease of use.

Coming in fourth place was Etsy followed by Mercari and Poshmark. Amazon narrowly squeaked ahead of eCrater with Craigslist and Facebook coming in ninth and tenth place respectively.

eBay took the top spot for Profitability again this year and it also placed first in Ease of use. Bonanza took top spots for Customer Service and Communication and it also was the top most recommended marketplace.

With more people shopping online due to the coronavirus ecommerce should have been the rising tide that lifted all boats in 2020. But there were fewer outright mentions of the effects of COVID-19 than we had expected.

Some sellers noted that they had benefitted from extra traffic to marketplaces but it also left them vulnerable to claims of late delivery especially during the holiday shopping period when some marketplaces decided the fate of Item Not Received claims. Despite getting packages into the mail on time it was the seller not the carrier that ended up taking losses when items weren’t delivered on time some sellers said.

The top nominated venues were diverse from traditional marketplaces like eBay and Amazon; to niche sites; to classifieds site Craigslist; to social platforms like Facebook. Some of the finalists were large publicly traded companies; others were tiny versions.

In reading through sellers reviews we picked up on three attitudes towards marketplaces. First there were the venues where sellers could list with little investment in time or money and what sales they got were quite satisfactory. Those were the “it is what it is” venues.

Then there were the “mega platforms” where some sellers were quite satisfied due to the volume of sales but others bristled due to a feeling that the companies had stacked the deck against the sellers. It went beyond the typical complaints of “nickle-and-diming” fees to practices such as charging a commission fee on shipping and sales tax which sellers felt were wrong.

And then there were marketplaces where sellers felt at home and enjoyed selling but yearned for more traffic and sales. Those venues offered autonomy or an attractive fee structure and sellers urged those venues to advertise more to fulfill their potential.

You can read more about these issues in the individual findings for each marketplace. Next up – rankings and how they break down.

How It Breaks Down – Profitability

We asked sellers “How would you rate your profitability as a seller on (marketplace name)?” eBay topped the list for Profitability followed by Etsy Mercari Craigslist and Facebook.

How It Breaks Down – Customer Service

We asked sellers “How would you rate the customer service (marketplace name) provides to sellers?” Bonanza topped the list for Customer Service followed by Ruby Lane eBay Etsy and Poshmark.

How It Breaks Down – Communication

We asked sellers “How would you rate (marketplace name)’s communication with you as a seller?” Bonanza topped the list for Communication followed by Ruby Lane eBay Poshmark and Etsy.

How It Breaks Down – Ease of Use

We asked sellers “How would you rate (marketplace name)’s ease of use as a seller?” eBay topped the list for Ease of Use followed by Bonanza Etsy Mercari and Craigslist.

How It Breaks Down – Recommended Selling Venue

We asked sellers “How likely are you to recommend (marketplace name) as a Selling venue to a friend or colleague? Bonanza scored highest on Recommended Selling Venue followed by Mercari Etsy eBay and Ruby Lane.

From left: pianist Gloria Chien violist Milena Pajaro-van de Stadt and clarinetist Anthony McGill. Read more

When the pandemic forced the closure of arts venues everywhere the Philadelphia Chamber Music Society (PCMS) reacted as some others did continuing to perform and setting concerts aloft on the digital wind.

The move to online though brought something unexpected to PCMS one of the nation’s busiest presenters of string quartets and piano recitalists: a new and viable business model.

Advertisement

It’s early days for online listenership and donations but in the first few months of operations PCMS’s digital enterprise has racked up some eye-popping numbers.

Viewership for the season’s first 13 events has averaged 3200 per concert. For an in-the-flesh sell-out about 350 listeners turn up to hear works of Schubert or Vivian Fung in the American Philosophical Society’s Benjamin Franklin Hall just a few steps from Independence Hall.

PCMS’s online concerts have drawn a strong local following with 63% of viewers from Pennsylvania and New Jersey. But about 20% of the audience has come from outside the United States including Canada Mexico the U.K. Germany India Israel and Japan.

Not everyone is tuning in from beginning to end. Average viewing time is just 18 minutes for the hour-plus concerts.

There’s one metric however that stands out as a marker of success. PCMS’s virtual concerts are technically free of charge but the pay-as-you-wish donation model has drawn real money — an average of $7500 in donations per concert.

This sum is at roughly equal to the paid ticket revenue PCMS typically collected pre-pandemic at APS for a concert by a popular artist.

“I guess I would say I am pleasantly surprised. We really had no idea how it would all pan out” says Philip Maneval PCMS’s executive director. “Our initial motivation was to try to put musicians back to work. They are struggling as never before. Many of them have been without almost any income since last March.”

So robust have donations been that “the concerts really are paying for themselves” he says.

One viewer from California new to PCMS has sent in four gifts since online concerts began. They total $5500.

This success like any other since the pandemic’s arrival must be considered a Pyrrhic victory. It was nearly a year ago that artists were suddenly idled and projects stopped cold. Survival of Philadelphia’s institutions is hardly certain. And when arts groups including PCMS return to full operations no one should forget that some familiar faces in the audience will be missing.

Still the pandemic has forced creativity and innovation. PCMS’s COVID-era concerts at APS have hosted off and on a small live audience — up to 25. This past Wednesday afternoon Mozart rang in the hall. Clarinetist Anthony McGill violist Milena Pajaro-van de Stadt and pianist Gloria Chien could be heard rehearsing the Kegelstatt Trio for a performance with a socially distanced audience that night and the hall cleared of its normal crowd revealed a much more live acoustic.

Is there a way to renovate the hall to make this beautiful sound permanent? Let’s hope so. More immediately PCMS and APS are investing time and money in physical changes like more sophisticated cameras and lighting. The goal is a production approach and aesthetic true to PCMS fans who want a generally no-frills presentation with the focus squarely on the music.

McGill appears in another very different online approach in a Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center online show. Highly produced edited and art-directed it is more music video than pure concert film.

PCMS’s online model might not apply to other arts groups. Each organization has its own set of fixed costs union contracts and logistical hurdles that must be weighed against factors like the existence (or not) of an endowment and the depth of a donor list.

Most arts troupes though are adapting to digital life.

Opera Philadelphia has so far sold digital passes and rentals to more than 1500 households for its series of original-for-online operatic films. The Philadelphia Orchestra is selling between 1400 and 1500 tickets for its online concerts for $15 and $17 a pop — far cheaper than the ticket price for live concerts which often hover near or above $100 each in Verizon Hall (with 2500 seats).

“It’s orders of magnitude less than the revenue we derive from the live concert” says orchestra president and CEO Matías Tarnopolsky. At the same time “the expenses have not gone down commensurately.”

For all groups now philanthropy is critical.

Hello from Brazil

PCMS has taken its share of hits during the pandemic. COVID-related travel hurdles have forced the cancellation of some of the group’s most individualistic artists like pianist Imogen Cooper. But on the plus side PCMS has folded tech into the “society” part of its name by hosting chats on YouTube where listeners weigh in during the concert.

“People pop in to say hello from Brazil or other people ask serious questions about the repertoire like someone who wants to know how Dvorak is perceived in the U.S. because they are in Eastern Europe” says PCMS communications director Brian Potter. “Some people are expressing gratitude. It’s really across the board.”

Here Google Translate is sometimes of limited help. “Until recently he didn’t love the viola and then he loved it !!!” wrote one listener rather cryptically in Russian during Wednesday night’s YouTube chat as Brahms’ Viola Sonata in E Flat Major Op. 120 No. 2 was being played.

Entertaining though the banter may be PCMS says it’s important to reunite listeners with the in-person concert experience. Online the sound of the piano during Wednesday evening’s concert was fine but a shadow of what it had been earlier in the day at rehearsal heard live. The Hamburg Steinway bought just before the pandemic by PCMS and its sister organization the Marlboro Music Festival might be the most lovely keyboard in the city at the moment. Listeners deserve to hear it in full.

And then there is the intangible thrill of music unmediated by an electronic scrim. ”The first time I went back after not hearing a live performance for a while I had tears down my face” says Maneval. “The experience of hearing it live again with people around me it was such a beautiful thing.”

Although PCMS aims to continue online concerts in some capacity post-COVID-19 “we are doing all of this to supplement the core concept of chamber music which is to experience our concerts in person” says PCMS artistic director Miles Cohen.

The exhibition will feature the works of the renowned Nakkaş Osman one of the leading ‘nakkaş’ or miniaturists of the Ottoman Empire who was the chief miniaturist in the late 16th century. Osman's “Surname-i Hümayun” which are Imperial Festival Books created by artists to mark and depict in pictorial and textual detail imperial celebrations such as weddings and circumcision festivals will be displayed in the exhibition.

The exhibition will be held at Marmaray Yenikapı Station in Istanbul. It will welcome visitors until March 5 and will be free of charge. The exhibition's aim is to raise awareness of and introduce to younger generations traditional arts of Turkey. It will be a digital exhibition that incorporates holographic and special projection techniques that make it possible to display the only copies of miniaturist Osman's artworks which are preserved at the Topkapı Palace.

Ottoman miniature was developed over several centuries into a visual language that used to express the cultural diversity and cosmopolitan geography of the Empire. Nakkaş Osman was one of the leading artists of miniature during the height of the empire in the 16th century. He became to be known as the “Leonardo da Vinci” of the East whose unique style was visible throughout his nearly 600 art pieces.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzg4NjI3LWdvb2dsZS11cGRhdGVzLXlvdXR1YmUtaXBob25lLWZpcnN0LW1ham9yLWlvcy11cGRhdGUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google updates YouTube for iPhone first major iOS update since December,"In context: Google has issued a bug-fixing update to its YouTube iOS app which marks the first major iOS app update since Apple's new privacy rules came into effect in December. The move comes after many speculated that Google was withholding app updates in protest over Apple's privacy ""nutrition labels"" in the App Store.

Following the 15.49.6 update privacy details for the YouTube app are now appearing on the App Store.

""The developer Google LLC indicated that the app's privacy practices may include handing of data as described below"" the page reads. There it adds that data used to track users includes ""contact info"" and ""identifiers"" along with a wider range of data which may be linked to users' identity.

So far YouTube is the only Google app to receive an update since December. Other apps including Gmail Search and Docs received their last update before December 8 meaning they didn't have to comply with Apple's new privacy features.

Apple is hoping to equip users with a better understanding of how their personal data is being used and to allow iPhone and iPad owners to opt-out of tracking on a per-app basis.

The news didn't go down well with ad firms or social media giant Facebook which went so far as to take out two full-page newspaper ads slamming Apple's privacy policies and claiming that such a move would be ""devastating for small businesses."" Critics were quick to question Facebook's motives however given the company's history of questionable privacy practices.

For iPhone and iPad users the good news is that we should expect to see further Google apps receive bug-fixing updates in the coming days and weeks. Like we said YouTube's latest update is available to download now on the App Store."

It's taken me a long time to find a hair routine that works. I've tried every product and hack you can think of to keep my hair free of oil frizz and tangles. On top of that I don't have super thick hair so I'm always trying to pump up the volume. It's hard to find products that tackle everything I want without weighing my hair down but I've finally found my holy grail routine — and it only costs $37 on Amazon.

Whether you have long and limp hair you're trying to grow your hair out or you're constantly fighting with knots these four hair products might end your battles once and for all.

Honeydew Biotin Shampoo

I've already raved about this shampoo but it's so good that I can't stop talking about it. This is the shampoo that has not only helped me grow out my hair over the past year but has kept it healthy and thick too. The shampoo is made with biotin keratin and zinc which work together to support hair growth and strengthen strands. It's also made with tea tree and rosemary oils which are great for my oily scalp and removing product buildup. I always air dry my hair which could go awry if I use the wrong shampoo but the Honeydew Biotin Shampoo always leaves it voluminous and smooth.

L'Oréal Paris 8 Second Wonder Water

I have to admit I was scared to use this. Anything that advertises silky hair with no weigh-down usually leaves me with greasy strands — but not this time. I'm so relieved to have found a weekly hair treatment that actually makes my hair super soft and shiny. L'Oréal's 8 Second Wonder Water is made with amino acids and proteins that smooth the hair's surface. Plus since I've been using it my hair is much easier to brush through. My favorite part (other than its amazing scent) is that you only have to leave it in for eight seconds before rinsing it out.

Recently I've also been using the Dream Lengths Wonder Water which is made specifically for long hair and I love it just as much.

Wet Brush Shine Enhancer Brush

We've all heard of Wet Brush but I was super intrigued by this shine-enhancing version that's made with boar bristles. Since my hair is longer than ever now brushing out tangles has been a pain in the you-know-what. I had been using Tangle Teezer's brush which was fine but not the best option for my difficult knots. This Wet Brush on the other hand makes brushing my hair a breeze plus it always leaves a pretty sheen.

L'Oréal Paris Dream Lengths No Haircut Cream

When I saw the name of this product I knew it was meant for me. Over the last year I've only gotten one trim so I'm trying to do what I can to upkeep my hair without visiting the salon. The No Haircut Cream has been a great supplement to my routine — it smooths out my ends and makes my hair look blow-dried (even though I'm too lazy to actually do that). It's made with castor oil and vitamins and it offers heat protection up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit if you do opt for heat styling.

Mixing friendship and finance can be messy but for many Canadians who take advantage of peer lending and savings it works.

The concept involves groups of friends or acquaintances pooling money together to provide funding in situations where traditional financial institutions won't or don't work.

Rahma Mohamed who lives in Edmonton started participating in groups like this — called hagbads in her Somali community — once she was old enough to start working.

For 10 months at a time she and about a dozen other women would agree to save together contributing equal amounts every month and taking turns withdrawing largers sums made up of everyone's contributions. The system was based on trust: a newcomer to the group could not withdraw right away but only after a history of making payments.

The Cost of Living ❤s money — how it makes (or breaks) us.

Catch us Sundays on CBC Radio One at 12:00 p.m. (12:30 p.m. NT).

We also repeat the following Tuesday at 11:30 a.m. in most provinces.

Thanks to these groups Mohamed said she saved enough to pay off nearly $30000 in student loans within three years of graduating from university.

Beyond giving her a social structure to save she said the groups helped strengthen friendships and community ties as women confided in each other and worked together toward achieving their goals.

""It feels almost like people are paying into your dream even though it's your own money that you're getting at the end"" she said.

Academics call groups like this rotating savings and credit associations but they are known by many different names in Canada and around the world.

Canadians often use peer lending groups as an alternative to more traditional banking. (Chris Helgren/Reuters)

""It's very interesting and a relatively simple mechanism for allowing small amounts of money to be accumulated within a group that has group responsibility and also has regular agreed-upon payout schedules"" said Susanna Khavul a professor in the Lucas College and Graduate School of Business at San Jose State University.

For Canadians who face barriers to traditional banking and other forms of credit these groups have long served an important purpose by providing access to capital they wouldn't otherwise have.

Now alongside the COVID-19 pandemic peer lending — in many forms — is becoming more mainstream as some groups move online entrepreneurs seek alternative funding sources and tech companies design platforms to cash in on these valuable peer networks.

Moving rotational savings online

On Prince Edward Island startup MICC Financial is digitizing the rotating savings concept.

Co-founder and CEO Jonah Chininga said he was inspired to develop a savings app after struggling as an international student to access and build credit in Canada.

James Muhato left Jonah Chininga Sergio Fernandez and Daniel Ohaegbu all had a hand in creating the MICC Financial app. (Reddin Handrahan)

Through Chininga's app groups of three to twelve users link their bank accounts and make monthly payments. The app operates like a rotating savings and credit association but with a twist: since the company sends transaction data to credit bureaus users also build credit and pay a small monthly fee to use the service.

Launched in September the app is seeing its highest engagement from young people and young entrepreneurs who have struggled during the pandemic.

""It has really shown where the gaps are within the financial system here in Canada in terms of accessing credit especially"" Chininga said.

Non-profit lending circles expand as well

Non-profit organizations have also embraced the peer-lending concept and seen demand for it increase during the pandemic.

The PARO Centre for Women's Enterprise a non-profit social enterprise based in Thunder Bay Ont. runs more than 185 peer lending circles in that province.

As small businesses struggled with pandemic-related restrictions and closures the organization saw unprecedented demand for its lending circles.

""Women started calling us from all over the province even if it wasn't where we were normally working because they were really struggling and they didn't fit into the criteria for federal programs to be able to keep their business going"" said Rosalind Lockyer the PARO Centre's founder and CEO.

The circles and the training sessions linked to them have moved online. The digital format is allowing the non-profit to serve more women than in the past.

Peer-to-peer lending as a business

Canadian peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms such as Lending Loop and goPeer connect borrowers with lenders claiming to be faster and more accessible than large banks and financial institutions.

Though the industry is less established in Canada P2P lending has seen increasing popularity over the past decade in other countries including the United States and United Kingdom.

Investors began to make huge investments in these American and British platforms … they are much less personal now and they are much more seen as kind of a big business. - Rob Aitken author of

""What interests me the most is actually the link between these very small fringe banking and financial practices in the larger financial markets because they're actually deeply connected"" said Rob Aitken a professor of political science at the University of Alberta and author of the book Fringe Finance: Crossing and Contesting the Borders of Global Capital.

Though P2P platforms might have been intended for individual borrowers and lenders according to Aitken they also end up attracting large institutional investors.

""Investors began to make huge investments in these American and British platforms and it's changed the dynamic there quite a bit so that they are much less personal now and they are much more seen as kind of a big business"" Aitken said.

But whether online or offline Susanna Khavul predicts peer lending and savings groups will always be around in some form because they serve a social purpose in addition to a financial one.

""I'm not going to bet against humans wanting connections with other humans"" she said.

Celebrity engagement rings often come with hefty price tags. They can cost thousands or even millions of dollars. But in the case of Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher they’re a rare Hollywood couple who sport more affordable wedding rings.

Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher married in 2015

Kutcher and Kunis became husband and wife in July 2015. They didn’t have an elaborate celebration with a star-studded guest list but rather a private affair. As Kutcher said during a 2016 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show they went to great lengths to keep the ceremony a secret.

“It was a ninja effort” Kutcher said. “We really didn’t want helicopters [with paparazzi photographers] at our wedding and it’s a legitimate concern.”

The Ranch star continued saying he even left false clues online.

“I was posting things on social media that were in different locations to avoid the helicopters because we didn’t want to be screaming our vows at each other and be like ‘Forever!’ ‘Did you say never?’ We didn’t want to do that thing so we went really under the radar with it” he explained.

After saying their I do’s the couple took an RV trip with their then-10-month-old daughter Wyatt and Kutcher’s parents. As Kunis revealed later on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon the trip was a disaster.

“If you’ve ever seen the National Lampoon movies our honeymoon was like a real-life National Lampoon‘s honeymoon” she said.

Mila Kunis bought her and Ashton Kutcher’s wedding bands on Etsy

After pricing out rings Kunis headed to Etsy to get wedding bands for her and Kutcher.

“I wanted the thinnest possible platinum band” she said during a 2016 appearance on Conan. “I mean you can’t see it but it’s super super thin. I looked at how much Tiffany’s [cost] and I was like ‘They’re how much? This is astronomical.’ So I went on Etsy and I was like ‘$90?’ I was like ‘Buy now!’ $90 everybody! Ashton’s was $100 so technically his wedding band was a little bit more expensive than mine.”

The Bad Moms actor continued saying she has a “beautiful” engagement ring from Kutcher she never wears. Instead she wears her more affordable ring.

Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis: Who has the higher net worth?

Kutcher and Kunis are both successful actors but they didn’t grow up with money. Hence their more frugal ways as adults. Both have been open about their upbringings saying they didn’t have much money. As parents it’s important to them they don’t raise their children to feel entitled.

“It’s so important because we both came from pretty solid poverty backgrounds and grew up very poor and are very much self-made and are very aware of what a dollar is worth” Kunis said of her and Kutcher on the The Kyle and Jackie O Show per CBS News. “Nothing’s been handed to us.”

They met on That ’70s Show as teens and even played love interests. In fact Kunis shared her first kiss — a scripted one for the comedy — with her future husband. They were both established actors when they reconnected at the 2012 Golden Globe Awards. Kutcher had multiple TV and film roles and Kunis had starred in Black Swan only two years earlier.

Kutcher’s worth a reported $200 million while Kunis has an estimated net worth of $75 million according to Celebrity Net Worth. But the couple doesn’t plan on leaving all of their money to their children. The actors want to invent in their kids’ business ideas and donate the rest.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb21tZXJjZWJ5dGVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzEzL3NlbGxlcnMtY2hvaWNlLWF3YXJkcy0yMDIxLW1lcmNoYW50cy1yYXRlLXRvcC1vbmxpbmUtbWFya2V0cGxhY2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sellers Choice Awards 2021: Merchants Rate Top Online Marketplaces,"Welcome to the 12th annual EcommerceBytes Sellers Choice Awards. Each year we invite sellers to rate and review the marketplaces on which they sell and they use the opportunity to tell companies (and each other) what’s working and what isn’t.

As in past years we let readers nominate their top choices and then opened up the voting to the top 10 nominated venues.

Readers rated the finalists in four key areas – profitability customer service communication and ease of use. Respondents were also asked how likely they were to recommend each marketplace as a selling venue to a friend or colleague.

As they do every year sellers pointed to specific policies and practices that affected them.

There was great diversity of sellers responding. Some were newbies or low-volume; others noted they were longtime pros. Some were artisans and some used fulfillment services.

The Results



eBay again topped the list this year overall followed by Bonanza and Ruby Lane. The rankings take into account four key criteria – profitability customer service communication and ease of use.

Coming in fourth place was Etsy followed by Mercari and Poshmark. Amazon narrowly squeaked ahead of eCrater with Craigslist and Facebook coming in ninth and tenth place respectively.

eBay took the top spot for Profitability again this year and it also placed first in Ease of use. Bonanza took top spots for Customer Service and Communication and it also was the top most recommended marketplace.

With more people shopping online due to the coronavirus ecommerce should have been the rising tide that lifted all boats in 2020. But there were fewer outright mentions of the effects of COVID-19 than we had expected.

Some sellers noted that they had benefitted from extra traffic to marketplaces but it also left them vulnerable to claims of late delivery especially during the holiday shopping period when some marketplaces decided the fate of Item Not Received claims. Despite getting packages into the mail on time it was the seller not the carrier that ended up taking losses when items weren’t delivered on time some sellers said.

The top nominated venues were diverse from traditional marketplaces like eBay and Amazon; to niche sites; to classifieds site Craigslist; to social platforms like Facebook. Some of the finalists were large publicly traded companies; others were tiny versions.

In reading through sellers reviews we picked up on three attitudes towards marketplaces. First there were the venues where sellers could list with little investment in time or money and what sales they got were quite satisfactory. Those were the “it is what it is” venues.

Then there were the “mega platforms” where some sellers were quite satisfied due to the volume of sales but others bristled due to a feeling that the companies had stacked the deck against the sellers. It went beyond the typical complaints of “nickle-and-diming” fees to practices such as charging a commission fee on shipping and sales tax which sellers felt were wrong.

And then there were marketplaces where sellers felt at home and enjoyed selling but yearned for more traffic and sales. Those venues offered autonomy or an attractive fee structure and sellers urged those venues to advertise more to fulfill their potential.

You can read more about these issues in the individual findings for each marketplace. Next up – rankings and how they break down.

How It Breaks Down – Profitability

It's been more than 20 years since we first met Carrie Bradshaw Samantha Jones Charlotte York and Miranda Hobbes — and we couldn't help but wonder will we ever meet again? The answer is yes because there is a ""Sex and the City"" revival in the works titled ""And Just Like That.""

Samantha Jones played by Canadian actress Kim Cattrall will be noticeably absent from the new series but that could give the series a chance to hire some diverse cast members. It will be interesting to see how they explain Samantha's absence but it also gives the writers a chance to fix some of the things they got wrong in the '90s especially since it's airing in a post #MeToo world.

There are so many different possibilities in store for the new series and fans cannot wait to hear more details about a 21st-century ""SATC"".

If re-watching two movies and six seasons of the original HBO series isn't enough here are 11 ""Sex and the City""-inspired products that will keep you patiently waiting for the revival premiere.

I'm the easiest person to get on board with a hyped up piece of clothing a beauty product or an interiors buy. I'm basically an influencer's dream. And the latest thing to catch my eye is the Murano glass lamp which is shaped like a cute little mushroom. Problem is one of these will set you back literally hundreds of pounds which is why I went looking for glass lamps that are dupes for a Murano.

The real Murano lamps you can find out there are mostly vintage and let me tell you they're certainly not cheap. I'm talking prices that start at £300-£500 and go right up to the thousand quid mark. For a lamp. Now unless you're a bajillionaire I'm guessing you (like I) do not have that kind of money to spend. But all those Instagram content creators with the coolest style and homes are likely still taunting you with this glass lamp.

Luckily there are several dupes out there. The best one I've found is by Urban Outfitters; their Ansel lamp comes in three designs which currently are all sadly out of stock.

I ummed and aahed over buying one when they were available for days and now deeply regret my decision not to go for it. I've contacted the team at UO to see if we can expect it to come back and will keep you updated.

The company which has had to increase gas flaring due to the malfunction recently announced that it would have to send the compressor to Germany for a full assessment to determine the fault.

In a statement yesterday Exxon said that the compressor mechanical seal the suction silencer and necessary spare parts were cleared with customs in Germany and are now being disassembled for inspection and assessment.

“This process spearheaded by technical experts from the vessel’s owner SBM Offshore the equipment manufacturer MAN Energy Solutions and ExxonMobil is critical as it will determine the repair plan and timeline” the statement said.

Exxon also said that that it continues to safely manage production and flare levels on the Liza Destiny and has been providing daily updates to the government.

Exxon previously stated that production levels have been cut to limit the controversial flaring of gas.

President of ExxonMobil Guyana Alistair Routledge confirmed on Monday that the gas compressor failed in the middle of the night on January 27th when optimisation testing was ongoing and the production level was around 130000 barrels per day but maintained that this was not in any way linked to the malfunction. As a result Routledge disclosed that oil production has been pared to 120000 barrels per day (bpd) – its previously stated maximum capacity – while gas flaring has increased to 16 million cubic feet per day.

Meanwhile Exxon said yesterday that it met with various stakeholders and provided an operational update.

In today’s column I continue my summary appraisal of the adverse impacts of the 2020 general crisis as I have defined this phenomenon on Guyana’s infant oil and gas sector. Thus far I have treated with the adverse impacts on the price and quantity of Guyana’s crude oil sales. To recall the new oil sector had been modeled and published by the Authorities in Q4 2019 with a 2020 output of 102000 barrels of crude oil per day and a price of US 64 per barrel. The lead contractor ExxonMobil and partners had by then already projected output at 120000 barrels per day.

Based on calculations of projected 2020 Government of Guyana (GoG) profit share provided by the Department of Energy (DoE) – five million barrels of crude oil versus the reported profit share of only four million barrels – there is an indication of an output shortfall in the region of 20%. Similarly based on calculations of projected royalties – US$18 million for 2020 – the 2% rate on gross production would yield a gross value of US$0.9 billion for 2020. Both these calculations are very rough. They do however remind us of the gap in the provision of timely data on the sector’s performance by the public and private authorities.

The valuations given in the above paragraph reflect combined price and quantity effects. With all of Guyana’s sales taking place in the world market prices received are available in real time. I remain convinced the substantial decline in global crude oil prices is reflected in delayed publication of Guyana’s oil sales.

Impeded performance

Four factors were highlighted last week as being principally responsible for the 2020 production delays identified in Guyana. First start-up mechanical problems (compression related); second inability to undertake timely repairs and maintenance due to pandemic-related setbacks and delays; third pandemic-related considerations also impeded the deployment of both overseas and local workers to Guyana’s offshore production facilities; and fourth regulatory hold- ups especially in regard to permission for the Payara project go ahead. The last was also affected by the electoral and political crisis following national elections.

Indeed such considerations led Rystad Energy to publish a report on the “impact costs of delays” in the execution of planned production in Guyana’s infant oil and gas sector. I had evaluated this report in my column of September 27 2020; and I reproduce in Schedule 1 data showing Rystad’s results. The Schedule clearly reveals a clear-cut outcome; that is the net present value (NPV) yielded by available projects declines as the time period of the delay extends. Delays are clearly likely to be progressively costly.

Parenthetically it is worth noting that the indicated shares of NPV going to the GoG and contractor (ExxonMobil and partners) in the Rystad Energy’s report confirms to their separate estimation of GoG take at 60%.

Measuring Impacts

For the average reader the list of micro and macroeconomic impacts of the 2020 crisis that should be investigated and quantified is quite formidable. I had therefore in earlier columns sought to find for the broad public’s benefit a proxy/summary indicator that best captured the totality of these economic impacts. That proxy indicator or measure is the GDP at constant prices.

I have advanced the proposition that the rate of growth of Guyana’s GDP at constant prices is a summary measure of economic impacts positive and negative. Consequently I have used time-based differences in estimated growth rates of Guyana’s GDP starting with the Authorities pre-crisis estimate and those that followed subsequently as the crisis unfolded during 2020 as a measure of the overall economic value of the reverses or setbacks to the economy. Although the estimates provided institution varied all estimates were revised downwards the later in the year they were made.

Readers should observe the World Bank’s World Economic Outlook (WEO) provides a simple and effective description of what the GDP represents. As the WEO states: “it is the most commonly used single measure of a country’s (Guyana) overall economic activity. It represents the total value at constant prices of final goods and services produced within a country (Guyana) during a specified period of time (2020)”. The performance of Guyana’s oil and gas sector is therefore captured in its GDP measurements. Consequently as estimates of this measure are updated when 2020 advances these estimates ought to capture economic impacts of the 2020 general crisis on the hydrocarbons sector in the performance of Guyana’s GDP.

Updated forecasts reveal quite dramatic results. The original 2020 forecast made by the Authorities back in Q4 2019 was based on the expectation of:

1) continued investment in the oil and gas sector in 2020;

2) an output of 102000 barrels of oil per day on average;

3) oil sold at US$64 per barrel.

This forecast was made jointly by the Guyana Authorities and the IMF and announced in Q4 2019. It revealed a whopping projected growth rate of 86% for 2020. This rate was easily the fastest projected rate of growth for any country in the world for 2020!

Conclusion

Next week I’ll present a Schedule summarising these data as I wrap-up this presentation on the use of real GDP behaviour as a proxy indicator for the economic impacts of the 2020 general crisis on Guyana’s infant oil and gas sector.",,,,,,

This expansion of Blancco’s ongoing relationship with Carahsoft Technology Corp. The Trusted Government IT Solutions Provider® gives AWS Consulting Partner Private Offers (CPPO) partners and enterprise decision makers the ability to quickly obtain Blancco’s data erasure software. The vastly simplified procurement process streamlines billing to include “pay-as-you-go” and subscription options allowing government agencies to build holistic data management solutions.

“Organizations of all sizes – including Federal state and local government agencies – are tasked with preventing the exposure of highly sensitive and classified information as well as complying with data privacy regulations. This includes ensuring data is certifiably erased from IT assets and environments at every stage of the information lifecycle” said Christina Walker Global Director of Channel Blancco. “We’re thrilled that Carahsoft is now offering our industry-standard data sanitization software through private offers on AWS Marketplace allowing us to help even more agencies confidently meet their data mandates quickly and cost-effectively.”

Secure data erasure is especially critical when organizations undertake digital transformation initiatives that incorporate cloud migration. As data is prepared for its move to the cloud organizations discover redundant outdated and trivial (ROT) information that they no longer need. Blancco’s data erasure solution which works in conjunction with data management solutions that identify this obsolete data provides the means to securely eliminate it in a secure auditable manner.

Since its founding in 2004 Carahsoft has provided the public sector with IT solutions from hundreds of technology vendors prime contractors system integrators value-added resellers and channel partners. In addition to serving government agencies the company also supports large education and healthcare organizations.

The company’s latest project The Collection will have six office suites — with private entrances patios with Wi-Fi and outdoor spaces — in a former retail space on Pacific Coast Highway. The 48000-square-foot campus is expected to open this summer.



“This is a new kind of creative office space intended for the world’s most innovative concepts offering an inviting and cooperative space that benefits not only the companies that reside here but the surrounding community as a whole” Jeff Kreshek senior vice president of West Coast leasing at Federal Realty Investment Trust said in a statement.



“The companies we’re targeting match well with our brand culture — they are the innovative sustainable forward-thinking companies grabbing people’s attention with bold objectives and inventive ideas” he added.



A big chunk of the project has already been leased to beauty companies.



Lady Gaga’s makeup brand Haus Laboratories is leasing nearly 16000 square feet.

“The office will be an innovative space for us to chart out what’s next for Haus Labs located in a bustling neighborhood that allows us to work alongside our target shoppers so we can identify what they are looking to see from us next” Ben Jones chief executive of Haus Laboratories said in a statement.



Ideation Beauty will occupy 11000 square feet of office space at the campus for its U.S. headquarters.



El Segundo once known for its Chevron refinery and aerospace companies is now home to a more diverse array of industries.

In the side parking lot of the old Eldorado Casino site in Henderson’s Water Street District lay what’s left of the sign that used to hang on the back entrance of the property.

New ownership is modernizing the building in a $5 million renovation and that starts by sprucing up the exterior with a new blue and yellow paint job landscaping and signage.

The casino closed since last March because of the pandemic will eventually reopen under new ownership. It was purchased from Boyd Gaming in December by DeSimone Gaming which also owns Railroad Pass in Henderson.

The modernization will come with another significant change — the property will be renamed The Pass when it reopens. They anticipate a spring opening pending approval from the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

The new name is a nod to a cross-pollination marketing effort with Railroad Pass but also an effort to stand apart since an assortment of other casinos around the country including one in Reno already claim the Eldorado name.

“As Boyd said in its press release when the sale was announced the (Eldorado) was a nonessential asset for Boyd but it’s going to be a very essential asset for me” said Joe DeSimone the company’s owner and operator.

It is eerily quiet at the shuttered property which opened in 1961 and is a favorite of longtime Henderson residents on this afternoon as owner DeSimone walks through.

He points to a bay of outdated slot machines and says they will be replaced. He looks over blueprints showing more changes including an $800000 sports book upgrade and new banquet room. They will also bring back table games to become the only downtown Henderson property with a casino pit.

The new offerings include an “upscale” Italian restaurant and a 24-hour café that will be named after his daughter Emelia.

There were be a shuttle taking patrons between the two properties which are about seven miles apart. They will also share the same rewards club.

“It’s going to be busy in here all hours of the day once we open” he said. “That’s the goal. It’s going to be fun.”

The building is wedged between the new Lifeguard Arena — headquarters for the minor league Henderson Silver Knights — and the Rainbow Club casino. The arena will also host youth hockey events to bring many visitors to the area some of whom will stumble into the property.

That’s especially true because just steps away from the arena is a 500-space parking garage that came with the transaction of the casino. DeSimone doesn’t plan to charge casino patrons to park.

“Having the Eldorado property reopened is only going to reinvigorate that area and play off the arena” said Michelle Romero a Henderson councilwoman whose district encompasses Water Street.

Future upgrades could include a hotel tower which would give the property the lone hotel rooms in downtown. It would be perfect for families in town for youth hockey at the arena.

“Depending on the needs downtown that could be an option” DeSimone said. “People are spending money down here and I think that’s only going to continue. There’s momentum here.”

A real estate developer by trade — he owns First Federal Realty in Henderson — DeSimone said he took an immediate liking to the casino industry after purchasing Railroad Pass from MGM Resorts International in 2015.

He rattles off names of some of the most well-known executives in Las Vegas gaming — Kirk Kerkorian Sheldon Adelson and new Las Vegas Sands CEO Rob Goldstein — and says they give him inspiration.

He lauded companies like Boyd and MGM saying “Nevada should be proud to have them” but said an independent casino operator can sometimes bring a certain hands-on mentality that a big company might not be able to. That’s how he operates his properties.

“Those are wonderful companies to deal with” DeSimone said. “But having a small-businessperson with the flexibility and capital and motivation necessary to liven up a place that makes sense. We don’t have the overhead or obligations that a Strip hotel has. I try to talk to my employees at Railroad Pass every day and I listen to them.”

Soon new signs will be hung outside the building to further usher in a new era. DeSimone is confident it will remain a locals favorite calling his plans a perfect fit for Water Street.

“The entire deal with The Pass feels really good” he said. “It feels like it did when I bought Railroad Pass and that’s worked out really well. Ten or 15 years ago I wouldn’t have thought I’d be a casino owner but gaming is great. I love it.”",,,,,,,,,

( ) — It's a story two years in the making. A woman saved by a stranger when she attempted to take her own life.

On her road to recovery she tracks down her saving grace who helps her again in an unexpected way.

Tuesday Sept. 25 2018 happened to be Garrett Nichsolson’s 42nd birthday and it’s a day that changed his life forever.

He had just completed a FedEx delivery on Marble Hall Road just west of Rogersville when he noticed a woman now identified as 56-year-old Peggy Parson sitting on the edge of the Marble Hall bridge over Caney Creek.

“I was in a bad marriage and we were both using drugs pretty excessively"" says Peggy. ""I just got a little ways down the road and I stopped and thought I don’t have anywhere to go.”

Peggy was a former addiction therapist who ended up becoming an addict herself. “Had I not been on drugs at the time I’m sure I never would have considered that a viable option” says Peggy.



Garrett pulled his FedEx truck up to block traffic and then slowly approached Peggy while trying to “talk her down.”

Peggy was dangling 30-40 feet above the dry creek bed.

“I just kept imagining she’s going to fall. I thought that if she does I’m going to go in after her"" says Garrett.

Eventually a Hawkins County deputy arrived and helped Garrett pull her to safety. Peggy says she was angry with Garrett at the time. She wanted to die.

""I was already over the railing and from what I understand I had a belt around my neck when he stopped"" says Peggy. ""His timing was ideal.""

She was taken for an emergency committal and mental evaluation and did some time in jail. That was the last time Garrett Nicholson heard about her for exactly two years.

""I think me and my wife both prayed just so much that she was okay and that God would look after her"" says Garrett. “I think it was just something about her when she was talking on the bridge and the things that she was saying. I just knew that this is someone that is going through more than they should have to. It broke my heart.”

Four days after Garrett saved Peggy on the bridge tragedy struck his family when his entire house was destroyed by a fire.

""Our entire life is just pretty much destroyed"" says Garrett.

The Nichsolson’s were able to get back on their feet. But just like Peggy they couldn't on their own. They relied on the kindness of neighbors and nearby churches.

Flash-forward to 2021 seven months sober and attempting to make a fresh start 28 months after a failed suicide attempt Peggy was reunited with the man who saved her life.

""First thing I did when I got out of jail was call him"" says Peggy.

What Peggy didn’t know was the man who gave her life back to her that fateful day on a bridge near Rogersville had already taken steps to give her another fighting chance.

""She’s had so much bad that it’s time for her to get something good going for her"" says Garrett.

Garrett his wife Patrice and their daughter Bryndel brought Peggy to Leggacy Motors in Kingsport and Peggy immediately began browsing cars on the lot.

Garrett guided Peggy to a Chevy Impala that was already parked front and center.

Peggy said “I really like this one but it’s going to be out of my price range.”

Garrett replied “You don’t worry about that because it’s all yours. Free and clear.”

Peggy paused for a moment in disbelief and then burst into tears. ""I never thought I’d be able to come back from where I was at"" says Peggy. ""To being this happy. To being able to see a future.""

Peggy is now living into a sober living facility in Knoxville called “Never Alone."" and these once strangers are now lifelong friends.

Foothills Park would be renamed to Foothills Nature Preserve to better distinguish the 1400-acre area as an open space preserve according to the proposal before council on Feb. 22. The park currently allows a maximum of 1000 people at one time but the ordinance will limit the number to 400.

Foothills Park was sold to the city of Palo Alto by Dr. Russel Lee founder of the Palo Alto Medical Clinic in 1958. The park was formally dedicated to the city in 1965 and open exclusively to Palo Alto residents.

Following a lawsuit by the ACLU and NAACP council members voted Nov. 2 to allow non-residents access to the park.

The decision to drop the residents’ only restriction has resulted in an increase in people visiting the park. The city is now charging $6 a car. The city is looking into possible changes in the fees.

The Parks and Recreation Commission formed a committee to make a recommendation on the fees. The commitee is recommending a:

•$65 annual pass for non-Palo Alto residents;

• $49 annual pass for senior low income or active military and veteran non-Palo Alto

residents;

• $50 annual pass for Palo Alto residents;

• $38 annual pass for senior low income or active military and veteran Palo Alto residents.

City Council will have the final say on fees."

One way to get there may be with virtual power plants.

Heron Pointe and other CA VPP projects are built for participation in the California demand response market and other grid services. sonnen Inc.

A virtual power plant or VPP uses software to better control renewable electricity generation -- a process which can often be volatile on the electrical grid.

""Instead of having all these disparate forms of variable generation the purpose of the virtual power plant ... is to transform those into something that can actually replace a power plant"" said Blake Richetta chairman and CEO of Sonnen Inc. a battery developer.

One of the major parts of a VPP is managing the load or amount of electricity entering the grid. In the past with a traditional power plant there was a consistent amount of energy that could be released. As more solar and wind farms start producing electricity that load could become inconsistent which could lead to periods where generation doesn't match demand or demand doesn't match generation the experts who spoke with ABC News explained.

Soleil Lofts features over 600 individual sonnen ecoLinx batteries totaling 12.6 megawatt-hours of solar energy storage sonnen Inc.

""If you can flatten those spikes if you can balance the load in the grid you can make the grid actually operate in a decarbonized and lower-cost manner and you can bring renewables online"" said Richetta.

Wasatch Energy Group and Sonnen have teamed up to develop residential VPPs in Utah and California.

The first was the Soleil Lofts a new 600-unit solar and storage residential community outside of Salt Lake City in partnership with Rocky Mountain Power the local utility. The project can store 12.6 megawatt-hours in batteries produced by Sonnen the companies said.

""It created this product that benefits all of the strategic stakeholders including the tenants in the building because they get a battery that is resilient. They have backup power they have renewable energy. They have all these great things that benefit them as a resident free of charge"" said Ryan Peterson president and managing partner of Wasatch Energy Group.

The two companies are now working on a new project: a fleet of VPPs across California that will eventually equip 3000 residential apartments with a total of 60 megawatt-hours of storage and over 24 megawatts of solar power upon completion they say.

The first solar-and-storage retrofit in the Wasatch California VPP is the 417-unit Heron Pointe apartment community in Fresno. sonnen Inc.

The first part of the project is called Heron Pointe a 417-unit community in Fresno California that is designed to have four-megawatt hours of storage and 1.85 megawatts of solar power. Unlike the Salt Lake City project this one will be a retrofit of apartments already owned by the Wasatch Group a real estate company that is the parent company of Wasatch Energy Group.

In the community each apartment will have solar panels on the roof along with batteries in the units. There will also be a larger solar array on a community center and clubhouse.

""The idea is that the big giant community-solar produces solar and the baby solar in the apartments produce solar and that is shared among all the different apartment batteries. The apartment batteries are then able to handle the load of the apartments as well as most importantly harness that solar and effectively dispatch that solar into the CAISO market which is the California independent system operator"" said Richetta.

The two companies said they have had conversations with major California utilities about the project.

""If we can prove the scientific thesis that this VPP can be helpful to the energy system and all ratepayers and society in total and it can also be helpful to the utility company then they could potentially embrace it even more and try to expand their battery program to other projects and other applications"" said Richetta.

Similar to the Salt Lake City project tenants in Fresno will also get a discount on electricity prices along with the ability to have electricity if utilities shut off power during the wildfire season according to Peterson.

""In California you've got some pretty big benefits around backup power especially in these high-risk fire areas. And it's hard to put a price on that because a lot of people want that resilience in their home"" said Peterson.

The project also will allow people to have solar and storage who may not typically be able to afford it said Richetta.

""There are low-income tenants in Heron Pointe. It's a disadvantaged community the state of California certified it as. And these are folks that are not signing PPA's [Power Purchase Agreements] or taking solar loans or buying solar and batteries with cash"" Richetta said.

The Soleil Lofts apartment community in Herriman Utah represents an all-electric residential community design that standardizes on-site energy storage in every unit. sonnen Inc.

Though they have done both new builds and retrofits Peterson says the latter is the model they will likely use in the future. The only limitations he said is raising the money needed to build at scale working with utilities and finding other non-Wasatch owned properties to build on.

Richetta said he thinks the key to growing VPPs is working with utility companies.

""They have to benefit from this. Everyone needs to benefit from it. And that's really why this VPP model needs to work. And I think it will work because of that fact alone that we work with the utilities"" said Richetta.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXBsZXNuZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS8yMDIxLzAyLzEzL2NyZWF0ZS1wZXJmZWN0LWNvbWJpbmF0aW9uLXB1bHRlLWhvbWVzLWFuZC1ob21lc2l0ZXMtYmFiY29jay1yYW5jaC80NDQxNjAxMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Create perfect combination with Pulte Homes and homesites in Babcock Ranch,"Gravina Smith Matte & Arnold Marketing and PR

Or follow us on Google News

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL’s) U.S. Solar Photovoltaic System and Energy Storage Cost Benchmark: Q1 2020 is now available documenting a decade of cost reductions in solar and battery storage installations across utility commercial and residential sectors.

NREL’s cost benchmarking applies a bottom-up methodology that captures variation in system design and regional costs helping to identify future research and development directions that could further reduce costs.

The last decade has shown a sharp though now steadying decline in costs driven largely by photovoltaic (PV) module efficiencies (now 19.5% up from 19.2% in 2019) and hardware and inverter costs. Since 2010 there has been a 64% 69% and 82% reduction in the cost of residential commercial-rooftop and utility-scale PV systems respectively. As in previous years soft costs remain a large and persistent portion of installation costs for both solar and storage systems and especially for commercial and residential systems.

“A significant portion of the cost declines over the past decade can be attributed to an 85% cost decline in module price. A decade ago the module alone cost around $2.50 per watt and now an entire utility-scale PV system costs around $1 per watt” said NREL Senior Financial Analyst David Feldman. “With similar reductions in hardware costs for storage systems PV and storage have become vastly more affordable energy resources across the nation.”

Expanding Scope to PV Plus Storage

This year’s benchmark report integrates PV-plus-storage costs demonstrating that these also fell from the first quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020. The new benchmark includes varying hours of storage capacities reflecting diverse customer preferences for resilience.

Additionally NREL has calculated the levelized cost of solar-plus-storage (LCOSS) which tracks the total cost of operating a PV-plus-storage plant on a per-megawatt-hour basis. LCOSS was used to establish a 2020 benchmark of PV-plus-storage systems and will be useful for identifying future goals in the same way that the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) has established PV price targets.

Tracking SETO Targets

In 2010 SETO announced unsubsidized PV price targets for 2020. Per this year’s benchmarking residential and commercial systems are 93% and 97% toward achieving the 2020 targets of 10 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) and 8 cents/kWh respectively. Utility systems which met 2020 price targets three years early are progressing towards SETO’s 2030 target for utility systems of 3 cents/kWh.

In pursuit of 2030 targets the benchmark report notes that business innovations partnerships and continued R&D will be necessary to lower costs further. Although soft costs — such as labor interconnection with the electric grid profits and overheard — often dominate current system costs improvements in one area often affect others such as high-efficiency modules reducing labor and material costs by requiring less products installed. Future cost reductions could be attained from a combination of improvements.

You can download the reportPDF along with an accompanying slide deckPDF and a public version of the underlying data set.

The report authors will also summarize key findings from the report via webinar on Feb. 24 2021 at 12 p.m. ET/10 a.m. MT.

And a potential source of chaos.

These endearing innocuous-looking bags of gas could turn out the lights prematurely on couples during this holiday weekend. FirstEnergy Corp. parent of West Penn Power advises consumers to avoid releasing foil balloons heavenward because their metallic coating conducts electricity and could cause power outages.

Yes those endearing innocuous-looking bags.

“Many people are surprised to learn that stray balloons can cause power outages and other safety issues that impact our power system” Lisa Rouse director of outage management at FirstEnergy said in a prepared statement. “It is important for people to handle them properly so they do not get released into the sky and impact electric service.”

More evidence that 2020 was a miserable year all around: Todd Meyers a FirstEnergy spokesman said “rogue foil balloons were to blame for 132 power outages across FirstEnergy’s six-state service area” last year. That he added was a 25% increase from 2019.

Over the past three years he noted stray balloons have caused about 355 power outages across those six states including 36 in the West Penn Power region.

West Penn Power based in Greensburg serves 720000 customers in the western half of Pennsylvania. Many of them reside in Fayette County.

Valentine’s balloons are popular which is why FirstEnergy considers this weekend to be the kickoff to the balloon-related outage “season.” The Akron-based utility said outages peak in June when more people schedule events outdoors. Drive-by celebrations may have led to a spike in these events last year.

Balloon safety tips aren’t often a priority but FirstEnergy offered these:

n Avoid celebrating with metallic balloons near overhead electric lines;

n Securely tie them to a weight that is heavy enough to prevent them from heading upward. Do not remove the weight until the balloons are deflated.

n Puncture and deflate metallic balloons once they are no longer in use. They can stay inflated for weeks.

n Don’t try to retrieve a balloon kite or toy that is caught in a power line. Call FirstEnergy at 888-544-4877 to report the problem.

n Stay far away from a downed or low-hanging power line then call 911 immediately.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndreWMuY29tL3ZpZGVvL3RlY2gvd2FudC1sZXNzLXNjcmVlbi10aW1lLWdldC1hLWR1bWItcGhvbmUtYWdhaW4vOTUtNGRjZjFiNTEtMjY1OC00NzgwLWExNTctOTRmMTg1MDk0MmZi0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Want less screen time?

The latest version has sleek back doors a hatchback big enough to swallow an Ikea furniture box—and a massive electric battery.

While it will still pin you to the back of your seat when you punch the “go” pedal—electric all-wheel drive and modern traction control will see to that—it couldn’t lay down rubber if it wanted. But it will go a good 200 miles on a single charge. And it will do so silently with no tailpipe emissions.

Called the Mustang Mach-E after one of the fastest barnstorming Mustangs of the 1970s Ford’s first dedicated electric vehicle is among a new wave of affordable electric vehicles from Detroit’s Big Three automakers that don’t just aim to appease regulators and climate hawks but aspire to pick up the gauntlet thrown down by Tesla.

Detroit’s belated bet on electric has wowed investors in recent months. Ford’s share price is at a two-and-a-half-year high as the company targets 2021 as the year of its electrified turnaround. But not all die-hard Mustang loyalists are sure what to make of the new-look Mach-E.

Fortune recently got to take the car for a spin to see for ourselves what the fuss is about. Ford says the first year of Mach-E production is already sold out. If it hits its sales target of 30000 that would pad Ford’s top line by a cool $1.68 billion or about 5% of 2020 total revenue.

There’s more than a bit riding on this electric hotrod.

The Mach-E’s value “lies not in the revenue it generates in the short term” says Matt DeLorenzo senior managing editor for Kelley Blue Book. “What it does do is point a way forward for Ford. It shows that they can leverage iconic nameplates like the Mustang on new technology vehicles like electrics. This will be critical in differentiating their products from new competitors. The branding may allow them to derive larger margins and profits than newer rivals.”

Last week Ford announced that it will double its investment in electric cars in the next four years to $22 billion in an effort to build more electric models by 2025 including an electric transit van for 2021 at least two new electric SUVs and the previously announced F-150 electric pickup due out in 2022.

If Ford wants to keep selling profitable gas-powered pickups and SUVs in California and other big markets around the world it will need more such cars to meet zero-emissions quotas as well as federal fuel-economy averages—especially now that the company has abandoned selling more efficient sedans and hatchbacks. And it will need to make these vehicles attractive in order to sell them.

Glorified golf carts

Automakers have known how to sell cars for more than 100 years—with power style capability—and bragging rights. Their early pledges to introduce zero-emission models messed with that time honored strategy; too often the engineers grudgingly designed nerdy models designs and tasked the marketing teams to figure out new ways to sell them such as closed-end leases and trial subscriptions.

When Tesla rolled out its quick long-range $90000 Model S in 2012 it made several generations of those electric efforts by mainstream automakers look like glorified golf carts.

Today Elon Musk’s creation accounts for nearly 80% of all the new electrics sold every year in the U.S. according to industry trackers at EV-volumes.com. Globally the U.S. is a laggard market for EVs with plug-in penetration well below the global average a recent report by the London-based investment bank Liberum points out (see chart).

The Mach-E is considered the first electric model from a mainstream automaker to follow Tesla’s proven formula. In the next two years it will be followed by all-electric trucks and SUVs from Ford and Hummer electric SUVs from Lincoln and Cadillac and even a new electric Microbus from VW. General Motors announced Feb. 1 that it will stop building light-duty internal-combustion models by 2035 joining Volkswagen among others.

This new wave of aspirational electric cars will bring a different dynamic to the road in 2022 and 2023 appealing to performance enthusiasts beyond a niche of early adopters willing to make their second most expensive lifetime purchase from a startup company.

“Tesla has shown there are enthusiasts and that electric cars are real cars” says Carla Bailo president and CEO of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor. The Mach-E she says “is about elevating the performance aspect of an EV. Once they do that then they’ll be freer to apply electric-vehicle technology to other cars.” A pessimist might note that EV sales amount to just 2% of the U.S. auto market. An optimist would say 98% of potential customers are there to be conquered.

To win over those buyers Ford has bestowed upon the Mach-E its most valuable automotive nameplate the Mustang. Since its introduction in 1964 Ford has sold more than 10 million of them giving rise to a whole new vehicle category: the pony car. None of its rivals have remained in continuous production since and the Mustang still handily outsells each of them. But “pony car” sales are tailing off even as Ford and its competitors introduce special editions in rapid sequence to prop them up. Mustang coupe sales slid 16% in 2020 to just over 61000 after years of steady declines (see chart).

From the original 1970s Mach 1 to the 5.0-liter GT and its bellowing dual chrome tailpipes the Mustang has long been a car with attitude. It’s no wonder it’s been featured in a litany of urban movies and hip-hop songs over the years. Readers of a certain age will no doubt recall (and possibly wince at) Vanilla Ice’s hit “Rollin’ in My 5.0.”

Now the owners of those Mustangs raise their eyebrows as they watch the Mach-E humming not barreling down the road. “I think they’re kind of destroying the car slowly” says Mark “Kip” O’Hara a member of the Seaport Car Club in Connecticut who has owned so many Mustangs he can’t keep track. “Forty or 50 I think” he says. His 2013 Mustang Boss 302 will gallop to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds from a standstill about half a second quicker than the electric Mach-E although about half a second slower than the upcoming ultimate Mach-E GT.

“Most Mustang enthusiasts would agree” he says. “We know it’s fast but they should have called it an Escape.”

Ford has heard that before. Darren Palmer the company’s global Product development director for battery electric vehicles who owns a late-model Shelby Mustang GT350R traveled the U.S. to Mustang club events to take the pulse of enthusiasts and make them believers in his new electric machine. He told doubters “Just drive it.” Once they did he said several put in orders. They’d say “This is a car I could drive every day.” One club president bought two he notes.

“I love my GT350R” says Palmer “but if I drove it every day I’d probably hate it with the noise and everything else.”

He says the biggest complaint his team heard from enthusiasts was the name. “But if it didn’t have the name it wouldn’t be the same would it?” he says rhetorically.

Rollin’ in the Mach-E

Is it the same? I drove it on the highway and around the twisty back roads north of New York City to find out.

Our test vehicle a First Edition equipped similarly to a mid-level Mach-E Premium with 385 horsepower will sprint to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds Ford estimates—significantly faster than any Mustangs from the model’s sales heyday—though on public roads we didn’t have a chance to time it.

It certainly feels fast—much quicker than almost any gas-powered car off the line launching you like a catapult on a roller coaster. After that acceleration trails off (as it does with all electric cars) but it’s already delivered the thrills.

Pop the door open with its electronic button and climb inside; the Mach-E delivers on its luxury promise with thick leather and tactile fabrics bejeweled with giant modern touch screens that customize almost every aspect of driving. Unlike Tesla Ford has retained some conventional control buttons and stalks that keep the driving experience safely familiar. Also unlike Teslas the Mach-E offers the latest Android Auto and Apple CarPlay software to make connecting with your phone simple and comprehensive.

Reach for the “Start” button and an outlined horse gallops across the instrument screen behind the steering wheel; the Mach-E’s center screen welcomes you with your own preferences for apps radio and navigation a route to your destination (if you’ve set that as a preference) and the best available chargers along the way.

In many ways Ford engineers have worked to turn the necessities of electric vehicles into performance assets for the Mach-E.

It leaps forward on a hair trigger even when you prod the accelerator gently and it digs in the same way when you lift off. In an effort to make the Mustang feel responsive as well as to maximize its electric range Ford has given the Mach-E an aggressive regenerative braking system (which drivers can turn off). You rarely have to reach for the brake pedal unless you underestimate your speed. Unlike gas- (or hay-)powered Mustangs the Mach-E responds instantly to any inputs in each of its three driving modes: efficient and stealthy Whisper; mid-level Engage; and full-out Unbridled. Engineers have trimmed its response to the accelerator to one-third the time it takes to blink an eye Palmer says. That’s what makes it feel even faster than it actually is.

Ten hours to recharge

Our Mach-E’s 270 miles of range falls 56 miles short of a comparable Tesla Model Y. In the few days we tested it daytime temps hovered in the low 20s Fahrenheit and the car’s range meter topped out at 200 miles. It takes significant energy to run the heater in an electric car and the batteries are less efficient in the cold.

A full recharge takes about 10 hours overnight at home and a little over a half-hour to recharge at a 150kw fast charger point. That’s comparable to most Teslas though the Mach-E can’t handle the speed of the latest 350kw fast chargers rolling out around the country. Ford says the Mach-E has access to 2700 fast chargers across the U.S.—more than twice as many as Teslas do.

Ford offers the Mach-E with big and small batteries rear- or all-wheel drive and four power levels. When it arrives the base car with 211 miles of range from a 68 kilowatt-hour battery will set you back $42895 comparable to a base Model Y. (Mach-E buyers qualify for up to a $7500 federal tax credit for buying an EV.)

Later this spring Ford will amp up the fun with a Mach-E GT with a more potent battery and 480 horsepower driving through all four wheels. Add the Performance Pack and it will have 634 lbs.-ft. of torque—a number unheard of in gas-powered Mustangs until recently—and will blast to 60 mph Ford hopes in 3.5 seconds.

To win over die-hards Ford would be better off pointing out that this model is like nothing they’ve ever seen before; it’s no 5.0 GT and it’s no Tesla either.

Compared with the Tesla Model Y its most direct competitor “it’s a very impressive vehicle” says Jake Fisher director of vehicle testing at Consumer Reports magazine. “Ford is pretty good at knowing how to build cars that work. I have a little more faith in them to stand behind the product.

“I think there’s a lot [the Mach-E] is going to lack: going out on back roads and shifting through the gears the engine noise—and peeling out” says “Kip” O’Hara the longtime Mustang fan. “I just don’t see that in this car.” Still he’s willing to keep his mind open and says he plans to test-drive it as soon as he can find one. “I still want to see what it’s all about” O’Hara reflects. “I could be totally wrong and it could change my mind 100%.”

Loud powerful visceral: What happens to the V8 engine in an electric car world?

They're loud powerful and as American as apple pie.

And they could soon become extinct.

The fabled V8 engine that powers American muscle cars and European exotics has been slowly losing its standing with carmakers and motorists. Smaller more fuel-efficient four- and six-cylinder engines have overtaken the V8 as CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards tighten.

The V8 got a crushing blow last month when General Motors the industry behemoth behind the Corvette Camaro and Silverado truck announced that 40% of the company’s U.S. models will be battery electric vehicles (BEV) by the end of 2025. That's not all: GM said it plans to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035.

The all-new 6.2-liter V8 in GMC's 2021 Yukon lineup is the most powerful engine in the full-size SUV segment. GMC

Automotive insiders were already bracing for a possible all-electric 'Vette. Then Ford GM's domestic rival and maker of the popular F-150 pickup truck and Mustang sports car accelerated its shift to electrification more than doubling its investment in electric vehicles to $22 billion.

Elon Musk made EVs cool with his Teslas. They're also the majority of EVs sold in the U.S. a tiny (2%) but rapidly growing segment of the automotive market. Mainstream and luxury automakers including Ferrari the apex of the sports car orbit with its throaty V12 and V8 engines are gearing up for a world where internal combustion engines and petroleum are obsolete and passé.

""Electric cars are an inevitability"" Eric Minoff a specialist in the Motoring Department at Bonhams auction house told ABC News. ""So many governments are mandating [electrification]. It's foolish to continue holding on to gas technology.""

It will take serious commitment from automakers to reach these lofty EV goals he noted adding that V8s still play an important role with consumers. And V8s could become even more desirable as fewer roll off the production line in the coming years.

""It's simple supply and demand"" he said.

V8s commonly found in large pickup trucks high-end SUVs and low-volume sports cars are not entirely equal; enthusiasts and collectors have to seek out the performance-focused models Minoff advised.

""The top-of-the-line engine model is always worth more"" he said. ""Whatever is the biggest most powerful engine -- that's always what people want.""

Stephanie Brinley an analyst at IHS Markit also sees V8s emerging as a hot commodity in collector circles. Electric motors deliver unparalleled acceleration and torque. Good old-fashioned V8s however still have a leg up on their silent peers.

""There's a very visceral connection to a high-powered V8 that you don't have in the same way with an EV"" she told ABC News. ""EVs have fake sounds and don't have the same vibrations as a V8 engine. Lots of people grew up with noise under the hood.""

V8-powered vehicles accounted for 15.3% of U.S. vehicle registrations (excluding EVs) in 2020 up from 14.5% in 2019 Brinley noted. Nearly 72% of V8 vehicle registrations were full-size pickup trucks. Half of Ford Mustang Dodge Charger and Chevrolet Camaro owners who registered vehicles last year chose the more expensive and powerful V8 engines according to the data.

""For Ford and GM to pivot to an all-electric future building credibility with an EV pickup is crucial"" Brinley said. ""The challenge for automakers is to [build] EVs that create a similar emotional and aspirational reaction.""

Dodge's burly large V8 engines have helped lift sales at the struggling marque and attract buyers who demand insane horsepower and thrilling speeds. Its 2021 Durango SRT Hellcat SUV ""the most powerful SUV ever"" can easily whip the competition: A supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi Hellcat V8 engine delivers 710 horses and 645 lb.-ft. of torque. Loyalists were stunned when Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis declared last month that V8s no longer have a place in the ""Golden Age of muscle cars.""

""The days of an iron block supercharged 6.2-liter V8 are numbered"" Kuniskis told CNBC on Jan. 26. ""They’re absolutely numbered because of all the compliance costs. But the performance that those vehicles generate is not numbered.""

Big powerful and rumbly V8 engines are a hallmark of Dodge Chargers. Dodge

Plenty of automakers continue to crank out vehicles with thundering V8s extending their expiration date. BMW recently revealed its 2022 M5 CS the quickest and most powerful production BMW car ever built. A 4.4-liter M TwinPower turbo V8 engine propels the sporty sedan from 0 to 60 mph in 2.9 seconds.

The 4.4-liter M TwinPower turbo V8 engine in the 2022 BMW M5 CS has been tuned to deliver 627 hp at 6000 rpm. BMW

GM's Cadillac division answered enthusiasts' pleas with its CT5-V Blackwing a 668-hp track star with a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 that can reach speeds above 200 mph (it also comes with a six-speed manual transmission).

The Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing with its 6.2-liter supercharged V8 will be the fastest and most powerful Cadillac ever. Cadillac

V8s are offered in five Lexus models -- the LX GX RC F LC 500 and LC 500 convertible -- and in Toyota's Tundra pickup truck Sequoia and Land Cruiser SUVs.

""Every model with a V8 had stronger sales in December 2020 than it did in December 2019"" according to Lisa Materazzo group vice president of Toyota Marketing.

The Lexus LC 500's powerful 5.0-liter naturally aspirated V8 engine makes 471 hp. Lexus

Like its rivals Toyota has accepted a reality of zero-emissions vehicles. The Japanese company will debut three new electrified models -- two BEVs and a plug-in hybrid -- in the U.S. later this year.

Randy Nonnenberg president and co-founder of Bring a Trailer said 1960s and 70s muscle cars with V8s are trending on the online auction platform.

""Collectors are nostalgic for older V8s"" he told ABC News. ""They represent muscle and horsepower. Motorsports and drag racing are highly identifiable with V8s.""

Jonathan Klinger a vice president at collectible car insurer Hagerty told ABC News the ""love affair"" with American muscle cars and V8s won't end when EVs rule the roads.

""The V8 engine absolutely has its place in the automotive space and will continue to"" he asserted. ""The traditional V8 engine -- and even an ICE engine -- are going to remain desirable to a group of enthusiasts. It's hard to replicate the muscular deeper engine note in a V8.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ibG9nLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzEzL2ZvcmQtZjE1MC1yb2NrZXQtbGVhZ3VlLWdhbWluZy1yb3VuZHVwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starting Feb 20 you'll be able to play Rocket League with a F-150,"Autoblog may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.

Jim Hackett retired from his role as CEO of the Ford Motor Company last year and has now found an even more comfortable seat on the Board of Directors at American furniture manufacturer La-Z-Boy.

The appointment actually makes a lot of sense when you look at Hackett’s background. Before moving to Ford in 2017 he spent 30 years at Steelcase a Michigan-based office furniture company.

“Jim is a welcome addition to our board” said Kurt L. Darrow Chairperson President and CEO of La-Z-Boy. “An astute thought leader his keen understanding of the consumer is matched by his ability to quickly identify changes in the marketplace and marry the two together with innovative product offerings.”

The move actually means that La-Z-Boy’s Board of Directors will grow to 10 members. Ford’s ex CEO will serve on the Audit Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee.

Hackett announced his retirement from Ford in October 2020. The decision to step down a year ahead of schedule meant that Jim Farley who was COO at the time ascended to the role of CEO.

Farley is Ford’s third CEO in six years and is overseeing the company through a sea change. Hackett meanwhile was in charge during a massive shakeup of his own and saw the discontinuation of nearly every passenger car in the automaker’s North American lineup to make room for more trucks SUVs and crossovers.

Whether or not his time at La-Z-Boy will be as adventurous as it was at Ford remains to be seen. The furniture company though seems pretty optimistic.

“With demonstrable career successes at both Steelcase and Ford including three decades of office furniture experience we are pleased to have the benefit of his insight foresight and wisdom as we move into our next phase of growth” said Darrow. “Jim will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to our company.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9mYWN0Y2hlY2svMjAyMS8wMi8xMy9mYWN0LWNoZWNrLXF1b3RlLWNyaXRpcXVpbmctc29jaWFsaXNtLW1pc2F0dHJpYnV0ZWQtaGVucnktZm9yZC82NzM5MjE5MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fact check: Quote critiquing socialism misattributed to Henry Ford,"The claim: Henry Ford compared government assistance to treatment of Native Americans

A nearly 2-year-old Facebook post comparing socialism to the treatment of American Indians by the U.S. government recently went viral.

The comparison was purportedly made by Henry Ford the entrepreneur and founder of the Ford Motor Co.

According to the meme posted on March 3 2019 to the account Americans Against Socialism Ford said ""Any man who thinks he can be prosperous by letting the government take care of him better take a closer look at the American Indian.""

Americans Against Socialism is the Facebook site for far-right news and opinion blogs The Raging Patriot and Freedom Press.

USA TODAY reached out to the poster for comment.

Proponents of capitalism often consider socialism – an economic system where the means of production are controlled by social democratic systems according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy – an inferior economic model. The means of production are owned and maintained privately under capitalism.

Ford oldest son of an immigrant who rose to prominence through innovation achieved success in part because of capitalism. But there is little substantive evidence tying him to the quote.

More:Fact check: Quote about guns has long been misattributed to Gloria Steinem

Where did the quote come from?

The statement is not included in a list of notable quotations on the website for The Henry Ford the museum of Ford's inventions in Dearborn Michigan.

The museum's research center does not verify Henry Ford quotes according to research specialist Stephanie Lucas.

""Henry Ford wrote numerous articles for a variety of periodicals and newspapers and the quotes attributed to him were varied and often unsubstantiated"" she told USA TODAY in an email.

Lucas confirmed that every quote on the museum's website has a verified citation.

Barry Popik an etymologist and contributor to the Oxford English Dictionary per his website said Ford never spoke the words in the claim.

""'Any man who thinks he can be happy and prosperous by letting the government take care of him better take a closer look at the American Indian' is a quote that has been credited to American industrialist Henry Ford (1863-1947) and has been popular during the presidency of Barack Obama (from 2009). There is no evidence that Ford ever said it"" Popik wrote in a Nov. 8 2013 post to his website.

A statement closely resembling the quote appeared in a Racine Wisconsin newspaper three years after Ford's death Popik says.

“Those who are plugging for socialism in this country because they want government to take care of them should look at the poor American Indians” Tex Reynolds of the Racine Journal-Times wrote in 1950 according to Popik.

American Indians and Alaskan Natives disproportionately experience higher poverty rates lower earnings and poorer health outcomes compared to the general population according to a 2012 report from the Social Security Office of Retirement and Disability Policy.

Various iterations of the quote have resurfaced over the decades in newspaper columns on T-shirts and bumper stickers in court statements and on social media per Popik's website.

The quote was again misattributed to Ford in Nov. 6 2013 tweet days before Popik's blog entry.

Turning Point USA a conservative youth group posted a meme with the quote to its Facebook page on Oct. 18 2019 with the caption ""Big Government HURTS Entire Communities! #BigGovSucks #ThinkForYourself."" It was once again misattributed to Ford.

Our rating: False

We rate this claim FALSE based on our research. A Facebook claim incorrectly attributed a quote comparing government assistance with the social conditions of American Indians to Henry Ford. There is no evidence that Ford ever said it according to etymologist Barry Popik and the statement is not included in a list of notable quotations on the website for The Henry Ford museum. The earliest evidence of the quote in print dates back to 1950 three years after Ford's death.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey selected the winning bid at a board meeting on Thursday afternoon to allow Silverstein Properties Brookfield Properties Omni New York LLC and Dabar Development Partners to lease the 1.56-million-square-foot mixed-use building under a 99-year ground lease.

The building will yield 190000 square feet of office space a 12000-square-foot community facility space 55000 square feet of public amenity space 7000 square feet of retail space and 1.2 million square feet of residential space divided into 1325 apartments. Of these 330 or 25 percent of the total inventory will be devoted to affordable housing. Five World Trade Center will be built on the former home of the 39-story Deustsche Bank Building which was heavily damaged on 9/11 and fully demolished by late January 2011. Today the Financial District site currently owned by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) sits to the south of the elevated Liberty Park and Santiago Calatrava‘s St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and is bound by Greenwich Street to the east Albany Street to the south and Washington Street to the west.

Renderings show a curtain wall of floor-to-ceiling glass with rounded corners and a large-scale grid of light-colored mullions with vertical members spanning several floors. A tall space near the middle of the superstructure will add a visual break to the uniform exterior surface with clear glass and and a subtle setback that could likely be devoted to a residential amenity level. Overall the envelope would depart from the sleek minimalist exterior finishes of the other four World Trade Center skyscrapers.

The diagram below highlights the location of each of the building’s programmatic functions. The lobby and retail will sit on the ground floor followed by communal space office floors mechanical levels and two floors of amenities and finally all of the residences spread across 69 levels that rest above the multi-story podium setback up to the flat roof parapet. It looks like the total floor count is around 80 stories.

After nearly two decades in the making Five World Trade Center will be the first building in the World Trade Center complex to feature residential living space and is projected to create 10000 construction jobs 1900 permanent jobs and $1.9 billion in economic output.

Construction is expected to commence in 2023 and finish in 2028.

LINCOLN PROJECT'S POLITICAL FUTURE IN PERIL AFTER CONTROVERSIES WOUND GROUP

Journalists and political pundits have criticized The Lincoln Project in recent weeks after reporters revealed inappropriate communications between co-founder John Weaver and various young men which the PAC did not publicly comment on or take action against until this year despite prior warnings about his conduct.

EX-LINCOLN PROJECT MEMBERS CALL FOR INDEPENDENT PROBE INTO WEAVER ALLEGATIONS SAY MORE VICTIMS REACHING OUT

There is no evidence that The Lincoln Project buried the allegations against Weaver for business reasons. But taken together the harassment allegations and new revelations about spending practices raise significant questions about the management of one of the highest-profile antagonists of Trump.

The revelations threaten the stature of not just the Lincoln Project but the broader coalition of establishment-oriented Republican groups hoping to pool their resources to excise Trump from the party.

LINCOLN PROJECT BEING ASKED TO RELEASE FORMER EMPLOYEES FROM NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS

Lincoln Project co-founder Stephen Schmidt insisted that he and the rest of the group's leadership were not aware of any internal allegations of wrongdoing involving Weaver.

""No Lincoln Project employee intern or contractors ever made an allegation of inappropriate communication about John Weaver that would have triggered an investigation by HR or by an outside employment counsel"" Schmidt said. ""In other words no human being ever made an allegation about any inappropriate sexualized communications about John Weaver ever.""

Overall the envelope would depart from the sleek minimalist exterior finishes of the other four World Trade Center skyscrapers.

The diagram below highlights the location of each of the building’s programmatic functions. The lobby and retail will sit on the ground floor followed by communal space office floors mechanical levels and two floors of amenities and finally all of the residences spread across 69 levels that rest above the multi-story podium setback up to the flat roof parapet. It looks like the total floor count is around 80 stories.

After nearly two decades in the making Five World Trade Center will be the first building in the World Trade Center complex to feature residential living space and is projected to create 10000 construction jobs 1900 permanent jobs and $1.9 billion in economic output.

Construction is expected to commence in 2023 and finish in 2028.

LINCOLN PROJECT'S POLITICAL FUTURE IN PERIL AFTER CONTROVERSIES WOUND GROUP

Journalists and political pundits have criticized The Lincoln Project in recent weeks after reporters revealed inappropriate communications between co-founder John Weaver and various young men which the PAC did not publicly comment on or take action against until this year despite prior warnings about his conduct.

EX-LINCOLN PROJECT MEMBERS CALL FOR INDEPENDENT PROBE INTO WEAVER ALLEGATIONS SAY MORE VICTIMS REACHING OUT

There is no evidence that The Lincoln Project buried the allegations against Weaver for business reasons. But taken together the harassment allegations and new revelations about spending practices raise significant questions about the management of one of the highest-profile antagonists of Trump.

The revelations threaten the stature of not just the Lincoln Project but the broader coalition of establishment-oriented Republican groups hoping to pool their resources to excise Trump from the party.

Read this article on the new Outside+ app available now on iOS devices for members! Download the app.

In late 2010 a backcountry skier on Colorado’s Berthoud Pass was causing major trouble for local search and rescue teams. Under the incorrect belief that an avalanche transceiver and a personal locator beacon (PLB) were the same thing he’d push the SOS signal on his PLB every time he was about to drop into a run.

Over the course of a few weeks the unidentified skier pushed the button on his unregistered device six times causing search and rescue (SAR) teams from Clear Creek Gilpin and Jefferson counties—most of whom are unpaid volunteers—to scramble into action. When they arrived at the location of the distress signal all they found were ski tracks.

Eventually once the authorities figured out the signal was coming from the same unregistered device SAR teams stopped responding to the signal according to The Denver Post. Authorities later discovered that every time the Berthoud Pass skier triggered a SAR response he was never actually wearing an avalanche transceiver.

Not only did this skier unnecessarily dispatch SAR but he also put the rescue professionals in a difficult position: They decided to ignore the SOS calls from that particular PLB but what if that skier had actually had an emergency? This real-life example demonstrates how essential it is that backcountry skiers know how to use their safety equipment properly.

In 2019 according to Snowsports Industries of America backcountry skiing continued to be the fastest-growing segment of winter sports in North America. Meanwhile over the past decade backcountry rescue devices have become even more complex and diverse. Avalanche transceivers are considered mandatory for all backcountry skiers (as well as knowledge of how to use them) while PLBs are less commonly found on backcountry skiers. That said a PLB is still an essential piece of backcountry safety gear. In addition RECCO reflectors and other devices are recommended for those traveling into ski terrain beyond chairlifts.

Knowing the difference between the three as well as how to use them can save you and your backcountry partners—and local authorities—a lot of time in an emergency situation.

Note: There is no rescue device that can replace the knowledge gained in an avalanche education course certified by the American Avalanche Association (AAA) and/or the American Institute for Avalanche Research and Education (AIARE).

Be sure to get educated before going into the backcountry.

Avalanche Transceivers

Sometimes called avy beacons avalanche transceivers are devices that actively transmit and search for an electronic signal at a limited range. They are specifically designed to locate victims buried by avalanches and are generally regarded as the fastest way to find someone in a full burial. Because of this they are typically listed first in the three avalanche rescue items skiers need when venturing into the backcountry: transceiver shovel probe.

There is NO substitute for using an avalanche transceiver during backcountry travel.

There are a variety of brands and models of avalanche transceivers on the market. Whichever you choose the most important thing is that your transceiver—and your partners’ transceiver—operate at the 457 kHz range which has been the industry standard since the early 1990s.

Like most electronics the functionality of avalanche transceivers can waver and deteriorate over time. That’s why it’s a good idea to replace your transceiver every three to four years. Plus similar to upgrading a smartphone updating an avalanche transceiver every few seasons will provide users with newer features faster processors and with sufficient practice possibly make finding someone in an emergency situation more efficient.

For recreational skiers there has never been a better time to upgrade an avalanche transceiver. Many brands are making extremely easy-to-use reasonably priced options that have simple displays and minimal bells and whistles. Some of SKI’s favorites include the Black Diamond Recon BT the BCA Tracker S and the Mammut Barryvox.

Guide- and professional-level transceivers feature more complex functionality but at an increased cost. While these functions when used properly can be very helpful in extreme emergency situations they require more practice and training to be implemented properly. SKI’s picks for professional-level options include the Ortovox S1+ the Arva Neo+ and the BCA Tracker 3.

Regardless of the brand and model the most important thing to remember about avalanche transceivers is how to use them and to practice using them often. Many ski areas now have avalanche transceiver practice areas specifically for this purpose. Teaming up with a few friends in a safe area to use transceivers for various types of hide-and-seek games is another great option.

RECCO Reflectors and Detectors

If you’ve purchased a shell or bib pants for skiing in the past few years there is probably a RECCO reflector inside. Reflectors are also starting to find their way into ski boots helmets belts and even into avalanche transceivers.

RECCO reflectors are NOT a substitute for an avalanche transceiver.

A RECCO reflector is a passive object that can reflect a radar signal back to a RECCO detector which can help locate a buried avalanche victim. RECCO reflectors are generally considered a back-up option should someone be buried in an avalanche without an avalanche transceiver or if a transceiver is damaged in an avalanche.

While RECCO reflectors are quite small and becoming ubiquitous in ski outerwear RECCO detectors are quite large cumbersome expensive and generally only used by ski patrol SAR and heli-skiing operations. The modern handheld RECCO detector is about the size of a college textbook with a handle which makes it less than ideal for recreational skiers to haul around on ever ski tour. RECCO detectors have become more common for North American snow safety professionals and SAR teams.

Over the past few years SAR teams in North America and Europe have begun using the RECCO SAR Helicopter Detector. About the size of a keg of beer the heli detector can cover a huge amount of terrain quickly (one square kilometer in six minutes according to the company). This obviously expedites the “search” aspect for SAR teams when it comes to finding a missing person in the wilderness and it’s why RECCO reflectors are finding their way into more summer-specific equipment in addition to all types of winter gear.

The most important thing about RECCO reflectors for recreational backcountry users is to know if your partner has one or more reflectors on their person. This information can be critical in an emergency situation for ski patrol SAR and other authorities in order to know what equipment to use. If you want to add more RECCO reflectors to your kit the company makes reflector belts stick-on reflectors and a reflector that can loop on to a backpack.

Personal Locator Beacons and Satellite Messengers

PLBs have come a long way since 2010. Originally designed for SOS and one-way message transmission brands like Spot Garmin and BivyStick now make devices with two-way SMS messaging options Bluetooth phone connectivity and sleek real-time mapping software that can be shared privately or publicly on the internet.

Regardless PLBs are NOT a substitute for an avalanche transceiver.

If there is an emergency in the backcountry where there is little or no cell phone service PLBs can be a lifeline for summoning nearby SAR operations. That’s why it’s a great idea for backcountry travelers to have a PLB in addition to an avalanche transceiver and RECCO reflectors.

Although there is no substitute for having avalanche burial rescue training as well as wilderness medical training being able to have professionals on their way when needed is important when time matters.

The two-way messaging features found on most new PLBs are also very handy especially in backcountry zones with limited cell phone service. Besides being able to check in throughout the day with status and location information two-way messaging devices can also be a great way to let the right people know that everything is OK when an adventure takes longer than expected or if a rendezvous spot has changed.

Spot Garmin and BivyStick offer various devices with SOS mapping software and two-way SMS messaging via a Bluetooth connection to a smartphone with a subscription plan. Only the Spot X device however offers all of the above with a Blackberry-style keyboard on the device itself a critical feature should the smartphone’s battery die. That makes the Spot X the ideal choice for extended adventures beyond the range of cell phone service.

While it’s true that any backcountry skier needs an avalanche transceiver before any other type of backcountry rescue device adding at least one RECCO reflector to your kit and a PLB would be a great idea for you and your backcountry partners. Keep in mind that any rescue device is only as functional as the person using it so be sure to read all instructions for every device and take at least one AAA or AIARE-certified avalanche education course before heading out beyond the ropes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnQzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BvbGFyLXZlcml0eS1zZW5zZS1wcmljZS1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Polar Verity Sense heart rate monitor tracks pulse more reliably than Garmin and Fitbit watches,"Verity Sense might sound like a name of a news anchor but it's actually a new heart rate monitor from the Finnish fitness brand Polar. A successor to the popular Polar OH1 arm strap the Verity Sense takes a very different approach to chest heart rate monitors: it's an optical heart rate monitor that attaches to your arm or temple. The second way of wearing it is primarily for swimmers and Verity Sense can be attached to a pair of swimming goggles. It could also work equally as well worn under a headband although the band needs to be rather tight in order to keep the sensor close to the skin.

With a number of additional features also included Verity Sense could be a very good alternative for those who find chest straps too cumbersome and wrist heart-rate monitoring – as used on Garmin watches Fitbit trackers and all smartwatches – too unreliable.

Lately Polar has released a number of new products including the Polar Unite fitness tracker and the Polar Grit X outdoor watch and the Polar Vantage V2 premium running watch. The Verity Sense seems to be using a different optical heart rate sensor that's found in Polar's running watch range (Precision Prime) we are looking forward to seeing just how precise this system is.

(Image credit: Polar)

The Polar Verity Sense is available to purchase from 17 February 2021 at Polar US Polar UK and Polar Australia for a recommended retail price of $89.95 / £79.50 / AUD $129.

Polar Verity Sense: main features

The Verity Sense brings several added advantages to Polar’s existing heart rate sensor product line which now includes four different models. The new sensor is built to work with a wide variety of products including cycling computers treadmills and turbo trainers: the sensor pairs easily through dual Bluetooth and ANT+ connectivity. This enables real-time heart rate monitoring on a connected device or app or afterwards through transferred data from recorded sessions.

Compared to the Polar OH1 the Verity Sense has a significantly improved battery life: while the Polar OH1 only lasts for 12 hours in between charges the Verity Sense can record workout data for 20 hours straight on a single charge.

Talking about workout data: the Verity Sense also boasts 12 MB bigger memory compared to the OH1 (16 MB in total) which equals to 600 hours of training data. The Verity Sense improved its Bluetooth range too which is now 75 meters wider Bluetooth with omnidirectional antenna (150 meters in total).

Swimmers will appreciate the Verity Sense's swimming mode: with the swimming goggle strap clip against the temple it tracks heart rate distance and pace – automatically in the pool. As well as providing heart rate readings under water the Verity Sense can also be slipped around the arm or placed anywhere snugly and firmly against the skin under tight-fitting clothing meaning that it can probably measure heart rate more accurately during HIIT workouts or kettlebell exercises when the weight rests on the wrists.

The remote and high altitude route runs from Durango to Denver through the San Juan Sawatch and Front Range mountains. In his own words “it was absolutely brutal.”

“I rode it during the summer but it still was some of my coldest memories on a bike” says the man who’s gained a reputation of riding a fine line between world-class cyclist and professional masochist. “One night I had to emergency bivy at 13000 feet. I have quite a bit of nerve damage in my fingers from that ride. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done by a significant amount. The elevation rough trail weather and wear and tear on your body adds up.”

A strong statement for someone who in the same year set records on the 2000-kilometer GBDuro and Kokopelli Trail and broke the Everesting record twice in one week.

Now residing in Boulder Colorado the Australia native admits that riding in the cold didn’t come naturally: “I had a steep learning curve. When I first moved here it was January. I was determined to get up in the mountains every day and didn’t understand why other riders weren’t doing the same. I wasn’t accustomed to checking the weather and on the third or fourth day out I got caught in a storm my gears stopped working everything was iced up and I was in a bad situation quickly.”

Since then Morton has learned systems for staying warm and safe which help him ride outside for most of winter. Check out his favorite tips and gear and you might start thinking like he does: “Winter riding is really enjoyable because it’s different. It feels epic no matter what.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnQzLmNvbS9yZXZpZXdzL2FtYXpmaXQtZ3RzLTJlLXJldmlld9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazfit GTS 2e review: Cheap but performant Fitbit Versa 3 alternative,"Amazfit GTS 2e review TL;DR: Cheap it might be the Amazfit GTS 2e packs a punch and delivers a decent fitness watch experience on a budget.

Amazfit has been busy establishing itself as not just another no-name Chinese smartwatch manufacturer in the last few years and with the GTS 2e it really hit the nail on the head. The smaller sibling to the Amazfit GTS 2 the GTS 2e has an Apple Watch-like body and sports Fitbit-like features for a budget-friendly price.

After testing the 'premium' Zepp E health smartwatch at the end of last year I was slightly concerned that a running watch from the same brand not touted as premium might be of poor quality. Maybe because of this bias I was pleasantly surprised by the overall design and the included health and fitness features of the Amazfit GTS 2e.

Sure the GTS 2e might not rival high-end performance running wearables such as the Garmin Fenix 6 Pro or the Polar Vantage V but it provides a very decent user experience nevertheless.

Amazfit GTS 2e: Price and availability

The Amazfit GTS 2e is available to buy now for $139.99 / £119.

In the UK the Amazfit GTS 2e can be purchased at Amazon and Argos.

Amazfit GTS 2e review: Design and ergonomics

The Amazfit GTS 2e is not a bad looking smartwatch. It has a 1.65"" 'HD' AMOLED display with a resolution of 348 x 442 pixels (341 PPI) hidden under a '2.5D' curved tempered glass lens. The glass blends nicely with the bezel making it look bigger than how large it actually is.

Not like a 1.65"" screen is small but the smooth transition between the edge of the screen and the bezel has a similar effect to infinity pools on top of high-rises: since you can't tell where the pool ends and the sky starts your brain automatically assumes they are all the same.

The display and the switching between the different widget views are both sharp and fast maybe not quite as responsive as the Zepp E but on par with even more expensive touchscreen smartwatches such as the Fitbit Versa 3. There is one physical button on the edge of the case which confused me a bit at first: it has a 'digital crown' design but it can't be rotated so it is basically 'just' a push button.

That aside controlling the GTS 2e is pretty intuitive and the menus can be found where you expect them to be. Should you ever get lost in all the submenus you can always press the physical button to take you back to the watch face which also happens to be the home screen.

I didn't much like the strap on the Zepp E and was expecting the Amazfit GTS 2e to come with an even poorer quality strap but surprisingly it is pretty decent and definitely better than the one included with the Zepp E. It's smooth silicon and during the test it didn't break anywhere which is great for a watch priced as low as the GTS 2e.

Amazfit GTS 2e review: Activity and health tracking

The Amazfit GTS 2e is not a running watch per se but it has 90 sport modes and a bunch of fitness and health features that make it ideal for tracking both indoor and outdoor fitness activities. For example just like the Fitbit Versa 3 the GTS 2e comes with built-in GPS which might not be hyper-accurate – according to the map view in the Zepp App I clipped through some buildings during my runs – but tracks distance relatively precisely.

The GTS 2e can also monitor heart rate 24/7 so not just during physical activities. The optical heart rate sensor gave me completely different readings from the Polar Vantage V2 a watch I tested at the same time as the GTS 2e. For obvious reasons I tend to believe that the Vantage V2 reads heart rate more accurately but that said for everyday activities the sensor accuracy of the GTS 2e seems good enough. I wouldn't choose it over a Garmin Forerunner 745 for a long-distance race but for jogging and moving around in space during the day it is perfectly fine.

Based on your activity throughout the day you are given a Personal Activity Intelligence – or PAI for short – score which is essentially the same thing as Fitbit's Active Zone Minutes and Garmin's Intensity Minutes feature. The standard weekly PAI score goal is 150 in line with the WHO-recommended 150 minutes a week physical activity threshold.

Other sensors include a pulse ox (blood-oxygen saturation) sensor which is something we've also seen in Fitbit Apple and Garmin wearables before. A low blood oxygen saturation is called hypoxemia which is a ""sign of a problem related to breathing or circulation and may result in various symptoms such as shortness of breath"" according to Mayo Clinic.

You can also monitor your sleep quality with the Amazfit GTS 2e and I found this feature to be pretty accurate from the get-go. In the Zepp App you can further scrutinise your sleep data e.g. how much deep sleep you had the night before. Here you are also provided with some pretty generic tips on how to improve sleep. Who would've thought that reducing stress would improve sleep?

Does Amazfit GTS 2e have GPS?

The Amazfit GTS 2e does have a GPS chip on board which is quite unusual for a smartwatch in this price range. Better still it uses multi-system positioning (GPS + GLONASS) which is generally more accurate than single-system options not like there are many of those in 2021. However as usual having GPS on will significantly reduce battery life compared to standby mode.

Amazfit GTS 2e review: Battery life

The Amazfit GTS 2e really shines when it comes to battery life. Officially the 246 mAh battery found in the GTS 2e can last up to two weeks in smartwatch mode and up to 24 days (!) in watch mode. According to the Amazfit website the GTS 2e will last up to a week even considering heavy use which I assume means the sensors are on and the screen is used often.

Better still the watch charges from 0-100 per cent in about two hours so you won't need to attach it to the weird-looking magnetic charger too often. I was generally pleased with the battery life and only had to charge the watch once to see if it lives up to the 2-hour charge time claim (it does). It's amazing to see that a light smartwatch with an AMOLED screen and built-in GPS can last so long between two charges. Other manufacturers could learn from this: consider the 18-hour battery life of the Apple Watch.

Amazfit GTS 2e review: The Zepp App

All data from the sensors are fed into the Zepp App which is definitely not the worst companion app I've seen so far. The dashboard has all the main stats clearly displayed such as steps heart rate stress sleep and PAI score. You can also click into each section and see everything in more detail too as well as change the watch and widget settings.

I mentioned this in the Zepp E review but there are some Chinese-to-English translation errors in the app that I find particularly entertaining. For example the second icon on the navigation bar is called 'Enjoy' and in this section you'll find enjoyable features such as the alarm clock and schedule. You also find the watch face store here which is admittedly more fun than the other features mentioned above.

Overall The Zepp App is a pretty decent app and I'm sure the language barrier hiccups will be ironed out soon.

Amazfit GTS 2e review: Verdict

All things considered the Amazfit GTS 2e is an excellent value for money health-cum-fitness smartwatch. It has its shortcomings but those are few and far between especially if you are using the watch to track fairly light physical activities rather than hardcore athletic performance.

For its low price the build quality of the Amazfit GTS 2e is excellent and the specs are admirable too: for a little bit over a $100/£100 you'll get a fitness watch that has an AMOLED display aluminium body built-in GPS an optical heart rate sensor and a number of health and fitness features. The watch is easy to use and the touchscreen is also highly functional with not much lag either.

The only criticism I can offer is that the Amazfit GTS 2e lacks innovation. As opposed to coming up with new ideas the watch takes features found in other watches and offers them for less money. But even so I can forgive the Amazfit GTS 2e as it does it all so effortlessly. For this price the watch is a real bargain. For those who don't want their fitness watch to also be a status symbol the Amazfit GTS 2e is the perfect choice.

Amazfit GTS 2e review: Also consider

The Fitbit Versa 3 might be more expensive than the Amazfit GTS 2e but the brand is admittedly more established and tries harder to innovate. The Versa 3 introduced substantial updates over the Versa 2 such as built-in GPS and a more handsome design and user interface and did it without a price increase. The inductive button might take some time to get used to though.

The Apple Watch SE is even more expensive although still cheaper than your average Apple Watch. From our review: ""The Apple Watch SE is a truly excellent smartwatch and where Apple has cut back for the more budget price you won't notice it significantly in general use. It feels like a full Apple Watch experience with all the advantages that bring in convenience fitness tracking and health and safety features… for iPhone users. As ever Android users need not apply.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbmVub3cuaW4vbm9ydGgtZWFzdC1uZXdzL2Fzc2FtL3NvbGVtYXRlLXJ1bi1oYWxmLW1hcmF0aG9uLWluLWd1d2FoYXRpLXRvLW1hcmstdmFsZW50aW5lcy1kYXkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solemate Run: Half Marathon in Guwahati to mark Valentine's Day,"A Half Marathon called the Garmin 21K Solemate Run was organised in Guwahati on Sunday to mark the Valentine’s Day celebration.

The pair could be spouses siblings parents friends or anyone who could run and the team had to cross the finish line together.

This was the first edition of Garmin Solemate Run.

It was a 21 km run held at the picturesque Panbari area near Chandrapur on the outskirts of the city.

“The running course consisted of some hilly sections with decent elevation and some plain sections as well” the organisers said.

The run was well received by the running enthusiasts in Guwahati.

The participants said they were happy with all the arrangements made for the event as well as the location the organisers stated.

Simanta Baruah and Bitumani Baruah achieved the first position while Dhiraj Pegu and Bikash Haloi were adjudged the first runners-up.

The position of second runners-up was achieved by the husband-wife duo – Rajendra Bisht and Sunita Bisht.

The run was powered by Garmin and was managed by Spokehub.

Garmin makes various types of GPS navigation enabled sports fitness and outdoor activity products.

They had recently opened their first exclusive store in Guwahati.

The event was also supported by Energy Drinks partner Redbull."

The report did not show that. Prices were not volatile but it does look like we set a top.

USDA did not deliver the bullish numbers the trade was presuming were inevitable and prices sold off as a result. Wheat and corn had an outside day lower on report day and because corn had established a contract high before the report was released its outside day lower became a key reversal. Soybeans closed higher on that day but they sold off the following day as both wheat and corn continued their selling.

Seasonally there is a strong tendency for grains to put in a high in early February often around the crop report. We clearly have that kind of price action this year and that suggests we will likely see more downside through the next few weeks.

Wheat tried to find some support late in the week on concerns of crop damage from the extreme cold temps bearing down on the Southern Plains some of which has no snow cover. There may be some damage but we won't know the extent for several weeks and the market is unlikely to stay supported for that long on just that fundamental issue.

More important to the wheat market in the near term are that world FOB offers are declining and support from corn has diminished after USDA's lack of supply concern. Russian FOB offers this week hovered around $290/MT down $9/MT from last week (down around $.25/bu). The onerous export tax imposed by the Russian government has succeeded in pushing their farmers to sell wheat and exporters are putting out offers – and getting some business.

World cash is unlikely to decline very much as the tax will keep Russian cash high but it appears we have found a ceiling in cash price for now. As of June 1 their tax will increase to 70 euro/MT over $200/MT which will force their offers higher and thus world prices higher. By then we will know what our own crop looks like and have a good idea of the remaining Northern Hemisphere's as well.

Wheat export sales were a solid 635 TMT much higher than the high end of estimates. Market year-to-date sales are at 23.2 MMT up 1.2 MMT (+5%) over last year. Corn sales last week were 1.5 MMT; market year-to-date sales sit at 57.5 MMT up a whopping 34 MMT over last year (+142%). Soybeans export sales last week were 984 TMT; market year-to-date sales are at 59.4 MMT up 27 MMT over last year (+81%).

These huge demand bases are the main reason the grain complex is in such a strong bull market. This week's sell-off won't change the demand base or the tight supply of U.S. crops. If anything the lack of concern over corn supplies could exacerbate the tightness especially given the late planting of the Southern American second-season crop.

I expect that the seasonal will keep prices in check/moving lower for the next few weeks but as we get into winter wheat's growing season and spring planting I look for prices to resume their upward trend.",,,,,,,,,

Generally the sooner you file your taxes the sooner you’ll see your refund in the bank (and it reduces the chances of tax fraud). The amount that you receive — if any — depends on a number of factors including how much of your income isn’t subject to tax withholding how many deductions and credits you claim and how you filled out your W-4 which is the form your employer uses to determine how much to withhold from your paycheck for income taxes.

Even if you’re a procrastinator you’ll want to file your tax return before the April 15 2021 tax deadline. And if you think you’re getting a refund you’ll want to know what to expect and how to protect it.

What’s the Average Tax Refund?

For the 2020 filing season which covers returns filed for the 2019 calendar year the average federal tax refund for individuals was $2707.

The average tax refund also varies by state. For instance in Maine the average refund was just over $2314 but in Texas the average taxpayer got back $3191. But before you get jealous of those living in Texas remember that receiving a tax refund just means you made an interest-free loan to Uncle Sam and the government is now paying you back for the extra amounts that were taken out of your paycheck.

Here’s a look at the average tax refund issued by state for 2019 fiscal year listed from highest average refund amount to lowest:

In past years the IRS would issue most tax refunds within 21 days; however the agency is taking longer to process all mailed items because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain other things can delay the processing of your refund including the following:

Story continues

Incomplete returns

Returns with errors

Returns affected by identity theft or fraud

Returns with claims for the earned income tax credit or additional child tax credit

Returns with Form 8379 injured spouse allocation which can take up to 14 weeks to process

Within 24 hours of e-filing or four weeks of filing by mail you can visit the IRS “Where’s My Refund” site to check the IRS refund schedule and the status of your refund. Information on the site is updated daily typically overnight.

What to Do With Your Refund

In a 2019 GOBankingRates survey 27 percent of respondents said they would put their tax refund toward paying off debt. Once you get your refund it might be tempting to treat yourself and spend it. But paying down or paying off debts is a smarter choice — if you pay off a credit card for example you can reduce your credit utilization ratio and bump up your credit score.

Other financially sound options for your tax refund include the following:

Padding your emergency fund

Contributing to a retirement plan

Improving the value of your home by tackling home renovations

Making charitable contributions that you can deduct from your next return

Investing the money in stocks or CDs

Investing in yourself with a fitness or certification program

Remember that you don’t have to make an “all-or-nothing” choice with your refund; you can tuck most of it away in investments or home improvements for example but still treat your family to a night out with a small portion of your refund.

Methodology: In order to discover the average IRS tax refund amount by state GOBankingRates used the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) “SOI Tax Stats – State Data FY 2019” (the latest data available) to find (1) individual income tax and employment tax refunds issued and (2) individual income tax and employment tax total refunds issued in USD. With these two figures isolated for all 50 states GOBankingRates only had to divide the two to find (3) the average tax refund amount for every state. All data was collected on and up to date as of January 11 2021.

During Q4 2020 the company generated $105 million in revenue which was 2% less than the $107 million reported in Q4 2019 but still enough to beat analyst guidance by $2.8 million. However in terms of Protolabs’ full-year financials it earned just $434 million in revenue 5% less than the $458 million generated in FY 2019.

The results represent a return to annual revenue decline for the company after it managed to achieve growth between Q2 and Q3 2020 via a 6.5% quarterly rebound. Predictably Protolabs’ shares fell slightly by 2.1% following the publication of the results declining in value from $200.26 to $195.96 by midday trading on Friday.

According to outgoing Protolabs CEO and President Vicki Holt the firm’s employees showed great resilience during 2020 especially given the challenging COVID-hit macroeconomic climate. “Protolabs responded very well in the face of unforeseen challenges driven by the emergence of the global pandemic” said Holt.

“As an organization we prioritized the health of our employees while continuing to serve our customers and advance our long-term business opportunities” she added. “Our digital manufacturing model allowed us to help our customers produce parts at market leading turnaround times to respond to COVID-19.”

Protolabs’ FY 2020 financials

Protolobs broadly reports its financial results across four key segments: Injection Molding CNC Machining 3D Printing and Sheet Metal. In terms of net revenue contribution Injection Molding remains the company’s biggest earner and over the course of 2020 it generated $218 million marginally more than the $217 million reported in FY 2019.

With regards to 3D printing the division’s revenue also increased rising from $61 million in FY 2019 to $62.5 million in FY 2020. This moderate growth was evident in Q4 2020 as well as the segment’s revenue rose from $15.7 million in Q4 2019 to $16 million showing that demand in one of Protolabs’ key verticals is still going strong.

The majority of the company’s revenue decline originated in its CNC Machining division which generated just $132 million across FY 2020 15% less than the $155 million reported in FY 2019. Protolabs’ Sheet Metal revenue also fell during the same period from $21 million to $19 million a comparative reduction of around 10%.

When sorted by geographical area the United States remains the firm’s best revenue driver bringing in $346 million over the course of FY 2020 but this still represents a 4% decline. Elsewhere Protolabs generated $75 million in revenue from its European business and $14 million in Japan constituting annual decreases of 11% and 14% respectively.

Revenue Stream (USD) FY 2019 FY 2020 Variance (%) Injection Molding 217.4m 218m +0.2 CNC Machining 155m 132m -15 3D Printing 61m 62.5m +2.5 Sheet Metal 21m 19m -10 Other 3.5m 3.5m – Total 458m 434m -5

Breaking down a difficult 2020

During an earnings call with analysts and investors Holt emphasized that despite the ongoing uncertainty caused by COVID-19 the company’s new manufacturing service holds the potential to return it to revenue growth. “We accomplished our number one priority entering 2020 the successful launch of Protolabs 2.0” said Holt.

“Protolabs 2.0 offers a much-improved customer experience that will allow us to maintain and extend our position as the leader in digital manufacturing” she added. “The launches went as expected and initial customer feedback has been very positive. As the economy continues its gradual recovery we expect higher retention moving forwards.”

The company’s CFO John Way added that while its number of developer clients fell by 15.7% in 2021 to 40267 this wasn’t related to the decline seen in its CNC Machining revenue. In fact Protolabs has invested $47 million in a dedicated UK complex as well as its expanded 5000 ft German facility which should see the division’s revenue begin to recover.

Elsewhere Protolabs extended its production capacity by installing both Carbon DLS and GE Additive X-Line 3D printers at its factories earlier this year. The company also grew its material offering by launching a cobalt chrome superalloy for its oil and gas clients something which no doubt helped to boost its 3D printing revenue.

New year new CEO new direction?

For the first time in seven years Protolabs is heading into a new fiscal year with a fresh CEO. Robert Bodor who takes over the reigns from March 1st 2021 thanked Holt on the call for her “passionate leadership” and expressed a desire to continue growing the business following the firm’s $280 million acquisition of 3D Hubs.

“We’ve built our business by adding new services and expanding our envelope to manufacture a broader range of parts” said Bodor. “Our customers value this and continue to ask us to add more services and capabilities. With the launch of Protolabs 2.0 and the addition of 3D Hubs we are uniquely-positioned to capitalize on this.”

Moving forwards the company has promised to add new features to Protolabs 2.0 and roll-out its heat metal service on the platform. Later this year Protolabs also intends to integrate 3D Hubs’ network into its offering as a means of maximizing part availability although the firms will remain separate for the time being.

“The addition of 3D Hubs will allow us to expand how we serve customers. If we can’t make it we’ll find the right manufacturer to make it for you” concluded Bodor. “This is a truly exciting market-leading vision for digital manufacturing. We will bring the two organizations together to provide a single unified customer experience.”

Predictably Protolabs’ shares fell slightly by 2.1% following the publication of the results declining in value from $200.26 to $195.96 by midday trading on Friday.

According to outgoing Protolabs CEO and President Vicki Holt the firm’s employees showed great resilience during 2020 especially given the challenging COVID-hit macroeconomic climate. “Protolabs responded very well in the face of unforeseen challenges driven by the emergence of the global pandemic” said Holt.

“As an organization we prioritized the health of our employees while continuing to serve our customers and advance our long-term business opportunities” she added. “Our digital manufacturing model allowed us to help our customers produce parts at market leading turnaround times to respond to COVID-19.”

Protolabs’ FY 2020 financials

Protolobs broadly reports its financial results across four key segments: Injection Molding CNC Machining 3D Printing and Sheet Metal. In terms of net revenue contribution Injection Molding remains the company’s biggest earner and over the course of 2020 it generated $218 million marginally more than the $217 million reported in FY 2019.

With regards to 3D printing the division’s revenue also increased rising from $61 million in FY 2019 to $62.5 million in FY 2020. This moderate growth was evident in Q4 2020 as well as the segment’s revenue rose from $15.7 million in Q4 2019 to $16 million showing that demand in one of Protolabs’ key verticals is still going strong.

The majority of the company’s revenue decline originated in its CNC Machining division which generated just $132 million across FY 2020 15% less than the $155 million reported in FY 2019. Protolabs’ Sheet Metal revenue also fell during the same period from $21 million to $19 million a comparative reduction of around 10%.

When sorted by geographical area the United States remains the firm’s best revenue driver bringing in $346 million over the course of FY 2020 but this still represents a 4% decline. Elsewhere Protolabs generated $75 million in revenue from its European business and $14 million in Japan constituting annual decreases of 11% and 14% respectively.

Revenue Stream (USD) FY 2019 FY 2020 Variance (%) Injection Molding 217.4m 218m +0.2 CNC Machining 155m 132m -15 3D Printing 61m 62.5m +2.5 Sheet Metal 21m 19m -10 Other 3.5m 3.5m – Total 458m 434m -5

Breaking down a difficult 2020

During an earnings call with analysts and investors Holt emphasized that despite the ongoing uncertainty caused by COVID-19 the company’s new manufacturing service holds the potential to return it to revenue growth. “We accomplished our number one priority entering 2020 the successful launch of Protolabs 2.0” said Holt.

“Protolabs 2.0 offers a much-improved customer experience that will allow us to maintain and extend our position as the leader in digital manufacturing” she added. “The launches went as expected and initial customer feedback has been very positive. As the economy continues its gradual recovery we expect higher retention moving forwards.”

The company’s CFO John Way added that while its number of developer clients fell by 15.7% in 2021 to 40267 this wasn’t related to the decline seen in its CNC Machining revenue. In fact Protolabs has invested $47 million in a dedicated UK complex as well as its expanded 5000 ft German facility which should see the division’s revenue begin to recover.

Elsewhere Protolabs extended its production capacity by installing both Carbon DLS and GE Additive X-Line 3D printers at its factories earlier this year. The company also grew its material offering by launching a cobalt chrome superalloy for its oil and gas clients something which no doubt helped to boost its 3D printing revenue.

New year new CEO new direction?

For the first time in seven years Protolabs is heading into a new fiscal year with a fresh CEO. Robert Bodor who takes over the reigns from March 1st 2021 thanked Holt on the call for her “passionate leadership” and expressed a desire to continue growing the business following the firm’s $280 million acquisition of 3D Hubs.

“We’ve built our business by adding new services and expanding our envelope to manufacture a broader range of parts” said Bodor. “Our customers value this and continue to ask us to add more services and capabilities. With the launch of Protolabs 2.0 and the addition of 3D Hubs we are uniquely-positioned to capitalize on this.”

Moving forwards the company has promised to add new features to Protolabs 2.0 and roll-out its heat metal service on the platform. Later this year Protolabs also intends to integrate 3D Hubs’ network into its offering as a means of maximizing part availability although the firms will remain separate for the time being.

“The addition of 3D Hubs will allow us to expand how we serve customers. If we can’t make it we’ll find the right manufacturer to make it for you” concluded Bodor. “This is a truly exciting market-leading vision for digital manufacturing. We will bring the two organizations together to provide a single unified customer experience.”

GEN,Gen Digital,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZ2VuLXotbWlsbGVubmlhbHMtbWlkZGxlLWhhaXItcGFydC10aWt0b2vSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gen Z doesn't own the middle part. No one does.,"It brings me no pleasure to type these words but center parts are tearing the internet apart.

That's right. The timeless middle hair part is at the center of a recently sparked generational feud of dramatically epic proportions — one that's driving a wedge between members of Gen Z millennials and really anyone with a head of hair.

How could people be arguing about the placement of hair parts ever let alone in 2021? Amazing question. As with so many viral trends these days it all started on TikTok.

Basically a decent number of Gen Z TikTok users decided to start roasting millennials for doing ~millennial things~ like wearing skinny jeans and refusing to abandon their side parts. (It's a whole thing.) The Gen Z argument is essentially that side parts are less flattering and make a person look older so they're urging all millennials rocking side parts to do themselves a solid and reclaim their youth by achieving that elite scalp symmetry.

For the past few weeks I've watched in horror as my fellow millennials took the Gen Z middle part TikTok narrative as a deeply personal attack. Some broke down in what appeared to be mid-life crises wondering if their side parts had been aging them for years. Others caved to peer pressure and temporarily switched to center parts as an experiment. Then after being wildly disappointed by their trials they stubbornly switched back to side parts and rudely argued things like middle parts are ""STUPID!"" or ""scream 'I'm in elementary school!'""

The debate quite frankly is getting out of hand. So I'm here to settle it.

As a rare millennial who has proudly — without a single shred of shame — rocked the middle part for my entire life I feel I am the utmost authority on this particular topic.

First things first: Do I think the middle part makes me look younger than I actually am? Almost certainly. In 2016 when I was 23 years old I got carded when trying to buy a ticket to the famously inappropriate PG-13 movie La La Land. Upon realizing the film wasn't rated R like she'd thought however the woman let me slide. To this day I still occasionally get asked if I'm in high school or college and the middle part may be to blame. But hey if anything I'm taking my youthful appearance as a compliment!

Do I personally agree with members of Gen Z who are going to bat for my beloved middle part? Of course! But as I've learned from years of enduring light center part shaming from classmates friends and family members the middle part is not for everyone. And if there's one thing I can absolutely attest to from having had a part down the center of my head for the past 27 years it's that Gen Z didn't invent and doesn't own this hairstyle by any means.

When I told my mom — the woman who first bestowed my iconic middle part upon me — about this generational feud she got a bit defensive. ""You've worn a middle part your whole life. Sounds like if anything they stole it from you!"" she said. And you know what she's got a point.

Members of Gen Z may rep and worship the middle part and I love them for that but they shouldn't act cocky about it as if they're the ones who made the center part what it is today. I've been repping the middle part since before Gen Z was born and before I was born people older than me were doing the same. (Editor's note: Before this late Gen Xer switched to a buzzcut I was a middle parter going back to the late '70s.)

When I was younger my signature look (straightened hair with a middle part and face-framing angles) was inspired by former center part queen Amanda Bynes. Crucially Bynes is not a member of Gen Z nor are other famous middle parters including but not limited to Cher Meghan Markle and Megan Fox. It's worth noting too that there are countless other public figures born before 1996 who occasionally switch to and look great in a center part.

If you're a millennial who's a fan of the middle part that's fine. If you're a member of Gen Z who's a fan of the middle part that's also fine. If you're a fan of the side part the same rules apply. Do you see where I'm going with this? If you're 87 years old and want to rock a zig-zag part you should be able to go for it without anyone else weighing in as if it impacts them at all.

""You should be able to part your hair anywhere. Wherever makes you feel most comfortable."" -Mom

In the wise words of my mother ""You should be able to part your hair anywhere. Wherever makes you feel most comfortable."" Again she's right! I'd very much like to continue rocking my center without people assuming I'm doing so to look younger or because a younger generation bullied me into wearing one. As a die-hard middle parter I simply don't feel myself when I part my hair to the side. And I imagine that's how die-hard side parters feel when they try a middle part so who am I to tell them otherwise?

To members of Gen Z: Please stop telling other people how they should wear their hair. To my fellow millennials: Don't feel pressured to succumb to middle part peer pressure but don't you dare insult those who have one either.

Wear one part forever or switch your hair part up every once in a while but just stop fighting about it. There are far more important things to ask of people like to wear a damn mask.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwZWVkb250aGV3YXRlci5jb20vbWVyY3VyeS1tYXJpbmUtbGF1bmNoZXMtbmV4dC1nZW4tZHRzLXN5c3RlbS_SAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcGVlZG9udGhld2F0ZXIuY29tL21lcmN1cnktbWFyaW5lLWxhdW5jaGVzLW5leHQtZ2VuLWR0cy1zeXN0ZW0vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mercury Marine Launches Next Gen DTS System,"Introduced in 2004 Mercury Marine’s Digital Throttle And Shift system—dubbed DTS—has been upgraded with new features for 2021. The new system will “replace all DTS-compatible Mercury stern-drive inboard diesel and outboard engines” according to a press release from the Fond du Lac Wis. company. That includes Mercury’s new Verado 600 V-12 outboard unveiled earlier this week as well as the entire Verado engine family.

Mercury Marine has enhanced its Digital Throttle and Shift system for its outboard stern-drive and diesel engine products.

“When we were creating the Next Gen Digital Throttle and Shift system we aimed to improve the boating experience with an intuitive design and simpler access to the features boaters use most often” said Tyler Mehrl category manager for steering and controls at Mercury in the release.

New features include Active Trim activation and adjustment buttons integrated on the Next Gen DTS control base which eliminates the need for an additional control panel on the dash. (Active Trim automatically and continuously adjusts engine trim based on changes in GPS speed to improve performance fuel economy and ease of operation according to the release.) Additional enhancements include a green neutral indicator light on the throttle handles that confirm gear position a convenient throttle only feature for starting and warming the engines and a large start/stop button and an oversized trim switch.

The new DTS controls have the same sleek chrome-on black-aesthetics styling consistent with the current “Mercury DNA” overseen by Todd Dannenberg Mercury director of industrial design.

“The ergonomics provide a very natural connection that invites the boater to push the throttle and feel the engine’s power. Plus there are intuitive new features that improve the user experience which we derived through intensive usability testing” Dannenberg said in the release.

Added Mehrl “We incorporated an incredible range of features designed to improve the experience of operating single- and multi-engine boats. The intuitive design means there’s very little learning curve to be able to enjoy a huge performance advantage.”

Extremely light

Good keyboard and touchpad

Excellent battery life

Very nice 16:10 display Cons Bezels are a bit large

Lenovo has been tinkering with its iconic ThinkPad line for a couple of years now breaking away from the tried and true. It went big and powerful with the excellent ThinkPad X1 Extreme as well as a 2-in-1 tablet form factor with the ThinkPad X12 Detachable. Don’t get me started on the craziness that is the ThinkPad X1 Fold.

Now Lenovo has made the ThinkPad X1 Nano the smallest and lightest ThinkPad ever. Don’t think that means it’s cheaper though as the ThinkPad X1 Nano review unit configuration Lenovo sent me comes in at a cool $1847. That nets you an Intel 11th-gen Tiger Lake Core i7-1060G7 16GB of RAM  a 512GB PCIe solid-state drive (SSD) and a 13.0-inch 2K (2160 x 1350) IPS display in the increasingly popular 16:10 aspect ratio.

The ThinkPad X1 Nano has jumped into a very competitive space (hello Dell XPS 13). Does the ThinkPad X1 Nano live up to the potential?

Design

Lenovo might have made the ThinkPad X1 Nano tinier than any other ThinkPad but it didn’t mess with the aesthetic. The ThinkPad X1 Nano is just as completely black as the majority of ThinkPads — no visible carbon fiber anywhere to be found like on the ThinkPad X1 Extreme nor a titanium lid like the one built into the new ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga.

You’ll find the same subtle red hints like the LED “i” on the ThinkPad Yoga and the red TrackPoint nubbin and red button accents. It’s a super conservative look that’s unique to the ThinkPad. Its simple design is nothing like the sleek lines on the Dell XPS 13 nor the gem-cut elegance of the HP Spectre x360 13.

The X1 Nano is also built like other ThinkPads with a mix of materials resulting in a sturdy chassis. In this case it’s a carbon-fiber hybrid material making up the lid with magnesium-aluminum alloy in the chassis bottom. Those materials contribute to the ThinkPad X1 Nano’s light weight of just 1.99 pounds — compared to the XPS 13 and Spectre x360 13 both at 2.8 pounds. And the ThinkPad X1 Nano feels just as sturdy as those two which are among the sturdiest we’ve tested.

For a device of its class the X1 Nano is the lightest laptop you can buy.

Note that 1.99 pounds is really really light. For a laptop of its kind the X1 Nano is the lightest laptop you can buy — even lighter than the LG Gram 13 whose entire purpose is to be as light as possible. It’s almost as light as the Acer Swift 7 (1.96 pounds) and lighter than the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook (2.3 pounds) neither of which pack in this class of CPU.

Is such a light laptop such a big deal? Well it’s a pleasure to use and carry around certainly. Add in the ThinkPad X1 Nano’s materials that make it cool to the touch and you get a supremely attractive and comfortable laptop.

If it felt flimsy — as some light laptops do — then that would mitigate the advantage of being so light. But the ThinkPad X1 Nano feels just as solid as any ThinkPad. There’s no bending twisting or flexing in the lid keyboard deck or chassis. The XPS 13 has the ThinkPad X1 Nano beat when it comes to the hinge though — the latter’s is quite a bit stiffer and requires both hands to open.

The ThinkPad X1 Nano isn’t quite as thin as it is light coming in at a tapered 0.55 to 0.66 inches. The XPS 13 is just 0.58 inches while the Spectre x360 13 is a little thicker at 0.67 inches. Because the ThinkPad X1 Nano’s top and bottom bezels are a little larger than the XPS 13’s it’s a bit deeper even with the smaller display (13 inches versus 13.4 inches) but not by much.

Thanks to the taller 16:10 display (just like the XPS 13) the ThinkPad X1 Nano enjoys more palm rest space than the Spectre x360 13 which is still at 16:9.

Connectivity is one area where the ThinkPad X1 Nano is affected by its size. There are just two USB-C with Thunderbolt 4 ports on the left-hand side to go with a 3.5mm audio jack. The Spectre x360 13 manages to pack in both a USB-A port and a microSD card reader both of which the ThinkPad X1 Nano lacks.

The Lenovo is up to speed on wireless connectivity though with Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0 and either 4G or 5G WWAN support is optional via a SIM slot along the back.

Security

I’m adding a special section to this review to account for some pretty cool technology that Lenovo has included with the ThinkPad X1 Nano. None of it is new but the software in particular has been perfected — at least compared to the last time I tried it.

The ThinkPad X1 Nano has the usual ThinkShutter physical slider that covers the webcam so that’s nothing special when it comes to ThinkPads. But what is special is the human presence detection (HPD) technology and software that uses radar to sense when a user is in front of the laptop and when that user walks away. As long as the user remains in front of the ThinkPad X1 Nano it stays awake and works normally.

Move outside of a 60-degree arc though and the laptop turns off the display locks and goes into Modern Standby to preserve battery life. Once the user returns to within that 60-degree arc the ThinkPad X1 Nano wakes up and if Windows Hello is set up for facial recognition automatically logs back in.

It works extremely well and is a real convenience — if you’re not running a task that is. I found out that my longer benchmarks were being interrupted when the software put the ThinkPad X1 Nano to sleep so the utility needs to be turned off if you need the machine to keep running. I couldn’t find a setting to turn off the step of switching to Modern Standby which is a bit of a bummer.

Overall though I found Lenovo’s solution faster and more reliable than the similar utility on Dell’s Latitude 7400 2-in-1.

Performance

The ThinkPad X1 Nano uses a so-far unusual version of Intel’s latest 11th-gen Tiger Lake CPU the Core i7-1160G7. Unlike the more popular Core i7-1165G7 that runs at up to 4.7GHz and has a thermal design power (TDP) range of 12 to 28 watts the Core i7-1160G7 maxes out at 4.4GHz and has a lower TDP range of seven to 15 watts. That makes it less power-hungry and cooler — a good fit for the diminutive X1 Nano.

Even though the CPU is theoretically slower it didn’t show up in a huge way in our benchmark testing. The ThinkPad X1 Nano didn’t show off in Geekbench 5 where it could only manage 5139 in multi-core mode and 1466 in single-core mode. Other Tiger Lake laptops tend to exceed 5400 and 1500. In Handbrake though where we encode a 420MB video as H.265 the ThinkPad X1 Nano did surprisingly well finishing in exactly three minutes. That beats out a few laptops with faster Tiger Lake chips like the Dell XPS 13 with a Core i7-1185G7 that required about 20 seconds more. The HP Spectre x360 14 with a Core i7-1165G7 took 10 seconds longer.

The ThinkPad X1 Nano also did relatively well in Cinebench R23 where it scored 4550 in multi-core mode and 1377 in single-core mode. That again beat out the XPS 13 (4267 and 1449) but fell behind the Spectre x360 14 in its performance mode (4847 and 1404). The ThinkPad X1 Nano isn’t the fastest Tiger Lake laptop in this test but it’s not as far behind as the CPU specifications might indicate.

Finally I ran the PCMark 10 Complete test where the ThinkPad X1 Nano managed a total score of 4684 and then 9295 in the Essentials 6413 in the Productivity and 4678 in the Creation subtests. These scores are a bit further behind the faster CPUs where the Spectre x360 14 scored 4796 9760 6340 and 4837 across the different tests. This is the one test where the ThinkPad X1 Nano’s lower-specced CPU couldn’t quite keep up.

Generally speaking though the ThinkPad X1 Nano was plenty quick for productivity tasks. I never found myself noticing any slowdowns and I used it just as hard as any other laptop I’ve reviewed. Lenovo did a great job of packing just the right amount of power into the small and light chassis.

In terms of gaming the ThinkPad X1 Nano equipped with the usual Intel Iris Xe you’ll find in Tiger Lake machines was also in line with its competition. It scored 1549 in the 3DMark Time Spy test which is in the middle of the pack. The XPS 13 managed 1589 while the MSI Prestige 14 Evo (a very fast laptop otherwise) could only muster 1465. The Spectre x360 14 hit a blazing 1709 in performance mode.

I also ran Fortnite which on the ThinkPad X1 Nano ran at 1920 x 1200 and I saw 31 frames per second (fps) in 1200p and high graphics and 23 fps in epic graphics. That compares to the XPS 13 at 29 fps and 22 fps and the Spectre x360 14 at 36 fps and 23 fps both running at 1080p. Some Tiger Lake laptops are faster and some are slower but generally speaking you’re getting close to discrete Nvidia MX350 performance out of a very small and light laptop.

Display

The ThinkPad X1 Nano has a brand-new display that’s 13.0 inches in the taller 16:10 aspect ratio. It enjoys a 2K (2160 x 1350) resolution that’s plenty sharp although I did notice the color temperature was a little on the warm (yellower) side.

According to my colorimeter this is a good display for a premium laptop but not a great one. The color gamut was of average width at 74% of AdobeRGB and 98% of sRGB and color accuracy was good at DeltaE 1.31 where 1.0 or less is considered excellent. The XPS 13 Full HD+ display was similar at 75% AdobeRGB and 98% sRGB and a color accuracy of 1.36. The Spectre x369 13 I reviewed used an OLED display that had much wider and more accurate colors so it’s not the best comparison.

The ThinkPad X1 Nano’s display was very bright at 414 nits which was nice to see (no pun intended). That made it bright enough to overpower a lot of ambient lighting. Contrast came in at 980:1 just under our preferred threshold of 1000:1 for premium laptops . The XPS 13 was brighter at 458 nits and had much better contrast at 1350:1. Again the Spectre x360 13’s OLED panel was superior in its virtually infinite contrast although it wasn’t as bright at 405 nits.

I enjoyed the display especially the 16:10 aspect ratio. Once I got used to the color temp being a little warm I settled in and enjoyed the panel for all of the work I threw at it. Creative types who demand wide color gamuts will want to look elsewhere but for most people this is a very good display.

Audio was very good with tons of volume for such a small laptop and no distortion. That’s thanks to quad speakers two downward-firing woofers and two upward-firing tweeters. You get great highs and mids and just a smidgen of bass. It’s plenty for Netflix and the occasional tune although it can’t hold a candle to the best laptop speakers on the market those on the MacBook Pro. I also find the speakers to be a little less enjoyable than the quad speakers on the HP Spectre x360 14 which provide just a little more oomph.

Keyboard and touchpad

According to Lenovo the ThinkPad X1 Nano’s keyboard is the same as on other ThinkPads with “similar” travel. That certainly seems to be the case — they’re the same sculpted keys with plenty of spacing and the mechanism is almost identical to other ThinkPads. I do think the travel is somewhat less which to my mind is a good thing — I find the “normal” ThinkPad keyboard to require a little too much effort.

I like the lighter keyboards on the Dell XPS 13 HP Spectre line and Apple’s Magic Keyboard on the latest MacBooks. So in the end unless it’s my imagination the ThinkPad X1 Nano’s keyboard feel is the best I’ve experienced on a ThinkPad.

The touchpad is a Microsoft Precision version making for a precise tracking experience and functional multitouch gestures in Windows 10. You lose some space to the buttons for the TrackPoint nubbin in the middle of the keyboard something that’s always bugged me about ThinkPads. Really the touchpad ends up being too small where the extra space thanks to the taller display could make for a larger swiping surface.

Speaking of the display it doesn’t support touch which is also a negative. I find non-touch laptops to be a bother after getting so used to using my thumb to scroll long web pages and my finger to tap quick on-screen buttons.

Finally Windows 10 Hello support is provided by both a fingerprint reader immediately to the right of the touchpad and an infrared camera up top for facial recognition. With the human presence detection feature the facial recognition method makes extra sense and works perfectly.

Battery life

When I saw that the ThinkPad X1 Nano had just 48 watt-hours of battery I was expecting it to toe the line with other ThinkPads in suffering from mediocre battery life. I suppose the smaller display and lower-power CPU made a real difference though because the ThinkPad X1 Nano definitely bucks the ThinkPad trend.

First I ran our web browsing test which provides a passable indication of productivity battery life. Here the ThinkPad X1 Nano managed 10.25 hours which is a very good score that likely means the laptop meets or exceeds Intel’s Evo certification of nine hours of typical use.

It also beat the XPS 13 Full HD+ and the 4K OLED-equipped Spectre x360 13 (with 60 watt-hours of battery) by almost two hours. In our video test that loops through a Full HD Avengers trailer the ThinkPad X1 Nano lasted for 18 hours — an exceptional result. That’s six hours longer than the XPS 13 and eight hours longer than the Spectre x360 13.

I also ran the PCMark 10 Gaming battery test that stresses the CPU and the ThinkPad X1 Nano lasted for almost four hours. That’s the second-longest score we’ve seen just one second behind the XPS 13 Full HD+. I tried running the PCMark 10 Application battery test which is the best indicator of productivity longevity but unfortunately the test failed multiple times. I imagine though that the ThinkPad X1 Nano would have done well on the test and overall it should provide the typical productivity user more than a full day’s battery life.

Our take

The ThinkPad X1 Nano is a highly competent entrant into the tiny laptop market. It provides solid productivity performance great battery life and a solid build with a good keyboard and usable human presence detecting technology. And it’s up-to-date with the move to a taller display thanks to its 16:10 panel.

There’s not a lot to dislike about the ThinkPad X1 Nano. It doesn’t have quite the polish of the XPS 13 and it doesn’t have the standout good looks or flexibility of the Spectre x360 13 but as 13-inch laptops go this is a good one.

Are there any alternatives?

The HP Spectre x360 14 is a solid alternative offering its own taller display with a 13.5-inch 3:2 OLED panel that’s miles ahead of the ThinkPad’s display. It’s priced about the same as the ThinkPad X1 Nano depending on the configuration but its 2-in-1 flexibility sets it apart.

The Dell XPS 13 9310 is perhaps the most logical competitor though with a slightly larger 16:10 display and a more streamlined design. Performance is similar between the two but the ThinkPad has better battery life. The XPS 13 is just as well-built has a superior display and can handle more storage and RAM than Lenovo’s offering.

Finally if you’re willing to switch operating systems then Apple’s MacBook Pro 13 M1 is another great option. It’s extremely fast perhaps better built has a better display and enjoys the best keyboard and audio on any laptop. It’s also several hundred dollars less expensive than the ThinkPad X1 Nano.

How long will it last?

WD’s My Passport SSD is the company’s latest portable SSD to hit the market and it aims to bring a new level of performance to the lineup with peak performance of 1050/1000 MBps of read/write throughput.

Last year we took a look at WD’s My Passport a portable HDD that’s well suited for backup tasks but we wouldn’t quite recommend it for a production workflow. But if you’re looking to speed up your workflow portable SSDs are all the rage. Of course the tradeoff for a fancy new portable SSD is that it comes at a higher price-per-GB but the experience just can’t be beaten.

Like Samsung’s T7 WD’s My Passport SSD is a DRAM-less portable NVMe SSD and comes in various color options including gold silver grey blue and red. With a USB 3.2 Gen2 controller and the company’s Blue SN550E NVMe SSD under the hood this portable SSD is built to deliver blistering performance that leaves portable HDDs in the dust. Additionally the drive comes with hardware-based AES 256-bit encryption for the security conscious.

Ranging from 500GB up to a beefy 4TB WD’s My Passport SSD comes in a variety of capacities and all are rated to deliver up to 1050/1000 MBps of read/write performance under sequential workloads. Pricing is a bit higher than your standard SATA or M.2 SSD though. However at roughly $0.14-$018 per gigabyte the My Passport SSD falls in line with competitors such as Samsung’s T7 Crucial’s X8 and the SanDisk Extreme v2.

As per the norm for most portable SSDs the My Passport lacks an endurance rating but it’s rational to expect that it should have a similar life expectancy to the WD Blue SN550 that powers the device (300 and 600TB for the 500GB and 2TB models respectively). Oddly the lack of an official endurance rating is actually a plus though – WD backs the drive with a five-year warranty so if you have problems you can RMA the drive during the duration of the warranty regardless of the amount of data you’ve written.

WD rates the My Passport SSD to handle falls up to 6.5ft but unlike SanDisk’s or LaCie’s portables it lacks a formal Ingress Protection rating against the elements. The device comes formatted as exFAT for compatibility with both macOS and Windows-based computers and supports S.M.A.R.T. data reporting. When formatted as NTFS the device supports TRIM.

WD includes a relatively short six-inch USB Type-C cable and a one-inch Type-C to Type-A adaptor with the drive. WD provides the company’s Discovery software to manage the device and enables downloading a few other apps. WD Security and WD Backup software manage the device’s password protection and configure backup tasks on both macOS and Windows-based computers.

Measuring 100 x 55 x 9 mm and weighing in at under 54 grams WD’s My Passport SSD is sleek slim and easily slips into a pocket. However the build quality isn't as solid as the company’s WD Black P50 or SanDisk’s Extreme Pro. With a little pressure the casing flexes to your will and the case doesn’t have an activity light.

WD My Passport SSD is constructed out of both plastic and metal: the topside is metal while the bottom is plastic. Prying the casing open reveals the company took thermals well into consideration as there are multiple thermal pads and points of contact for the chips to dissipate heat into the top metal cover to function as a heat spreader.

An ASMedia ASM2362 USB 3.2-to-PCIe 3.0 x2 NVMe SSD chip bridges the link between the internal NVMe SSD and the host. It interfaces with WD’s Blue SN550E over a PCIe 3.0 x2 connection. It translates the NVMe protocol (1.3c) into USB Attached SCSI Protocol for faster than transitional bulk-only transport performance though it supports both for compatibility. The drive manages power consumption via USB and PCI Express link power management along with chip power management.

WD’s Blue SN550E is a DRAM-less M.2 2280 PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe SSD that leverages a quad-channel controller and WD’s 512Gb 96-Layer TLC flash.

Sixteen flash dies are stuffed within our 1TB sample each featuring a dual-plane design that doubles interleaving performance compared to single-plane flash. The controller features hardware-based AES 256-bit encryption support enabling secure password protection. It also has a multi-gear ECC scheme and other flash management routines to ensure data reliability.

In February the United States Navy announced that it would cut production of the legacy F/A-18E/F Super Hornet to instead accelerate the development of the next-generation carrier-based fighter program. According to the service's newly revealed Fiscal Year 2021 budget request next year's order of two dozen of the tactical aircraft would be the last in the program. This comes after Super Hornet maker Boeing won a $4-billion multi-year contract to build 78 of the strike attack aircraft through FY 2021.

This would bring to an end the F/A-18 program that began in the 1970s with the development of the McDonnell Douglas designed twin-engine F-18 fighter and attack aircraft. The F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet is the final variants of that original multirole fighter aircraft and features a 20% larger airframe 7000lb. empty weight and 15000lb. heavier maxim weight than the original Hornet. The Super Hornet can also carry 33% more internal fuel which can increase its mission range by 41% and its endurance by 50% over the earlier aircraft. Moreover despite the increase in size the F/A-18E/F actually has 42% fewer parts than its predecessor the F/A-18C/D.

The F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet which is now manufactured by Boeing following its merger with McDonnell Douglas in 1997 is produced as two distinct versions. The single-seat F/A-18/E and the dual-seat F/A-18/F.

It also has a multirole fighter that can serve as an attack aircraft via the use of different external equipment as well as its advanced networking capabilities which allow it to accomplish very specific missions. In this way it is seen as a ""force multiplier"" that allows it to be deployed to meet the various challenges that a carrier might face. In its fighter mode it can serve as an escort and provide fleet air defenses from enemy aircraft and other threats while in its attack mode it can provide force projection interdiction and close and deep air support.

The Super Hornet has 11 weapons stations including two wing store stations and it is able to fulfill a range of armaments that include AIM-9 Sidewinder AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles guided air-to-ground weapons such as Harpoon SLAM/SLAM-ER GBU-10 GBU-51 HARM and Maverick; and free-fall air-to-ground bombs Mk-76 BDU-48 Mk-82LD Mk-82HD and Mk-84. The aircraft is also equipped with a General Dynamics M61A2 20mm Gatling-style gun a hydraulically driven six-barreled rotary action air-cooled electrically fired weapon that offers selectable rates of either 4000 or 6000 rounds per minute.

The first operational use of the F/A-18/E was with Strike Fighter Squadron 115 (VFA-115) known as the ""Eagles"" which was operating from the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) on July 24 2002 and the aircraft saw it first combat action on November 6 of the same year when the squadron took part in hostile targets in the ""no-fly"" zone in Iraq. The F/A-18E/F was also used deployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003.

Despite the Navy's decision to stop further production of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet it will remain the primary strike power from U.S. carriers for the next decade.

Rochester MN (KROC AM News) - A Kasson man has been charged with felony assault for hitting a man in the face with a large beer mug at a Rochester bar.

Arraigned in Olmsted County Court on 3rd and 5th-degree assault charges was 35-year-old Jonathan Collett.

The apparent unprovoked assault took place Tuesday at Roosters Too! Bar and Grill.

According to the criminal complaint “The drink Defendant had was in a ""Goliath"" mug which is 10 inches tall and is made of thick glass. Defendant walked up to Victim and asked him if he wanted to box outside. Defendant then hit Victim in the head with the mug and left the Bar.”

The complaint says a man who was sitting with the victim “was hit in the face by a shard of glass after the mug broke on Victim's face. “

Police say a surveillance video from the bar “Showed Victim and the witnesses sitting around a table. Defendant approached and spoke with the group for a bit before starting to take a video or photos of the group. This appeared to upset the males but they did not stand up to confront Defendant. Defendant circled around the table and approached Victim who was sitting. Defendant then thrust his mug into Victim's face in a palm-strike-like fashion shattering the mug.”

The complaint says the victim received nine stitches for his facial injury. A cut on his forearm also required stitches.

Collett was later arrested at his home in Kasson. According to the complaint Collett told police he “remembered being at the bar but had no memory of what happened to his hand” which was wrapped in gauze.

Collett has been ordered to make his first court appearance Feb 24.

The 2022 BEYA STEM Conference will be hosted in Washington D.C. Information can be found at www.beya.org",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVwLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9jYXJzL2dlbmVyYWwtbW90b3JzLzIwMjEvMDIvMTQvZ20tYm9sdC1ldXYtZXYtMjAyMi82NzQxOTM5MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM reveals 2022 Bolt EUV 2022 Bolt EV: How they're different,"General Motors showed the world Sunday the first new electric vehicle of the 30 new EVs that it will bring to market by mid-decade.

Chevrolet revealed the new 2022 Bolt EUV alongside a redesigned 2022 Bolt EV five-door hatchback car. Chevrolet has sold the car since 2017 but the Bolt EUV is brand new and it's longer and heavier than the Bolt EV providing more rear-seat legroom so Chevrolet considers it an electric utility vehicle.

""The Bolt EV and Bolt EUV share the same architecture but the EUV has different exterior sheet metal a more muscular design is 6 inches longer than the Bolt EV ... and it features Chevy’s high-eye daytime running lamps"" said Jesse Ortega architectural chief engineer of the Bolt EV. ""It has 3 inches more rear passenger leg room than Bolt EV.""

The Bolt EUV will also offer GM's hands-free driving technology called Super Cruise. Both vehicles will have all-new interiors and extra features to make range anxiety a thing of the past Ortega said.

The starting price for the 2022 Bolt EUV is $33995 and the 2022 Bolt EV starts at $31995 said Steve Majoros director of Chevrolet marketing. Both are priced less than the 2021 Bolt EV which starts at $36500.

“We’ve been building the Bolt now for four years so we continue to build a supply base that has a lot more scale"" Ortega said explaining how GM is able to offer more for less money with the new Bolt vehicles. ""We’ve had more sales volume with it and that has allowed us to leverage costs. We are giving more for less for a better value.""

'Adoption is critical'

Chevrolet revealed the vehicles Sunday afternoon. The reveal video can be seen on www.chevrolet.com/ev. Chevrolet was expected to run a 90-second ad called ""Magic is Electric"" for the Bolts during American Idol airing Sunday at 8 p.m. ET on ABC. Chevrolet has partnered with Disney World Resort around the Bolt marketing.

The Bolt has been the only long-range full-electric car GM has offered. GM has sold about 100000 Bolts worldwide.

GM sold more than 6.8 million vehicles globally in 2020 alone so the Bolt sales volume is a drop in the bucket. But the vehicle is important for other reasons especially since GM aspires for all its light-duty vehicles to be zero emissions by 2035.

Majoros said about three-quarters of Bolt EV buyers in the United States are new to GM. He declined to say whether the Bolt is profitable.

“We don’t discuss that publicly but we know that EV adoption is critical and we know that as time goes on we’ve gotten better with cost reduction and we think we’re giving the customer the features they’ve been asking for"" Majoros said.

Chevrolet is offering preorders only for the 2022 Bolt EUV Launch Edition which starts at $43495. It requires a $100 refundable deposit made to a Chevrolet dealer. The special Launch Edition Bolt EUV comes fully loaded with Super Cruise panoramic sunroof unique wheels special badging and an illuminated charge port.

Chip shortage battery fires

GM's Orion Assembly plant in Lake Orion will start building the vehicles this spring and they go on sale in late summer. GM gets the motors from a supplier in South Korea.

The batteries used in the Bolt also come from a supplier LG Chem that has been connected to a massive GM recall of the Bolt EV. In November GM recalled all 2017-19 model year Bolts because they may pose a fire risk. It involves 68667 vehicles globally; of those 50925 are in the United States.

There were five Bolts that caught fire without impact and GM said all had high voltage batteries produced at LG Chem’s Ochang South Korea facility.

The 2022 Bolt EV and Bolt EUV will use a different version of batteries than the ones used in the recalled vehicles Ortega said.

“If you look at the recall we’ve got right now it doesn’t impact 2020 and beyond Bolts"" Ortega said. ""Those utilize a different version of a battery chemistry than the ones in the recall. That (new) chemistry allowed us to improve our range in these vehicles.""

Chevrolet provides an 8-year/100000 mile warranty on the battery. After the warranty runs out ""it’s hard to predict what replacement costs would be"" said Shad Balch Chevrolet spokesman. But Chevrolet has the ability to replace battery modules and sections he said. When it comes to end-of-life GM is focused first on re-use and then recycling them.

GM has also developed its own proprietary battery system called Ultium which will underpin the 29 other new EVs GM will bring to market in the next few years starting with the GMC Hummer EV pickup due out late this year. But there are no plans to move the Bolt vehicles onto the Ultium platform any time soon Ortega said.

GM also faces the challenge of going to production amid a massive shortage of semiconductor chips that are used in many car components. The chip deficit has derailed production at nearly all carmakers including GM which shut down three North American plants this week. But Majoros said the problem is not expected to disrupt production of the 2022 Bolt vehicles.

""We’ve been all over this situation"" Majoros said. ""We’re prioritizing products that you’d imagine like full-size trucks and launch productions are part of that too. So nothing to announce there but we’ll be monitoring the situation closely.”

All 50 states

Majoros declined to say how many Bolt EVs and Bolt EUVs GM will produce or expects to sell ""but it is fully our intention to build more and to sell more in both of these products.”

GM will sell the Bolts in all 50 states Majoros said.

“You can’t get mainstream adoption by selling in 12 or 13 states. We’ve worked very hard to make sure we can satisfy demand in states like California” Majoros said. “There are certain markets where EV adoption is a little ahead of the curve but make no mistake there are dedicated EV dealers and EV advocates in every single part of this country.”

Chevy has about 3000 U.S. dealerships and about 1300 sell the Bolt EV but Majoros said “As more and more products come into our portfolio that number is going to go up. They see the market and they will be very active participants in our EV future.”

GM's luxury brand Cadillac recently trimmed about 270 dealers from its network. leaving about 600 in the United States as it shifts the brand to sell only electric cars by the end of the decade. Cadillac gave dealers buyout packages if they did not want to invest in the infrastructure to sell EVs.

Get rid of range anxiety

The Bolt EUV will be the first Chevrolet-brand vehicle to offer Super Cruise which provides hands-free driving on about 200000 U.S. and Canadian compatible highways. Super Cruise is currently available only on certain Cadillac models.

A single-motor drive unit powers both Bolt vehicles and it delivers 200 horsepower and 266 pound feet of torque.

The Bolt EV will get an estimated 259 miles of range on a full charge Ortega said. The Bolt EUV will get 250 miles of range despite being taller longer and “a bit heavier” than the Bolt EV he said.

Standard on the Bolt EUV and available for purchase with the Bolt EV is a new dual level charge cord. It will eliminate a customer's need to buy a separate charger for their home. It has a changeable plug that allows the customer to plug into a standard 120-volt three-prong outlet or a 240-volt outlet common in most homes.

The cord can be used to charge at DC Fast Charger station too. For maximum Level 2 charging speed both vehicles are now capable of 11 kilowatt Level 2 charging but separate charging equipment is required.

Here are the approximate charging times:

Bolt EV: 100 miles per 30 minutes at a DC Fast Charger

Bolt EUV: 95 miles per 30 minutes at a DC Fast Charger

When using a 240-volt home outlet the Bolt EV or EUV would take about 7 hours to fully charge.

Using 120-volt takes approximately 55 hours from an empty battery. If an owner has the typical 40 mile commute each day they can get back to a full charge overnight since the battery wasn't drained.

Chevrolet will cover the cost of standard installation of Level 2 charging capability for eligible customers who buy or lease a 2022 Bolt EUV or Bolt EV Majoros said.

Chevrolet has partnered with home EV-charger installation company Qmerit to give Bolt owners access to faster charging at their homes he said. That's a significant savings given that installation of a Level 2 charger could cost up to $2000 according to Realtor.com. No standalone charging station is required in this case because of the dual-level charge cord.

Likewise GM has partnered with fast-charging network EVgo to triple the number of fast chargers in the country by adding 2700 by the end of 2025.

Finally the myChevrolet app gives owners location access to more than 80000 chargers in North America.

“Range anxiety is a term we need to get rid of because once you own an EV it becomes a non-issue"" Ortega said.

Here's what's new

Besides different exterior sheet metal parts used on each and the EUV's extra 6 inches in length there are some other distinctions between the two.

The Bolt EUV which is part of the small SUV market segment has a modern muscular design and a roomier interior and ample rear legroom Ortega said. It also features a sculpted grille in front with standard LED headlamps and Chevrolet’s brand-specific high-eye daytime running lamps that double as turn-signal indicators.

For Bolt EV the design updates include a more upright front fascia which refers to the car's front-end features such as the grille headlamps and front bumper. It also has new front and rear lighting including the high-eye daytime running lights in front.

Both cars have new instrument panels vehicle controls and seats with a 10.2-inch-diagonal infotainment color touchscreen and integrated climate controls.

Ortega also got rid of the traditional gear shift. Instead there’s an electronic gear shift design that uses pull toggles and push buttons to free up more interior space.

Customer demands

Many of the new features came from customer requests Ortega said.

“Our current Bolt EV customers are some of GM’s most passionate and vocal. We had plenty of firsthand feedback about how we can make these vehicles even better” Ortega said. “They wanted more contemporary interiors a sunroof more room for passengers more safety features … we listened and delivered on these features and even more.”

The new interior has a flat-bottom steering wheel that incorporates the Regen on Demand paddle which lets the driver maximize energy to extend the driving range.

The Bolt EUV offers three inches of additional rear legroom compared with the Bolt EV. Heated and ventilated front seats and heated rear outboard seats are available on both along with a panoramic power sunroof option for Bolt EUV.

The vehicles include some standard safety features too such as automatic emergency braking forward collision alert lane keep assist with lane departure warning following distance Indicator and front pedestrian braking.

Additional connectivity technologies include new wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto phone projection capability as well as wireless phone charging that is standard on Bolt EUV and available on Bolt EV and an available 4G LTE Wi-Fi Hotspot.

“The Bolt EV has helped make Chevy the number two EV brand and sales were up 26% for 2020"" Majoros said. ""It attracts more new customers to GM than any other model we sell. We'll continue to reimage this vehicle with fresh design and new features.”

General Motors unveiled two new versions of the Bolt on Sunday: an updated Bolt EV hatchback with longer range and new high-tech features and the brand new Bolt EUV — essentially a compact SUV — with more legroom room and less range than the Bolt EV.

Due out this summer the refreshed Bolt EV will sell for $31995 — or about $5000 less than the current model year Bolt EV. The Bolt EUV (which stands for “electric utility vehicle”) will also be less expensive costing $33995. A limited-edition “Launch” version with unique wheels special badging and an illuminated charge port will be available for $43495. The Bolt EV and EUV were expected to go into production at the end of 2020 but were delayed until this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

First introduced in 2016 the Chevy Bolt was intended to be General Motors’ first stab at a mass-market purely battery-electric vehicle with 200-plus miles of range and an affordable price tag. But sales have been anemic since the release of the Tesla Model 3 in 2018 which has come to dominate the EV market in the US and abroad. The Bolt’s compact hatchback size is not what most American car buyers are looking for these days. And a recent recall of 2017-2019 model year Bolts related to a flawed battery certainly hasn’t helped GM’s image problems with the EV.

GM hopes to lift the Bolt’s fortunes with these two new versions

The automaker hopes to lift the Bolt’s fortunes with these two new versions but that may be difficult given that the technology that powers the Bolt is quickly becoming obsolete. Both the Bolt EV and Bolt EUV will be built on GM’s BEV2 platform which is distinct from the new “Ultium” battery pack announced in early 2020. The recently unveiled Cadillac Lyriq and the GMC Hummer EV will be the first vehicles to be built on this new architecture. GM has said that Ultium’s advanced battery chemistry will enable its future electric vehicles to travel further on a single charge and re-charge at a faster rate. But the automaker has no plans to move the Bolt over to the Ultium platform according to Chevy’s lead engineer.

As a consolation for its approaching irrelevance both versions of the Bolt will come with Super Cruise the “hands-free” advanced driver assist system that previously has only been available in Cadillac vehicles. The Bolt EV and EUV are the first non-Cadillac vehicles and first electric vehicles to have Super Cruise.

The price helps make up for the Bolt’s shortcomings. When it was first introduced five years ago the automaker was still eligible for the federal government’s $7500 tax credit which effectively made the Bolt a $30000 vehicle. But in 2019 GM sold its 200000th EV in the US triggering a phase out of the tax credit. No longer eligible for that incentive GM decided to stick with the reduced price for these latest versions which is encouraging.

GM claims that the Bolt EV’s 65 kWh battery pack will enable 259 miles of range on a single charge while the slightly heavier Bolt EUV will have 250 miles of range — basically the same as the current year model. The original 2018 Bolt had 238 miles of range but typically got less due to cold weather or other external factors. Neither vehicles’ range has yet been certified by US or European regulators.

Chevy is also including an active thermal management system that uses coolant to maintain the battery’s temperature. Late last year General Motors was forced to recall over 68000 Chevy Bolts manufactured between 2017-2019 after several battery fires were reported. Federal regulators are investigating and a class action lawsuit was filed alleging that the Bolt’s battery is “prone to burst into flames.”

the new Bolts utilize a different battery chemistry that will help prevent fires

According to Jesse Ortega chief engineer at Chevy the new Bolts utilize a different battery chemistry that will help prevent future incidents the same chemistry that allowed the automaker to increase the range from 238 miles to 250 miles.

Both versions of the Bolt come with a single-motor drive unit that can deliver 200 horsepower thanks to 150 kW of power and 266 pound-feet (360 Newton meters) of torque. Like previous models the new Bolts will have regenerative braking and a one-pedal driving mode that is fairly common among EVs today.

The Bolt EUV and redesigned Bolt EV share an architecture but their designs are unique. No exterior sheet metal parts are shared between the two vehicles after some owners complained about lackluster sheet metal in previous versions. The EUV is approximately 6 inches longer and will have about 3 inches of extra rear legroom than the Bolt EV.

The grille has been tweaked swapping the dual-tone look of the previous Bolt with a more monochromatic fascia. Chevy is keeping small ventilation panel rather than embrace the completely flat front-end of other EVs like the Tesla Model 3.

The Bolt’s interior has always been more practical than inspiring with hard plastic abound. Now the Bolt EV and EUV’s interior has been redesigned to include more screens and sensors mostly to help power Super Cruise’s promise of “hands-free” driving. Chevy has even ripped out the Bolt’s oft-criticized seats and replaced them with seats that feature a triangular geometric pattern and contrasting color stitching which the automaker claims is a “premium design that gives a consistent and upscale atmosphere.” Not words you typically see used to describe a $30000 vehicle.

The main 10.2-inch infotainment screen is still embedded in the dashboard but is integrated more seamlessly into the center console than the original Bolt’s design. The physical buttons are smoother and less chunky. And Chevy swapped out the gear shifter for a series of electronic buttons to free up more interior space. There’s also a new one-pedal driving button that keeps the system active between drive cycles.

Other new additions include the light bar in the top of the steering wheel and the infrared sensor on the steering column. These are components of GM’s Super Cruise assisted driving system which uses cameras radar and mapping data to allow users to drive hands-free on divided highways. Super Cruise is not a self-driving system in that it still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road and engaged enough to be able to take over at a moment’s notice. Notably the Bolt EV and Bolt EUV will only come with the standard version of Super Cruise not the enhanced version that includes automatic lane-changing.

EV charging in the US is a bit of a mess and while Chevy can’t solve some of the more intractable problems it is doing what it can to make charging a little less of a headache. A dual-level charge cord is included with the Bolt which Chevy said will eliminate the need for many people to purchase a separate charger for their home. The changeable plug allows customers to plug into a standard 120-volt three-prong outlet for Level 1 charging and a 240-volt outlet for Level 2 charging up to 7.2 kilowatts. Both vehicles are also capable of 11 kW Level 2 charging but separate charging equipment is required.

Bolt owners will get free installation of a Level 2 home charger

As an added perk anyone who buys or leases a Bolt EUV or Bolt EV will get free installation of a Level 2 charger in their home through GM’s partnership with Qmerit a home charger installer. For charging on the go GM is partnering with public charging station operator EVgo to include over 80000 public chargers in the My Chevrolet app.

But charging times will still be subject to the power levels of each individual charger. When plugged into a normal 120-volt system (ie most home outlets) the Bolt EV and EUV will only get four miles of range for every hour of charging. Plugged into a 240-volt outlet will get the Bolt to a full charge in seven hours. And a DC fast charger will add up to 100 miles in 30 minutes for both vehicles.

Affordability has always been the Bolt’s strongest selling point offering a decent size battery and adequate range for under $35000. Chevy wanted to ensure the Bolt stayed affordable even as it added new features like Super Cruise or leveled up to crossover status said Steve Majoros vice president of Chevy marketing. Keeping the price low will help spur EV adoption from its current status of only 2 percent of US sales to upwards of 15-20 percent of the overall car market he said."

BVN Staff

During Black History Month the National AIDS Memorial honors Black lives lost to AIDS with a specially curated selection of 56 blocks of the AIDS Memorial Quilt (the Quilt). The exhibition uses the beauty and power of the Quilt to bring to light stories of the countless men women and children who have died and the impact AIDS has had on Black Americans.

“This virtual exhibition shares stories of hope healing and remembrance to honor Black lives lost to AIDS” said John Cunningham Executive Director of the National AIDS Memorial. “Our hope is that it helps raise greater awareness about the ongoing struggle with HIV and the impact systemic barriers have to positive health outcomes particularly among the Black community.”

In the 40 years since the first cases of AIDS were reported Black Americans and communities of color have been disproportionately impacted by AIDS. By 1993 HIV was the leading cause of death for Black men between the ages 25-44 and by 2004 HIV became the leading cause of death for Black women in the same age group. In 2018 Black Americans made up 42% of the nearly 38000 new HIV diagnoses in the U.S. with half of those living in southern states. The Quilt is a powerful tool to reach these communities through its stories of resilience healing hope and remembrance represented in each panel.

Partners for the Black History Month AIDS Memorial Quilt Virtual Exhibition include the Black AIDS Institute Gilead Sciences and Vivent Health national leaders in the fight against AIDS.

“Today Black Americans face the highest impact of HIV/AIDS compared to all other races and ethnicities. This highlights the need to center Black and LGBTQ people in the fight to end the epidemic” said Raniyah Copeland President and CEO Black AIDS Institute. “By sharing these powerful stories from the Quilt we can continue to advocate for Black people living with HIV defy stigma and create awareness around prevention and treatment options available today that can end HIV in Black communities over the next decade.”

In 2013 as part of ongoing awareness and educational efforts a special Quilt program Call My Name was created to draw attention to HIV/AIDS in the Black community and the public health crisis that still exists today. The program aims to create a greater number of Quilt panels that reflect the impact of HIV/AIDS within the Black community and the effect stigma and prejudice have on increased infection rates.

“We selected Quilt panels for this exhibition that tell some of the many stories of Black Americans who lost their lives to AIDS and whose loved ones honored them by stitching their stories their memories their hopes into the Quilt” said Gert McMullin National AIDS Memorial Quilt Conservator. “These stories are of children women and men who we lost to AIDS and who all are remembered through the Quilt.”

The stories featured in the exhibition include:

Panels made as part of the Call My Name program one of which honors Wandra made by her hairdresser who kept Wandra’s secret of being HIV-positive for 10 years until her death. She wanted to honor Wandra a neonatologist in Atlanta who “had a life of accomplishment” noting that her friend loved to ski and watch ballet “I wanted to honor that.” (Block 5788)

Black children who lost their lives to AIDS including one panel that honors two-year-old Alexzandria that shows her photo a teddy bear Big Bird and a poem written by her mother Charlene who says she pours her grief into the poems and stories she has been writing since Alexzandria died. “I can be angry about it but instead I soothe myself with my writing.” (Block 2542) Another memorializes “Dougie” who lost his life to AIDS at the age of eight. His mother lovingly made his panel which includes a painting of him from a photo taken when he met musical artist Ice-T. (Block 2268)

Panels in memory of Black women who died of AIDS such as Belynda a Massachusetts AIDS activist who dedicated herself to helping organize Black churches in the fight against AIDS. According to her pastor “within a few years she had 45 black churches doing prevention education…she helped us cross ideological and theological lines.” (Block 5718)

Black celebrities – musicians artists designers journalists – lost to AIDS and through their work and connection to people brought awareness to the pandemic. A Quilt panel honors Sean Sasser an AIDS activist who appeared on MTV’s The Real World: San Francisco and who openly shared his relationship with Pedro Zamora helping open hearts and minds to LGBT issues and those living with HIV/AIDS. (Block 5975) Another remembers the iconic “Sylvester” James Eazy-E Max Robinson Arthur Ashe and Willi Smith with records CDs and photographs sewn onto it. (Block 5888)

Several panels honor Black men who died of AIDS including three that have military uniforms sewn into them to honor their service. (Block 5976) Another honors George Gramby who spent the last decade of his life helping people overcome substance abuse forming a program called “Beginnings” which still operates today. For more than 25 years the town of Morristown New Jersey holds an annual day in his memory. (Block 5592)

The exhibition is free to the public and can be viewed at www.aidsmemorial.org through March 31 2021. Visitors to the site can also view all 48000 panels of the Quilt and search for the names of loved ones who have a panel made in their memory.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As the world went into lockdown last year most people turned to online shopping which accelerated ecommerce adoption and increased its share of total US retail sales by 75% last year (from 8% penetration in 2019 to 14% in 2020).

Retail giants such as Walmart Best Buy and Target saw their market capitalization nearly double in 2020 on the back of enormous ecommerce sales growth. Industries that power the ecommerce ecosystem also heavily benefited from this trend with companies like FedEx (logistics) and Shopify (ecommerce platform) seeing incredible growth.

In particular one industry was a significant beneficiary: ‘Buy Now Pay Later’ (BNPL) solutions saw a massive surge in popularity during the pandemic as the prospect of delayed payment became more attractive in light of the financial uncertainty resulting from the spike in unemployment.

What are BNPL solutions?

BNPL solutions allow customers to spread out the cost of their purchases into interest-free installments creating value for both customers and merchants:

Customers: Instead of immediately paying $2000 for a new TV (or paying it a month later in your credit card bill) you can now pay $335 a month over six months at 0% interest and $0 fees through a seamless checkout experience (fast and straightforward sign-up process with one-click checkout for returning customers) and flexible payment options (3 6 or 12 months).

Merchants also benefit as they witness an improvement in conversion rates an increase in basket sizes (AOVs) and enhanced repeat purchase rates.

According to Worldpay’s 2020 Global Payments report BNPL became the fastest growing ecommerce payment method globally projecting this category to account for 9% of ecommerce payments by 2023 in EMEA.

As investors acknowledged the solution’s potential BNPL providers had a great year with Afterplay tripling its market cap triple (graph below) and Affirm’s value soared by 132% since it began trading in mid-January.

Credit Card Disruptors

The concept of delayed payment is not new. We all have credit cards which de-facto are ‘Buy Now Pay Later’ tools. Unfortunately credit cards have remained unchanged for the past 30 years even though consumers (Millenials) developed an aversion to them following the financial crisis and horror stories of extravagant interest rates (29% APRs on the outstanding balance).

In essence credit card providers have gotten lazy and are being disrupted by BNPL players. I wrote about disruption theory last year where I highlighted that:

Disruption takes place when smaller more agile players introduce a lower performing cheaper product with a structurally different business model. Initially targeting a niche set of customers (lowest value consumers or unserved consumers) they are ignored by incumbents who instead focus on defending their legacy business model (historically a source of competitive advantage).

As new entrants gradually improve their product they move up the food chain targeting more attractive customers and stealing market share from incumbents who unable to disrupt themselves see their business models become obsolete and gradually die.

Compared to a credit card BNPL solutions are indeed inferior. They can only be used with merchants that integrated into their checkout page. Besides high spenders can generally cover their credit card expenses and won’t be attracted to BNPL solutions. However ignoring this trend can be as deadly a mistake as Blockbuster ignoring Netflix at the turn of the century and we all know how that story ended.

It remains to be seen whether companies like Affirm and Klarna will overtake MasterCard and Visa one day. Given the recent surge in adoption the macro tailwinds (growth of ecommerce and the Millenial consumer) and the growing disinclination towards credit cards this might happen sooner than we think.

Economics of BNPL businesses

Profitability for BNPL companies depends on seven main metrics and looks something like this:

Net take rate represents the commission charged to merchants (Take rate) minus payment processing fees that the BNPL company pays.

Debt financing cost corresponds to the interest BNPL providers pay banks for liquidity (to provide loans to their customers).



Debt management cost equals the credit check costs plus payment collection costs minus late fee payments collected from customers.

Provision for debt impairment equals the weighted average percentage of loans that are not paid back (i.e. bad debt)

The four above components represent the contribution margin. In their early days BNPL companies tend to have a negative contribution margin as losses incurred from debt impairment wipe out any income generated. However over time BNPL players use data to improve their algorithms and remove “bad customers” from their platform reducing such losses.

Let’s take an example: Suppose your net take rate is 5% (assuming merchants pay you 6% and you pay 1% in payment processing fees). If you pay 1% interest on your loan and it costs you 1% to manage consumer loans the percentage of your non-performing loans can’t exceed 3%; otherwise you lose money. Unfortunately this figure is generally higher in the early years and remains so for a while.

GMV refers to Gross Merchandising Value the sum of all payments conducted on the BNPL platform.

Marketing and sales expenses are expenses incurred as BNPL providers acquire and onboard both merchants and customers to their platform.

General and administrative expenses include team salaries technology and other infrastructure costs.

Turning profits in BNPL is very tricky and the model heavily relies on economies of scale (i.e. a high GMV) which enable companies to:

1) Negotiate better terms with financial (banks) and infrastructure providers (payment systems).

2) Access more data to improve their algorithms and reduce losses from debt impairment.

3) Balance out the high fixed costs of the business (marketing salaries technology and infrastructure).

Consumer-merchant flywheel

Beyond profitability the BNPL economic model relies on a positive feedback cycle (flywheel) that helps winners keep winning.

As more merchants join a BNPL provider more consumers have the opportunity to use the service. As these consumers see the service across multiple platforms they trust it more and are more inclined to try it leading to more transactions.

More consumers lead to more transactions and higher GMV. As a result BNPL providers increase their profitability (economies of scale) improve their risk assessment capabilities and algorithms thus dropping their loan losses (debt impairment).

Improved economics enables BNPL companies to offer more attractive deals and better services to merchants (i.e. conversion optimization and other services based on data collected)

Better deals and services make the BNPL value proposition more attractive to merchants increasing overall adoption and attracting more merchants.

BNPL in the Middle East

The Middle East region has witnessed an explosion of BNPL solutions in the past year with 10+ providers emerging many of whom have already raised significant funding to explore the space.

Beyond improving conversion and sales regional BNPL providers offer something extra: Partial relief from cash-on-delivery (COD) issues. Cash-on-Delivery which accounted for more than 60% of ecommerce sales pre-pandemic has been a major obstacle for ecommerce growth in the region and a headache for merchants.

BNPL solutions allow customers to pay after delivery thus partially driving some of them away from COD and removing the collection burden from merchants.

As a result I expect this service to rapidly gain traction in the Middle East. However the industry is likely to undergo some major shifts over the coming years as we see four key changes taking place:

1) Not everyone will survive.

As discussed above the economic model/ flywheel effect in BNPL means that succeeding in this business depends on your ability to:

1) Grow GMV and achieve economies of scale.

2) Raise enough money to cover losses in the early years of growth (as you work to yield a positive contribution margin and cover your fixed costs).

As a result we will see consolidation in the market as smaller players fail to achieve the required scale or raise enough money and thus exit the space (or are absorbed by some merchants). Eventually two to three independent players would survive and grow each picking a specific category or geography to focus on.

Given all players offer roughly the same core product distribution will be the core driver predictor of success in the first phase of growth: Whoever secures the highest number of quality retailers first will build an advantage.

2) Taking the battle to the consumer

As merchants start offering more than one BNPL solution providers will very soon look to the other end of the marketplace (the consumer) to capture the transaction.

They will redirect their marketing budget towards offerings aimed at keeping the consumer loyal to their platform. As a result expect to see more customized products and value-added services for consumers. Eventually BNPL providers will turn their websites into shopping and discovery platforms with merchant discounts to attract first-time customers. In that respect BNPL apps/ websites become a mini-version of The Entertainer focused on luxury/high-value purchases.

Shahry is a pioneer in this area and has already taken steps in this direction as it enables customers to browse various products and checkout on the Shahry app itself providing a seamless experience and ensuring you capture the consumer before they get to the checkout page. ValU the first in the region to offer BNPL which is owned by EFG Hermes has also embarked on the same journey.

Also similar to what western companies are doing regional BNPL providers will offer virtual cards where consumers pre-add money to use in their online and offline purchases thus keeping them loyal.

3) More regulatory scrutiny

Consumer lending is one of the most regulated sectors in our region and as they grow expect BNPL providers to attract a higher level of scrutiny. Regulators will specifically be worried about the adverse selection effect of the business:

Many BNPL consumers opt for the service as they can’t afford to pay for their purchase fully. These consumers will be at a higher risk of defaulting on their loans and getting burdened by debt. Regulators will look for ways to protect them and won’t look lightly at BNPL providers using tactics that incentivize impulse purchases

4) Some response from traditional players

Given the low barriers to entry there is no reason why big ecommerce players (i.e. Amazon Noon) and big retail conglomerates (MAF Chalhoub Al-Futtaim group) can’t start offering their own BNPL upon checkout (potentially buying the smaller players in the space as I mentioned in trend 1 above).

Similarly banks might learn a thing or two from disruption theory and start providing a credit card suite with a similar structure. In the US JP Morgan Chase has recently entered the BNPL space offering consumers the option to pay for purchases over multiple months at 0% interest and a small monthly fee.

Regardless of how things play out the future looks bright for Fintech players in the region and specifically BNPL providers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZmJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9zYXVkaS1zdGMtcGF5LWludHJvZHVjZXMtY29udGFjdGxlc3MtY2FyZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Saudi STC Pay introduces contactless cards,"STC Pay a mobile wallet operated by Saudi Arabia’s biggest telco STC has introduced contactless cards for use at point of sale (POS) machines e-commerce transactions and cash withdrawal at local and international ATMs.

Barnes was the last of the Dodgers’ arbitration-eligible players to sign this offseason. The team will not go to a hearing with anyone this year.

The contract is reportedly for $4.3 million over the next two seasons including a $300000 signing bonus and salaries of $1.5 million in 2021 and $2.5 million in 2022 with potential escalator clauses based on games played. Barnes had sought a $2 million salary for 2021 in arbitration with the Dodgers countering at $1.5 million.

Barnes has become valued by the Dodgers (and their pitching staff) for his defensive skills. Even as Yasmani Grandal and now Will Smith were the Dodgers’ primary catchers in the regular season Barnes has started 30 of the Dodgers’ 54 postseason games over the past four seasons including 15 of 18 World Series games in that time.

In six seasons with the Dodgers the 31-year-old Barnes has a .230 batting average and .700 OPS.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vbm9sYW53cml0aW4uY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMTMvdGV4YXMtcmFuZ2Vycy1vZG9yLWNhcmRpbmFscy10cmFkZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Rangers: Could team look to St. Louis for salary relief?,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2xvc2FuZ2VsZXMuY29tL25ld3Mvc3BvcnRzL2p1c3Rpbi10dXJuZXItcmV0dXJuaW5nLXRvLXdvcmxkLXNlcmllcy1jaGFtcGlvbi1kb2RnZXJzLzI1MjY3NTMv0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbG9zYW5nZWxlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9zcG9ydHMvanVzdGluLXR1cm5lci1yZXR1cm5pbmctdG8td29ybGQtc2VyaWVzLWNoYW1waW9uLWRvZGdlcnMvMjUyNjc1My8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Justin Turner Returning to World Series Champion Dodgers,"He's back!

Justin Turner is returning to the Los Angeles Dodgers. In what is a rarity in 2021 Turner himself broke the news of his return to the Boys in Blue via his Twitter account on Saturday night.

""Lettt's gooo run it back Dodgers fans!"" read the tweet accompanied by a photograph of Turner after he hit his infamous walk-off home run in Game 2 of the 2017 NLCS against the Chicago Cubs. ""LA He's Here to Stay"" read the caption behind the photo.

ESPN's Jeff Passan and The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal were the first to report the details of the contract which is reportedly a two-year deal worth $34 million. There is a team-option for a third year on the deal that would bring the total to $48 million over three years should the Dodgers take the option. Turner also received an $8 million signing bonus and has performance bonuses written in the contract that could increase the contract to as much as $52 million total.

Justin Turner deal with Dodgers per source: Two years $34M with club option for third season. Includes $8M signing bonus. — Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) February 14 2021

The 36-year-old third baseman batted .307 with four homers 23 RBIs and an .860 OPS during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season.

The red-headed slugger hit .320 with two homers during the World Series before being pulled from the deciding Game 6 after testing positive for the coronavirus. He infamously broke protocol by returning to the field after the final out and removed his mask near teammates during the celebration. MLB decided against punishing him.

Turner became a free agent when his $64 million four-year deal with the Dodgers expired after the World Series. He earned a prorated $7037037 of his $19 million salary in 2020.

Turner also had other suitors as well. Reportedly the Milwaukee Brewers also offered Turner a two-year $34 million deal with a third-year team option. The Braves and Blue Jays also reportedly had interest in Turner but the Long Beach born Southern California native opted to return home for the remainder of his career.

A late-bloomer after overhauling his swing in his late 20s Turner has been an anchor in the Dodgers' lineup for most of their eight straight NL West titles. He hit .302 with 116 homers over seven seasons in Los Angeles.

The Dodgers are set to bring back essentially the same team that won the 2020 title — along with NL Cy Young Award winner Trevor Bauer who signed a $102 million three-year deal with Los Angeles this week. Adding Bauer and returning Turner gave the Dodgers a splashy finish to an otherwise quiet offseason cementing the champs as a threat to repeat just days before pitchers and catchers are set to report for spring training.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvcmFuZ2Vycy8yMDIxLzAyLzEzL2VsdmlzLWFuZHJ1cy1zYXlzLWdvb2RieWUtdG8tZGFsbGFzLXlvdS13aWxsLWFsd2F5cy1ob2xkLWEtc3BlY2lhbC1wbGFjZS1hbmQtYS1iaWctc21pbGUtaW4tbXktaGVhcnQv0gGpAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9yYW5nZXJzLzIwMjEvMDIvMTMvZWx2aXMtYW5kcnVzLXNheXMtZ29vZGJ5ZS10by1kYWxsYXMteW91LXdpbGwtYWx3YXlzLWhvbGQtYS1zcGVjaWFsLXBsYWNlLWFuZC1hLWJpZy1zbWlsZS1pbi1teS1oZWFydC8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elvis Andrus says goodbye to Dallas: You will always hold a special place — and a big smile — in my heart,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.dallasnews.com', port=443): Read timed out.

SPACs have played a major role in both the investment-banking and automotive industries over the past year. In the wake of massive stock-price increases for EV-makers like Tesla and Nio startups making EVs or lidar sensors which are used by autonomous vehicles to detect nearby objects have been going public through SPAC mergers at a rapid pace. More than 20 companies involved in one of the two industries have merged with a SPAC or announced their intention to do so since the beginning of 2020.

SPACs make it faster and easier for companies to go public than traditional IPOs while also allowing young companies that have made little or no revenue to share their financial projections with the public. But some analysts have said the volume of EV SPAC deals has created a speculative bubble similar to the one that overinflated the values of internet-company stocks in the late 1990s.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2pvbmF0aGFucG9uY2lhbm8vMjAyMS8wMi8xMy9iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1kb25hbGQtZm9zcy13YXMtb25lLW9mLWdhbWVzdG9wcy1iaWdnZXN0LXNoYXJlaG9sZGVycy1idXQtY2FzaGVkLW91dC1iZWZvcmUtamFudWFyeS1zdG9jay1zdXJnZS1uZXctZmlsaW5nLXNob3dzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire Donald Foss Was One Of GameStop's Biggest Shareholders But Cashed Out Before January Stock Surge ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/02/13/billionaire-donald-foss-was-one-of-gamestops-biggest-shareholders-but-cashed-out-before-january-stock-surge-new-filing-shows/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2pvbmF0aGFucG9uY2lhbm8vMjAyMS8wMi8xMy9iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1kb25hbGQtZm9zcy13YXMtb25lLW9mLWdhbWVzdG9wcy1iaWdnZXN0LXNoYXJlaG9sZGVycy1idXQtY2FzaGVkLW91dC1iZWZvcmUtamFudWFyeS1zdG9jay1zdXJnZS1uZXctZmlsaW5nLXNob3dzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTAyLTEzL3Utcy1jcmVkaXQtd2Vlay1haGVhZC1hbWVyaWNhbi10aXJlLW1heS10YXAtanVuay1ib25kLW1hcmtldNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Tire May Tap Junk Bond Market: U.S. Credit Week Ahead,"The high-yield market issuance frenzy is expected to keep up next week as investors continue to gobble up risky assets to escape ultra-low interest rates in other products.

In 2018 the burgeoning mobile phone accessories market in the U.S. amassed $28.52 billion and has continued to boom since.

For former philosophy professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder and entrepreneur David Barnett (92C) creating the infamous PopSocket wasn’t a conscious decision rather it was a simple solution to his earbuds being constantly tangled.

A brand that started with Barnett gluing a large fabric button to the back of his iPhone 3 has since blossomed into a $200 million company that has sold more than 100 million units since its inception in 2014. The Wheel discussed the meteoric rise of the cult favorite and Colorado-based PopSockets with Barnett founder and CEO on Feb. 4.

This transcript has been edited for clarity and length.

Angela Choksi the Emory Wheel: What encouraged you to major in philosophy at Emory?

David Barnett: I was actually originally an economics major. I remember that I was sitting down with an advisor and told him that I found economics interesting at the beginning but I was losing that interest quickly. He told me to not waste my time and that this was my one chance in life to take classes about all sorts of different topics. About a year into classes I went to drop or change a class and I vividly remember standing in front of a wall on which they used to post course listings. There was a cute girl next to me who picked a philosophy course and I thought to myself sure I’ll try that class. I took the class I loved it and ended up eventually getting a Ph.D. in philosophy.

TEW: How would you describe your transition from being a philosophy professor to becoming a CEO?

DB: The timing was just perfect for me. I was burnt out of thinking of philosophical questions and the discipline itself. I love philosophy and loved grappling with those questions but after so many years I felt that you can only make so much progress. Then just by chance I came up with this invention … that I thought that I could sell to other people and by the time I brought it to market I realized that I could actually sell quite a few of these. Philosophy still comes in handy every day though in terms of critical thinking skills and decision-making skills. It has been invaluable for me in business.

TEW: How did the idea of PopSockets first come to you?

DB: As a kid I was an entrepreneur so I think that I was tapping into that spirit. In 2010 I was fed up with my earbud cords tangling in my pocket and so I drove to a nearby fabric store to find a solution for myself. I ended up gluing a couple of big clothing buttons to the back of my iPhone 3 with a few spacer buttons so that I could wrap my headset cord around these two huge inch-and-a-half clothing buttons. iPhone 3s were tiny and so these buttons covered my entire phone and it worked for my purpose but looked quite ridiculous and my friends and family made fun of me. I quickly set out to improve the solution and toyed with many different mechanisms until I landed on the accordion mechanism. I worked on making it more functional so that it could serve as a grip and a stand and clip on to things but still lay flush in your pocket. The grip is really the central feature that took off as the main benefit of a PopSockets Grip.

TEW: What inspired the name “PopSockets”? Is there any significance behind it?

DB: Originally the company and the first product was called iButtons. I did not really love the name and just quickly came up with it but then a billion-dollar company threatened to sue me for the name since I owned the iButtons.com domain name. When I was a professor I brainstormed some names with my students and my wife actually put our ingredients together to come up with the PopSockets name.

TEW: How do you feel when you see someone with a PopSocket on their phone?

DB: It’s almost sad now that I don’t feel nearly as much pride and joy as I used to since I have seen so many. In the early years it was a big deal when I would spot one of the PopSockets Grips in the wild. I was so excited to see one at the airport or in another state. It was a surreal experience for me to see an invention that I had been working on by myself at a desk in a little room after prototyping so many versions to be used by celebrities and so many other people when they blew up.

TEW: How has the coronavirus pandemic impacted you in your role as CEO as well as the PopSockets brand?

DB: Before the pandemic we had about 300 employees and sold at about 100000 doors in the United States alone. The pandemic was a major threat to our business and we were running out of cash from all these doors closing so we quickly had to cut expenses by roughly $45 million dollars within a matter of weeks furlough 60 employees and lay off 40 employees. Those were some of the roughest days that I have had in the brand and we had to be prepared for a decrease of about 40-50% in our sales projections. We ended up missing by about 20% at the end of last year and that was in large part to our online business as well as our retail partners that remained open like Target and Walmart.

TEW: How do you envision the future of PopSockets in the next few years?

DB: As far as growth goes we are focused on a shift of approach in terms of building a brand that sells direct-to-consumer around the world especially as we grow our business in Latin America and Asia. Instead of simply pegging our products in a large store our strategy is to grow brand awareness through social-media and influencer and awareness campaigns. This year we are launching a MagSafe collection for the new iPhone that has a magnetic platform on the back of it. We also have a big confidential product that we are launching later this year and are also toying with launching products that are not mobile phone accessories.

TEW: What is your fondest memory from your time as an Emory undergraduate?

DB: I have so many fond memories from my time at Emory. Just yesterday I was thinking about the draft of a book that the author who was my physics professor shared with me. Even though I wasn’t a physics major I formed a rapport with him and he felt comfortable enough to share his unpublished manuscript with me. Even though it went way over my head I read the whole thing and was stimulated by it. Pulling all-nighters is a fun memory of mine even though I did not really retain much while cramming. Curly fries intramural competitions and of course late night meals at Waffle House with my friends will always remain in my heart.

TEW: If you could share one piece of advice with Emory students or budding entrepreneurs what would it be?

DB: Tenacity is one of the most important qualities that an entrepreneur should have. You should also have the ability to internalize feedback and tweak your ideas accordingly. One should definitely join a start-up community that can support advise and guide you in key ways especially when you are just starting out with your business. One must also find the right balance of confidence which is associated with being tenacious accepting failure. Most entrepreneurs have a little too much confidence which is what allows them to take the risks that other people would not take. One must still be receptive to the feedback being received and the data surrounding your product or invention. You cannot be deaf to the market and have to be willing to adjust in light of feedback from the community.

TEW: What were some failures that you faced or obstacles that confronted you during the early stages of the company?

DB: Two of the biggest obstacles that I encountered were around supply-chain and hiring. I had massive problems around quality with my product with shipment after shipment of products being defective. I had no expertise in manufacturing or identifying the right suppliers either domestically or overseas and that led to massive pain for me that could have been avoided had I aligned myself with an expert or joined a start-up community in town. Our very first shipment of 30000 PopGrips which took all the money that I had at the time all had an ineffective adhesive and so they fell right off the phone. The second challenge was formulating expectations on what sorts of people I could hire for various positions. I had no understanding whatsoever of what an A player is or what a B or a C player in business is. As I hired people I had no idea whether I was hiring the best person in a field or the worst person in a field because I had nothing to compare these people to. Over the years I have understood what is available in the talent market and what sorts of people to hire for different levels of the company.

Conclusion

A version of the article originally appeared in West Hartford LIFE in November 2004 as well as in her 2018 book “Life in West Hartford.”

By Tracey Wilson Town Historian

Bristow an enslaved African aged 44 bought his freedom from Thomas Hart Hooker in 1775. Imagine the human dynamics of this manumission transaction. His manumission paper in the Connecticut Historical Society approximately 18 centimeters in length and of paper yellow with age reads:

Know all men by these presents that I Thomas Hart Hooker of Hartford in the County of Hartford for the consideration of Sixty Pounds money Rec’d to my full satisfaction – do by these present fully freely and absolutely release manumit and set at full Liberty a Certain Negro man Named Bristow from (?) to my house & assigns forever and I Do Grant to him said Bristow his full Liberty and Freedom from me and my Service that he may go & come when & wherever he pleases without any Hindrance or molestation from me or any one claiming from by or under me. In Witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand seal the 9th day of May Anno Dom 1775 in the 16th year of his Majesty’s Reign.

Signed Sealed & Deli’v

In presence of Thomas Hart Hooker

Salomon Whitman

Mary Root

Did Bristow know what freedom was while enslaved? Did he understand it once he had his freedom? His manumission paper clearly states what freedom included:

Being at full liberty from Hooker’s house forever

Having freedom from service to Hooker

Going and coming when and wherever he pleased without any hindrance or molestation from Hooker or anyone claiming to be working for Hooker

When I studied slavery with my students I often asked if they think enslaved people can understand freedom. Some students argued that not having freedom allows a person to understand the concept better. Others said that if a person can see his/her master’s freedom s/he can know what it is. Still others argued that a person can only know what freedom is when they have it.

Thomas Hart Hooker the enslaver of Bristow was 30 years old in 1775 at the time of Bristow’s emancipation. He was the great-grandson of Thomas Hooker one of the original English settlers in Hartford. Thomas Hart Hooker married Sarah Whitman Hooker six years earlier in 1769 and they had two children Abigail born in 1770 and Thomas Hart Hooker Jr. born in 1772.

At a point in time before 1775 Bristow had come to be enslaved by Hooker. This was not an unusual event in the West Division of Hartford. The pastors Benjamin Colton (1713-1759) and Nathanael Hooker (1759-1770) each enslaved men. Africans who were enslaved were present in both Hartford and the West Division and it was the economic and political leaders of the day who enslaved these Africans and their descendents who were often referred to as “servants.”

In December 1774 many colonists agreed to stop the importation exportation and consumption of British goods. But even after the first battle of the war at Lexington and Concord April 19 1775 most Americans believed that the British would change their ways. They remained loyal to England and thought that the Parliament would treat the colonists more fairly.

Hooker enlisted in the Hartford militia as a private soldier at “first call” in 1775. His wife two children and maybe some other “Negro” servants were left home but Bristow would have been free. With a wife and two children aged 5 and 3 Hooker went to war less than a month after the battles at Lexington and Concord. Thomas Hart Hooker participated in the siege of Boston and died of disease on November 11 1775. His body lies in an unmarked grave in Roxbury.

Hooker’s genealogy says that “before going to the seat of war he gave freedom to his negro servants saying that he would not own property in a human being while he himself was fighting for freedom.” The lore about Bristow was that Hooker bestowed freedom upon his “negro servants.” Bristow’s manumission paper reveals a story of Bristow’s freedom that directly challenges Hooker’s genealogy.

What makes Bristow’s manumission document so significant?

What surprises me the most was Bristow’s ability to buy his own freedom. He earned 60 pounds to pay Hooker. This was a large sum of money especially for someone who was enslaved.

One day’s work was worth three shillings according to account books from the time period. At 20 shillings per pound Bristow paid 1200 shillings or the equivalent of 400 eight-hour days of work. (At minimum wage in 2004 that would be close to $25000.)

This document is also significant for its use of “republican discourse” which had crept into American political and social life since the mid-18th century. This was rhetoric different from that of England. The colonists established new norms for behavior in America. The use of the terms “set at full liberty and freedom” are the very words used by the revolutionaries of the day.

The two witnesses to this transaction Salomon Whitman (perhaps a relative to Sarah Whitman Hooker) and Mary Root witnessed this economic transaction when Bristow paid his sum of money to his master. Women had few political rights and yet Mary Root was allowed to be a legitimate witness for the transaction.

According to law Hooker could not manumit Bristow unless Bristow could take care of himself. It seems from reading Bristow’s will from 1791 (16 years later) that Bristow then went to work for Thomas Hart Hooker’s brother Roger.

Roger according to the Hooker genealogy was born in 1751 and was six years younger than his brother. He made 11 voyages to the West Indies before the Revolutionary War. What did the colonists trade with the West Indies? A profitable commodity was Africans.

Historians have claimed that enslaved people in New England were treated as part of the family and were treated better than their counterparts in the South. Numerous runaway ads in the Connecticut Courant and a number of manumissions give us evidence that this was not accurate.

But Bristow’s will shows him bequeathing “all my estate both real and personal unto Thomas Hart Hooker and Abigail Hooker children of Thomas Hart Hooker late of Hartford.”

Imagine Bristow’s decision. Terry Schmitt former West Hartford Board of Education member suggested that Bristow was a man who could bridge cultures and that was why Schmitt said he voted to name the new middle school after him.

Bristow was an African-American who after buying his freedom continued to respect and be respected by the children of his enslaver. That could only have happened if this was a two-way relationship from a man who knew what it meant to be free and be human.

A Twitter user posted the following screenshot on Friday from retailer Big Bad Toy Store.

“We have been informed by Hasbro that they have canceled production of the Star Wars: The Black Series 6″ Cara Dune (The Mandalorian) and will not be fulfilling our order. Unfortunately this means we must cancel our pre-orders for this item. We apologize for the inconvenience and greatly appreciate your understanding.”

The Wrap has reached out to Hasbro for comment.

The former MMA fighter played Cara Dune on “The Mandalorian” for the first two seasons of the hit Disney+ show. A search on Hasbro’s store shows the current inventory of Cara Dune figures completely sold out.

Carano came under fire on Wednesday over an Instagram post in which she compared being Republican today to being Jewish during Nazi Germany. Social media reacted in a big way causing the hashtag #FireGinaCarano to trend. Carano was dropped by Lucasfilm and her talent agency UTA did the same shortly afterward.

“Jews were beaten in the streets not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbors…even by children. Because history is edited most people today don’t realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews. How is that any different from hating someone for their political views” Carano wrote.

Another Instagram story post showed someone with several masks covering their entire face with the caption “Meanwhile in California.”

At last year’s Disney’s investor call the company announced a “Mandalorian” spin-off show called “Star Wars: Rangers of the New Republic” which could have potentially starred Carano’s Cara Dune.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbWFnaWMubmV0LzIwMjEvMDIvaGFzYnJvLWNhcmEtZHVuZS1yd2IxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hasbro Halts Production of Cara Dune Collectible With No Warning - Inside the Magic,"If you haven’t heard about Gina Carano being fired from Star Wars by now you probably haven’t been on the internet this week. The Mandalorian actress was let go by Lucasfilm following months of social media controversy. Now the trickle-down effect of her firing has reached toy manufacturer Hasbro.

The company holds the master toy license for both Marvel and Star Wars. Their line of Star Wars The Black Series figures are particularly popular.

This action figure collection includes Skywalker Saga icons like Sith Lord Darth Vader Millennium Falcon pilot Han Solo Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker Princess Leia Organa bounty hunter Boba Fett Chewbacca and even the Empire Strikes Back (1980) Wampa.

It also features posable scale figures from The Mandalorian and animated series like Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels. Grand Admiral Thrawn Cad Bane The Armorer Rosario Dawson’s Ahsoka Tano and Pedro Pascal’s Din Djarin are all available for instance.

A run of Gina Carano’s Cara Dune figure was available for pre-order prior to the news of her firing. Now Hasbro has made the decision to cancel all pre-orders and immediately halt production of the Star Wars action figure.

Twitter user KC Walsh shared a screenshot of an email from the BigBadToyStore that read:

Hello Thank you for Pre-ordering from BigBadToyStore!

Hasbro recently spoke out about how Star Wars toys sales – and The Mandalorian toy sales in particular – had helped them survive the pandemic . Their Star Wars saga lightsaber line including the Darksaber has also been popular throughout the COVID-19 outbreak.

Furthermore Carano still has a large number of supporters and her character still appears in both the first season and the second season of The Mandalorian it is interesting that the decision was made to halt production of The Black Series figure.

There has been no official word from Hasbro regarding whether or not the character may be added to the merchandise collection in the future but for now it would appear that is not going to happen.

Amazon lists the Cara Dune toy as “Currently Unavailable” but still features the following description of the Star Wars figure:

Cara Dune: a veteran of the galactic Civil War who fought under the banner of the Rebellion Cara Dune is a seasoned Warrior

Disney plus series-inspired design: fans and collectors can imagine scenes from the Star Wars Galaxy with this premium Cara Dune action figure inspired by the the Mandalorian live-action TV series on Disney plus

Tv series-based character-inspired accessories: This Star Wars the black series action figure comes with 3 Cara dune-inspired accessories that make a great addition to any Star Wars collection

Premium articulation and detailing: Star Wars fans and collectors can display this highly poseable (4 Fully articulated limbs) figure featuring premium deco in their action figure and vehicle collection

What are your thoughts? Should the Cara Dune Black Series action figure have been canceled? Do you collect Star Wars figures from The Black Series or the Vintage Collection?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ3YXJzbmV3c25ldC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi9jYXJhLWR1bmUtdGhlLW1hbmRhbG9yaWFuLWFjdGlvbi1maWd1cmVzLWNhbmNlbGVkLWJ5LWhhc2Jyby5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cara Dune 'The Mandalorian' Action Figures Canceled By Hasbro,"According to multiple reports pre-orders of Hasbro Cara Dune action figures are being canceled by the toy manufacturer.

The Wrap reports that Hasbro producer of The Mandalorian Black Series and The Vintage Collection lines is canceling preorders of Cara Dune action figures scheduled to ship later this summer. This comes in the wake of Cara Dune actress Gina Carano’s firing over controversial remarks she made on social media. The cancelations were first reported in a tweet from a customer on Twitter:

Hasbro says bye bye Carano pic.twitter.com/gCpg05zoJt — KC Walsh (@TheComixKid) February 12 2021

The notice reads:

“We have been informed by Hasbro that they have canceled production of the Star Wars: The Black Series 6” Cara Dune (The Mandalorian) and will not be fulfilling our order. Unfortunately this means we must cancel our pre-orders for this item. We apologize for the inconvenience and greatly appreciate your understanding.”

The Wrap had reached out to Hasbro for comment without any reply as of this writing.

The Cara Dune figures being canceled are reissues of previously produced figures from both the Black Series 6″ line of action figures and the 3.75″ The Vintage Collection. Both figures ran in late 2019/early 2020 but were being reissued due to a lot of people missing out on the original runs of any and all The Mandalorian merchandise.

This does not affect the upcoming Retro Collection Cara Dune which will be produced in the classic Kenner Star Wars style. According to original reporting by Star Wars collecting site Yakface.com this particular figure will still ship with the rest of The Mandalorian themed assortment later this fall.

Yakface is also just reporting today on Twitter that some lucky folks with pre-orders may get theirs as GameStop did receive some The Vintage Collection Cara Due figures on February 11:

Keep an eye on your order status if you Pre-ordered the Cara Dune Vintage Collection figure from GameStop. Their Texas warehouse just received cases of them on February 11 and may still fill the orders. #hasbro #gamestop #vintagecollection #caradune #TVC #kenner #themandalorian pic.twitter.com/Kpe5YZQOuG — Yakface.com (@yak_face) February 14 2021

As is the case with any controversy prices on the existing Cara Dune Hasbro action figures have gone up since Gina Carano was let go. The aftermarket was already high on The Mandalorian action figures so this will make it more difficult for collectors to complete their collections at least in the near-term."
HCA,HCA Healthcare,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYWx0aGxlYWRlcnNtZWRpYS5jb20vbnVyc2luZy9ndWlkaW5nLWdlbi16LW51cnNlcy10aHJvdWdoLWNvdmlkLTE50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guiding Gen Z Nurses Through COVID-19,"HCA Healthcare's Chief Nurse Executive Jane Englebright shares how the hospital system has helped her nurses cope with the pandemic.

While COVID-19 is taking an emotional toll on nursing staffs indications are that Gen Z nurses—those between the age of 18 and 22—generally are having a much tougher time.

Generally the simple fact of their age with its lack of life experiences and adversity and therefore resilience is a major factor according to the study Keeping an Eye on Generation Z Nurses.

""Most Generation Z nurses have less experience with adversity"" the study states. ""It is difficult for them to put the COVID-19 experience into any context.""

Data from a recent survey Nurse Wellbeing At Risk indicated that Gen Z nurses were the most likely (57.3%) to report that COVID-19 had negatively impacted their overall well-being; they were the least likely (23.5%) to report managing work-related stress and anxiety; and only 15.4% felt comfortable discussing their well-being with their manager—a sharp difference from their baby boomer counterparts (59.6%).

Going into the pandemic HCA Healthcare based in Nashville had a handle on Gen Z nurses from a recruiting study it had commissioned and released in February 2020. The study conducted by The Center for Generational Kinetics was designed to better understand what motivates and drives the younger generations of nurses.

Jane D. Englebright PhD RN CENP FAAN is senior vice president and chief nursing executive for HCA Healthcare which employs about 98000 nurses most of whom she says are millennials and Gen Z.

HealthLeaders recently spoke with Englebright about how HCA has helped the hospital system's nurses—particularly its youngest nurses—navigate the pandemic.

The following is a transcript of the conversation lightly edited for clarity and brevity.

HealthLeaders: HCA commissioned a study last year on millennial and Gen Z nurses' perceptions. What overall did the study reveal about Gen Z?

Jane Englebright: What it helped us do was to prioritize the things that were important to this growing segment of our nursing population. What came out of it was their need for flexibility how important relationships were to them having a positive work environment and the importance of teamwork and how they want to feel part of a team. We got a lot of insight into training that we ended up using a lot this year in terms of how they prefer to receive training information. And then there's the whole idea that they needed a way to have a voice. All of those things we sort of knew going in but it gave us a little more insight and we turned around and tried to apply that to almost everything that we were dealing with [with COVID-19].

HL: How did the study help HCA prepare to manage through a pandemic?

Englebright: It was important and continues to be important as we manage a continuous flow of up-to-date accurate information. Do you remember in the beginning of the pandemic that we were still having conflicting guidelines coming out? As everything evolved and continued to change and as we learned more we had to get education to the front line fast. We had already been working on our centers for clinical advancement and a new education model and moving a lot of our education from the PowerPoint with voiceover to little mini videos so we ramped that up in a significant way.

The other thing we came up with was how to put reference materials at their fingertips that would never be out of date. We made these posters that can be hung up in the wall of the nurses' station or even in a patient room that had a QR code on it that links you to the master document and they could always just scan that code and read the latest. We could maintain everything in a central database that had all the latest information in it and not worry about a lot of outdated information still being out there in the unit.

HL: Even more seasoned nurses are struggling with the effects of the pandemic. How have your younger nurses grappled with it?

Englebright: Every age group has had the full spectrum of responses. There are different life stressors but they're all struggling with the disruption in their personal lives as well as the disruption in their work life. This last month I've spent quite a bit of time working in the TriStar vaccination clinic and you see the nurses coming through it and you can see the variation of how they're coping and their response. Some are coming in playing their walking music and dancing it out happy that we're to the vaccine stage. Others come in in tears because we're in the vaccine stage. And I think that's what we've seen all along. At every stage of this we've had the full range of responses.

HL: How did HCA help the nurses cope as the pandemic worsened?

Englebright: We put in place a Nurse Care Program [a free confidential program partnered with a company offering licensed psychologists counselors and therapists]. We had been piloting it in 2019 and when we got into the situation in March we ramped it up and rolled it out to the rest of the company in a six-week period and it's been widely accepted. About 90% of the calls that come through are the Gen Z and millennial nurses. Of almost 26000 calls about 20000 of them are related to COVID so the younger nurses are calling in larger numbers than the more seasoned nurses.

HL: How have you measured the outcomes of some of these actions that you've taken for your nurses?

Englebright: A couple of ways. We've done some poll surveys asking ""What's important to you and what else do you need?"" What we got back from them was that they had two things that were their key needs. One was frequent communication. That was the No. 1 way they felt that they were being supported. And then the other thing they need is to feel a sense of being safe at work and an understanding of all the work-related stress. So I think we've done that.

Our universal protection protocol that we put in place about being safe in the work environment seems to have worked and people seem to have confidence in it. And then with work-related stress how we came at that was first the Nurse Care Program. The second was we leaned heavily on our behavioral health experts throughout the organization and had them assemble resources on stress management [on our intranet]. While I was making rounds at one of our hospitals I saw some of the nurses gathered around a computer together and I asked ""What are you guys doing?"" and they said ""We're watching the mindfulness video. We do it every day at this time.""

HL: The Nurse Well-being At Risk survey says that only 15.4% of Gen Z nurses felt comfortable discussing their well-being with their manager. Given that how does a CNO or other nurse managers successfully ""take the temperature"" of how their youngest nurses are doing?

Englebright: Besides the couple of things I mentioned and the pulse surveys that we do periodically we also have a practice of employee rounding where managers spend time with each employee on a regular basis where they just talk about them: ""How are you doing? What are your career aspirations? Where do you want to go next? How can I help you develop?""

Then we've launched an app that our nurses designed that we call HCA Inspire. This app has social networking features and where [nurses] can recognize each other. [It] also has an ability to find a mentor; [nurses] can go in and match up with a mentor to talk.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZlcnl3ZWxsaGVhbHRoLmNvbS92YWNjaW5lLWNhcmQtYmV0dGVyLWJ1c2luZXNzLWJ1cmVhdS1zb2NpYWwtbWVkaWEtNTExMTMzNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Business Bureau: Don't Post COVID-19 Vaccine Card on Social Media,"Key Takeaways The Better Business Bureau advises against posting a picture of your vaccination card on social media to prevent identity theft and vaccine scams.

Instead they are promoting vaccine stickers to help spread the vaccine word without sharing private information.

The Better Business Bureau (BBB) is advising people not to post their COVID-19 vaccination card on social media due to the private information featured including your full name birth date and where you received your immunization which can make you vulnerable to identity theft and possible vaccine scams.

Although the personal information listed on the vaccination card isn’t more than what many people have already posted on their various social media accounts the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) explains that tidbits of personal information like this can help identity thieves put together a profile of a person making it easier to steal your identity and access your personal accounts.

“I took mine [photo] down after I heard that people were possibly stealing photos to make false vaccine records” Stephanie Van Derbur RN a patient placement coordinator at HCA Healthcare in Utah tells Verywell. “But I did post about my experience to spread the word.”

What This Means For You Make sure to check your privacy settings on all your social media platforms. Be cautious of the amount of information you post on social media as it enables those that want to steal your personal information. Share a picture of your ""I got vaccinated"" sticker instead of a photo of your vaccine card.

Vaccine Scams

Historically a public emergency usually attracts the work of scammers who try to take advantage of the vulnerable and the COVID-19 pandemic is no exception.

The BBB cited a news report detailing a scam that sold fake vaccination cards to people on eBay and points to other COVID-19 related scams including:

Clinical trial scams

Contract tracing cons

Counterfeit face masks

Government agency imposters

The BBB advises that you stay alert to these scams avoid sharing personal information on social media and make sure your privacy settings are strict to help prevent you or your personal information from falling victim to a scam.

Social Media Safety

Both the BBB and the FTC are promoting the use of stickers to help share your vaccination milestone and encourage others to get vaccinated. Stickers similar to the familiar ""I Voted"" stickers can help spread the word without sharing any personal information.

The BBB recommends the following tips on how to share safely on social media:﻿﻿

Share your vaccine sticker or use a profile frame instead . Share a photo of your vaccine sticker or set a frame around your profile picture.

. Share a photo of your vaccine sticker or set a frame around your profile picture. Review your security settings on all social media platforms . If you only want friends and family to see your posts be sure that’s how your privacy settings are configured.

. If you only want friends and family to see your posts be sure that’s how your privacy settings are configured. Be wary of answering popular social media prompts. Think twice before participating in other viral personal posts such as listing all the cars you’ve owned (including makes/model years) favorite songs and top 10 TV shows. Some of these “favorite things” are commonly used passwords or security questions.

Sharing Your Vaccine Experience

With COVID-19 vaccinations now being administered and developed around the world we're making progress against the pandemic. However according to the World Health Organization (WHO) vaccine acceptance is the next hurdle we need to overcome.

It is not enough to just provide information on the vaccine; we also need to utilize the main factors that drive vaccination acceptance and behavior—an enabling environment social influences and motivation.

According to a recent 1000-person Verywell Health survey people are more likely to say they'll get the COVID-19 vaccine if they know someone else who has already been vaccinated. Sixty-one percent of respondents who know a vaccinated person say they’d get vaccinated themselves while only 46% of those who don’t personally know a vaccinated person say they will.

The WHO explained on its website that “by making vaccine uptake ‘visible' to others through clinics in prominent public places or by enabling ways for people to signal that they have received the vaccine—on social media in news media or in person—we can contribute to making the social norm more salient.”

Despite the BBB's recommendations many will still continue to share their vaccine cards as a way to share their experience with others. If you do decide to post it consider blocking out your personal information or adjusting your privacy settings.

“I think publicizing the [vaccine] experience is good” Elizabeth Hanes RN a former nurse and freelance health writer tells Verywell. “Aside from the concerns noted above if posting at least part of your vaccine card provides a fun illustration then why not?”

The news comes three weeks after the hospital faced backlash for allowing teachers and staff at an affluent Los Gatos school district to skip the line for COVID-19 vaccines by pretending to be health care workers. The story first reported by San José Spotlight generated widespread outcry and led to the county withholding future vaccine doses from the hospital.

In an email obtained by this news organization the hospital’s Chief Medical Officer Klaus Thaler told staff that state-level changes in vaccine distribution have caused uncertainty about how the hospital’s vaccine supply will be impacted.

“Thus we officially closed our offering of first dose COVID vaccines to our colleagues medical staff and community” Thaler wrote. “Thank you to all those who took advantage of the hospital’s offering to get vaccinated and sincere appreciation for those frontline-team members who helped to operationalized (sic) the clinic.”

A county spokesperson said officials had been notified of the clinic’s closure and said it shouldn’t have a noticeable effect on the vaccine rollout in Santa Clara County. Good Samaritan officials say the focus was only to vaccinate its own health care workers — not the broader community.

“Our focus has always been our healthcare workers getting vaccinated” said Antonio Castelan a spokesman for HCA Healthcare Good Samaritan’s parent company. “We are now winding down our vaccination clinic since many of our employees already received their two doses.”

Following the vaccine scandal COVID-19 Testing Officer Marty Fenstersheib warned the county would withhold further vaccine doses to the hospital until it could prove it would follow the rules on distribution. On Jan. 28 the hospital sent a letter to Fenstersheib outlining how it would comply with county orders and continue vaccinations.

The plan written by hospital CEO Joe Deschryver said the hospital would immediately begin increased screening measures to ensure it only vaccinated eligible patients. Hospital officials planned to check identification at the entrance of the hospital outside the vaccine clinic and again inside the clinic.

DeSchryver said the hospital would not begin to vaccinate anyone beyond Tier 1 until it “exerts all efforts to vaccinate all health care workers in Phase 1A” and would follow a contingency plan to prevent vaccine wastage. Phase 1A primarily includes health care workers.

In response Fenstersheib told the hospital on Feb. 2 to “administer second doses of vaccines to all individuals who received a first vaccine dose from Good Samaritan” including those who got a vaccine even though it was not their turn.

Fenstersheib said some who received their first COVID-19 shot at Good Samaritan are “confused” as to who will administer their second one and reaffirmed that the hospital needs to provide second doses to those individuals instead of sending them to the county vaccine sites.

That happened to Irina Zaliznyak a 61-year-old health care worker who is not an employee of Good Samaritan. She received her first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine from Good Samaritan and expected to get her second shot on Feb. 16.

After hours of waiting on the phone the hospital told Zaliznyak to ask the county for her second dose. She was finally able to schedule her second vaccine appointment with Good Samaritan earlier this month.

Given the hospital’s decision to suspend its vaccine clinic except second doses Fenstersheib directed the hospital to return unused vaccines back to the county to be redistributed to other providers. It is unclear if Good Samaritan had done so.

“If any additional health care workers at Good Samaritan request vaccination they may be directed to county operated sites” Fenstersheib wrote.

County officials said Friday that Good Samaritan would remain on the county’s vaccine dashboard even after closing its COVID-19 vaccine clinic “as an indicator of vaccine history.”

According to The Guardian the young adults are all from Mali and seek damages for “forced labor and further compensation for unjust enrichment negligent supervision and intentional infliction of emotional distress” when they were children.

This also marks the first time a class-action lawsuit is being filed against the cocoa industry in a U.S. court. It is also believed that this case is only one of many instances of child abuse and slave labor in the industry. The Ivory Coast is responsible for 45% of the world's cocoa supply and has long been linked to human rights abuses structural poverty low pay and illegal child labor.

The court papers also say that the plaintiffs claim that they sustained injuries from machete accidents while working at the farms and that the farms knowingly profited from their labor without their knowledge at the time.

One of the companies in question being sued Cargill released a statement responding to the lawsuit saying it has no tolerance for child labor in cocoa production.

“We are aware of the filing and while we cannot comment on specifics of this case right now [the company wants] to reinforce we have no tolerance for child labor in cocoa production” the statement read. “Children belong in school. They deserve safe living conditions and access to good nutrition.”

Nestlé also released a statement saying it “does not advance the shared goal of ending child labor in the cocoa industry” and added “child labor is unacceptable and goes against everything we stand for. Nestlé has explicit policies against it and is unwavering in our dedication to ending it. We remain committed to combating child labor within the cocoa supply chain and addressing its root causes as part of the Nestlé Cocoa Plan and through collaborative efforts.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1jYWxsLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzEzL2hlcnNoZXlzLWNocmlzdGlhbi1wdWxpc2ljLWlzLXNjb3JpbmctYmlnLWluLXNvY2Nlci1hbmQtaW4tbWFya2V0aW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hershey's Christian Pulisic is scoring big in soccer and in marketing,"It was telling that for his recent GQ Sports photo shoot Christian Pulisic the squeaky clean 22-year-old phenom from famously happy Hershey was posed like some chic ’90s model reclining languorously on a beaten-up sofa in a pair of vintage jeans and a tank top his face — the face of American soccer — unshaven and brooding.

That new edgy image heralded the commercial maturation of a major figure in the lucrative world of sports marketing one whose appeal both here and abroad is already deeper than any previous U.S. soccer player’s.

Once a shy teenage prodigy whose endorsement reach didn’t go far beyond candy bars made in his Pennsylvania hometown Pulisic has promotional clout that has grown in tandem with his development from boy wonder to full-blown soccer stud.

That commercial promise along with his athletic prowess explains why a top English soccer club Chelsea of the English Premier League paid a $73 million transfer fee — a record for an American player — in 2019 to get Pulisic from German club Borussia Dortmund. It’s why such companies as Nike EA Sports and Gatorade have brought him on board.

“He’s got so much marketing potential” said Mike Koeshartanto marketing manager for Chicago-based Gilt Edged Soccer Marketing. “He’s attractive. He fits the mold of the modern young engaged athlete. It’s easy to see why he’s picked up so many endorsements.

“From Chelsea’s perspective he’s helped on the field helped with their marketing and helped capture the U.S. audience. And he’s done it at a time when soccer interest is at an all-time high here.”

With the sport making steady headway among mainstream American fans Pulisic’s ascension to a star both on the pitch and as a pitchman has been as well-timed as any of the slick passes he makes as one of Chelsea’s primary weapons.

Last year after decades when you had a better chance of finding a marbles competition on TV there were more than 3000 soccer matches broadcast in the United States an average of more than eight a day.

Merchandise sales are soaring here. Interest in the 25-year-old MLS (Major League Soccer) has increased 27% since 2012 according to Nielsen Sports Sponsorlink. In a 2018 Gallup poll of 18-to-34-year-olds soccer tied with basketball as the second favorite sport behind only football.

Those trends plus Pulisic’s ability to capitalize on them financially should only intensify as the U.S. Men’s National Team likely with him as its captain tries to get back to the World Cup next year and four years after that when North America hosts the event.

Other U.S. stars — Tim Howard Clint Dempsey — have played in England and enjoyed commercial success. But Pulisic the son of two college soccer players may already have eclipsed them. Some marketers compare him to Yao Ming whose signing by the Houston Rockets in 2002 helped the NBA boost its popularity in the lucrative Chinese market.

Chelsea hopes its substantial investment in Pulisic — in addition to the transfer fee they signed him to a five-year $49 million deal in 2019 — will deepen its footprint in America where Manchester United Liverpool and Arsenal have long been the most popular clubs. And companies on both sides of the Atlantic see the young star as a way to tap into the U.S. soccer awakening.

“The average age of U.S. soccer fans is among the youngest for any sport somewhere around 34-35” said Koeshartanto. “They have spending power. They’re tech-savvy. And with globalization everything is now at their fingertips.”

In Pulisic those fans also now have an authentic homegrown star to cheer. He’s already a two-time U.S. player of the year. And the Pennsylvanian’s 2019 Chelsea debut against Manchester United set an NBCSN ratings record for soccer. He’s the youngest-ever captain of the U.S. men’s national team; the youngest player to record a hat trick in Chelsea’s 115-year history; and the youngest foreigner to score a goal in Germany’s Bundesliga soccer league where he played for Dortmund as a 17-year-old.

“He can change a game instantly” said Gregg Berhalter the men’s national team coach. “He can split the defense make the big pass.”

The talent he displayed early on and the American hunger for that first homegrown superstar have burnished his social-media chops. In 2018 in perhaps the ultimate online compliment LeBron James who has 86.7 million Twitter followers posed for an Instagram photo wearing a Pulisic jersey. Pulisic though he rarely Tweets has 3.4 million followers.

Although he can’t yet demand the money that such established superstars as Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo can it’s estimated that Pulisic’s endorsements added at least $5 million to his income last year.

“In an era where individual player personality is so impactful he’s clearly the top guy to connect with both soccer fans and the mainstream sports fans who will tune in for the World Cup in 2022 and of course 2026 when that tournament comes to North America” said John Guppy Gilt Edge’s owner.

In addition to his deals with Nike EA Sports and Gatorade Pulisic also has agreements with Chipotle Tag Heuer (watches) Panini America (cards and collectibles) and — least surprisingly — hometown Hershey’s for whom he helped launch Reese’s Outrageous bar in 2018.

“It’s not very often that a superstar hails from your own backyard” said Suzanne Jones a Hershey vice president

Reserved good-looking with what GQ described as “the fulsome chin of an Action Man figurine” Pulisic who stands 5-foot-8 and weighs 155 pounds is as tough and fearless on the field as he is magnetic off it — a combination that has many marketers drooling.

“He’s from Hershey Pa.” said Koeshartanto “and he’s almost exactly what I would expect every person from Hershey to be like.”

Pulisic lives alone in the tony London suburb of Wimbledon. When he’s not practicing or playing he’s likely to be at home on the video game console or eating a burrito. In fact it was his cravings for their burritos that led to Chipotle’s deal.

“That was one he manufactured himself” said Koeshartanto whose company counts Chelsea among its clients. “There are only about 40 Chipotle’s outside the U.S. mostly in Europe but he would always find one and post pictures of himself while at Chipotle’s. He’s their first international endorser.”

Chelsea awarded him the No. 10 jersey that traditionally goes to the team’s top offensive player. And in 2020 the only jersey that sold more than that one in the U.S. was Messi’s.

Pulisic is also someone who interacts online with athletes from different sports. Among them is the Utah Jazz’s Donovan Mitchell to whom Pulisic sent a jersey helping to convert the NBA star into a soccer fan.

Research that Gilt Edge conducted in 2020 revealed that Pulisic was by far the most popular player among American fans 10 times more so than Jozy Altidore or Michael Bradley. Among that same group his popularity also exceeded that of such familiar international superstars as Mo Salah Kylian Mbappe and James Rodriquez.

“He’s the most popular U.S. player no doubt about that” said Koeshartanto “and he’s probably top five across the world. It was always going to take a generation or two for soccer to take hold in America. Now thanks in no small part to Christian we’re seeing that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbm5saXZlLmNvbS9mb29kLzIwMjEvMDIvZmFzdG5hY2h0cy1pbi10aGUtaGFycmlzYnVyZy1hcmVhLWhlcmVzLXdoZXJlLXRvLWJ1eS10aGVtLWZvci1zaHJvdmUtdHVlc2RheS5odG1s0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbm5saXZlLmNvbS9mb29kLzIwMjEvMDIvZmFzdG5hY2h0cy1pbi10aGUtaGFycmlzYnVyZy1hcmVhLWhlcmVzLXdoZXJlLXRvLWJ1eS10aGVtLWZvci1zaHJvdmUtdHVlc2RheS5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fastnachts in the Harrisburg area: Here’s where to buy them for Shrove Tuesday,"It’s almost Fastnacht Day.

Every year on Shrove Tuesday bakeries grocery stores and churches stock up on fastnachts in a variety of flavors from plain to cinnamon sugar. This year the sweet day falls on Feb. 16.

Fastnachts unlike typical doughnuts decorated with sprinkles or filled with jelly or cream are dense and not very sweet.

The tradition of eating fastnachts started with the Pennsylvania Dutch who were looking for recipes to use up fat such as lard in the house before Lent. Fastnacht is a German word meaning “night before the fast.”

Not every fastnacht is the same and recipes vary. Some fastnachts are square or diamond-shaped while others are round. Some have holes.

Authentic fasnachts are made with yeast or baking soda. Some recipes call for mashed potatoes or potato flour. Traditional fastnachts are supposed to be deep-fried in lard.

This year on account of the coronavirus pandemic some mainstay fastnacht fundraisers including St. Cecilia’s Catholic Church in Lebanon have been postponed. The church has been making the deep-fried sugary Lenten treats since the 1930s.

To ensure you don’t miss out on the doughnut tradition here’s a list of places in and around the Harrisburg region selling them in the coming days:

When tech vendors and IT leaders from private and public enterprises gathered in the swanky Armani Hotel located in Dubai’s famous Burj Khalifa skyscraper at the 5th IoT Middle East conference last year much of the discussion revolved around the idea that IoT systems are expected to generate a trillion dollar market in the coming decade with far-reaching impact on areas such as energy consumer electronics telecommunication and industrial manufacturing.

“IoT devices collect data they create a mesh network (and) they send the data using cellular connectivity to the cloud and then from there on to the analytics and applications” explained Janne Kilpelainen the senior vice president of IoT engineering company Haltian at the Dubai summit.

Most of the IoT adoption in the Middle East is for the creation of public administration applications and major projects for smart cities some of which are being built from the ground up. City planners use IoT networks to monitor and control infrastructure devices and the flow of data with the overall goal of optimising public services enabling business opportunities and improving the standard of living for residents. For example data can flow into machine-learning systens that can then do predictive analysis for maintenence planning for essential public utilities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0YXJnZXQuY29tL3NlYXJjaHN0b3JhZ2Uvb3Bpbmlvbi9QYXktcGVyLXVzZS1wcmljaW5nLW1vZGVsLWNhbi1ib29zdC1kaWdpdGFsLWluaXRpYXRpdmVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pay-per-use pricing model can boost digital initiatives,"Businesses of all shapes and sizes -- and across multiple industries -- are ramping up their digital business initiatives and IT services roadmaps. Even prior to COVID-19 these initiatives were high on the IT priority list but in a soon-to-be post-coronavirus era (vaccine distribution permitting) businesses will succeed or fail based on their ability to use technology to better understand and engage with customers.

For some businesses COVID-19 has reaffirmed their existing roadmaps and plans. For others the pandemic has been a painful wake-up call. As businesses seek to add to or accelerate their digital initiatives some would say transformations personnel and budget constraints will present major hurdles to success.

Some IT organizations have turned to a pay-per-use or as-a-service model for infrastructure as a means of speeding up digital initiatives by accelerating investments without significantly impacting near-term budgets. Enterprise Strategy Group found in a recent study for example that IT organizations were more likely to favor a consumption-based model for procuring data center infrastructure over a traditional model with upfront capital purchases.

What's behind the growing interest in a pay-per-use pricing model? Two high-level goals drive interest in consumption-based pricing: the need to simplify IT operations and a desire to maximize near-term budget opportunities. A pay-per-use pricing model reduces the considerable level of effort involved with architecting and optimizing data center hardware for current and future needs of application environments. Given how quickly these environments are scaling and evolving -- especially with the rise of cloud-native container-based workloads -- accurately forecasting infrastructure demands over multiple years has become increasingly difficult. In addition more than one-third of IT organizations are experiencing problematic skill shortages in the area of IT architecture and planning. Shifting to a pay-per-use or as-a-service model can eliminate much or all of the upfront forecasting and architecting work. The other and possibly more enticing benefit is that pay-per-use infrastructure purchasing offers a way to maximize the near-term potential of existing IT budgets. For enterprises that have multiple projects on the roadmap shifting from a large upfront capital purchase model to one that allocates costs over the life of a technology can enable existing budgets to extend to a larger amount of infrastructure -- which can accelerate IT projects. This opportunity to accelerate activities with existing budgets has quickly become a major driver behind the increasing levels of interest in these consumption-based models.

What holds organizations back from consumption-based IT? One of the more dominant reasons why organizations do not take advantage of as a service and pay per use is that their current budget model will not allow them. Another common critique however centers on the assumption that if you implement a pay-per-use model you will pay more over time than if you procured the system upfront. In other words usage-based pricing enables you to pay less upfront but over the life of the product those who choose to pay more upfront will pay less overall. Each offering is different. But even if you assume that a pay-per-use option would require a larger expense versus an upfront purchase the ability to defer payments has value. In addition pay-per-use models reduce the personnel time and risk associated with forecasting the environment. The cost equation ultimately comes down to two questions: How confident are you with your ability to forecast application needs over the next three to four years? And are you sure there isn't something you could do that would be a better use of your time?

As-a-service vs. consumption-based pricing The research data on the rising interest in a pay-per-use pricing model often focuses predominately on consumption-based pricing which is different from a true as-a-service model. Organizations can achieve similar benefits with each approach however. With subscription-based pricing you manage the infrastructure but only pay for what you use. With an as-a-service model the expectation is that the infrastructure vendor will take care of the maintenance support and even the upgrade path. As a service goes further to reduce the burden on IT resources which can help accelerate digital initiatives.",,,,,,,,,

The “Larry King Live” host was initially hospitalized back in December at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles with COVID-19. His wife Shawn Southwick King in January revealed it was not the highly contagious virus however that killed the media icon at the age of 87.

According to King’s death certificate obtained by People he died from sepsis brought on by two underlying symptoms: late-stage renal failure or kidney failure and hypoxic respiratory failure a condition caused by a lack of oxygen in the blood.

In this Nov. 20 2017 photo Larry King attends the 45th International Emmy Awards at the New York Hilton.

King had also been battling a series of other health issues in recent years including Type 2 diabetes several heart attacks and a lung cancer diagnosis in 2017 which was ultimately treated via surgery. In 1987 he underwent quintuple bypass surgery.

Southwick King last month said her husband “was finally ready to go” at the time of his death.

“You know he never wanted to go but his sweet little body was just it had just been hit so many times with so many things and once we heard the word ‘COVID’ all of our hearts just sunk” she told “Entertainment Tonight.”

“But he beat it you know he beat it but it did take its toll and then the unrelated infection finally is what took him but boy he was not gonna go down easily”

King’s death came five months after the deaths of his children Andy and Chaia who died less than a month apart last summer.

Andy died suddenly of a heart attack on July 28. He was 65. Chaia died on Aug. 20 shortly after being diagnosed with lung cancer.

The New Mexico Environment Department placed the home improvement retailer located at 3560 E. Main St. on its daily Rapid Response COVID-19 watchlist when employees tested positive for the virus.

A letter from the New Mexico Department of Health to the business explained that the closure was required because the cases happened within a 14-day period and in accordance with the public health order issued on Jan. 29.

One case of COVID-19 infection was found on Jan. 22 Jan. 25 Jan. 29 and Feb. 1 according to the letter.

It goes on to explain that Home Depot may become exempted from the closure if the business enters into an agreement for surveillance testing and contact tracing plan with the environment and health departments.

""We're working with the state and our focus is the safety of our associates and customers which is why we've put numerous safety measures ...in place including requiring masks daily health checks for associates social distancing contract tracing and enhanced cleaning in addition to paid leave and time-off policies for associates"" Home Depot Spokesperson Margaret Watters Smith said to The Daily Times on Feb. 13.

She added that during the closure customers who need to purchase essential items may use the company's website and its options for delivery.

The company's website lists the location as ""temporarily closed"" on its store locator.

Customers were seen stopping at the location on Feb. 13 only to leave after reading the notice about the closure posted outside the main entrance.

For those who parked their vehicles they were informed by a person patrolling the parking lot that the store was closed.

According to the environment department the store has had positive tests among employees since October 2020. That month the department began publishing the names of businesses government agencies and schools that have two or more rapid response tests during a 14-day period.

In April of 2020 a department manager and an associate died from COVID-19. A company spokesperson talked to The Daily Times then about efforts to protect workers and customers at the Farmington store.

The Home Depot is the second retailer to be closed by the health department in Farmington. The Walmart Supercenter at 1400 W. Main St. was closed by the department from Nov. 7 to Nov. 21.

The two residents provided information leading to the arrest and conviction of a 2019 arsonist and will receive $4500 each from the Georgia Arson Control Board.

“The fire occurred July 1 2019 at 6:40 a.m. at 648 Joe Findley Road Royston which is in Hart County” said State Fire Investigator Brian Smith. “It was a doublewide mobile home that received heavy damage. A fire in the area of the back porch burnt into the structure destroying the structure.”

Hart County Sheriff’s Capt. Chris Carroll said the investigation and subsequent capture of James Colby Chastain of Vanna was a time-consuming process including having to seek the suspect in another state.

“It took a lot of effort” Carroll said. “We had to use the U.S. Marshals Service and there were a lot of resources used to track him down especially when it goes state to state – that takes a lot of people.”

Chastain 25 at the time was arrested in Columbia S.C. more than a month after the fire.

Smith said Hart County has seen several arson cases in recent years.

“In 2019 the State Fire Marshal’s Office worked four cases here in Hart County” Smith said. “One of those cases was an undetermined fire. The other three were an intentionally set fire. Out of those three cases two of those cases were cleared by arrest.”

Smith said the Georgia Arson Control Reward Program is an important deterrent but also is a valuable tool for investigators.

“The program works but it works because we have folks that want to give information and it really helps us out in our investigation” Smith said.

Carroll agreed.

“The public’s help is huge and I hope this shows the public that there are resources out there when they give information” Carroll said. “In the future I hope people will be more willing to give information knowing they can get something in return.”

The presentation to one of the recipients was made Thursday at the Hart County Sheriff's Office.

The Georgia Arson Control Program Inc. was formed in 1979 by property and casualty insurers writing business in Georgia. With the cooperation of the Georgia Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner’s Office and state and local law enforcement GAC set up a toll-free Arson Hotline with a rewards fund from which monetary rewards are given to individuals who come forward with information that results in the arrest and conviction of arsonists.

“We’ve given almost $2 million away in rewards since then” said Georgia Arson Control Consultant Kenneth LeCroy. “We’re averaging about $4000 a reward at this time. This is the first two rewards we’ve given away this year but we’re looking to give a lot more away and anybody is eligible. You don’t have to be a Georgia resident or anything; it just has to be a fire here in Georgia and you’ll be eligible for giving information that helps solve the case.”

This deal which is expected to close in the second quarter shows Hormel’s hunger for the ""high-growth area of snacking” according to Sheehan.

“Snacking is significant. This will give us a number brand in the nut category” he added.

This adds more non-meats to Hormel’s portfolio. When this deal is done 25% of its retail sales will be of non-meat products.

Of course Hormel still has a meaty center with its more than 80-year-old Spam product line which despite its age has been racking up record sales for the past seven years.

The Planters brand has an almost 100% recognition with consumers but Hormel wants to breathe some new life into it. Hormel first identified Planters as a possible acquisition at a strategy meeting in 2016. Talks with the Kraft Heinz Co. about buying Planters started before the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020.

While Hormel is known for regularly buying popular brands in the grocery aisles this deal is on a much larger scale than any it has ever done. In the past five years it has spent a total of $3 billion buying up small companies.

“This is a goal we’ve had for a long time. … to make a very impactful acquisition in the 3 to 4 billion range” said Sheehan. “The genesis of this goes back when we bought Skippy. … We’re an important player in the peanut business.”

Hormel believes that legacy brands such as Planters or even Spam can be preserved while also being updated and expanded. The company has been working to create new products such as Skippy squeeze peanut butter and its plant-based Happy Little Plants line. Rapid innovation is part of the company’s overall strategy.

Of the all products that Hormel sold in 2020 15% of them did not exist in 2017.

Adding Planters to its collection of brands won’t spur any direct changes at the Austin production facilities but Sheehan said it will benefit Austin.

“We are very committed to the community that we are in and this will make us a stronger member of the community” he said. “All of a sudden Austin Minn. is not only a major player with Spam chili and pepperoni. It is now a major player in the peanut business.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vY2F5bWFuLmxvb3BuZXdzLmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2tyYWZ0LWhlaW56LXNlbGxzLXBsYW50ZXJzLWJyYW5kLWhvcm1lbC1mb29kcy0w0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kraft Heinz sells Planters brand to Hormel Foods | Loop Cayman Islands,"Hormel Foods is going nuts.

The Austin Minnesota-based company known for its meat brands like Spam and Applegate said Thursday it is buying the Planters nut business from Kraft Heinz Co. for $3.35 billion. Included in the deal are Planters brands like Nut-rition Cheez Balls and Corn Nuts.

""The acquisition of the Planters business adds another $1 billion brand to our portfolio and significantly expands our presence in the growing snacking space"" Hormel Chairman President and CEO Jim Snee said in a statement.

The proposed transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2021.

Kraft CEO Miguel Patricio said the sale is a major step in the company's transformation. Patricio said the company plans to reinvest in products that have more growth opportunity like Lunchables and P3 protein packs.

Kraft Heinz which was formed in a 2015 merger has been struggling as customers increasingly seek fresh minimally processed foods. It has also had trouble differentiating its products from cheaper store brands.

In 2019 it slashed the value of its Oscar Meyer and Kraft brands and took an impairment charge because of the falling value of brands like Maxwell House and Velveeta. Last year it sold its natural cheese business including its Cracker Barrel brand to French dairy company Lactalis Group for $3.2 billion.

But Kraft Heinz also saw stronger retail sales last year as customers stocked up during the pandemic. The company said Thursday its net revenue grew 4.8 per cent to $26.2 billion last year. That beat Wall Street's estimates according to a poll of analysts by FactSet. Kraft Heinz also beat its fourth-quarter earnings expectations.

Hormel reports its fiscal first-quarter results next week. For the 2020 fiscal year which ended in October its sales rose one per cent to $9.6 billion.

Under the agreement Kraft Heinz will sell its Corn Nuts production facility in Fresno California and Planters production facilities in Fort Smith Arkansas and Suffolk Virginia to Hormel.

Following a similar pattern the S&P 500 Index made modest gains and reached a new peak mid-week before paring a part of the gains in the following session.

Meanwhile COVID-related filings for unemployment benefit remained elevated last week resulting in first-time claims of about 793000 which was above economists’ prediction.

Hormel Foods the company behind several popular food brands this week gobbled up Kraft Heinz Company’s snack nut portfolio Planters in a deal worth $3.4 billion.

Despite a slight dip in net income the company maintains a strong balance sheet with increased EBITDAre.

Strategic divestitures and a focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels position Host for competitive advantage.

Recent acquisitions signal a forward-looking growth strategy amidst a challenging economic landscape.

On May 3 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) a premier owner of luxury and upper-upscale hotels reported its first-quarter financial results through the 10-Q filing. The company's portfolio predominantly located in the United States consists of 77 properties with a strong presence under the Marriott and Starwood brands.

Decoding Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power and Portfolio Quality: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strength lies in its high-quality portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels primarily operating under the prestigious Marriott and Starwood brands. This association with renowned brands enhances the company's market presence and customer loyalty. The strategic focus on urban and resort properties in key markets positions Host to capitalize on high-demand segments driving revenue per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge.

Financial Robustness: The company's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet and revenue growth. The 6.5% increase in total revenues and the expansion of the operating profit margin reflect efficient cost management and an ability to drive top-line growth. The 13.5% increase in EBITDAre further demonstrates Host's operational efficiency and its capacity to generate cash flow which is crucial for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

Strategic Asset Management: Host's recent divestitures and acquisitions indicate a proactive asset management strategy. By selling off non-core assets and investing in strategic properties such as the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown Host is refining its portfolio to focus on high-potential markets and properties that align with its growth objectives.

Weaknesses

Net Income Decline: Despite revenue growth Host Hotels & Resorts Inc experienced a 6.5% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to translate revenue increases into net profit consistently. It is essential for Host to analyze the underlying causes such as potential increases in operating expenses or one-time charges and address them to ensure sustained profitability.

Dependence on Brand Partners: The company's significant reliance on Marriott and Starwood brands while a strength also poses a risk. Changes in the relationship with these brand partners or shifts in their strategic direction could impact Host's operations and market positioning. Diversifying its brand portfolio could mitigate this dependence and spread operational risk.

Impact of Strategic Shifts: The recent sale of international joint venture interests and other U.S. properties may lead to short-term disruptions and a potential loss of revenue from those assets. Host must manage these transitions effectively to ensure that the long-term benefits of these strategic moves outweigh the immediate impacts.

Opportunities

Market Recovery and Demand Growth: As the economy recovers from the pandemic and travel demand rebounds Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is well-positioned to benefit from increased occupancy and average daily rates. The company's focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels which are expected to see a faster recovery presents an opportunity to capture a larger market share and drive revenue growth.

Strategic Acquisitions: Host's recent acquisitions demonstrate its ability to identify and capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. The company's strong balance sheet and access to capital allow it to pursue further acquisitions enhancing its portfolio and geographic diversity and positioning it for long-term growth.

Operational Excellence: Host's operational efficiency as evidenced by its improved EBITDAre provides an opportunity to further optimize costs and enhance profitability. Continued focus on operational excellence can lead to sustained improvements in margins and cash flow generation.

Threats

Economic Uncertainty: The potential for an economic recession coupled with high inflation and rising interest rates poses a threat to the hospitality industry. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc must navigate these macroeconomic challenges which could impact travel demand and the company's financial performance.

Geopolitical Risks: Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts can affect global travel patterns and have a direct impact on Host's operations. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to mitigate the effects of such external risks on its business.

Competition and Market Saturation: The luxury and upper-upscale hotel segments are highly competitive with new entrants and existing players vying for market share. Host must continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive position in a potentially saturated market.

In conclusion Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) presents a strong financial and strategic profile with robust revenue growth a high-quality portfolio and a proactive approach to asset management. However the company must address the decline in net income manage its brand partner dependencies and

James F. Risoleo President and Chief Executive Officer said “Host delivered comparable hotel Total RevPAR growth of 0.5% over the first quarter of 2023 which is impressive given the challenging comparison of the prior year. Banquet revenues led our performance driven by improvements in group business and continued strong demand in food and beverage. In addition we delivered net income of $272 million a decline of 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and Adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million an 8.8% improvement over the first quarter of 2023. At the same time comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2% as a result of tough comparisons the impact of Maui and unseasonable weather in many markets that impacted short term leisure demand.”

Risoleo continued “Subsequent to quarter end we acquired the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and our strategic approach to capital allocation. This two-hotel complex further improves the quality of our portfolio and establishes a meaningful presence for Host in a top performing market. As a result of the acquisition additional business interruption insurance gains and improving out-of-room spend we kept our net income guidance flat to our previous forecast while increasing the mid-point of our Adjusted EBITDAre guidance by 2%. We tightened our full year Total RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.7% to 4.6% and our RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.0% to 4.0% based on our performance in the first quarter the evolving nature of demand in Maui and our expectations for growth in the second half of the year. Given our fortress balance sheet and successful capital allocation execution we believe Host is well positioned to continue delivering EBITDA growth.”

(1) NAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel revenues are non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally comparable hotel results and statistics include adjustments for dispositions acquisitions and non-comparable hotels. See Hotel Operating Data for RevPAR results of the portfolio based on the Company's ownership period without these adjustments.

HIGHLIGHTS:

Comparable hotel Total RevPAR was $369.58 representing an increase of 0.5% compared to first quarter of 2023 as strong contributions from group business led to an increase in food and beverage revenues with banquet and catering revenues per group room night in excess of the prior peak reached in first quarter of 2023.

Comparable hotel RevPAR was $215.37 for the first quarter of 2024 representing a decrease of 1.2% compared to first quarter of 2023 driven by the impacts of the Maui wildfires unseasonable weather conditions in several markets and unanticipated delays in renovation. In addition there were difficult comparisons to first quarter of 2023 which had experienced elevated levels of leisure demand leading to significant RevPAR growth.

GAAP net income was $272 million for first quarter of 2024 reflecting a 6.5% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in gain on asset sales partially offset by gains on insurance settlements recognized in the first quarter. GAAP operating profit margin was 19.8% an improvement of 180 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the insurance gains.

Comparable hotel EBITDA was $435 million for first quarter of 2024 a 2.9% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 leading to a comparable hotel EBITDA margin decline of 140 basis points to 31.2%. The decline for the quarter was driven by increased wages and higher insurance expenses in comparison to first quarter 2023.

Adjusted EBITDAre was $483 million for first quarter of 2024 exceeding 2023 by 8.8% driven by strong operating performance at The Ritz-Carlton Naples which was closed in the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian and including the benefit of the business interruption gain.

To date the Company has received insurance proceeds of $263 million out of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian. The Company received $31 million in the first quarter and $10 million of these proceeds were recognized as a gain on business interruption.

Subsequent Acquisition

On April 15 2024 the Company acquired the fee simple interest in the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for a total purchase price of $530 million. The LEED Silver® hotels comprise a two-hotel complex located in Nashville's famed Lower Broadway entertainment district across the street from Music City Convention Center and near other key points of interest and feature seven food and beverage outlets a spa two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space.



Maui Update

Impacts from the August 2023 wildfires in Maui Hawaii continued into 2024. In the first quarter the Company's Maui hotels and golf courses impacted RevPAR by 170 basis points. Operating profit margin and comparable hotel EBITDA margin were impacted by approximately 50 basis points and 30 basis points respectively for the first quarter. The first quarter impact is understated as the Company would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points.

BALANCE SHEET

The Company maintains a robust balance sheet and completed several transactions in March and April of 2024. These transactions include:

Net draws of $215 million on the revolving credit facility (including a $300 million draw in March as well as a $65 million draw and $150 million repayment subsequent to quarter end).

Under the Hyatt Transformational Capital Program the Company received $2 million of the expected full year $9 million of operating guarantees in the first quarter of 2024 to offset business disruptions.

2024 OUTLOOK

The 2024 guidance range continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth. In addition the range incorporates continued improvement in group business a gradual recovery in business transient demand softer short term leisure transient demand and the evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. Growth in the first half of 2024 is expected to be flat to low single-digits while the second half of the year is expected to have stronger year-over-year improvements due to better group booking pace less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and diminishing impacts from the wildfire event in Maui which occurred in early August of 2023.

Operating profit margin in 2024 is expected to increase slightly compared to 2023 while comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to decline compared to 2023 due to the impacts from the Maui wildfires and continued growth in wages real estate taxes and insurance. At the midpoint of guidance the impact from the Maui wildfires is expected to be an approximate decline of 130 basis points in RevPAR 90 basis points in Total RevPAR and 20 basis points in margins. At the midpoint in comparison to 2019 operating profit margin is expected to increase 110 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to increase 10 basis points as portfolio-wide cost reductions continue to curb inflation and benefiting from business interruption gains.

The guidance range for net income and Adjusted EBITDAre includes an additional $28 million of gains from business interruption proceeds compared to prior forecast comprised of $8 million related to Hurricane Ian and based on an estimated range of $18 million to $22 million related to the Maui wildfires which is expected to be received during the remainder of 2024. The guidance also includes an estimated $17 million and $29 million of net income and Adjusted EBITDAre respectively which is expected from the recent acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown. Due to the timing of the acquisition the results for these two hotels will be included in the comparable hotel guidance starting in the second quarter. Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California in March 2024 Alila Ventana Big Sur temporarily closed on March 30 2024 and will be removed from the forecast comparable hotel set for full year 2024.

The Company anticipates its 2024 operating results as compared to 2023 will be in the following range:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Comparable hotel Total RevPAR $352 to $359 2.7% to 4.6% 2.9% to 5.8% (60) bps Comparable hotel RevPAR $214 to $218 2.0% to 4.0% 2.5% to 5.5% (100) bps Total revenues under GAAP (in millions) $5650 to $5753 6.4% to 8.3% 5.2% to 8.1% 80 bps Operating profit margin under GAAP 15.4% to 16.1% (20) bps to 50 bps (40) bps to 70 bps (10) bps Comparable hotel EBITDA margin 29.3% to 29.8% (80) bps to (30) bps (120) bps to (40) bps 30 bps

Based upon the above parameters the Company estimates its 2024 guidance as follows:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Net income (in millions) $719 to $775 $708 to $794 $(4) Adjusted EBITDAre (in millions) $1640 to $1700 $1590 to $1680 $35 Diluted earnings per common share $1.00 to $1.08 $.99 to $1.11 $(0.01) NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share $1.97 to $2.05 $1.92 to $2.04 $0.03

(1) The Forecasts are based on the below assumptions:

Comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 2.0% to 4.0% compared to 2023 for the low and high end of the forecast range. Comparable hotel metrics do not yet include the results of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown which were acquired in April 2024. We expect to include the comparable hotel results for these two hotels beginning in the second quarter.

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins will decrease 80 basis points to 30 basis points compared to 2023 for the low and high ends of the forecasted comparable hotel RevPAR range respectively.

We expect to spend approximately $500 million to $605 million on capital expenditures.

Includes $17 million of net income and $29 million of EBITDA from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024. Assumes no additional acquisitions and no dispositions during the year.

Assumes a total of $38 million of gains from business interruption proceeds expected to be received in 2024 related to Hurricane Ian and related to the Maui wildfire disruption. No further business interruption gains are expected. Also includes $32 million of insurance proceeds from Hurricane Ian received through May 1 2024 that result in a gain on property insurance settlement. No further property insurance gains have been included related to Hurricane Ian. We have collected $263 million out of a potential $310 million insurance recovery related to Hurricane Ian under our policy and we continue to work with our insurers to recover the remaining amount although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result.

For a discussion of items that may affect forecast results see the Notes to Financial Information.

Notes to Financial Information

FORECASTS

Our forecast of net income earnings per diluted share NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

COMPARABLE HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS AND RESULTS

To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics (i.e. Total RevPAR RevPAR average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues expenses hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large-scale capital projects in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.

The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.

Similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.

Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of March 31 2024 76 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of March 31 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

The Ritz-Carlton Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022 reopened in July 2023); and

Sales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.

Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California Alila Ventana Big Sur closed on March 30 2024 and has yet to reopen to guests. As a result the property will be removed from the comparable hotel set starting in the second quarter.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted) (ii) EBITDA (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.

NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense –In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and therefore we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.

EBITDA

Earnings before Interest Expense Income Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control) impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense – In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) interest expense (for EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally NAREIT FFO per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as measures of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.

Similarly EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.

Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and EBITDA (and the related margins) on a comparable hotel or ""same store"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses these non-cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses gains or losses on disposition certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons we believe comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management.

“We are excited to add the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown to our portfolio and establish a presence in one of the country’s most exciting cities"" Host Hotels & Resorts President and CEO James Risoleo said in a statement. ""The newly built property has a prime location in Nashville a top-performing market which had an impressive RevPAR CAGR of 7.7 percent from 2000 to 2023 even while absorbing new supply. A major leisure destination and the #2 ranked convention destination in the United States Nashville also has a recently expanded airport and a new stadium that is expected to attract more entertainment and sporting events. With meaningful in-place cash flow multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements we expect the Property will generate outsized growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders.”

The newly built LEED Silver property opened in 2022 and is located two blocks from numerous live music and entertainment venues in Nashville’s famed Lower Broadway entertainment district. The Property stands directly across from the Music City Convention Center adjacent to the Bridgestone arena home of the NHL Nashville Predators and within a 10-minute drive of Nissan Stadium the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum Vanderbilt University Tennessee State University and Centennial Park. The MCCC has continued to set record attendance numbers by attracting larger events and it has promising definite bookings in future years. The new Nissan Stadium home of the NFL Tennessee Titans is also expected to generate increased demand as the stadium’s dome will allow for year-round activation beginning with the 2027 season. In addition the Nashville International Airport is the fastest growing airport in the United States with current passenger traffic 33 percent above 2019. The recent $1.5 billion airport expansion added six international gates and eight satellite gates and another $1.5 billion expansion is already underway with completion expected in 2028.

The Property has a combined 721 oversized rooms that average approximately 500 square feet with a 75 percent suite mix. It offers seven separate food and beverage outlets including Harriet’s Rooftop which provides guests with exclusive views of Music City’s skyline in an elevated nightlife setting. Among other amenities the property has a Bamford Wellness spa with six treatment rooms two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space including a 9400 square foot ballroom and 9300 square feet of pre-function space.

Supply growth is expected to continue in Nashville with most projects in the planning stages and in the select service chain scale. Host believes the Property is differentiated from the future supply as a result of its central location and diversified product offerings that provide distinct value propositions to customers. The company expects the Property to stabilize between approximately 10-12x EBITDA3 in the 2026-2028 time frame."

Even outboard motor super-maven Mercury Marine is looking for more fuel-efficient methods of blowing your hat off when you pin the hand-throttle out on your local lake. So in the pursuit of sipping fuel at a rate less like cheap light beer and more like fine whiskey the 82-year-old manufacturer just launched itsfirst-ever V-12 outboard motor.

Wait … what?

Advertisement

Alright while we're joshing around a bit Mercury Marine does claim that strapping two of these 600-hp V-12s to the back of your craft will provide the same 1200 combined horsepower but cut down on fuel consumption by an impressive 20-percent when compared to a triple-stack of Yamaha V-8s. So not exactly a waterbound Toyota Prius Hybrid Synergy Drive but the dividends should become more apparent the larger the craft.

Whereas automotive V-12s have enjoyed a long lifespan at the hands of manufacturers such as Ferrari Lamborghini and Mercedes-Benz the new so-called Verado V-12 is the first outboard motor of its kind; previously sunburned and salt-stained power junkies were limited to a row of naturally aspirated or supercharged marine V-8s for their power fix and with the relatively recent shuttering of powersport purveyors Marine Seven a niche hole has opened up in the marine outboard market.

Until now. As mentioned above this 7.6-liter is good for a whopping 600 hp meaning two outboards can now do the job of three though why stop there? Arrange 'em in a trio for a total of 36 hard-charging cylinders. As you might expect packaging a V-12 lump is a bit of a nightmare and required some clever engineering from Mercury Marine to get it right. That V-12 block is mounted vertically—or straight up and down—with the power-end of the engine pointed straight down.

Traditionally watercraft with outboard motors steer by pivoting the entire engine and drive unit together but considering the size limitations of this new unit Mercury developed a proprietary system wherein the boat steers with just the lower part of its outdrive. So keen boat spotters hoping to see this new V-12 in the wild should keep an eye out for crafts that appear to turn regardless of their outboards. Kinda spooky.

Even the most modern automotive V-12s are somewhat logistical nightmares requiring aggressive service intervals and with more ""stuff"" happening under the front hood there's more stuff to go wrong. Mercury Marine anticipated this and worked hard to keep complexity and service costs as low as possible. Oil changes are on a 200-hour schedule and do not necessitate removing cowling or dry-docking. Cowling is removed for the major service but that's only on a 1000-hour or five-year schedule so that's reasonable. For those hoping for a commercial-grade mill the new SeaPro V-12 is detuned to 500 hp each with the potential for high operational hours between servicing.

Sure 600 hp isn't exactly headline-stealing in the marine world but the water-soaked Rat Finks should stay tuned for the inevitable Mercury Racing V-12 variant that is presumably good for over 700 hp apiece. That should prove a significant leap over most powerful outboard currently offered by Mercury Racing; the 4.6-liter supercharged V-8 450R wilts at the idea of future supercharged 7.6-liter V-12s.

All this power and trick engineering doesn't come cheap. If you're angling to fit your trawler with a set of Verados expect to pay just under $80000 per motor for the privilege.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3Bvd2VyZnVsLWRvZGdlLWNoYWxsZW5nZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Dodge Challengers Produce Ridiculous Amounts Of Power,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3Bvd2VyZnVsLWRvZGdlLWNoYWxsZW5nZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWxmdXR1cmVzLmNvbS9tZXJnZXJzLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9ucy90YS1hc3NvY2lhdGVzLXRvLWFjcXVpcmUtdmlydHVhbC1kZXNrdG9wLW9zLXByb3ZpZGVyLWlnZWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TA Associates to Acquire Virtual Desktop OS Provider IGEL,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.channelfutures.com/mergers-acquisitions/ta-associates-to-acquire-virtual-desktop-os-provider-igel on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWxmdXR1cmVzLmNvbS9tZXJnZXJzLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9ucy90YS1hc3NvY2lhdGVzLXRvLWFjcXVpcmUtdmlydHVhbC1kZXNrdG9wLW9zLXByb3ZpZGVyLWlnZWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbnppbnNpZGVyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzIwMjEtbWVyY2VkZXMtYW1nLXM2My1jb3VwZS1nZXRzLTkyNy1ocC1mcm9tLXBvc2FpZG9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Mercedes-AMG S63 Coupe Gets 927 HP From Posaidon,"The Mercedes-AMG S63 Coupe is one of the best that the three-pointed star marque has to offer. It comes from the German automaker’s flagship car lineup and boosted by the luxury brand’s performance division. For those who want to push the car to its limit though Posaidon has what it takes to anger the beast within it.

Don’t let its appearance fool you the car may look the same as when it came out from the AMG factory on the outside but within it is a major engine tune. With a €52000 ($63048) price tag in Germany one can upgrade the 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine of the car from its original 603 hp and 664 lb-ft of torque configuration into a whopping total of 927 hp and 944 lb-ft.

The ultimate stage of Posaidon’s tuning package is achieved by fitting the AMG S63 Coupe with new high-performance turbochargers. The turbos feature new ball bearings downpipes with sport catalytic converters a sport air filter cylinder head porting valve seat alternation and a water/methanol injection system with an optional tank. It also comes with engine and transmission software remapping.

The new setup allows the high-performance two-door S-Class to sprint from 0 to 62 mph in just 2.8 seconds. Meanwhile its top speed is limited to 217 mph to prevent the tires from wearing off quickly.

Is 927 HP Too Much?

If 927 hp is too much for you there’s Posaidon’s stage 1 kit that provides a subtle 690 hp and 701 lb-ft of torque to the car for €4200 ($5092) with a mere software upgrade. That’s good for a 0-62 mph run in 3.2 seconds and a max speed of 205 mph.

The €24000 ($29099) stage 2 tune squeezes 818 hp and 811 lb-ft of torque thanks to upgraded turbochargers. That takes the auto from 0 to 62 mph in 3 seconds.

The stage 3 package does not offer a new injection setup valve seat tinkering and cylinder head porting like the stage 4 but it improves the output of the vehicle to 868 hp and 885 lb-ft of torque. The boost gives it an acceleration time of 2.9 seconds from 0 to 62 mph. The top speed is the same as stage 4.

There’s More

Posaidon is working to further up the ante with the Mercedes-AMG S63 Coupe. The upcoming stage 5 kit is expected to give it over 1000 hp.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3doeS10aGlzLWd1eS1jb252ZXJ0ZWQtaGlzLTIzMDAtaHAtbmlzc2FuLWd0LXItdG8tcmVhci13aGVlbC1kcml2ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why This Guy Converted His 2300 hp Nissan GT-R To Rear-Wheel Drive,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3doeS10aGlzLWd1eS1jb252ZXJ0ZWQtaGlzLTIzMDAtaHAtbmlzc2FuLWd0LXItdG8tcmVhci13aGVlbC1kcml2ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Dix

For those interested in Kent history and the names of those who built the community the Kent Historical Society has published a handsomely designed brochure appropriately called “A Walking Tour of Standing Rock Cemetery.”

Funded with a contribution from Jack Amrhein a retired Roosevelt High School teacher who is the current historical society’s president and his wife Claudia Amrhein general manager of PARTA (the Portage Area Regional Transportation Association) the multi-color quadra-folded brochure identifies 77 gravesites and provides thumbnail sketches of who is buried in them. An effort to include women minorities and immigrants went into the selection of the 77.

Designed by Henry Halem a retired art professor at Kent State who is generous with his time and talents at the Kent Historical Society the guide’s information was authored by Roger Di Paolo the former editor of the Record-Courier whose Portage Pathways columns for years informed readers about their heritage.

Di Paolo’s commentary is excellent. It provides the reader a quick Cliff Notes education in Kent history. Assisting Di Paolo were Bob Springer and Mary Louise Ruehr several un-named volunteers and the Standing Rock Cemetery clerk and staff plus Jean Chrest and Roger Donell. Keeping everyone on task was Sandra Pearl Halem a published author and editor who volunteers at the Kent Historical Society and early on helped the society’s founders grow the fledgling organization.

Di Paolo’s commentary has been organized alphabetically. Readers simply find the name of the deceased they are interested in learning more about. A number is associated with the name. Using the number readers can locate that person’s gravesite on the back of the page in a four-color map of Standing Rock Cemetery.

Some names highlighted are obvious. The gravesite of Marvin Kent the man for whom the community is named because in 1867 he brought the Atlantic & Great Western Railroad to what was then called Franklin Mills is Gravesite No. 37. Kent also founded the Kent National Bank now part of Huntington Bank. His son William whose donation of 52 acres to the state of Ohio caused the Kent Normal School to be located in Kent lies at Gravesite No. 38. Eventually Kent Normal School became Kent State University.

Three Kent State University presidents rest in Standing Rock Cemetery: John McGilvery the visionary first president in Gravesite No. 45; George Bowman KSU’s longest serving president of 19 years at Gravesite No. 10; and Robert I. White at Gravesite No. 71. John Davey the founder of The Davey Tree Expert Co. lies at Gravesite No. 19 and his son Martin L. Davey who built the company into a nationwide enterprise served in Congress and became Ohio’s governor at Gravesite No. 20.

Samuel Bissler founder of S.C. Bissler & Sons Funeral Home a four-generation business lies in Gravesite No. 8. W.W. Reed an early Kent chamber leader who lobbied to bring the college to Kent and served as Kent postmaster is at Gravesite No. 54. Paul Yacavona who served on Kent City Council for a record 42 years lies at Gravesite No. 77. Mildred Stinaff a pioneer aviatrix who set world records for her exploits occupies Gravesite No. 63.

Others? Charles Williams the founder of Kent’s Williams Bros. Mill in 1879 lies in Gravesite No. 74; William Fageol co-founder of the Twin Coach Bus Company at Gravesite No. 23; and Thomas Tipler whose bakery and catering became popular area staples at Gravesite 67. Judge Robert Cook Kent State first alumnus in Congress and later a judge for 25 years rests at Gravesite No. 18. Jo Woodward Solem a member of the Russian Ballet troupe led by the great Nijinsky who then returned to Kent and helped her husband run a jewelry business is at Gravesite No. 61. Raymond Salituro founder of Ray’s Place a venerable Kent institution is at Gravesite No. 56 and Hale B. Thompson who with his father Robert founded Thompson’s Drug Store which continued for 125 years is at Gravesite No. 66. Joshua Brown Civil Rights leader and Council member rests at Gravesite No. 11.

Wikipedia says community cemeteries are relatively recent phenomena for both North America and Europe starting around 1830 with the growth of modern cities. Before that cemeteries were located behind churches and synagogues or on family plots. It says community cemeteries often served as America’s first urban parks beautifully landscaped grounds where city dwellers could escape the cacophony of city life. Standing Rock Cemetery’s street plan resembling a bi-section of a flower with arced lanes emanating from an honorary Veteran’s Circle has that kind of beauty. Well-tended trees and nearby Standing Rock the ancient Craig in the Cuyahoga River lend the Cemetery an appealing dimension of mystery.

The brochure explains Standing Rock Cemetery started as a five-acre venture and expanded to 45 acres. In 1963 St. Patrick Cemetery which lies alongside Standing Rock Cemetery became part of a jointly funded enterprise remaining as a consecrated burial site for Catholics. This spread costs more fairly among Kent and Franklin Township taxpayers. Breakneck Creek Cemetery on Rhodes Road was moved to a section of Standing Rock making way for the expansion of Kent State University.

“A Walking Tour of Standing Rock Cemetery is available free of charge at the Kent Historical Society McKay Bricker Framing and Sue Nelson Designs both in downtown Kent.

The home was built in 2012 and resembles an Old World aristocratic estate — albeit a somewhat garish take on one — with a marble- and limestone-lined double-height entryway and frescoes inspired by the Sistine Chapel.

The rooms are outfitted with decorations inspired by an 18th-century French country estate. Amenities include both indoor and outdoor pools a ballroom on the lower floors and a home theater.

It’s the second piece of real estate that appeared on “Schitt’s Creek” to hit the market in recent months. The real motel that stood in for the Rosebud Motel for the show’s six seasons went up for sale in October. The hotel has eight apartment-style units and one three-bedroom unit. It’s asking $2 million.

Toronto’s housing market has rebounded since the lowest points of the coronavirus pandemic. Local authorities expect the average sales price in the metro area will exceed $1 million for the first time this year.

With the benefit of CRISPR affordable human genome sequencing and advances in data science a handful of companies are positioning themselves to take advantage of this new advent of healthcare. We will explore what is genomics what companies are positioning themselves for this future and why it matters.

What is Genomics?

Genomics is the study of a person's genes (the genome) the field reviews the interactions of those genes with each other and with the person's environment. The genome is an organism's complete set of DNA which programs the individual with different physical traits. Virtually every single cell in the body contains a complete copy of the approximately 3 billion DNA base pairs or letters that make up the human genome. With the power of data science it is now possible to study how genes interact and in some cases edit genes in order to modify a single DNA letter or base in a gene.

Sequencing Human Genomes

There are multiple exponential technologies that have merged to enable the easy and cost-effective sequencing of the complete human genome. Sequencing the first human genome cost 2.7 Billion and took 13 years. Due to Moore's Law and other exponential technologies the cost has now been reduced to $1000 and is projected to be further reduced to $100.

This means we are entering an era where anyone can have their complete human genome sequenced in search of errors or predispositions to certain illnesses or health issues.

Multiple companies are clamoring for a marketplace where initially consumers will demand to have their genome sequenced and eventually medical professionals will demand it. This is driving the force behind many of the genomic companies in the marketplace the second driving force is the transformative power of CRISPR technology.

What is CRISPR?

To familiarize oneself with CRISPR one must first understand that there are multiple use cases for the terminology. In biology CRISPR refers to DNA sequences naturally found in the genomes of bacteria and other microorganisms. CRISPRs are the sequences of a crucial component of the immune system that protect bacteria from viruses. The CRISPR immune system defends itself from viral attack by destroying the genome of the invading virus. This is where CRISPR technology then enters the scene.

For popular usage and in how we will explain it “CRISPR” is shorthand for “CRISPR-Cas9.” CRISPR in combination with a protein called Cas9 (or “CRISPR-associated”) is an enzyme that acts like a pair of molecular scissors capable of cutting strands of DNA. While the idea of gene editing has been around since the 1950s CRISPR has enabled a cost-effective level of gene editing with a precision that has never before been available.

Companies that are Involved in Genomics

There are currently dozens of companies that are taking advantage of genomics we will review five of the leading companies that are publicly traded.

CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ: CRSP

What sets CRSPR Therapeutics apart is the all-star team of founders this includes Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier whose seminal research unveiled the key mechanisms of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology laying the foundation for the use of CRISPR-Cas9 as a versatile and precise gene-editing tool. Numerous awards have recognized her work including the Breakthrough Prize in Life Science.

CRISPR Therapeutics is developing an efficient and versatile CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing platform into therapies to treat hemoglobinopathies cancer diabetes and other diseases.

The first therapy that they are advancing is targeting the blood diseases β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease this has now entered clinical testing as has the first allogeneic CAR-T program targeting B-cell malignancies. While sickle cell is a disease with an arguable small market once the technology is mature they can advance to targeting other disease vectors.

Invitae Corporation (NASDAQ: NVTA

Invitae Corporation is primed to take advantage of the rapidly decreasing cost of sequencing a human genome. This is a genetic information company that specializes in providing information for genetic diagnostics preimplantation and carrier screening for inherited disorders miscarriage analysis and hereditary cancer. Basically any big data that can be provided from sequencing the human genome Invitae Corporation offers.

Recently Invitae Corporation partnered with ArcherDX to bring comprehensive cancer genetics and precision oncology to patients worldwide.

For anyone searching to take advantage of a company that is sequencing human genomes they are a market leader.

Pacific Biosciences of California Inc (NASDAQ: PACB

Pacific Biosciences of California Inc. is a biotechnology company founded in 2004 that develops and manufactures systems for gene sequencing and some novel real-time biological observation. They've developed a single molecule real-time (SMRT) Sequencing technology that delivers high consensus accuracy with unprecedented read lengths. This a new way to study the synthesis and regulation of DNA RNA and proteins by harnessing advances in biochemistry optics nanofabrication and more.

Some of the current applications they are working on include detecting epigenetic changes during sequencing to open the door to easier exploration of DNA modification to connect genotype with phenotype. This will enable understanding the effects of epigenetics on a broad range of biological processes including gene expression host-pathogen interactions environmental response DNA damage and DNA repair. Furthermore it will uncover the role of epigenetics in the inheritance of traits from one generation to the next.

Twist Biosciences Corp (NASDAQ: TWST

Twist Biosciences Corp manufactures synthetic DNA for clients in the biotechnology industry. They've designed a DNA synthesis platform to address the limitations of throughput scalability and cost inherent in legacy DNA synthesis methods. This allows them to achieve precision manufacturing of DNA at scale.

The high-throughput silicon platform enables Twist Biosciences to miniaturize the chemistry necessary for DNA synthesis. This miniaturization allows the company to reduce the reaction volumes by a factor of 1000000 while increasing throughput by a factor of 1000 enabling the synthesis of 9600 genes on a single silicon chip at full scale.

This is essentially an easy way for other companies to order DNA as needed.

Illumina Inc (NASDAQ: ILMN

Illumina Inc develops manufactures and markets integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and biological function. The company provides a line of products and services that serve the sequencing genotyping and gene expression and proteomics markets.

The technology is currently being used to assist with COVID-19 they enable companies working around the clock to track transmission conduct surveillance develop therapies and vaccines for any type of viral infection.

Some of their current offerings include access to fast high-quality sample-to-data next-generation sequencing (NGS) services such as RNA and whole-genome sequencing services.

Summary

While we have listed some of the primary companies that are taking advantage of low-cost human genome sequencing and gene editing there are many other companies that are promising. The healthcare industry is ripe for disruption; investors that strategically become shareholders in some of these market leaders will be best positioned for the advent of a new industry. Investors should ensure that they become familiar with genomics with a special emphasis on CRISPR.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As an embedded line we are now in the middle segment of the primary product lifecycle. One chip that we use quite often yet have not formally reviewed is the Intel Xeon D-2123IT. This 4 core/ 8 thread part is nowhere near the fastest and feature-packed CPU in Intel’s lineup but it is perhaps one of the more intriguing at less than half the cost of the next lowest price Xeon D-2100 launch part. In this review we are going to discuss why we use this particular SKU quite often.

Intel Xeon D-2123IT Overview

Key stats for the Intel Xeon D-2123IT: 4 cores / 8 threads with a 2.2GHz base clock and 3.0GHz turbo boost. There is 8MB of onboard cache. The CPU features a 60W TDP. These are $213 list price parts. Here is the Intel Ark page for your reference.

Here is what the lscpu output looks like for an Intel Xeon D-2123IT:

The CPU itself is part of the Intel Xeon D-2100 series family. We wanted to give a brief overview of what the SoC is comprised of for those that missed our more in-depth Intel Xeon D-2100 Architecture and Platform Overview.

Effectively the Intel Xeon D-2100 series platform uses Skylake Xeon cores and pairs them with the IP from Intel’s mainstream server PCH (Lewisburg) and creates a compact platform. We only get 4-channels of DDR4 memory not six as we found in the larger mainstream socketed first-generation Intel Xeon Scalable parts. The key here is that we get significantly more PCIe 3.0 than we have in the Xeon D-1500 series. We also get more SATA lanes via flexible high-speed I/O lanes as well as higher power consumption.

One will notice that the feature set closely mirrors something like an Intel C624 PCH for the non-QAT parts. When we say that the Intel Xeon D-2123IT uses Lewisburg PCH IP this is what one can see looking at an Intel Xeon D-2123IT’s hardware:

For those who are building embedded systems this is great since sharing IP means that this is not some niche embedded driver codebase. Instead this is going to largely align with what will be one of the longest-running server platforms. Purley with the Lewisburg chipset will be Intel’s flagship server platform between 2017 and 2021. There is a good chance you have used the Xeon D-2100 series as we showed in the Twin Lakes Intel Xeon D-2100 Platform Powering Facebook piece.

There are trade-offs being made for the D-2123IT. Specifically we do not get Intel QuickAssist Technology support. If that is a feature important to you then we suggest this is not the correct part.

As a quick and somewhat fun aside at the lower end of the market the Intel PCH found on most servers both takes up space and also has an associated cost. A PCH like what is comparable to what we have in the Xeon D-2123IT is around $75-100 list price which puts some context around the $213 chip’s value.

Next we are going to discuss the test configuration and performance before getting to our power consumption value analysis and final words.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9mYXN0ZXItc3Bpbi1vbi1pbnRlbHMtZmxhZ3NoaXAtY29tZXQtbGFrZS1jcHUtY291bGQtYXJyaXZlLXNvb24tdG8tcHJlc3N1cmUtYW1k0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Faster spin on Intel's flagship Comet Lake CPU could arrive soon to pressure AMD,"Intel could have a new top dog Comet Lake processor waiting in the wings namely a fresh variant of the flagship 10900K according to a new report.

Tom’s Hardware spotted a Core i9-10900KS processor mentioned in an Intel Software Advantage Program document listing qualifying CPUs for a Crysis Remastered game bundle.

The 10900KS is listed alongside the existing 10900K (vanilla unlocked model) and 10900KF (with no integrated graphics) versions of Intel’s top-tier Comet Lake chip suggesting that this is a new variant that might be launched soon. Remember that Rocket Lake is set to take off in March and if Intel does have a new spin on the 10900K it’ll very likely be coming out before the next-gen chips.

Prime CPUs

The theory is that this will be a special edition of the 10900K CPU a specially binned model – meaning Intel will select the choicest silicon for the chips – which means it can be pushed with slightly higher clocks much like the 9900KS before it (that offered an all-core 5GHz boost – it remains to be seen what avenue Intel might take with the 10900KS).

Of course just because it has popped up in a document doesn’t mean this processor is inbound – the listing could be some kind of a mistake (maybe Intel previously planned to deploy the CPU but has changed its mind since). A number of scenarios could apply here so we certainly can’t take anything for granted – but that said it’s definitely a possibility that there is a 10900KS on the horizon.

If it does eventually emerge the 10900KS will seemingly come bundled with a copy of Crysis Remastered as per the aforementioned Intel document.

Intel appears to be on a big counter-attack against Ryzen processors at the moment with Comet Lake prices being cut substantially at retailers and this could represent another offensive against AMD which is currently struggling with stock issues and supply of new Ryzen 5000 CPUs.

Humbled by successive manufacturing failures Intel has fallen further and further behind its rivals. Investors heaped scorn on the company last fall as its stock price sagged demanding a solution.

Intel promised an answer by the middle of January. Company leaders were contemplating a major retreat giving up on the advanced manufacturing that defined Intel and instead outsourcing the work to competitors in Asia.

Instead Intel made a shocking turn: ousting its CEO and bringing back Pat Gelsinger a veteran Oregon engineer who had left the company a dozen years earlier. And Gelsinger promptly indicated that he had no intension of backing down. Instead he pledged to reinvigorate the company’s engineering and manufacturing and restore Intel to the pole position.

It’s a bold gamble with little margin for error. If Intel stumbles again it risks falling irretrievably behind.

Gelsinger who turns 60 next month is a throwback a protégé of Intel’s legendarily ferocious former CEO Andy Grove. Direct and driven Gelsinger is also an evangelical Christian who believes “companies need to be there for a higher purpose.”

He joined Intel at age 18 and told employees last month that this is the job he always hoped for even back then.

“I wrote my mission statement to be CEO at Intel” he said. “It was a crazy aspiration now it’s coming real.”

To succeed though his homecoming has to be a great deal more than an exercise in nostalgia.

SKEPTICS ABOUND

Long one of Intel’s senior Oregon executives Gelsinger formally returns to Intel Monday after a dozen years in software. He’s spent the last decade as CEO of VMware a cloud computing company in Silicon Valley.

While VMware thrived during Gelsinger’s tenure – sales grew 134% over the eight years he ran the business – he benefited to some degree from running a cloud computing company at a time when that industry was soaring. He never faced anything like the challenge awaiting him back at Intel.

While he was away Intel suffered an unprecedented string of production failures in its Hillsboro research factories. Stubborn manufacturing defects delayed the rollout of three successive generations of new chips enabling rivals in Asia to leap ahead.

Intel’s sales remain solid but its outlook is tenuous. If the company cannot quickly regain the technological advantage Intel’s lapses could render it a perennial also-ran. The company could find itself making trailing-edge chips shedding market share and profits in a downward spiral.

Investors and analysts are pushing Intel to sell off its factories or outsource its manufacturing a strategic retreat to position the company to do battle with nimble competitors. Gelsinger though has made it clear he’s not coming back to dismantle the business.

“It’s my dream job to come back and participate with all of you in shaping the best company to the best days that it has in front of it yet” Gelsinger told employees last month.

Pat Gelsinger Education: Degrees from Lincoln Technical Institute Santa Clara University and Stanford Career: 30 years at Intel where he served as the company’s first CTO before joining VMware parent EMC in 2009. Named VMware’s CEO in 2012. Age: 59 Family: Married with four grown children

While Intel’s stock surged in the days after Intel announced Gelsinger’s return it plunged 9% the day after his first meeting with Wall Street analysts last month. He indicated that Intel is committed to its factories and to building its own leading-edge chips.

That sounded to some like Gelsinger will walk the same unfruitful path as his predecessor outgoing Intel CEO Bob Swan a finance executive who left the company less than three years after being promoted to the top job.

“Our first impression of Mr. Gelsinger’s commentary last night is that he intends to continue Bob Swan’s strategy but with more cowbell if you will” wrote Hans Mosesmann who follows Intel for Rosenblatt Securities.

“We have believed Intel will need more disruptive change in architectural roadmaps” Mosesmann wrote and to be more open to outsourcing its manufacturing.

The Intel that Gelsinger left back in 2009 was the unquestioned leader in semiconductor manufacturing. Subsequent lapses though delayed its 14-nanometer 10nm and its forthcoming 7nm chips – now due a year late in 2023.

Semiconductor production is increasingly difficult as the features on the chips shrink to the atomic level. What’s worrying though is that Intel didn’t seem to anticipate its factory troubles – and that its rivals don’t appear to be having the same problems.

Contract manufacturers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung now make chips generally acknowledged to be more advanced than Intel’s. And since they make chips for other companies that has given Intel competitors like AMD – long a technological laggard – access to more advanced production technology than Intel has.

Just as alarming longtime Intel customers may now be its competitors.

Apple has begun shifting its flagship line of Mac computers away from Intel processors to chips Apple has designed itself. The first Macs using Apple’s M1 chip handily outperformed equivalent models using Intel processors according to technology benchmarks.

“We have to deliver better products to the ecosystem than any possible thing that a lifestyle company in Cupertino” makes Gelsinger told Intel employees last month a dismissive but evidently lighthearted reference to Apple and its corporate offices.

Even more concerning is the possibility that Amazon Google Microsoft and other companies that run large data centers might go the same route with their high-powered servers. That could cost Intel one of its most lucrative and fastest growing markets.

“We have to do better and lean into those relationships” Gelsinger told employees. He was apparently suggesting Intel could do more to anticipate the needs of the big cloud computing companies and build those features into its chips.

‘FAIL OR SUCCEED QUICKLY’

Intel’s headquarters are in Silicon Valley and that’s where Gelsinger will work. He moved away from Oregon in 2012 but still has a home and an adult son living here.

Intel’s brain is in Oregon too where the company has 21000 employees – more than any other business. It spends billions of dollars a year equipping its Oregon factories one of the state’s primary economic engines.

Most advanced semiconductor companies specialize in either design computer chips or manufacturing them. Intel does both in Hillsboro maintaining that its integrated model enables it to act faster and more profitably than its rivals.

As Intel faltered over the past several years though contract manufacturers TSMC and Samsung raced ahead in production technology. And Intel began losing sales to rivals like AMD which doesn’t have its own factories and so uses that contractors (the chip industry calls them foundries) to make its chips.

After Intel announced setbacks with its 7nm chips last summer the company openly flirted with sending its advanced manufacturing to the Asian foundries in order to meet its goal of introducing the chips in 2023.

Some investors and many Wall Street analysts cheered the idea while others pushed to do more – advocating that Intel sell off its factories altogether.

Either option would significantly diminish Oregon’s role in Intel’s business. It would certainly reduce Intel’s scope but some analysts felt it the best choice among bad options given the successive production failures.

In his first days after announcing his return to Intel though Gelsinger rejected both ideas. Manufacturing is “the power and soul of the company” he told employees telling Wall Street analysts the following week that he is “confident that the majority of our 2023 products will be manufactured internally.”

Wall Street remains dubious – but it’s giving the new CEO a brief honeymoon period to show he can deliver. Intel’s stock has been erratic in the weeks since the company announced Gelsinger’s hiring but has rallied over the last several days and is now up 20% since last month’s announcement.

“While we remain somewhat pessimistic Gelsinger can restore Intel to manufacturing prominence we do believe it’s ultimately worth a try as the prize is so great” Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland told clients last month. “However our advice is to ‘fail or succeed quickly.’”

WHY NOW?

Growing up on a farm in Pennsylvania Dutch country Gelsinger became accustomed to sleeping just five hours a night. Friends say he has maintained that energetic pace his whole life.

An engineer at heart former colleagues describe Gelsinger as a demanding and passionate leader who skips fluidly from discussing chip architecture to business strategy economic policy and politics.

Intel’s top job was open in 2013 and again in 2018 and both times observers floated Gelsinger as a likely candidate. He acknowledged to The Oregonian/OregonLive in 2019 that he had discussed returning when the job was last open but said at the time he said he was happy running VMware.

It’s not clear what changed in 14 months but when Wall Street analysts pushed Gelsinger for an explanation last month he offered a couple clues.

It was “very exciting to see the unity of the board in calling me to the role” Gelsinger said. That could suggest Intel’s board wasn’t unanimous in its enthusiasm for hiring him last time around or that it couldn’t agree on a strategy for reviving the company.

Additionally Gelsinger noted that chip production has mostly moved offshore – Intel is the last company making leading-edge chips in the United States and if it had gone ahead with outsourcing its advanced manufacturing then that would be gone too.

“This company needs to be healthy for the technology industry for technology in America and to me it’s an opportunity to help and to unquestionably put Intel and the United States in a technology leadership position” Gelsinger told analysts.

Intel made the decision easier this time by offering Gelsinger a pay package it valued at $116 million. Gelsinger though says he gives away half of what he makes -- mostly to evangelical groups.

Intel says Gelsinger’s favorite charities include a number of Christian organizations including William Jessup University Stadia Missions of Hope International Mercy Ships and the Oregon-based Luis Palau Association run by Gelsinger’s longtime friend Kevin Palau.

Many Sunday mornings Gelsinger tweets an inspirational Bible passage.

Though Palau said he cannot speak for Gelsinger he said he expects the reason he’s returning to Intel is pretty straightforward: “He doesn’t need a prestige job or more money. He’s clearly not doing it for those reasons. I think he loves Intel.”

While serving as a senior Intel executive Gelsinger wrote a book on balancing faith family and his career. As VMware’s CEO Gelsinger routinely traveled to Christian schools and organizations to speak on his spirituality – and he helped launch Transforming the Bay with Christ an organization that sought to encourage collaboration among churches in and around San Francisco.

“His faith is not a ritual. It’s a genuine part of his life that I think makes him deal with pressure well” Palau said. He said Gelsinger’s spirituality grounds him enabling him to focus and not be overwhelmed by whatever complex issues confront him in his work or life.

Evangelical Christianity hasn’t always squared with Silicon Valley’s liberal ethos. Speaking to The Oregonian/OregonLive in 2019 Gelsinger acknowledged that he has “certain views of the family.”

In his book Gelsinger and his wife elaborated. While he describes advising “mutual submission” in a marriage when counseling other couples his wife Linda writes in an afterward that she has chosen a submissive role in their own relationship in keeping with Colossians 3:18.

“Pat is open to my suggestions and opinions but the final decision falls on him” she wrote. “The final responsibility also falls on him and I know that God will use those opportunities to make Pat the godly man he is supposed to be. And I can support him with a proper mind-set emotions and a joyful and submissive attitude.”

In 2019 though Gelsinger was emphatic that he does not impose his beliefs on others – about marriage faith or other topics.

“Diversity means valuing the diversity of opinion” he said and welcoming LGBQT employees atheists Muslims and Hindus.

Intel like the broader tech industry remains overwhelmingly male and disproportionately white and Asian. Speaking to Intel employees last month Gelsinger endorsed the company’s longstanding diversity goals and somewhat awkwardly professed support for recruiting more women to the company’s engineering team.

“I’m a deep believer in diversity and inclusion” he said especially “technical females.”

GETTING THE BAND BACK TOGETHER

Veteran Oregon chip architect Glenn Hinton had been retired from Intel for three years when the company brought him back last year to help out with a special project. The work was winding down in January but Intel was trying to lure him back full time.

Hinton hesitated saying later he was wary because he didn’t know the people running the company and was unsure about its direction. Then he woke up one morning to the news that Gelsinger was returning.

“When I found out that Pat was coming back then all the concerns that I had went away” Hinton said. He said he let out an unprompted whoop then called Intel the next day to accept the offer.

Hinton hadn’t talked to Gelsinger before making that decision but he said they’ve been in touch several times over the past few weeks.

“He just seems very excited and upbeat” Hinton said. “I think he realizes he’s got a big challenge ahead of him and he wants to do whatever he can to get Intel to be the best they can be.”

In recent years Intel sought to revitalize its engineering by recruiting new leaders from outside the company – Qualcomm AMD and elsewhere. None of those high-profile hires stuck a few were spectacular failures.

“Most executives don’t really understand computers very well. But Pat’s very bright” Hinton said. “Not only is he very good at leading an organization he actually understands the technical issues.”

Gelsinger who spent 30 years at Intel during his first stint and was its first chief technology officer appears to believe Intel’s future lies in its past. Even before formally starting work Monday he has been working the phones enlisting former Intel colleagues to join him on the comeback tour.

In addition to Hinton Intel announced that former Vice President Sunil Shenoy is returning to the company as head of its Oregon-based design engineering group.

“You’ll be seeing other announcements of key leaders coming back in” Gelsinger told Wall Street analysts last month. Gelsinger promised to rebuild Intel’s in the model of his mentor the late Intel CEO Andy Grove.

“I was trained at the feet of Grove and we will have the Grovian maniac execution transparent data driven culture and rebuilding that as part of this company” he said.

Friends describe Gelsinger as direct open and transparent. He doesn’t pull his punches they say but also doesn’t bring the harsh combative edge that defined Intel’s culture of “constructive confrontation” when Grove was running the business.

In his analyst remarks last month Gelsinger noted that Intel has stumbled in the past – notably when it was late to produce multicore processors that gave computers more horsepower. Intel’s engineers overcame those shortcomings and Gelsinger indicated that he is putting his faith in them again.

“Great companies are able to come back from periods of difficulty in challenge and they come back stronger better and more capable than ever” he said. “That I believe is the opportunity at Intel and I’m confident that this company has its best days in front of it.”

Although he was only officially appointed a month ago this isn’t the first time he has been offered the position. Since 2013 his name has come up as a leading candidate but Gelsinger had refused and preferred to stay on as CEO of VMware where he managed to double the company’s size. Now he’s getting a whole different Intel than in 2013 one that may not be as focused.

The chip making giant’s hazy future is the result of a decade of poor or undecisive business decisions. There is hardly a sector that the chip giant hasn’t tried entering: computer processors smartphone processors computer manufacturing (such as the NUC line of mini PCs) wearables drones autonomous cars (Mobileye) navigation (Moovit) sporting event photography cloud computing network cards modems graphics cards drivers and software memory chips cybersecurity artificial intelligence big data virtual reality and augmented reality. Intel has tried its luck in almost every field and that might be the root of the problem.

Incoming-Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger

It’s difficult to say when exactly Intel lost its way but the last CEO to lead the company with a relatively clear vision was Paul Otellini who left in 2013. His tenure was defined by structural changes that were designed to provide Intel with long term growth expand its server market segment and maintain its revenues during a worldwide recession. His other achievements included signing contracts with prominent customers such as Apple for operating its Mac computers with Intel chips partnerships and strategic acquisitions which expanded its presence in the fields of security software and mobile communications. Otellini was also responsible for one of Inetl’s biggest embarrassments one that it is still attempting to recover from today: missing out on the mobile market.

Otellini was replaced by Brian Krzanich then-chief operating officer. Krzanich’s period was probably one of the worst in the company’s history. It was complicated by a number of attempts to enter different fields that it hadn’t previously been active in such as drones or wearables which weren’t really related to the company’s core activity. In addition its disregard of the rising mobile market left the sector to its competitors at Qualcomm Samsung and Arm Ltd.

Krzanich was a hasty appointment. The board had stubbornly tried to convince external candidates like Gelsinger or Senjay Jha (former CEO of Motorola Mobility and COO of Qualcomm) to head the tech giant as Otellini’s resignation date approached. When all attempts failed Krzanich’s appointment was swiftly approved. Intel somewhat lost its way since Krzanich didn’t have a clear-cut vision or strategy. In hindsight Krzanich’s time at Intel was characterized by many attempts to fire in multiple directions out of fear that it would miss out on the next big thing just like it did with the mobile market.

One of the most prominent examples was Intel’s failure to enter the cybersecurity market. Krzanich inherited from his predecessor the company’s failure to fully implement cybersecurity company McAfee which it acquired in 2010. McAfee has now become a warning sign for Intel’s tendency to make large well-publicized acquisitions ($7.7 billion) and turn them into embarrassing failures. A decade ago the cybersecurity company was at a turning point in the industry when it created anti-virus software and a payroll protection that included digital infrastructure and smart products. But after Krzanich tried turning MacAfee into Intel security and incorporating it into Intel’s DNA Intel realized that cyber was a wholly separate business. Otellini acquired McAfee because he wanted the company to assist with the development of Intel’s internal processors but it turns out that wasn’t something McAfee knew how to do. After an infinite number of attempts to adapt McAfee to Intel’s corporate culture and strategy the company was sold to private-equity investors in 2016 and Intel was left with only a minority holding (49%). A few months ago it was reported that McAfee was considering going public again which would result in Intel further reducing its holdings.

Intel made an additional pricey gamble in the field of smart transportation. Intel’s main acquisition was of course Israeli Mobileye (for $15.3 billion in 2017). Mobileye is still believed to be one of its most promising companies but three years after the acquisition that promise has yet to be realized. While the rollout of autonomous cars continues to be postponed in the meantime Mobileye is content with producing chips for smart car manufacturers. Since its parts aren’t being purchased by Tesla - the leading company in the sector - it isn’t clear when if at all it will return its investments.

It seems that its acquisition of Habana Labs was actually a good gamble for Intel. The company develops artificial intelligence chips that are used for machine learning computing. Intel offers them as competition to Nvidia’s products.

Gelsinger’s vision for Intel hasn’t yet been fully revealed but some core parts that were made known such as the focus on chip manufacturing control chips cloud computing and data centers which generate significant revenue for Intel. Gelsinger’s advantage over outgoing-CEO Bob Swan is that he is a tech guy an engineer but also a person who led another tech company VMware to become an industry leader.

“He’s a tech whiz” said Mooly (Shmuel) Eden the former President of Intel-Israel and a former senior vice president at Intel Corp. who left the company in 2015. “Andy Grove (one of Intel’s founders and CEOs) discovered him and mentored him he knows Intel’s hardware and technology first hand and after his time at VMware he’s also familiar with the world of software.” The fact that Gelsinger is acquainted with both worlds - namely the needs of both hardware and software customers - is a relatively rare combination in the tech world where most industry executives either focus on one side or the other. Very few have managed to successfully transition between them aside from Steve Jobs who knew how to ensure that the combination of software and hardware in Apple products fit his vision.

Most likely his vision will become clear soon but probably won’t be fundamentally different from what has led Intel toward its success so far namely controlling its development and production in the field of computing. It will be interesting to see which operational strategy he chooses to return Intel to its natural spot. “During a period when the tech industry is undergoing tectonic changes including Intel as a multinational company that lost some of its market share I think that if there’s someone capable of switching directions it’s Pat and I’m not someone who easily dishes out compliments” Eden said echoing many similar sentiments over the past month by former and current company employees journalists and analysts since it was made known that Gelsinger would be taking the helm as CEO.

That said Gelsinger is considered a very tough figure in the industry with high demands from his subordinates. “He isn’t a simple person and he knows how to make demands” said Eden. “He knows a lot of people in Israel. But I don’t want Intel Corp. to only be friendly with Intel-Israel because of his warm relations with people here. It should be because Israeli-made products are excellent.” Eden also believes that Gelsinger won’t hesitate to get rid of divisions that don’t yield high performance “he might even sell them to fund new acquisitions that the company will need to make.”

Another factor on the agenda is the demand by some of Intel’s investors that the company split its operational and manufacturing activities. However Eden estimates that isn’t something that will happen in the near future. “I don’t think that Intel is losing money on its manufacturing operations” he explained but believes that the company may consider such a move depending on whether it succeeds in leading the manufacturing industry or not. Extending production to external customers is also possible he said since “it’s been done in the past.”

If

“He’s the right person at the right time but I don’t think it’s relevant now if it becomes relevant then I’ll consider it. He’ll bring along some of his people. I didn’t hold back and sent Pat my blessing he isn’t someone who’s in it for the money and didn't come to Intel to be rich but rather because he believes he's part of the company’s heritage.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMizgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9JbnRlbC1Db3JlLWk5LTExOTAwVC1wb3BzLXVwLW9uLUdlZWtiZW5jaC13aXRoLVVIRC1HcmFwaGljcy03NTAtUG93ZXItb3B0aW1pemVkLVJvY2tldC1MYWtlLWNoaXAtaGl0cy00LTg5LUdIei1hbmQtZmxvb3JzLXRoZS1pOS0xMDkwMFQtaW4tc2luZ2xlLWNvcmUtcGVyZm9ybWFuY2UuNTIwMDQxLjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Core i9-11900T pops up on Geekbench with UHD Graphics 750: Power-optimized Rocket Lake chip hits 4.89 GHz ...,"A low-power Intel Core i9-11900T chip from the Rocket Lake family has appeared on Geekbench. The i9-11900T which has an iGPU in the form of the UHD Graphics 750 recorded a clock rate of 4.89 GHz and produced an outstanding single-core score that was +26% over the Comet Lake i9-10900T.

Another Rocket Lake processor from Intel has been spotted on Geekbench by noted data-miner APISAK. The record reveals the i9-11900T with the T-series units from Intel featuring lower TDPs but with a supposed minimum performance reduction when compared to non-T SKUs. This fearsome chip sped along at a maximum clock rate of 4.89 GHz (base: 1.51 GHz) with the help of an Asus ROG Maximus XIII Hero motherboard. Compared to the previous-generation i9-10900T the clock range seems greater with the older chip going from 1.9 GHz to 4.6 GHz (single core using Turbo Boost Max 3.0).

Although the i9-10900T is a 10-core 20-thread processor the 8-core 16-thread Intel Core i9-11900T keeps up very well with its predecessor in the multi-core discipline. With a score of 8349 points there are only a handful of examples of the Comet Lake chip that surpass that result on Geekbench (71 samples at the time of writing). But the single-core result is where the news is at with the Rocket Lake chip coming up with 1717 points. This blasts anything recorded on the benchmark by the i9-10900T right out of the water. The highest score listed is 1357 points which leaves the i9-11900T over +26.5% ahead.

The Intel Core i9-11900T’s UHD Graphics 750 iGPU was also tested on Geekbench churning out an OpenCL score of 7761 points and revealing its 32 compute units and maximum frequency of 1.3 GHz. In comparison the i9-10900T’s UHD Graphics 630 has 24 execution units and a boost rate of 1.05-1.25 GHz. The UHD 750’s score puts it over 52.5% ahead of the UHD 630’s average of 5088 points. With an expected TDP of around 35 W the Intel Core i9-11900T sample has given a demonstration of Rocket Lake’s generational improvements especially in single-core processing and hopefully at a reasonable power cost.

Source: Coupang documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 12

Coupang Corp. 37% owned by SoftBank Group is set to become the first Korean company to list directly on the New York Stock Exchange with its valuation estimated to have soared 10 times since SoftBank's first investment in the South Korean e-commerce giant in 2015.The online retailer filed its IPO application to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 12. The prospective IPO which is expected to value Coupang at around $50 billion would mark the largest listing for a non-US company since the Chinese retailer Alibaba Group’s 2014 debut.Coupang did not disclose the number of shares it is offering in the IPO nor its price range.Initially Coupang had opted to list on the Nasdaq and received preliminary approval for the Nasdaq listing last month . The company expected an overseas listing to give it a higher valuation than the domestic bourse which has no listed e-commerce-focused company.On the New York Stock Exchange where global e-commerce giants such as Amazon.com and Alibaba are traded Coupang stands to benefit from the red-hot IPO market. Its offering could take place as soon as March according to the Wall Street Journal.Coupang founded in 2010 has been pushing for its 2021 IPO to take full advantage of the surge in sales last year as one of the main beneficiaries of the online shopping boom in the prolonged pandemic era.It is the only Korean e-commerce firm that offers nationwide same-day delivery based on its direct delivery system and logistics centers built across the country. In 2020 its sales leapt by 91% to $12 billion won from a year earlier; while its operating loss narrowed to $475 million versus the previous year’s $699 million according to its IPO filing.Back in 2015 SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son invested $1 billion in Coupang valuing the company at $5 billion. In 2018 SoftBank Vision Fund invested $2 billion in the Korean company valuing it at $9 billion. Earlier this year Coupang was valued at $30 billion according to analysts.Founder and Chief Executive Kim Bom-suk will be able to exercise 29 votes per share unlike other shareholders entitled to one vote per share. That means Kim will continue to hold management rights over Coupang despite details about his ownership not being disclosed.Despite double-digit revenue growth the company has remained in shortfall territory which its senior officials called “intended losses"" as its operating profit margin improved. Its accumulated losses reached $4.12 billion as of the end of last year.The number of its active users or those who have purchased something through Coupang came to 14.8 million as of the end of 2020 up 26% year on year with paid subscribers for quicker delivery service accounting for 32%.Revenue per person soared by 59% to 283000 won ($256) on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter of last year.

Coupang’s accumulated algorithm for fast delivery is seen as the most attractive factor in luring investors. It offers dawn and same-day delivery services dubbed Rocket delivery for items ranging from fresh groceries to school supplies. It also expanded into the food delivery market with the Coupang Eats brand.



The IPO is expected to provide another boost to Coupang keen to ramp up last-mile delivery infrastructure and technology.



Last year Coupang announced a plan to build seven fulfillment centers outside of the Seoul metropolitan area for a combined $870 million. It recently hired Tuan Pham the former chief technology officer at US-based ride-hailing platform Uber as its new CTO.

Analysts say the company may mark a turnaround this year with an estimated revenue of 15 trillion won and an operating profit of 300 billion won.Further the company is expected to diversify into various e-commerce services following in the footsteps of Amazom in an aim to get customers asking: “How did I ever live without Coupang?”In December 2020 Coupang said it was launching a subscription-based video streaming service Coupang Play  in a bid to broaden its services from parcel and food delivery digital payments and online shopping to original video content services.Meanwhile CEO Kim recently announced a plan to give out around 100 billion won worth of shares in the company to its frontline employees including delivery workers and logistics center employees on the occasion of the US listing.Goldman Sachs is the lead manager of the IPO.Dong-Hui Park at donghuip@hankyung.com Yeonhee Kim edited this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9tYXJrZXRzLzIwMjEvMDIvMTQvc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LW9wZW4tcHJlc2lkZW50cy1kYXktMjAyMS82NzQ2NDA1MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. financial markets closed for Presidents Day,"U.S. financial markets are closed on Monday in observance of Presidents Day.

Keith Gill the day-trading member of the Reddit group Wall Street Bets who is widely credited with igniting the recent GameStop trading frenzy claimed in late January that he had turned his $54000 investment into a $48 million fortune.

Days later it had been sliced by more than half to $22 million and regulators had set their sights on Gill investigating him over potential disclosure violations.

While Gill still appears to have made a fortune many of the retail investors who joined the frenzy late probably lost money. GameStop's stock which peaked at more than $480 a share had dropped to about $52 as of Friday.

Before the roller coaster went off the rails however one hedge fund walked away with a $700 million profit the brokerage app Robinhood raised billions in new financing after being forced to restrict its users from buying certain stocks and the trading giant Citadel Securities most likely made a hefty sum from the increased market volatility.

While the dust has far from settled and some Wall Street firms did lose big a David-versus-Goliath victory now hardly seems like the most likely outcome.

It had made for a compelling narrative too: An army of retail investors — without deep pockets sophisticated trading algorithms proprietary market data or other tools of the trade — banding together to beat powerful financial institutions at their own game.

Ultimately though Wall Street and other big-money investors still appear to have ended up on top and experts at least those outside the industry say it's that outcome that further proves how the system is rigged.

Insider spoke with three experts on financial markets — none of whom work at traditional financial-services firms. They said there's a lot of work to be done to make the markets work for small investors and perhaps just as important to restore the public that the markets can do just that.

'Geared to favor the big'

""The whole business is basically a power dynamic"" Garphil Julien a research associate with the anti-monopoly think tank Open Markets Institute told Insider.

""It's geared to favor the big over the small"" he added. ""Those with enormous amounts of capital enormous amounts of money will use their power to basically get what they want and when they get what they want someone else is going to lose.""

He's not alone in that assessment.

A December poll by CNBC found that 57% of Americans viewed the stock market as a reflection of the way only corporations and the wealthy were doing not the rest of the country. Those views were shared by wealthier respondents as well as Republican ones both historic defenders of the free markets.

""Is the market really fair for individual investors? Is it really competitive? What we're seeing is that it's not"" Julien said.

As the former Wall Street analyst Alexis Goldstein recently put it in an op-ed article for The New York Times: ""Wall Street's edge over retail traders remains as always structural"" and even if a bunch of Redditors band together ""the house still wins."" But she argued ""rather than gambling on the dubious promise of more Americans gaining access to the casino it's time to rewrite the rules to ensure that the house doesn't always win.""

Julien said that meant adding more consumer protections as well as cracking down on the monopolization of various segments of the financial-services industry. For example he pointed to brokerage apps like the Morgan Stanley-owned E-Trade and TD Ameritrade which is owned by Charles Schwab.

Making money by 'making money'

The markets ultimately proved fairly resilient amid last month's trading frenzy but that doesn't mean they're working in ways that protect smaller investors who have more to lose.

""There will be a temptation to say ... the market isn't broken everything's fine"" Barbara Roper the director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America told Insider. ""While it's true that the market isn't broken — yet — I don't think it follows that everything is fine.""

Roper said that it's good to focus on improving transparency and accountability around practices that might involve conflicts of interest — such as payment for order flow over which Robinhood and Citadel Securities are facing scrutiny — but that the issue is also far more fundamental and widespread.

""The financial-services industry itself has sort of divorced itself from the more boring and less profitable job of helping to steer capital toward its best uses in support of the productive economy and has for some time now made most of its money making money"" Roper said.

Advertisement

""Financial firms make all of their money off of securitizing everything under the sun"" she said. ""They found a way that it's really profitable and so they're pursuing the profits even though the niche is overfilled.""

But that problem ""was at the heart of the last financial crisis and we didn't solve it there"" Roper said referring to the 2008 financial crisis.

There have been multiple near-crises since then and the problems have only gotten worse.

Robinhood itself has been criticized — and fined $65 million by the Securities and Exchange Commission — over high-frequency trading a controversial practice that uses technology to execute large trades in fractions of a second allowing firms to make money off momentary changes in the price of stocks. Wall Street banks are even evading regulations around derivatives trading — the same risky behavior that precipitated the 2008 crisis — according to the financial blog Wall Street On Parade.

Roper said she didn't see dangerous Wall Street business models being addressed anytime soon either.

""If we didn't do it when Wall Street literally brought the global economy to the brink of collapse I don't think we're going to do it now because some people on Reddit put on a short squeeze and caused some chaos in the markets for a few weeks"" she said. ""I guess I'm as cynical as the people on Wall Street Bets.""

'Broader public outrage'

Part of Americans' frustration with the current financial system is that it has become so complex that only Wall Street insiders really seem to know how everything works something the industry uses to its advantage in situations like that with GameStop.

""It's another episode similar to those past ones of the public feeling like there are multiple things wrong here — not really knowing what is exactly wrong but just feeling like something is not working"" Graham Steele a senior fellow at the American Economic Liberties Project told Insider.

Advertisement

""It's just a general popular sense that a system wherein this kind of scenario can come to pass just fundamentally doesn't work for the public and it is 'rigged' or something else but they know something is wrong.""

Steele also said widening inequality pandemic-response failures and polarization around the election amplified the GameStop fury: ""It feels like you're layering a new financial episode on top of other broader public outrage.""

That's also apparent in the voices from across the political spectrum that have criticized Wall Street in recent weeks: progressive Democrats such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Elizabeth Warren; far-right Republicans such as Sen. Ted Cruz; and tech investors such as Elon Musk and Mark Cuban.

But that's where their agreement ends with Democrats typically favoring government intervention and Republicans typically pushing for more transparency and then letting the markets figure out the rest.

Advertisement

""In terms of the Silicon Valley folks"" Steele said they're ""painting themselves as kind of populists but a lot of them have their own sort of financial interests at stake here. A lot of their solutions are like don't use that app use the app that I invested in.""

""I just don't see Elizabeth Warren going out there pumping someone else's trading app because a venture capitalist has said 'That's the right thing to do'"" he added.

Musk for example has spent the past few weeks hyping up cryptocurrencies such as dogecoin.

Ultimately all three experts agreed that making the markets more equitable and aligned with the health of the broader economy will require reforms stretching far beyond the financial services industry.

""Fixing that system requires a whole host of policy solutions that run the gamut from financial regulation to tax policy to how we structure the retirement system to how we deliver healthcare to people"" Steele said.

E-commerce giant to go public as early as March



By Anna J. Park



Coupang one of the largest and fastest-growing e-commerce tech giants headquartered in Korea could make its initial public offering (IPO) debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as early as March. The e-commerce company officially kicked off its efforts to achieve the NYSE listing late last week submitting its S-01 form required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Friday.



Once the S-1 filing is completed the IPO process could usually be wrapped up in three or four weeks. Given the timeline Coupang's Class A common stocks will begin to be publicly traded under the ticker symbol of ""CPNG"" as early as March.



The IPO is receiving much media attention as it's expected to be the largest public offering in U.S. stock markets from a foreign company since Alibaba's 2014 IPO debut. Coupang stepped up to be Korea's largest online retailer in 2020 as its revenue has increased four times during the past two years.



According to the firm's S-1 filing Coupang's Q4 revenue in 2020 stood at $3.8 billion quadruple the $900 million logged in Q1 in 2018. The online retailer platform's exponential growth is easily seen in its annual revenue growth as well. The firm's annual revenue last year recorded $11.9 billion which is almost double its annual revenue of 2019. Meanwhile the firm's annual net losses also decreased swiftly to $474 million at the end of 2020 from $1.09 billion in 2018.



Based on the solid growth rate the company's valuation is expected to exceed $50 billion. Some even forecast the corporate value could reach up to $100 billion as Alibaba garnered a valuation of $168 billion in its IPO back in 2014.



Listing at NYSE not Nasdaq



What was unexpected was that the e-commerce tech company chose the NYSE not the Nasdaq market for the firm's first listing. As the firm's Harvard-educated founder Kim Bom has been expressing his aspirations to list the firm on the Nasdaq market since 2011 many believed the firm would take that route.



Then why would the online retailer chose NYSE over Nasdaq?



Market watchers say the move shows Coupang's confidence in its future. Not only does the NYSE have a higher fee and more requirements for its listed firms than the Nasdaq the stock market could also delist firms for various reasons. Despite the higher barriers Coupang's decision to list itself on the stabler and bigger NYSE reflects the Seoul-based firm's long-term confidence in its profitability. Some market watchers forecast that the firm will also pursue a Nasdaq listing.



Coupang was founded by Kim in 2010 and has attracted massive investments from various venture capital funds including Altos Venture Sequoia Capital and SoftBank's $3 billion investments in 2015 and 2018. The invested money has mostly been spent on its signature Rocket Delivery ― promising to deliver goods on the same day the product was ordered or by dawn the following day ― as well as establishing infrastructure in logistics and delivery services.

by Emmy M. Cho and Dohyun Kim

Members of Harvard Law School’s Cyberlaw Clinic and International Human Rights Clinic teamed up to publish a study on the impacts of internet restrictions in Myanmar and Banglades on both societies. By Jonathan G. Yuan

Researchers at Harvard Law School’s Cyberlaw Clinic and International Human Rights Clinic collaborated with three human rights organizations based in Myanmar to produce a study on internet restrictions in Myanmar and Bangladesh according to a white paper the groups published last month.

The report highlights similarities in the impacts of internet shutdowns in both countries — including limited access to education and Covid-19 guidance. It also determined differences in how a lack of internet access influences work access to healthcare and physical security in both nations.

“What is unique about this report is that it looks at both sides of the border — it looks at Myanmar and Bangladesh” said Cyberlaw Clinic assistant director Jessica Fjeld who led the drafting of the report along with International Human Rights Clinic lecturer Yee Htun.

“We were able to report on the impacts of internet shutdowns in the voices of the people who were impacted by them” Fjeld added.

The paper is structured around 16 interviews with refugees in Bangladesh and internally displaced persons throughout Myanmar and was conducted by the partner organizations Athan Kintha Peace and Development Initiative and the Rohingya Youth Association.

The report was published just before a military coup and declaration of a state of emergency in Myanmar — events touched off by the National League for Democracy’s general election victory in November 2020. The opposition in the election claimed fraud and demanded a rerun of the vote.

Aung San Suu Kyi — the National League for Democracy’s founder and Nobel Peace Prize laureate — and various members of the Myanmar parliament are believed to be under house arrest a controversial move that has sparked international outcry.

The ongoing shutdowns in townships across Myanmar have lasted over a year while shutdowns in refugee camps in Bangladesh lasted for 11 months. While 2G cellular connectivity was temporarily restored following international pressure 2G generally does not permit online access to video calls emails photos videos or social media.

The lack of internet connectivity impedes populations across Myanmar and Bangladesh from accessing the “basic needs of life” such as education work healthcare free expression and access to reliable information according to the paper.

“For displaced people and those in conflict situations the internet can function as a literal lifeline and for this vulnerable population it is a lifeline that has all too often been cut off” the paper reads.

The paper studies how internet shutdowns dovetailed with the coronavirus pandemic to undermine people’s access to vital healthcare information.

The internet also importantly provides people in Myanmar and Bangladesh access to education more broadly per Fjeld.

“The Rohingya were prohibited from secondary education — they were only educated up to primary school in Myanmar and then denied access to public schools after that — so many of them are studying English or other subjects through courses online and they lost access to those courses when they lost access to the internet” Fjeld said.

“The Internet is our university” one of the interviewees cited in the report said.

Fjeld said she thinks the report will be “more relevant than ever” in light of the military coup in Myanmar.

“I think internet shutdowns are going to be a piece of the authoritarian strategy that they are employing” Fjeld said. “And so the report and the impacts that the report identifies will be more relevant than ever.”

Though temporary internet usage could allow for greater access to news jobs and communication with friends and family Fjeld said it may not be enough to guarantee freedom of expression given the aggressive acts imposed by the govenment to silence its critics.

The researchers concluded the paper by calling on the governments of Myanmar and Bangladesh to reinstate internet connectivity for their respective populations.

“It is within the power of the Myanmar government to ease the devastating impacts on the affected population restoring protections for their rights by lifting the shutdown order and the Bangladesh government must continue to guarantee network access” the paper reads. “If the internet is not available these vulnerable communities’ lives and suffering will persist in a perpetual state of lockdown and shutdown.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvZmViLzE0L3BpbmUtYmx1ZmYtcmlzaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OPINION | REX NELSON: Pine Bluff rising | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"It was a natural spot for a town to thrive this place called Pine Bluff. The Arkansas River provided a transportation route connecting the interior of the state to the Mississippi River and thus to cities such as New Orleans and St. Louis.

On one side of the city were vast pine forests that could fuel a lucrative timber industry.

On the other side were lowlands filled with bottomland hardwoods. Those hardwoods were harvested the land was drained and the rich soil proved ideal for growing cotton.

""In the autumn of 1819 Joseph Bonne making his way upstream from Arkansas Post built a crude cabin for his Quapaw wife and family on a high bluff covered with pine trees on the river's south bank"" Russell Bearden wrote for the Central Arkansas Library System's Encyclopedia of Arkansas. ""A few years later James Scull also from Arkansas Post arrived and set up an encampment on the north bank across from the future site of Pine Bluff. The encampment soon became a tavern and small inn.

""On March 3 1819 President James Monroe named Robert Crittenden territorial secretary. Crittenden quickly set about exploiting the remaining Quapaw in southeast Arkansas to relinquish their last tracts of land.""

With the Quapaw gone and steamboats beginning to ply the Arkansas River the area began attracting settlers such as French-born Antoine Barraque for whom a downtown Pine Bluff street is named. Jefferson County was established in 1829 and Pine Bluff became the county seat in 1832.

The railroad arrived in the 1880s connecting Pine Bluff to Little Rock. The town grew from 460 residents in 1850 to 9952 in 1890 making it the third-largest city in the state. The Cotton Belt located its main engine maintenance shops at Pine Bluff in 1894. The railroad was the largest industrial employer in the county until the Pine Bluff Arsenal was built during World War II.

Between the railroad operations cotton industry timber industry and arsenal (the arsenal alone employed almost 10000 people during World War II) Pine Bluff boomed. The population almost tripled from 21290 in 1940 to 57389 in 1970.

International Paper Co. decided to locate a paper mill at Pine Bluff in 1957. By 1962 that mill employed 1400 people.

Of the Pine Bluff Arsenal Bearden wrote: ""Construction costs were estimated at about $60 million. At the height of the war the plant expanded from making magnesium and thermite incendiary munitions to a chemical warfare manufacturing facility as well producing lethal gases and chemical compounds installed in artillery shells and specifically designed bombs. Fifteen civilian workers died in work-related accidents. The facility grew with its expanded mission.

""More than 900 buildings and production facilities consumed 3.3 million square feet of space 43 miles of roads and 14 miles of track for diesel-electric locomotives pulling boxcars and flat cars of munitions. In February 1942 the arsenal also became one of the nation's storage depots for its expanding chemical stockpile munitions. These binary projectiles (lethal agents mixed after discharge of the projectile) were isolated in igloos near the northwest section of the facility.""

President Richard Nixon banned the production and use of biological weapons in 1969. Part of the complex was renamed the National Center for Toxicological Research and became a branch of the federal Food & Drug Administration. On-site incineration of toxic nerve agents began in 2005 and was completed in 2010. The arsenal's mission changed to making smoke incendiary and pyrotechnic devices.

Despite a consistent decline in population in recent decades (the city has lost about 15000 residents since 1970) Pine Bluff continues to have a relatively strong manufacturing base due to companies such as Evergreen Packaging (in the former IP facility) and Tyson Foods.

In December Highland Pellets announced a strategic alliance with Orion Energy Partners to fund an expansion and upgrade of its Pine Bluff plant. Orion will provide a $163 million capital investment. Highland Pellets supplies wood pellets for export. The fuel is used for renewable energy production at converted coal power plants. Wood used at the Pine Bluff facility often comes from trees that were thinned from crowded forests or from leftover sawmill materials.

In November Good Day Farm Arkansas a medical marijuana cultivator received approval from the state to purchase Natural State Wellness Enterprises of Newport and move the operation to Pine Bluff. The company is constructing a 42000-square-foot growth area. The Pine Bluff facility will employ 200 people with an annual payroll of $9.4 million. Pine Bluff Mayor Shirley Washington said the company's initial investment is $25 million for retrofitting a building in the Jefferson County Industrial Park.

At the arsenal meanwhile ReadyOne Industries began production in August and plans to hire 120 people. The company produces military clothing. A large portion of its workforce consists of disabled employees.

In the story I wrote for the front page of today's section I outlined the beginnings of the Go Forward Pine Bluff initiative in 2015. What no one could have foreseen at the time was that Arkansas voters in November 2018 would approve a constitutional amendment allowing the construction of casinos at Pine Bluff and Russellville along with the expansion of existing gaming operations in Hot Springs and West Memphis. It marked the return of the Quapaw to Pine Bluff.

The main casino at the Quapaw Nation's Saracen Casino Resort opened in October of last year. A nearby annex had opened in October 2019.

""When the project was proposed many people that we have a lot of respect for said it was not going to work in Pine Bluff"" said Saracen's Carlton Saffa. ""And they're eating crow right now. This has been a success. We have proven the naysayers wrong.""

A story last month in the Pine Bluff Commercial noted that the annex in its early days saw ""people standing in line to get to a slot machine. But the grown-up casino with slots and table games and restaurants--the one that will eventually be attached to a multistory hotel--opened amid a pandemic that has kept numbers and expectations down.""

Still Saffa said the casino has made money. There already are more than 800 people employed. That number is expected to grow to 1000 once the hotel and conference center are constructed.

""We don't have all of the amenities yet"" Saffa said. ""And we're still building our brand. So our numbers are something that I'm extremely proud of.""

In addition to providing 1000 jobs one thing the Quapaw Nation's business will do is change the perception of Pine Bluff. With a hotel and conference center state associations will add Pine Bluff to the rotation for annual meetings.

Saracen is already putting a focus on food and beverage offerings hiring Todd Gold away from his job as dean of the Culinary Arts and Hospitality Management Institute in Little Rock. The Quapaw Nation developed its own cattle herd buffalo herd meat-processing facilities coffee roastery and produce farms for its Downstream Casino in northeastern Oklahoma. Those products are now offered in Pine Bluff.

""Food is driving this just as much as gaming and I can think of no better example than hiring Todd Gold from the culinary school"" Saffa said. ""If we have the best restaurant in Pine Bluff we've failed. If we have the best restaurant in southeast Arkansas we've failed. We need to have the best restaurant in the region.""

Gold said he has hired staff with the goal of making Pine Bluff a culinary and hospitality destination. The flagship Red Oak Steakhouse features dry-aged beef displayed in glass aging racks and a wine case with more than 140 varieties.

""Our aim is for Red Oak Steakhouse to be the best restaurant in the state"" Saffa said.

Mark Ramseyer’s controversial paper claiming sex slaves in Imperial Japan known as “comfort women” were voluntarily employed the journal told The Crimson Friday.

The journal initially issued an “Expression of Concern” earlier this week in response to mounting backlash announcing that concerns over the article’s “historical evidence” are currently under investigation.

“Comfort women” is a term used to refer to women and girls from Japan’s occupied territories including Korea who were forced into sex slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army before and during World War II.

Against the historical consensus Ramseyer claims in his paper entitled “Contracting for Sex in the Pacific War"" that comfort women were not coerced and instead voluntarily entered into contracts with Japanese brothels. His article stoked public outcry across South Korea after his abstract was re-printed in late January in the nationalist Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun.

Since students and scholars at Harvard and beyond criticized his paper as lacking historical context and evidence.

Multiple individuals and groups have penned open letters and petitions totalling at least 10000 signatures demanding various responses from the journal Ramseyer and Harvard. Some argued the article should be withdrawn from publication while others advocated disciplinary action against Ramseyer.

Andrew Davis vice president of communications for Elsevier the journal’s publisher wrote to The Crimson Friday that the print issue slated to include Ramseyer’s article is being “temporarily held.” Writing on behalf of the journal’s editors Davis also confirmed the journal still plans to print the article.

“Although not printed it is already assigned to the March issue (Volume 65) of the journal and is considered final” Davis wrote. “The print issue is being temporarily held so the Expression of Concern and comments/replies can be published in the same issue as the original article to give readers access to the fullest possible picture.”

Though the issue-bound publication of Ramseyer’s article is delayed the article has been available online since Dec. 1 2020.

In response to petitions and demands that the journal remove Ramseyer’s article Davis pointed to the journal’s correction policy which notes that if “substantiated concerns” are raised about a paper the journal may convene a review by new experts to determine if those concerns are legitimate. After this review the journal may initiate a correction which can constitute an editorial note a retraction or an Expression of Concern which has already been issued.

When asked about the journal’s statement Friday Ramseyer wrote in an emailed statement “my article speaks for itself.”

At the journal’s request Harvard History professor Andrew D. Gordon ’74 and East Asian Languages and Civilizations professor Carter J. Eckert are preparing a response for publication Eckert told The Crimson earlier this month.

Academics Students Continue To Speak Out

Since the publication of Ramseyer's article activists and academics alike have criticized the journal for its editorial process and decision to move forward with publication.

Samuel Clowes Huneke a history professor at George Mason University wrote to the editorial board of the journal demanding the article’s withdrawal according to a tweet on Feb. 3. In an emailed statement to The Crimson Huneke wrote that his letter went unacknowledged by the journal.

“By denying that these women were forced into sexual slavery Prof. Ramseyer and the IRLE thus put themselves in the company of those who deny or whitewash other war crimes and crimes against humanity” Huneke wrote.

Despite the journal’s Expression of Concern Huneke stood by his call for retraction and his belief that the article “falls short of any reasonable scholarly standard.”

Though professors and students condemned Ramseyer’s research critics remain split over the issue of academic freedom. Some argue Ramseyer is in his right to publish his article while others including Huneke denounced that the journal accepted the paper for publication.

The Korean Association of Harvard Law School published a statement Feb. 4 criticizing the article but defending Ramseyer's right to publish.

Phebe J. Hong ’16 co-president of the Harvard Asian Pacific American Law Students Association said her organization is working with KAHLS to write a “critical analysis” of Ramseyer’s article with fact-checks. Hong noted however that APALSA has respect for academic freedom “especially” that of Ramseyer.

Hong said APALSA has been in communication with Ramseyer to discuss the academic backing behind his article and that Ramseyer has been “responsive and replying to our inquiries.”

Ramseyer added in his emailed statement Friday that he appreciated APALSA’s openness and professionalism.

“I wish all academic disputes could proceed with such courtesy” he wrote.

Joseph L. Choe ’17 and Mindy G. Nam — who wrote an op-ed in The Crimson Thursday that contextualized Ramseyer’s article within the broader picture of Japanese revisionist movements — also said they believe Ramseyer’s right to academic freedom should be protected.

“We think academic freedom is very important. Whether it should be taken down should be decided by academics that are qualified to really judge the merits of this paper” said Nam a recent graduate of the Law School. “But if found faulty I think it should absolutely not be published.”

Choe a third-year student at the Law School added that critics of Ramseyer’s article should refrain from attacking him on a personal level and instead focus on the article and its logic.

Sara Kang a History Ph.D. student who is assisting Gordon and Eckert’s effort to draft a response wrote in an email that while it is important to respect Ramseyer’s academic freedom his article is “problematic on so many fronts.”

“Academic journals have a responsibility to publish work that is well-researched and competent based on the system of peer review” wrote Kang who studies Japanese and Korean history.

The Harvard University Korean Student Association has insisted that the article be retracted from the journal.

In a condemnation of Ramseyer’s article published on its website in Korean Monday the association requested the paper’s withdrawal recognizing the “gravity of misportrayal of historical facts” and the article’s impact on the victims of Japanese sex slavery.

KSA President Woowon Chung a Graduate School of Design student said in an interview conducted in Korean that it is important to consider the impact that Ramseyer’s exercise of academic freedom may have had on victims especially if the article caused a reprisal in denials of their trauma.

Sangmin Kim a third-year Harvard Medical School student and vice president of KSA added that he wanted to “emphasize the fact that this is bad science.”

Petitions Target Ramseyer Journal Harvard

South Korean internet-based organization Voluntary Agency Network of Korea — which has previously received donations from the South Korean government — released a Change.org petition that argues Ramseyer “defames Harvard Law School by violating ethics and conscience as a scholar.”

With more than 9000 signatures as of Saturday afternoon the petition calls on Ramseyer to apologize for the journal to withdraw his paper and for Harvard to take disciplinary action against Ramseyer.

The Harvard College Korean International Student Association also circulated a Harvard-wide petition Tuesday demanding an apology from Ramseyer an acknowledgement of the issue by University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 and a statement from the journal regarding the article’s shortcomings. The petition also urged the journal to consider withdrawing the article.

Harvard Korean Association co-president Danny Kim ’23 said 19 Harvard student organizations mostly undergraduate Asian affinity groups have co-signed the student petition.

Harvard students also took action independently sending out petitions and letters.

Hye Rin “Lina” Cho ’23 started her own Change.org petition Monday demanding apologies from the journal and Ramseyer which has more than 500 signatures as of Saturday.

In an emailed statement Cho wrote that the journal’s response is a “step in the right direction” but asserted the journal should also retract the article.

“The journal publishing his article anyway is giving credibility where it isn’t due and granting space where it’s not deserved” she wrote.

Woohee Kim an incoming Harvard graduate student also organized an open letter welcoming any signatory who self-identifies as “a feminist scholar student or alumni of a higher education institution.”

Unlike other circulating petitions and statements Kim’s letter — which has amassed nearly 900 signatures from both individuals and organizations as of Saturday — was directed toward higher education institutions rather than Ramseyer or the journal.

“The open letter calls on the need to address the implications of academic knowledge that upholds sexist patriarchal and colonialist perspectives at the expense of uncovering the deeply entrenched interlocking systems of oppression” Kim wrote in an emailed statement.

Beyond Harvard the paper has drawn increasing criticism from public officials and groups including U.S. Representatives Young O. Kim (R-Calif.) Michelle E. Steel (R-Calif.) and the Council of Korean Americans a national nonprofit.

On Twitter former White House ethics lawyer Richard W. Painter ’84 called for the paper to be taken down.

Some student organizations used the controversy as a teachable moment. On Tuesday APALSA and KAHLS held a documentary screening of “Shusenjo: Comfort Women and Japan’s War on History” and hosted a conversation with director Miki Dezaki according to Hong.

APALSA organizer and Law student Janet Park said APALSA is also hosting a webinar Feb. 16 on “debunking denialism” and comfort women activism in the U.S. The event will include a roundtable discussion with former U.S. Rep. Michael M. “Mike” Honda (D-Calif.) and two surviving comfort women Lee Yong-soo and Estelita Dy.

Harvard Officials Remain Quiet

Despite a groundswell of activism against Ramseyer and student calls for Harvard to respond to the backlash top University officials have remained silent on the issue.

“You have to wonder why they’re keeping silent” said Yumi Lee ’21 co-president of the Harvard Korean International Students Association. “Harvard should take some definite course of action in responses because not doing so will indicate some sort of complicity.”

Cho the undergraduate who started the Change.org petition wrote in a statement that the issue “is not going to be swept under the rug quietly.”

“All I need to do is get the message out as far as possible and I trust that people will respond” she said.

Ramseyer did not respond to questions about student demands to have the article taken down.

Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain deferred to Harvard Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal for comment. When asked on Saturday about Ramseyer student demands and if the Law School would take any action Neal declined to comment.

Choe the Law School student said he believes speaking out against the paper is important to shape future scholarship.

“What we wanted first and foremost was to disincentivize and prevent future publications like this from coming out whether from Ramseyer or from others” Choe said. “We wanted to hold accountable him and anyone else even remotely thinking about silencing these victims of sexual slavery.”

Collecting dirty plates was replaced with finding the perfect designer plate to photograph a famous chef’s recipe on. Then like hundreds of thousands of others Kelly lost her job because of Covid-19.

For months she managed to get by while applying for work similar to her previous role. But with her redundancy money running out she started to look for other work. One job sounded as if it could be just the thing to tide her over.

Advertised on Indeed which claims to be “the #1 job site in the world” it was a remote role doing Covid-19 testing admin. The company said it needed “people from all walks of life to help us as we reach this epic milestone in our fight against the virus”. The role would involve tasks such as “accessing and maintaining accurate patients’ records” and “providing admin support by sorting test results”.

She says: “It was working remotely so it felt really safe. The hourly rate was great; £14 an hour. I thought it must be so high because you don’t get many hours and it was data-related so seemed realistic. I spent a few hours writing a cover letter and filled in their application form.”

The next day she heard back. “I then had to send loads of details to their email: my current address and two previous ones my education and all my previous employment. Five days later I got a reply from a man named Daniel saying I had been shortlisted for a month-long trial period and to fill in a form starting the enrolment period. They wanted my current address contact details and my bank account number and sort code for a payment.”

After clicking confirm Kelly felt very uneasy. “Something didn’t feel right” she says. “I reread the email and there were some grammatical errors and spelling mistakes. I rang my bank and they told me the worst they could do was start a direct debit which they would look out for.”

Kelly Googled the company the job was supposedly for IQVIA a healthcare tech company – and discovered that far from being potential employers those behind the ad she had seen were fraudsters. Searching for “IQVIA” and “fraud” she found a page headed “Protect yourself from fraudulent job offers” which said the firm was aware its name was being misused by scammers.

“I transferred what I had in my current account to my boyfriend’s straight away and rang my bank. Luckily they didn’t take anything. If they had they could have easily wiped me out” she says. “Looking back at it it’s really weird to hire me without speaking to me on the phone. It was all too good to be true.”

IQVIA told Guardian Money it had heard from dozens of people who had seen the fake ads using its name including some who had lost money to the fraudsters. “IQVIA has become aware of job scams in which fraudsters impersonate company representatives and make fraudulent job offers” it says. “To be clear IQVIA does not make unsolicited job offers nor require any banking information from job applicants.”

Action Fraud which is the UK’s national reporting agency for scams says it has been alerted to 4540 Covid-19 related fraud and cybercrimes resulting in total losses of £21.8m. It has received 23 reports about fraudulent job ads using IQVIA’s name although there were no losses associated with these reports.

Action Fraud said scams were getting harder to spot: “Criminals are becoming more sophisticated and will use every opportunity they can to defraud innocent people.”

The incident has shaken Kelly’s confidence. “I would definitely want to at least speak to someone ideally in person before taking a job” she says. “I didn’t think just anyone would be able to post on Indeed; I would at least think there was an accreditation process.”

Indeed says it removed the advert after jobseekers complained. It adds that when posts are removed because of suspected fraud applicants are usually notified but that this had not happened in Kelly’s case.

“There’s a set of criteria jobs must meet before they go live but there’s also manual and automatic processes in place once jobs are published to remove those that breach our policies” it says. “We take rule violations very seriously and have a team dedicated to search quality that uses automatic and manual means of identifying and removing fraudulent accounts from our site as quickly as possible.”

It adds: “We encourage people to report any suspect job advertisements to us or if they feel it necessary to make a report to the police.”

To celebrate the milestone the developer announced that throughout the whole month of February it has plenty of ""fun stuff"" planned for the Nordic survival game and asked fans to keep an eye on its social media pages to hear what's coming.

Aside from extending the game's Lunar New Year sale on Steam Iron Gate also touched on the Mountain biome update confirming it's putting finishing touches on it before its scheduled release of ""early 2022.""

The Mountain update was announced last year and will feature new caves in the region and an underground temple. Alongside the Mountain update Iron Gate has also been working on Mistlands--another new biome players will be able to explore that will include new enemies a new boss resources and more.

""The phase of nailing down the core concept is done and we know what kind of inhabitants we want the biome to have"" the developer explained. ""This means we’re now working on a bunch of new build pieces and enemies as well as defining more of the new mechanics we will be introducing (though we’d like to keep those secret for a while longer).""

Iron Gate also addressed the upcoming release of the Steam Deck stating that it would like Valheim to run smoothly on the device at launch so it's working on it at the moment.

Valve recently confirmed that the Steam Deck will launch to the first buyers on February 25 and those who reserved a device will have 72 hours to purchase the unit after confirming their order via an email which will be sent that day.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHA6Ly93d3cua2V3ZWVuYXdyZXBvcnQuY29tL29iaXRzL29iaXR1YXJ5LWxvcnJhaW5lLWx5bm4td2F0dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary: Lorraine (Lynn) Watt,"As received from the Memorial Chapel & Plowe Funeral Homes:

Lorraine (Lynn) Watt of Houghton passed away on Friday February 5 2021 from injuries received in an automobile accident.

Lorraine was born December 3 1941 in Boston Location to parents Peter and Evelyn (Lovelace) Hilton. She was a graduate of Hancock High School with the class of 1960 and earned a secretarial certificate from Soumi College in 1961.

Lorraine used her skills beginning at Michigan Tech in the Athletic Department then the Birmingham Public School System before returning to the Copper Country to work at the Copper Country Medical Center before retiring in March of 2001 from Copper Country Mental Health.

Lorraine was united in marriage to Lynn Watts on May 21 1966 and the couple made their home in Royal Oak MI for years before returning to the Copper Country where she lived the remainder of her life. They were blessed with 2 children Jodi Lynne and Christopher. After retirement they made their home in Sarasota Florida for the winter months – returning to Houghton in the late spring to get a taste of the winter they left behind.

Lorraine was an active member of Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Houghton serving on various committees throughout her life. After retirement she was very active volunteering at Little Brothers the Calumet Theater and Helping Hand. She especially enjoyed being a host parent to many MTU students who attended Good Shepherd Church serving them home cooked meals. She was best known for her pies.

Lorraine is survived by her husband Lynn of 54 years son Christopher of Iron Mountain Brother John (Georgianna) of Olympia WA Sister Lucelia (Bill) of Steamboat Springs CO; brother-in-law: Jim and sister-in-law: Barb of Shelby Township MI; Nimes Stacy Lynne Marie Loris and Jill; Nephews Peter and Scott; godchild Jason Brooks and numerous relatives and wonderful friends.

She is preceded in death by her parents twin brothers Ronald and Arnold and daughter Jodi Lynn Watts.

A small private gather for Lorraine will be held later this spring with burial in the Forest Hill Cemetery of Houghton.

In lieu of other expressions of sympathy the family suggests memorials be made to Good Shepherd Lutheran Church of Houghton.

The Memorial Chapel & Plowe Funeral Homes of Hancock have been assisting the family with the arrangements.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5cHJlc3MubmV0L25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAyL2xvbmctbGFzdGluZy1jb3VwbGVzLXNoYXJlLW1hcnJpYWdlLXNlY3JldHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Long-lasting couples share marriage secrets | News Sports Jobs,"ESCANABA — As Valentine’s Day approaches thoughts turn to giving gifts nurturing romance and perhaps wondering what makes love last.

This February three U.P. couples married for over 50 years shared their secrets to a happy marriage. There were many common threads between the couples including gratitude shared interests communication and lots of give-and-take.

Claire (VanDamme) Burton and husband Charles (Chuck) celebrated 60 years of marriage on June 18 2020. The couple has lived in Gladstone throughout their marriage. Claire worked for the Gladstone school system from 1983 to 2000 retiring after 17 years. Chuck worked at Harnischfeger Corporation after serving two years in the U.S. Army. He then worked for Mead Paper Company for 32 years before retiring. The couple raised three daughters.

Over the years Claire said they spent regular time together in addition to each pursuing their own interests. Chuck used to bowl and play golf and she played bingo with friends. Before the pandemic Claire and Chuck also enjoyed playing cards with friends every week. They are fond of classic country music and watching television together.

“We watch T.V. together. He’ll watch whatever I want to watch. I watch what he wants to watch. We give-and-take with each other” said Claire.

Though Claire and Chuck don’t always share chores each contributes in their way. Claire does the cooking dishes and laundry.

“But he does the men’s stuff. Shovels snow blows cuts the grass. He’s very good about it” Claire said.

Though she handles the finances the couple makes big decisions together.

“I manage the money but I always check with him. But he’s easy-going and usually agrees” said Claire.

Claire believes the personality differences between she and Chuck help make the marriage work.

“He’s more quiet and I’m more talkative. Makes for a good mix” she said.

For the most part Claire and Chuck just plain get along. She credited his good attitude saying he’s easy to get along with because things don’t upset him.

“We had maybe three fights. When I look back I was at fault and he was right” Claire said adding “I’ve had 60 good years I can’t complain. Especially when you get to old age it makes a difference when you get along.”

Ethel M. Swanson Blixt and Richard W. Blixt have some things in common with the Burtons. They married on the same day in 1960. Richard also worked for Harnischfeger after serving in the military spending 27 years at the manufacturing company after four years in the U.S. Air Force.

Ethel also worked over the years spending five years at Neisner’s Dime store after being laid off from Hiawatha Baptist Mission. She then spent six years working in daycare. Like the Burtons Ethel and Richard have three daughters.

When Harnischfeger closed in 1984 Richard took a job with Voith Paper Machine Corporation moving the couple to Appleton Wis. Richard retired ten years later and he and Ethel moved back to Escanaba in 1995.

Of their similarities the most important parallel between the couples is most likely their outlook on marriage.

“We made it to 60 with give-and-take. You can’t just be one-sided and be mad about it. A lot of young people today just walk away from it. They each go their own direction and it’s all over with” said Richard.

Richard said when it comes to decisions he and Ethel usually agree though he’s more of the lead person.

“When I buy a car I just buy it. Sometimes she gets a little bit huffy but it blows over” he admitted.

Over the years the couple spent time together going to movies going to dinner on special occasions and camping. They also had their own interests Richard said pointing out that Ethel loved being a member of Loving Fingers Quilters at Central United Methodist Church.

Richard emphasized the importance of talking and being able to apologize. He also said that he and Ethel never had any big fights.

“It’s a long undertaking 60 years but I enjoyed them” Richard said.

Richard VanSipe and his wife Mary (Havens) will celebrate their 71st anniversary on March 25. Richard spent his career as a Michigan State Policeman and commander at the Gladstone Post retiring in 1975. Mary was a homemaker taking care of the family and also worked at State Wide Real Estate in Escanaba. They have two daughters and a son.

Like the Burtons and the Blixts Richard and Mary enjoyed shared interests in addition to having their own. Mary has made hundreds of quilts over the years and Richard likes gardening puzzling and is a devoted Detroit Tigers fan. They share a love of golf bowling and traveling.

“We golfed together for 60 years and we bowled together for over a dozen years” Richard said adding that their bowling team won three championships between 1976 and 1977.

During their marriage the couple’s travels took to them to Germany twice in addition to visiting every major baseball stadium in the U.S.

In October of 2019 Richard and Mary headed to Florida for the winter as was their yearly practice. When it came time to return in May 2020 however the couple stayed in Cocoa Beach. Richard said they discussed the pandemic and decided not to head north. They remain in Florida to this day.

Richard points to talking through important decisions — such as whether to return to Escanaba during the pandemic — as one of the keys to a happy marriage. Communication has always been essential he said especially when their children were young.

“We made parenting decisions through discussion” Richard said.

These days Richard and Mary like to watch T.V. together. Asked whether they ever disagree on what to watch Richard says no.

“We don’t fight over the remote because they don’t have one” said Richard admitting he’s okay with Mary choosing the shows they watch.

Mary also makes many of the bigger decisions though they agree on the important things — like Mary’s cooking.

“One thing I don’t do is cook. Whatever she fixes I eat. I definitely tell her it’s good because I want to have another meal” Richard said.",,,,,,

This company which is in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share delivering a surprise of 7.75%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Jacob Klaer (Sr.) was born in Germany June 6 1818; he emigrated to America in 1840. The elder Klaer settled in New York City where he operated a file factory four or five years. He then moved to Dingman Township Pike County Pa. where he bought a farm.

After eight years the elder moved to Milford where he made wagons. In 1858 he purchased and refitted an old woolen mill on the Sawkill Creek where for many years he was a wheelwright turning out spokes and hubs- used for wagons and carriage wheels.

This factory and the lower grist mill which he also operated took power from the lower end of the Sawkill Creek falls. The mill went through several hands. In June 1877 Klaer filed suit against the Ridgeway brothers who owned the mill just upstream over water rights.

In August 1924 August Metz Jr. bought the property and turned it into the tri-state area's first ice plant.

Flooding on the Sawkill was a serious issue for mill owners as well as neighbors. High waters on the Delaware and tributaries in December 1878 caused loss or damage to lumber at Klaer's mill as well as the mill of his neighbor Warren K. Ridgway. Klaer tied down his manufactories with rope for fear they would be swept away.

A much respected citizen the elder Klaer was an influential member in the local Democratic committee and was elected to the first Milford Borough council.

Borough set up 1875

Milford Pa. has the distinction of having been the county seat for not one but two counties. It was the first county seat of Wayne when the county was formed from Northampton in 1798. It was soon relocated further north in a tug-of-war to find the most suitable place for court in such a large district.

Then in 1814 when Pike County was sectioned off from Wayne the county seat Pike's county seat was established in Milford.

The town which grew as a manufacturing center along the powerful Sawkill Creek and soon became a much-desired resort haven did not become a borough until 1875 separating from Milford Township.

The new brick courthouse was opened at Broad and High Streets only the year before.

The first election in Milford under the borough charter was held February 16 1875. The following officers were elected:

Chief Burgess John C. Wallace; Council members John Gaillard Henry B. Wells Jacob Klaer Peter A.L. Quick Desire Bournique.

Other charter office-holders were School Directors Charles Lareaux Vincent Emerson John Nyce F.H. Palmer David A. Wells Frederick C. Almer; Overseer of the Poor Emanuel B. Quick John B. Newman; Assessor Chauncey W. Dimmick; Auditors Abraham D. Brown Benjamin P. Bennett Edward Quick; Judge of Elections James A. Doney; Inspectors of Elections Oscar M. Brink George Slawson.

Klaer and his fellow councilmen first met at the home of Burgess Wallace who presided on February 23 1875. Henry T. Baker was elected Borough Secretary and Samuel Dimmick was appointed Treasurer.

Klaer was re-elected the next year.

Among the important community developments at hand in the newly established borough was the establishment of a water company in 1875 and in 1876 organized a fire department once hydrants became available.

Jacob Klaer Jr. was active in the hook and ladder company that soon followed.

Milford Borough built its present hall at 109 West Catherine Street in 1899. Made of field stone the fire company occupied the first floor and council met upstairs. The tower held a fire alarm bell.

Future wife on same ship

Soon after his arrival in America Jacob Klaer (Sr.) was married in New York City to Miss Anna M. Huhnwho was born in Lindau Bavaria in January 1818.

She came to America on the same ship as her future husband accompanied by her parents John and Anna Huhn. It appears they may have met on the ship where love unfolded.

Both her father and Jacob's father were soldiers under Napolean.

She and Jacob had several children: John Caroline Jacob Mary Marian Louis Charles Henry and Maggie.

One of their sons John (1842-1888) was in the Civil War. He was a private in Co. B 179th Regiment Pa. Volunteer Infantry. John worked in his father's spoke and hub factory.

Mrs. Klaer knitted many garments for Union soldiers during the war.

Their home was very close to the spoke and hub factory and grist mill across the road.

In October 1897 the mill burned down the elder Klaer rebuilt it and was known as the Sawkill mill. After the burning down of the grist mill business financial reverses overtook him. “The accumulations of his untiring industry were swept away” a 1900 biographical article stated.

Jacob Klaer (Sr.) died December 31 1889 at the age of 71 and was laid to rest in Milford cemetery.

In 1909 his widow Anna moved to New Rochelle NY. She died at her daughter's home there August 23 1917 at the age of 100.

Hon. Jacob Klaer

Their son Jacob (who we will refer here as Hon. Jacob Klaer) was born September 14 1845 in Dingman Township. When he was six he and his family moved into town where he went to school in Milford.

At 16 he went to learn the blacksmith's trade under G.P.Heller of Milford but the start of the Civil War brought changes to the business. he then returned home to assist his father.When he was 27 he went to Bushkill and operated a spoke factory for five years his first business venture. He then went back to Milford and purchased his father's spoke and hub factory and grist mill continuing to 1897. His enterprises were successful.

In 1897 he bought the Rose farm a fine estate along the bottom lands bordering the Delaware River having 1000 acres. It contained some of the finest topsoil in Pike County. An August 1900 news item said that the Hon. Jacob Klaer was “busy turning out spokes” and just completed a silo on his farm. He planned to increase the milk production at his dairy.

At various times the Hon. Klaer held public office running as a Democrat. For over 20 years he was a school director and like his father was elected to Milford Council. There he served a few terms and also one term as chief burgess (mayor). He also served a term as justice of the peace.

Klaer served on the board of the 1st National Bank of Port Jervis.

In 1915 he was appointed as superintendent of the Milford Water Company.

Associate Judge

In 1896 he was elected as associate judge of Pike County. He served under President Judge George S. Purdy until October 1901 when President Judge Allen Craig took the bench.

When he ran for re-election in 1901 the Tri-State Union referred to it as a “triangular battle” with two comparatively unknown contenders. The article says Klaer “thinks the time-honored Democratic custom of re-election should prevail.”

Family life

On April 25 1877 the Hon. Klaer was wed to Miss Mary Jane Nyce at Egypt Mills in southern Pike County near Bushkill. It was a double wedding with their friends Mr. and Mrs. C.W. Bull Esq.

Mrs. Klaer was born at Egypt Mills daughter of Jacob and Linda Nyce.

Fifteen years later a largely attended anniversary banquet was held at the Klaer home in Milford.

The Klaers had five children Fred Harlan Linda Nyce Mary L. Edna M. and Henry J.

Their son Fred became a physician practicing in Philadelphia. His wife was Mary N. Howland; they had a son John who died in his fifth year.

Linda was wed to Albert Q. Wallace and had four children Marion Virginia Linda and Eva.

Louise Mary was a teacher. She wed Dr. David R. Chapin and had Henry and Cisly.

Edna wed Dr. Charles W. Hunt; their children were Gordon Margaret Mary and John.

Henry studied chemical engineering. He and his wife Dorothy W. Sproul had a daughter John. Henry was only 29 when he died of pneumonia in 1918.

Dr. Klaer died of tuberculosis meningitis at age 37.

The Hon. Jacob Klaer and his family made their home at 314 East Harford Street which was very near the location of his father's house. In the general location today is a half-circle street off East Harford forming a small park; a fireworks business is nearby.

He was a member and trustee at the 1st Presbyterian Church in town. Mrs. Klaer was active with the church Ladies' Aid society.

Local newspapers of the day carried much news of the coming and goings of area residents.

In November 1889 Klaer and two other men spent three days in the Shohola woods hunting pheasants; they killed 17.

Tri-States Union of Port Jervis recorded in July 1898 that Judge Klaer and his family along with several others made up a large camping party heading for the camp at Twin Lakes. They planned to stay two weeks. This was a popular camping destination for Milford area folks.

We wish we were told the make and model. The same paper on May 11 1908 reported “Hon. Jacob Klaer is running his new auto. So far he has not collided with any telephone poles.”

Judge Jacob Klaer died July 16 1942 at his Milford home. He was 96. His wife Mary was 97 when she passed away May 30 1951. Their remains were laid to rest at Milford Cemetery.

The gesture is a welcome development as it not only puts the young cadets in the spotlight that will make them household names but it will also spur their progress and development as a team as they build up for the 2021 FIBA-Asia Cup and ultimately the 2023 FIBA World Cup.

Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP) President Al Panlilio has lauded this move and thanked the PBA for extending its assistance to the national cause. While there is no confirmation yet from the SBP if the team will participate there are positive signs that they will.

Not counting the 1998 Centennial and the 2002 Selecta national all-pro teams that participated in the 1998 Centennial Cup and the 2002 Governors' and Commissioner's Cups respectively there have been 10 PBA conferences when an all-amateur national team participated as a guest team. Recent interviews of former national players on the podcast An Eternity of Basketball revealed that their PBA stint played a pivotal role in speeding up the cohesion and development process.

In this two-part series we'll look back at how these national teams performed in the PBA. This first part covers the four PBA conferences participated in by the RP-NCC teams of Ron Jacobs. The second part will cover the national teams of Joe Lipa and Rajko Toroman as well as the one-conference stint of Derick Pumaren's national team in 1988.

RP Northern Cement (3rd place 1984 1st All Filipino Conference)

Roster: Jeff Moore Chip Engelland Hector Calma Franz Pumaren Jong Uichico Elmer Reyes Yves Dignadice Rey Cuenco Alfie Almario Naning Valenciano Peter Aguilar Jun Tan Tonichi Yturri.

Coach: Ron Jacobs

After an unceremonious debacle in the 1983 ABC in Hong Kong where the Philippines ended up ninth overall brought about by a controversial technicality that forfeited the team's first two games in the preliminary round NCC forged an agreement with the PBA to serve as guest team for the first time in the 10th season of the league. With the disbandment of Toyota at the end of the 1983 season and the number of teams down to seven the arrangement became mutually beneficial.

At the end of the eliminations the Nationals surprised everyone by topping the field with an 11-3 card one game ahead of Crispa and Great Taste the latter welcoming Toyota stars Arnie Tuadles and Chito Loyzaga in its fold. Crispa then defeated GTC in the playoff for the automatic second semis seat 124-120. The two teams that benefited most from Toyota's disbandment Beer Hausen and Gilbey's Gin ended up with 8-6 slates apparently still adjusting to the new environment. Gold Eagle led by their franchise player Abe King closed the elims with a 4-10 record to join the Coffeemakers the Brewmasters and the Gin Tonics in the single-round robin quarterfinals. Tanduay and Countryfair were eliminated.

Gilbey's and Beer Hausen joined NCC and Crispa in the semis as both teams won two of their three games. Great Taste considered one of the favorites to win the title shockingly lost to Gold Eagle 103-97 that virtually spelled their doom. They also lost to Gilbey's in overtime 151-145 before ending their campaign with a 142-126 victory against previously unbeaten Beer Hausen. Gold Eagle filed a protest after their 106-104 loss to the Gin Tonics and the league ordered a re-play to determine the second semifinalist. Gilbey's eliminated the Beermen 115-106.

Fresh from a grand slam conquest the previous season the Redmanizers turned up the juice winning four straight games after an initial loss to Beer Hausen 109-108 at the start of the semis. After conquering NCC 96-94 for their fourth victory and a seat in the Finals Coach Tommy Manotoc resigned because of health reasons. Many-time national team member and assistant coach Narciso Bernardo took over. NCC on the other hand lost their first two games against Gilbey's and Crispa before pulling even with victories over Beer Hausen 115-109 and Gilbey's 135-124. The nationals lost steam in the end losing a heartbreaking game to Crispa and against Beer Hausen 119-107 leading to their elimination as they finished the semis with a 2-4 card. In their shortened series battle for 3rd place NCC toppled Beer Hausen in five games 3-2.

NCC's first stint in the PBA was only the third time since 1980 that a guest team played in the PBA. The Nicholas Stoodley-backed South Korean national team played in the Invitationals and finished third overall. They were also aiming to replicate another Nicholas Stoodley-backed foreign team made up of American professionals (led by former 1979 Royal Tru Orange import Larry Pounds) to win a PBA title as a guest team - a feat the Jeansmakers accomplished in the 1980 Invitationals against the Toyota Tamaraws. While they may have failed to accomplish this goal there were obviously more gains none more important than the mainstream acceptance of the team to the discriminate Filipino basketball fans. Their ability to go toe-to-toe against the top pro teams earned them more fans and considerable respect.

RP Northern Cement (4th place 1984 2nd All Filipino Conference)

Roster: Jeff Moore Chip Engelland Hector Calma Franz Pumaren Yves Dignadice Jong Uichico Jun Tan Elmer Reyes Alfie Almario Peter Aguilar Rey Cuenco Naning Valenciano Tonichi Yturri.

Coach: Ron Jacobs

The PBA was forced to have a second All Filipino conference in one season because of the economic crisis besetting the country. With the value of the dollar rising significantly against the peso the PBA teams decided not to hire imports to manage costs.

There were eight teams bracketed into two groups with NCC Crispa Gold Eagle and Tanduay comprising Group A and Great Taste Gilbey's Beer Hausen and Countryfair rounding up Group B. Teams in the same group would play each other once while facing the remaining four teams in the other bracket twice for a total of eleven games. At the end of the eliminations Great Taste and Northern earned automatic semifinals seats ending up with 9-2 and 8-3 cards respectively. Crispa beat Gold Eagle 2-0 Gilbey's came from behind to defeat Tanduay 2-1 while Beer Hausen swept Countryfair 2-0 to join GTC and NCC in the semis.

GTC topped the double round semifinals with a 6-2 slate losing only to Beer Hausen 105-89 and Tanduay 136-131. The Brewmasters led by eventual MVP Ramon Fernandez and NCC tied for second with 5-3 cards each while splitting their semis games 123-98 in favor of NCC in the first round and a 118-107 revenge from Beer Hausen in the second round. In their knockout game for the second finals seat the Brewmasters won the game 122-117 amidst controversy over allegations of one-sided officiating favoring Beer Hausen. Coach Jacobs was vocal about his disgust as he felt that the league didn't want an all-amateur team to succeed in the PBA.

In protest Jacobs hardly played Moore and Engelland in their best-of-five series for third place against Tanduay losing 135-121 and 127-95. Game 2 even saw rookie reserve Dennis Abbatuan scatter a career-high 51 points mostly from at the post and underneath as NCC's defense seemed half-hearted. Deputy Commissioner Tommy Manotoc summoned Jacobs to his office and admonished him for shortchanging the fans. In Game 3 NCC vented its ire on a hapless Tanduay team with a 148-110 demolition led by Engelland's 60 points. With Great Taste already sweeping Beer Hausen in the Finals Tanduay copped third place by virtue of a 2-1 series win.

The nationals were at the cusp of making it to the Finals for a battle royale with the Coffeemakers. They had an excellent chance of achieving this feat but because of the relative youth and inexperience of the local talents they succumbed to the pressure losing back to back games in the second round against GTC and Beer Hausen. Yet it was a major accomplishment as the finalists were led by the best players of the country in Brown and Fernandez.

RP Northern Cement - 1985 Open Conference (3rd place)

Roster: Dennis Still Jeff Moore Chip Engelland Hector Calma Samboy Lim Allan Caidic Yves Dignadice Elmer Reyes Franz Pumaren Tonichi Yturri Benjie Gutierrez Jun Tan.

Coach: Ron Jacobs

The NCC RP team had a full slate for 1985 given that the SEA Games and the ABC would be held in December. In support of the national cause the PBA adjusted the sequencing in its calendar with the All Filipino sandwiching the two import-laced conferences. With NCC going overseas in Gerona for the World Interclub and Taipei for the Jones Cup in June and July the league accommodated the national team for the Open and Reinforced Conferences. Similarly Still was finally inserted into the lineup alongside Engelland and Moore but with the provision that only two naturalized players were allowed to play at the same time.

The Open featured reinforcements with unlimited height with returning imports like 6'11 Lewis Brown (who replaced Doug Harris) the 6'5 Norman Black and 6'9 Rich Adams (replacing Kevin Graham) while newcomers were 6'9"" John Campbell of Ginebra (replacing Harold Driver) 6'7"" David Pope of Tanduay (who replaced Merlin Wilson) and Great Taste's 6'9"" Joe Binion (replacing Napoleon Johnson).

Great Taste and Tanduay topped the elims with 8-4 cards. NCC Magnolia Manila Beer and Shell duked it out in the quarterfinals for the last two semis slots while Ginebra dropped out of the race with a 3-9 record. The Ice Cream Makers won two games in the single round robin quarterfinals to gain the third semis slot. The Brewmasters were particularly impressive as they swept their three games by an average of 15.6 points to tie NCC for second. In their knockout playoff game NCC extracted vengeance with a convincing 98-75 victory to knock out the Lucio Tan franchise.

NCC started well beating Great Taste 100-97 in their first semis game. The Coffeemakers though went on a roll led by eventual MVP Ricardo Brown and won five in a row to earn the first Finals seat. While the national team dominated Tanduay in their two games they couldn't get past their tormentor Magnolia losing both games 97-95 and 94-84. In their conference head-to-head duel the Ice Cream Makers won four of their five games. In the last game of the semifinals NCC had to beat GTC to forge a three-way tie for first at 4-2 but suffered an overtime loss 102-94 to end up in the battle for third where they demolished the Rhum Makers 4-2 in a best-of-seven series.

Nineteen eighty-five may yet be the best year of the NCC national team in terms of accomplishment and performance. Apart from achieving their final objective of winning the ABC title the PBA crown was a major accomplishment as well given the daunting odds. When the PBA agreed to have Still play for NCC it showcased the league's willingness to take risks - the odds of seeing an all-amateur team win a PBA title were high with the 6'8"" Jolly Green Giant beefing up the Northerners. While the Open Conference may have yielded only a third-place finish the invaluable lessons of playing against the pro teams beefed up by a tall import made the nationals more than ready to face challenges in the coming months.

The Northern Cement-backed national team won the 1985 PBA Third Conference crown as a guest team. NCC

RP Northern Cement - 1985 Reinforced Conference (1st place)

Roster: Dennis Still Jeff Moore Allan Caidic Hector Calma Samboy Lim Elmer Reyes Yves Dignadice Pido Jarencio Franz Pumaren Jerry Codiñera Tonichi Yturri Alfie Almario.

Coach: Ron Jacobs

This was the most successful national team to ever play in the PBA. And they did this in dominant fashion making them only the second guest team (after Nicholas Stoodley in the 1980 Invitationals) to win a PBA title. After a successful conquest of the 1985 Jones Cup in Taipei where they beat the US Golden Eagles team in overtime 108-100 as well as a valuable experience in the 1985 World Interclub in Gerona Spain the PBA was NCC's last preparation for the ABC tournament to be held in Kuala Lumpur starting December 26 1985.

With Chip Engelland still ineligible to play in the ABC because of residency requirements Coach Ron Jacobs opted to sit the sweet-shooting naturalized player and fielded his final 12-man lineup for the tourney. They went up against teams reinforced by one import no taller than 6'6"" - the likes included Michael Hackett Ronnie Valentine Francois Wise Norman Black Lester Rowe and Corey Blackwell.

Manila Beer and Ginebra topped the eliminations to earn the first two seats in the semifinals. Magnolia NCC Great Taste and Tanduay figured in the quarterfinals for the last two slots with Shell being the only team to be eliminated. NCC and Great Taste won two of their three games while Tanduay and Magnolia only won once catapulting the Coffeemakers and the national team to the semis. In the double round-robin Final Four Manila Beer came out on top with four wins to earn the first Finals seat with NCC taking the long route by beating Great Taste in a playoff 123-107.

NCC went unbeaten after losing to Manila Beer in the second round of the semifinals 99-93 racking up five wins in a row including a sweep of the Brewmasters 4-0 in their best of seven Finals series winning by an average margin of 25.5 points in what is regarded as the most lopsided series in league finals history. While Moore and Still dominated in both scoring and rebounding it was the more superior local support of NCC that carried them to victory. Calma scored 26 points in Game 2 to back up Moore's 28 while Caidic tallied 25 to backstop Still's 31 markers in Game 3.

That win streak coupled with an immaculate slate in both the 1985 Southeast Asian Games in Bangkok and the 1985 ABC proved how dominant and merciless Jacobs made this team. At that time they were already regarded as the country's best basketball team even better than any PBA franchise.

The marked improvement of NCC as compared to their previous PBA performances may also be a testament to their international stints prior to the conference. They played in Spain Taiwan and Malaysia (Asian Interclub) where they were able to go up against future stars like David Robinson Chuck Person Harold Pressley Kenny Gattison Joe Wolf Jay Bilas Tommy Amaker Marcel de Souza and Drazen Petrovic among many others. But more importantly it was the team chemistry that led to the Reinforced title as Jacobs parlayed the roles of each player to the hilt maximized their individual strengths while working within a disciplined system and introduced one coaching innovation after another. The 1985 PBA Reinforced stint may have only validated how good everyone including themselves knew they were."

Running back Duke Johnson announced his retirement Sunday after playing eight seasons in the NFL.

Drafted in the third round by the Cleveland Browns in 2015 out of the University of Miami where he became the school's all-time leading rusher Johnson played for four NFL teams. He last played in the league in 2022 when he appeared in a game for the Buffalo Bills.

""8 Years 4 teams with 1 goal in mind create a better life for my family"" he posted to Instagram. ""I never dreamed of being the all time leading rusher of my dream school or being somewhere on the list of all time players to come out of South FL. I just wanted an opportunity to play a game to provide a better life for my family and I was able to do just that. I want to thank each team for giving me the chance to play and represent your organization and all the fans that supported me through the highs and lows.""

He added: ""Last but DEFINITELY NOT LEAST I want to thank my GOD for allowing me to take this journey and end it in the same health I started it in. With that being said I'm officially retiring from the NFL. I hope I left a greater impression on y'all that's bigger than football.""

Johnson 30 finishes his career with 5135 total yards and 23 touchdowns for the Browns Houston Texans Miami Dolphins and Bills.

House Speaker Mike Johnson continues to oversee one of the narrowest House majorities in history leaving little margin for error as he navigates his conference and faces threats to his leadership.

Republicans control 217 seats while Democrats control 213 after Democratic Rep. Tim Kennedy of New York was sworn in Monday evening. There are currently five vacant seats.

That breakdown leaves Republicans with a one-vote margin which means they can only afford one defection from within their conference to still pass legislation on a party-line when all members are present and voting. A tie vote in the House is a fail.

In addition to the tight margin there is always the possibility that absences can further impact the vote math.

The tight vote margin means that any individual member has the potential to exert outsized influence and Johnson has frequently felt pressure from his right flank.

The extremely narrow margin has forced the speaker to put high-profile bills directly onto the floor under a procedural move known as suspension of the rules in certain instances as his right flank has increasingly taken to tanking rule votes on the floor in a show of protest.

But that strategy compels the need for a two-thirds majority to pass bills requiring significant Democratic support and further alienating Johnson from the right wing of his conference.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDUvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvcHJpc29uLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For Markus Johnson Prison and Mental Illness Equaled a Death Sentence,"Markus Johnson slumped naked against the wall of his cell skin flecked with pepper spray his face a mask of puzzlement exhaustion and resignation. Four men in black tactical gear pinned him his face to the concrete to cuff his hands behind his back.

He did not resist. He couldn’t. He was so gravely dehydrated he would be dead by their next shift change.

“I didn’t do anything” Mr. Johnson moaned as they pressed a shield between his shoulders.

It was 1:19 p.m. on Sept. 6 2019 in the Danville Correctional Center a medium-security prison a few hours south of Chicago. Mr. Johnson 21 and serving a short sentence for gun possession was in the throes of a mental collapse that had gone largely untreated but hardly unwatched.

He had entered in good health with hopes of using the time to gain work skills. But for the previous three weeks Mr. Johnson who suffered from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia had refused to eat or take his medication. Most dangerous of all he had stealthily stopped drinking water hastening the physical collapse that often accompanies full-scale mental crises.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ290cmlidW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA2L2pvaG5zb24tcHVsbHMtcGxhbnMtbWlncmFudC1zaGVsdGVyLTExdGgtd2FyZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Johnson reverses course on moving migrants from downtown to proposed shelter in 11th Ward after stiff opposition ...,"Mayor Brandon Johnson announced Monday he is pulling his proposal to move migrants from downtown to a new shelter in the South Side 11th Ward before the Democratic National Convention in the face of stiff opposition from the local alderman and the building’s owners the latest setback in the administration’s attempts to house asylum-seekers.

The change came after the owners of the property said Johnson never informed them of his plans to use the building at 3951 S. Canal St. for a shelter. When the Tribune asked the city about that apparent disconnect the Department of Family and Support Services released a Monday statement saying the city is “no longer considering” doing so.

“We were surprised to hear news reports of the City’s plan to possibly use our property as a migrant shelter” Bajaj Medical the pharmaceutical company that owns the building in the New City neighborhood said in a Sunday statement. “Bajaj Medical has not been contacted by City officials and has not approved and does not intend to approve any public use of this property.”

DFSS’ statement acknowledged that was true but clarified that “while City staff had not had conversations with the owner there were conversations held with the owner’s broker of the property and our vendor.”

Representatives with Bajaj Medical which lists Ram Chakroborty as its registered agent in state business records did not respond to a request for further comment on Monday.

Ald. Nicole Lee 11th told the Tribune earlier on Sunday that the “pretty shocking” communication breakdown points to a larger pattern of the Johnson administration’s shaky leadership on the migrant crisis.

“What’s going on? What’s going on that nobody was in touch with the owners?” Lee said. “This shines a big light and calls into question how this is being managed and the people that we have working for the city … That just is mind-blowing to me.”

Reached for comment Monday after the plan was killed Lee said she was “pleased and grateful.” But her blistering critiques from the previous day reflected new levels of frustration from the alderman who represents Chinatown and Bridgeport after being appointed by Mayor Lori Lightfoot and then winning a full term.

Lee had said the proposal to house migrants in an industrial area surrounded by train tracks elicited environmental and safety concerns. But what most disappointed her was the administration’s explanation that the move was because of the planned closure of a downtown migrant shelter before the Democratic National Convention comes to Chicago in August she said.

“I was told that the location would need renovations that they needed to get everything done and ready for a July 1 move-in ahead of the DNC” Lee said Sunday. “It was pretty disturbing. … It seemed that they were down a path and I’m hoping that we’ve as a city learned a lot of lessons from all of the experiences in the last year with opening shelters.”

The fate of the 41000-plus asylum-seekers who have arrived in Chicago since 2022 has been an ongoing quandary for Johnson who has struggled with how to move expeditiously to house them in shelters without angering the city’s 50 aldermen a role that comes with being territorial over ward matters. Attempts to place asylum-seekers in sites from the Far Northwest Side to Roseland have run into a seemingly never-ending cascade of grumbles from council members across the political spectrum.

One of the most high-profile conflicts concerned Ald. Julia Ramirez 12th a freshman progressive who ultimately prevailed in seeing a proposed winterized base camp for 2000 migrants scrapped after Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s administration yanked funding away due to environmental concerns. Other aldermen have been less successful.

Lee is more of a political moderate within the City Council and endorsed Johnson’s runoff opponent Paul Vallas after her chosen candidate Lightfoot was knocked out of the running. However she has voted with Johnson to give him some slim City Council wins: She backed the Gaza cease-fire resolution that prevailed in a tie-breaker vote cast by the mayor and Johnson’s recent move to allocate another $70 million in city funds to address the migrant crisis.

On Sunday the alderman signaled those days may be over: “The city has been spending an inordinate amount of money in response to this. … I see what we’re getting in return. We’re paying Ritz-Carlton rates for Motel Six service.”

Johnson’s team has been vexed by the aldermanic pushback with his chief of staff Cristina Pacione-Zayas often stressing in reporter briefings that the city is in crisis mode and council members need to step up and meet the administration halfway.

The DFSS statement on the shelved 11th Ward proposal on Monday said “As part of our commitment to foster transparency and inclusivity Ald. Lee was given notice early in the process in an effort to gather feedback and information about this potential site. This site was under preliminary consideration and a site visit by various City departments had not been conducted.”

Bajaj Medical has contributed $1001 to Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart and $2800 to the 11th Ward Democrats according to state campaign finance records.

Complicating the matter further still is the mayor’s task to showcase Chicago’s strengths — including its reputation as a pro-immigrant city — on a national stage at the DNC. Johnson has long pointed to the way his own election energized young progressives and reflected the party’s leftward shift as proof Chicago is the perfect place to celebrate President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign.

Republicans though have highlighted past scenes of migrant families sleeping outside Chicago police stations to make the case Biden is weak on immigration and the nation’s eyes will be on the United Center as well as the downtown business district during the affair. The latter area is home to the Standard Club shelter 320 S. Plymouth Court where over 900 migrants live. Johnson wanted to move the Standard Club residents to the Canal Street building according to Lee.

So far a sudden escalation of migrant buses sent north from Texas has not repeated itself but few within Chicago government are counting on that reprieve to last as the Democratic Party event draws near.

Johnson meanwhile dodged questions Monday on the botched 11th Ward shelter plans by blaming Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for sending migrant buses to Chicago.

“We have to be prepared for things that we don’t have control of one of which is the behavior of the governor of Texas” the mayor told reporters before making a reference to the recent rap beef between artists Kendrick Lamar and Drake. “Now I’m not quite sure if he’s auditioning to come up with a diss track for the state of Illinois or the city of Chicago but the fact of the matter is his behavior has caused chaos around this country.”

In a letter to the Prime Minister the leaders of the Covid Recovery Group (CRG) said the “tremendous pace” of the vaccination rollout meant restrictions should begin easing from early March.

They said ministers must produce a cost-benefit analysis to justify any controls that remain in place after that date with a “road-map” stating when they would be removed.

It comes amid warnings from scientists advising the Government that lifting restrictions too quickly risks another wave of the disease as big as the current one.

Earlier Mr Johnson said he was “optimistic” he could announce plans for a “cautious” easing of the rules when he sets out his “road-map” out of lockdown on February 22.

However in their letter the CRG say that the Government’s “national priority” of re-opening schools in England by March 8 “must” be achieved.

By Easter they say pubs restaurants and other hospitality venues should be able to open in a way that is Covid-secure but still allows them to operate “in a commercially viable manner”.

“Covid is a serious disease and we must control it. However just like Covid lockdowns and restrictions cause immense social and health damage and have a huge impact on people’s livelihoods” the letter said.

“The vaccine gives us immunity from Covid but it must also give us permanent immunity from Covid-related lockdowns and restrictions.

“This should be a moment of unity – for our country and our party – as we look ahead with confidence hope and optimism for a much brighter future as we reclaim our lives once and for all.”

The letter points out that by March 8 the Government’s top four priority groups – including the over 70s accounting for 88% of deaths and 55% of hospitalisations – will have received the vaccine and will be protected.

“All restrictions remaining after March 8 should be proportionate to the ever-increasing number of people we have protected” it says.

“The burden is on ministers to demonstrate the evidence of effectiveness and proportionality with a cost-benefit analysis for each restriction and a roadmap for when they will be removed.”

Among the restrictions about which they had “concerns” were those relating to outdoor sport and swimming pools gyms personal care businesses care home visits hotels events industry businesses and weddings.",,,,,,,,,

This signals that traders owning Bitcoin are not selling their holdings.

While the supply is shrinking demand has been going up in the past few months as an increasing number of institutional investors have been buying Bitcoin.

Bloomberg recently reported that Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s subsidiary Cointerpoint Global “is exploring whether the cryptocurrency would be a suitable option for its investors.”

According to Morgan Stanley’s website Counterpoint Global chooses to invest in assets “whose market value can increase significantly for underlying fundamental reasons.” This suggests that the bank believes Bitcoin may be undervalued compared to its fundamentals.

JPMorgan Chase also hinted that it might eventually introduce Bitcoin services. JPMorgan’s co-president Daniel Pinto believes that if investors and asset managers start using Bitcoin the bank “will have to be involved.” Pinto however said that the current demand was not strong enough but conceded it may grow in the future.

Even though Bitcoin has risen sharply in the past few months its dominance has fallen from about 69.71% on Jan. 4 to 60.9% currently. This shows that altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the past few weeks. With an eye on altcoins let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may trend in the next few days.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin broke above the $41959.63 resistance on Feb. 8 with a strong up-move but since then the momentum has weakened. Although the price has been nudging higher the leading cryptocurrency is facing profit-booking at intermittent levels.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the price turns down from the current levels and slips below $46000 the correction could deepen to the strong support at $41959.63. If the BTC/USD pair rebounds off this support it will suggest the bulls continue to accumulate on dips which is a sign that the uptrend is intact.

The bulls will then try to drive the price above the psychological barrier at $50000 and resume the uptrend with the next target objective at $60974.43. On the other hand if the bears sink the price below the 20-day exponential moving average ($41349) the pair may drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($36070).

This is an important support to watch out for because the price has not dipped below the 50-day SMA since Oct. 9. Hence a break below it will indicate a possible change in trend. The next support on the downside is much lower at $28850.

The 4-hour chart shows the pair has formed a rising wedge pattern that will complete on a breakdown and close below the support line. If that happens the pair may drop to $43720.85 and then to $41959.63.

Contrary to this assumption if the price turns up from the current levels or the 20-EMA and rises above the wedge it will invalidate the bearish setup. A breakout above $50000 could attract short-covering from the aggressive bears and may result in a quick up-move to $55000.

BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) broke above the $539 resistance on Feb. 12 and this attracted buying from the bulls. The altcoin picked up momentum and soared above the $631.71 resistance on Feb. 13

BCH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The long wick on today’s candlestick suggests short-term traders may be booking profits after the recent runup. The BCH/USD pair may now correct to $631.71 and if the bulls can flip this level into support it will indicate buying on every minor dip.

If the bulls can push the price above $730.02 the uptrend could reach $900. Both moving averages are sloping up and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the overbought zone suggesting an advantage to the bulls.

Contrary to this assumption if the price dips and sustains below $631.71 the correction could deepen to $539.

The 4-hour chart shows the bears are defending the $720 resistance and the bulls are buying on dips to $650. If the buyers can propel the price above $730.02 the uptrend could resume.

On the other hand if the price again turns down from $720 the bears will try to pull the price down to $631.71. If this support cracks the decline could extend to the 20-EMA and then to the 50-SMA.

EOS/USD

EOS broke out of the long basing formation and started a new uptrend when it soared above the $3.95 overhead resistance on Feb. 9. The altcoin picked up momentum and the bulls pushed the price above the $5.4861 resistance on Feb. 13.

EOS/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

However the failure to sustain the price above $5.4861 may have attracted profit-booking from the short-term traders. This has started a correction that could extend to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $4.5014.

If the price rebounds off this level the bulls will again try to push and sustain the price above the $5.4861 to $5.6118 overhead resistance. Contrary to this assumption if the bears sink the price below $4.5014 the EOS/USD pair could drop to $3.95.

Such a deep correction will suggest that the momentum has weakened and the pair could then consolidate in a wide range between $3.95 and $5.6118 for a few days.

The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls have purchased the dip to the 20-EMA. If the pair sustains the rebound the bulls will again try to push the price above $5.6118. If they succeed the uptrend could resume.

The next target objective on the upside is $6 and if that level is also scaled the uptrend could reach $7.50. On the other hand a break below the 20-EMA could extend the correction to the 50-SMA.

XMR/USD

Monero (XMR) broke above the $190 resistance on Feb. 12 and resumed the uptrend. The 20-day EMA ($174) has turned up and the RSI has moved into overbought territory which suggests the bulls are in command.

XMR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears are currently defending the psychological level at $250. The first support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at 213.6152. If the price rebounds off this level it will suggest that traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.

A break above $254.45 will open the doors for a rally to $300 where the bears may again mount a stiff resistance.

Contrary to this assumption if the bears sink the price below $213.6152 the correction may deepen to $190. Such a deep fall may delay the start of the next leg of the uptrend.

The 4-hour chart shows the bears are defending the $240 to $254.45 resistance zone but the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. If the price rises from the current level or rebounds off the 20-EMA it will signal strength.

If the bulls can push the price above the overhead resistance a rally to $268 and then to $300 is likely. This bullish view will invalidate if the XMR/USD pair dips and closes below the 20-EMA.

XTZ/USD

Tezos (XTZ) broke above the previous all-time high at $4.4936 on Feb. 12 and has made a new high at $5.6471 today. Whenever an asset hits a new high it indicates that bulls are in control.

XTZ/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Another thing that usually happens when a major resistance is broken is that the price turns down and retests the breakout level. In this case the price could dip to the breakout level at $4.4936.

If the price rebounds off this level it will suggest that traders are buying on dips and have flipped the previous resistance to support. The bulls will then attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $5.6471.

If they succeed the XTZ/USD pair could rally to $7.1407. This bullish view will invalidate if the pair breaks and sustains below $4.4936.

The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls could not sustain the price above $5.40 which may have attracted profit-booking from short-term traders. The bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-EMA.

If the price rebounds off this support it will signal strength. A break above $5.6471 may resume the up-move. On the other hand if the price dips below the 20-EMA and the $4.4936 support the correction could deepen to the 50-SMA.

The formal acquisition completes the combination of the two creative organizations into a single nonprofit after they have worked in tandem since the formation of MakerSphere in 2019.

“While this is the result of many months of deliberation we rejoice in our decision to now have this wonderful community-supported asset under the MakerSphere umbrella” said MakerSphere board Chair John Bauer. “Due to Covid restrictions we cannot host a grand opening at this time. However visit our website for more information on remote classes and studio rentals.”

MakerSphere is located on Foundry Street with studio space for rent. The center is dedicated to an array of creative and artistic programs and classes for all ages with instructors from the local arts and maker community.

Seminary Arts founder Mame McKee has been part of the core group that established MakerSphere. The Seminary Arts space on Hollow Road in Waterbury Center has been a satellite MakerSphere location with a focus on pottery ceramics fiber arts and woodworking.

“I am thrilled the programs of Seminary Arts now go forward to grow and evolve within MakerSphere” McKee said in the merger announcement.

“The very dedicated and hardworking board of directors has been great to work with during the transition. I am very excited for the art and making opportunities that are developing in our region.”

McKee said she will remain involved as programs continue now as one organization. “I look forward to being a perpetual student and occasional teacher” she said.

The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted MakerSphere and Seminary Arts over the past 10 months to shift programming from in-person instruction to virtual formats. That continues with online registration for classes at makerspherevt.com.",,,,,,,,,,,,

By David A. F. Sweet

Long before races — such as today’s Daytona 500 — became televised spectacles featuring professional drivers whose livelihoods are tied to their steering wheels amateur sportsmen competed against each other in the United States and Europe laying the foundation for today’s accomplishments on asphalt.

Fred Wacker Jr. was one of those pioneers. He raced in the 24 Hours of Le Mans participated in the inaugural General Peron Argentine Grand Prix on the streets of Buenos Aires and compiled more than a half dozen first-place finishes in his career. The new book Fred Wacker Gentleman Racer 175 pages and published by Henschel HAUS Publishing in Milwaukee vividly describes his exploits and is graced with dozens of photos of Fred dashing around in the fastest cars of the day. Consider it an authoritative look: after all his son Fred Wacker III is a co-author.

Born in Chicago during World War I as a boy Fred Jr. attended the opening of Wacker Drive the city’s iconic roadway named after his grandfather Charles. With his father he watched the Indianapolis 500 in 1932 which likely spurred his love of racing. He later graduated from Hotchkiss and Yale and served in the South Pacific during World War II.

Though Fred Jr. was passionate about cars and motorcycles his father did not embrace his devotion prompting Fred Jr. to keep his motorcycle at a friend’s house in secret. When his parents bought him a clunky car as a gift Fred Jr. traded it in and returned home with a black two-seat 1948 MG with the number 8 painted on the side.

“My dad was rather upset when he saw my little MG for the first time” says Fred Jr. in the book as his father worried his son would get killed in the tiny car. “But after a closer look at the mechanicals under the bonnet his concerns lessened and he came to like it.”

In 1949 Fred Jr. launched his racing career entering the MG at the second Watkins Glen Grand Prix race in New York where he finished ninth. By the time of the 1950 event he had upgraded to a faster car — a Cadillac-powered Allard roadster which became known as the 8-Ball. He captured third.

The next year Fred Jr. joined the team of famous racer and car builder Briggs Cunningham for the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France. Driving as fast as 180 mph and negotiating complicated turns through small villages Fred Jr. and his driving partner George Rand fared well until Rand – whose headlights weren’t working in the dark — crashed on lap 77.

Racing at Le Mans again in 1953 Fred Jr. drove with Phil Hill then a rookie who became one of the best drivers of his generation winning Le Mans three times. Unfortunately as the clutch brakes and engine failed the duo were forced to stop after 115 laps.

Back in the United States Fred Jr. was focused on improving the safety of races. An event in 1952 had shaken him badly. During the Watkins Glen race – where his fastest-qualifying time earned him the pole position — his left fender struck a 7-year-old boy killing him. Accidents like that prompted racing to leave public streets where the crowds stood only feet from the speeding vehicles for tracks which afforded spectators protection.

Fred Jr. was a chief proponent of this switch. After Watkins Glen the racer – then the president of the Sports Car Club of America – worked with Curtis LeMay commander of the Strategic Air Command to craft a solution to improve safety. They ended up scheduling races at air bases across the country.

Closer to home Fred Jr. formed the Chicago Region of the Sports Car Club of America. He and a friend Jim Kimberly of Kimberly-Clark fame flew a small plane over southeastern Wisconsin to scout land for a racetrack. The duo chose Elkhart Lake. They organized three open-road races from 1950-52 with Kimberly winning the inaugural event. The number of cars entered soared by the third year – 238 in 1952 versus 33 in the first race – and about 100000 spectators watched. In 2006 the original country-road course joined Watkins Glen on the National Register of Historic Places.

Fred Jr. suffered one serious accident in his racing career. During the Grand Prix de Suisse in 1953 a Formula One race he had little time to prepare and arrived late. Having never driven the course he was thrown from the car as it flipped and suffered broken ribs and a skull fracture among other injuries. For several weeks he was ensconced in a Swiss hospital.

Despite the crash Fred Jr. was not demurred. The following year he raced in the Italian Grand Prix. But in 1956 he retired. As racing transitioned from a gentleman’s occupation to a full-time pursuit Fred Jr. decided it was more important to have a steady job in the Chicago area.

“His racing career was more of a hobby and a passion. He was a sportsman” explained Fred III. His gracious humble father was also an accomplished musician who loved jazz and ran two bands: Freddie Wacker and the Windy City Seven and later the Fred Wacker Big Band.

How did the book come to be? While cleaning the basement of his parents’ house a number of years ago Fred III came upon a few aging boxes. Upon opening them he found race programs trophies articles from Life magazine and more. They were his father’s mementos from a race-car career.

“I start digging through it and it was a treasure trove” said Fred III who grew up in Lake Bluff at a house filled with kids riding mini bikes outdoors and who crossed the United States on a 1913 Indian motorcycle five years ago.

What to do with all of this memorabilia? Through a friend Fred III got in touch with Robert Birmingham who had written a number of racing books including Augie Pabst Behind the Wheel about the great-great grandson of the beer entrepreneur. Pabst was one of the best sports-car racers of his day.

“After I introduced myself to Bob he said ‘I watched your Dad race when I was a kid. He was a legend’ recalled Fred III about the opening conversation. “I told him about the idea of a book. He said ‘Let’s start tomorrow. I’m 83.’”

The book is a tremendous tribute to Fred Jr. who died in 1998 just short of his 80th birthday. For Fred III who was extremely close with his father and attended dozens of Indianapolis 500s with him this labor of love is a perfect gift for future generations to remember a beloved gentleman racer.

Energy Transfer (ET 1.07%) currently owns one of the largest energy infrastructure businesses in North America. The master limited partnership (MLP) operates a fully integrated franchise that moves oil and gas from the wellhead to market centers. It transports more than 25% of all the natural gas and natural gas liquids produced in the U.S. and 35% of its oil. While this infrastructure is vital to meeting the economy's current energy needs it's starting to transition from fossil fuels to alternative sources like renewable energy.

Energy Transfer needs to join the transition so that it doesn't become extinct. That led it to recently launch an alternative energy group to increase its focus on finding ways to remain relevant as the energy industry shifts fuel sources.

Evolving with the industry

Energy Transfer has already started cleaning up its act in recent years. The company has spent the past decade focused on reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. For example it has installed a dual drive compression system along some of its natural gas pipelines that reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by more than 632000 tons last year alone. The company also recently supported the construction of the Maplewood 2 Solar Project in Texas by signing a power purchase agreement to buy clean power from that site to offset its energy usage. The company also operates more than 18000 solar-powered metering stations across the country. As a result 20% of the electricity it uses comes from renewable energy.

Energy Transfer's new alternative energy group will increase its efforts to find new renewable energy projects. The group will focus on finding opportunities to either purchase power from solar and wind farms or develop projects with third-party operators. Those investments will mainly offset the company's power usage. The company will also look to develop renewable diesel and renewable natural gas opportunities when they make economic sense. These projects would leverage the company's existing pipeline network as it could repurpose some of those assets for renewable fuels.

Taking different approaches

Energy Transfer is the latest fossil fuel-focused company to announce plans to increase its participation in the energy transition. Earlier this month oil giant ExxonMobil (XOM 0.65%) unveiled plans to launch a new business to commercialize its low-carbon technology portfolio. Exxon initially plans to focus on carbon capture and storage projects though the company also said it would consider other opportunities including hydrogen. Exxon plans to invest $3 billion in lower-emission energy projects through 2025. However that's just a drop in the bucket for a company that intends on investing as much as $25 billion per year during that timeframe.

Meanwhile energy infrastructure operator Kinder Morgan (KMI 0.21%) revealed how it's transitioning to the future of energy earlier this year. It's already involved in storing handling and blending liquid renewable transportation fuels like ethanol and biodiesel within its products pipelines and terminals segments. However it sees ripe opportunities for expansion in renewable diesel. Kinder Morgan also believes it can expand into adjacent markets by blending hydrogen into its existing natural gas network and transporting and sequestering carbon dioxide. Meanwhile it sees longer-term potential in hydrogen and renewable diesel production and joining Exxon in the carbon capture market. The company believes that it could convert much of its existing infrastructure network to transport and store the fuels of the future.

Meanwhile other energy companies are taking bolder approaches to capture opportunities in the energy transition. For example Canadian energy infrastructure giant Enbridge (ENB 0.91%) currently gets about 4% of its earnings from renewable energy assets. It operates 22 wind farms seven solar farms six renewable natural gas facilities and a hydrogen facility among other assets. Enbridge expects to invest $2 billion Canadian ($1.6 billion) on building additional offshore wind farms in Europe through 2023 and spend another roughly CA$500 million ($393 million) during that timeframe on self-power renewable energy projects in North America. It has several other renewable energy projects in development and other opportunities like carbon capture and storage projects and those focused on hydrogen and renewable natural gas further down the pipeline.

An important first step

Energy Transfer is putting a greater emphasis on discovering its role in the energy transition. It's starting small by looking at self-powering more of its existing infrastructure with renewable energy and exploring ways to leverage those assets to transport renewable fuels. However with the energy transition accelerating the company will need to do even more. If it doesn't it risks falling behind rivals like Enbridge that are already capturing opportunities to create value for their investors by leading the charge in helping the global economy switch power sources.

The Austin Minnesota-based company known for its meat brands like Spam and Applegate said Thursday it is buying the Planters nut business from Kraft Heinz Co. for $3.35 billion. Included in the deal are Planters brands like Nut-rition Cheez Balls and Corn Nuts.

""The acquisition of the Planters business adds another $1 billion brand to our portfolio and significantly expands our presence in the growing snacking space"" Hormel Chairman President and CEO Jim Snee said in a statement.

The proposed transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2021.

Kraft CEO Miguel Patricio said the sale is a major step in the company's transformation. Patricio said the company plans to reinvest in products that have more growth opportunity like Lunchables and P3 protein packs.

Kraft Heinz which was formed in a 2015 merger has been struggling as customers increasingly seek fresh minimally processed foods. It has also had trouble differentiating its products from cheaper store brands.

In 2019 it slashed the value of its Oscar Meyer and Kraft brands and took an impairment charge because of the falling value of brands like Maxwell House and Velveeta. Last year it sold its natural cheese business including its Cracker Barrel brand to French dairy company Lactalis Group for $3.2 billion.

But Kraft Heinz also saw stronger retail sales last year as customers stocked up during the pandemic. The company said Thursday its net revenue grew 4.8 per cent to $26.2 billion last year. That beat Wall Street's estimates according to a poll of analysts by FactSet. Kraft Heinz also beat its fourth-quarter earnings expectations.

Hormel reports its fiscal first-quarter results next week. For the 2020 fiscal year which ended in October its sales rose one per cent to $9.6 billion.

Under the agreement Kraft Heinz will sell its Corn Nuts production facility in Fresno California and Planters production facilities in Fort Smith Arkansas and Suffolk Virginia to Hormel.

Kraft Heinz and Hormel shares were flat in premarket trading.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbHBoYXN0cmVldC5jb20vZWFybmluZ3MtY2FsZW5kYXItZm9yLXRoZS13ZWVrLW9mLWZlYnJ1YXJ5LTE1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earnings calendar for the week of February 15,"The benchmark indexes mostly stayed on an upward trajectory before edging down towards the end of the week indicating that the excitement surrounding the stimulus bill and vaccination drive has probably slowed down.

Setting a new record the Dow Jones Industrial Average remained above the psychologically significant 31000-mark but ended Thursday’s session lower. Following a similar pattern the S&P 500 Index made modest gains and reached a new peak mid-week before paring a part of the gains in the following session.

Meanwhile COVID-related filings for unemployment benefit remained elevated last week resulting in first-time claims of about 793000 which was above economists’ prediction.

Elsewhere Israel-based online marketplace Fiverr acquired New York-headquartered creative network Working not Working for an undisclosed amount. Hormel Foods the company behind several popular food brands this week gobbled up Kraft Heinz Company’s snack nut portfolio Planters in a deal worth $3.4 billion. In another major deal gaming giant Electronic Arts agreed to buy Glu Mobile for $2.1 billion.

With the earnings season entering the final phase the coming week will be a lean period for Wall Street in terms of financial releases. Drug store chain CVS Health Co. which is set for a mass COVID vaccination drive is schedule to unveil fourth-quarter numbers on February 16 before the opening bell. The only other major companies reporting in the holiday-shortened week are Analog Devices and Baidu are – February 17. The typically busy Thursday will see muted activity.

Investors’ attention was mostly focused on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo this week amid speculations about their fiscal performance in the final months of 2020 after staying resilient to the pandemic thus far. The soft drink giants published stronger-than-expected earnings mid-week.

In a sign that Canadian cannabis firms have a long way to go before achieving sustainable growth market leader Canopy Growth Tuesday reported a wider loss for the most recent quarter. Aurora Cannabis which unveiled results on Thursday also reported a loss.

The other major firms to have published earnings in the last few days include Cisco and Twitter – Thursday. General Motors reported Wednesday and the next day Walt Disney came out with a surprise profit for the first quarter.

Are the odds in their favor?” noted that “chemical recycling is attracting billions in capital spending but environmentalists don’t think it will solve the plastic waste problem.”

This isn’t news. Consumers and especially anti-plastics activists have lost faith in the plastic industry’s ability to help solve a problem it has been accused of creating and the slow pace of advanced recycling technologies aka chemical recycling hasn’t helped renew confidence that this will be the silver bullet that will rid the world of plastic waste. But attempts continue unabated and the cost of trying is proving to be extremely high.

Even the pace of adoption of various types of plastic from recyclable traditional plastics such as PET and HDPE to bioplastics as alternatives to traditional plastics seems extremely slow. The chemical recycling industry also has taken hits as noted above. For example the CEN/ACS paper opened by saying that in 2022 “Mondelez International intends to start packaging its Philadelphia brand cream cheese in a tube made from chemically recycled plastics. The packaging maker Berry Global will mold the containers. Petrochemical giant Sabic will supply the polypropylene. And the start-up Plastic Energy will produce feedstock for that polypropylene from postconsumer plastics at a plant it is constructing on Sabic’s site in Geleen Netherlands.”

We’re not holding our collective breaths.

For at least a decade I’ve written blogs about the many consumer brand owners such as Kraft Heinz Mondelez and Nestlé being pressured by anti-plastics activist group As You Sow to find alternatives to single-use plastic packaging as a means to end plastic waste in the environment. Through shareholder proposals As You Sow keeps applying the pressure writing about the continued lack of progress these companies are making and the slow pace of adoption of alternative materials most of which are no “greener” than plastics when you examine their life-cycle analyses. Still to appease these activist groups big brand owners keep promising to find the Holy Grail of recycling that will turn mountains of plastic trash into beautifully pure new plastic or millions of gallons of fuel and other base chemicals from which to make new plastics.

Promises promises.

The CEN/ACS report is correct when it says that Mondelez “isn’t the only multinational firm promising a high-profile business to start-ups some of which haven’t even built their first recycling plants yet. Food beverage and consumer product companies — under fire to do something about mounting plastic waste — are clamoring to set up relationships like [Mondelez Berry and Sabic]. They have embraced chemical recycling as a means of incorporating renewable content without the performance compromises common with current recycling methods. Seeing a market recycling companies will spend billions of dollars on recycling projects in the US and Europe in the 2020s.”

An announcement from recycler Agilyx Corp. applauded the National Recycling Strategy announced by the US Environmental Protection Agency touting the “significant progress in domestic investment in the US recycling system. In the past three years 64 projects in mechanical and advanced recycling in the US have been announced valued at $5.3 billion according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC). Together these projects have the potential to divert more than four million metric tons of waste from landfills each year. In addition many companies have made significant commitments to use recycled plastics in their packaging and products” said Agilyx’s announcement of support.

Many of the announced projects for chemical recycling facilities that I’ve written about over the past five years are at this point dead in the water. Some have been limping along for two decades still unable to take in any significant amount of plastic waste to produce commercially viable amounts of fuel chemicals or new plastic. Yet new announcements for chemical recycling facilities pop up in my inbox like dandelions on a spring lawn announcing large investments and making even grander promises of helping solve the plastic waste crisis.

For example Virginia Governor Ralph Northam announced on June 2 2020 that Braven Environmental a company that uses pyrolysis technology to derive fuel from landfill-bound plastic will invest $31.7 million to establish a manufacturing operation in Cumberland County. Virginia successfully competed with North Carolina and South Carolina for the project.

Northam boasted of the “well-paid job opportunities” for the citizens of Cumberland County and the company’s contribution to lessening Virginia’s environmental footprint. Braven received a $150000 grant from the Commonwealth Opportunity Fund to assist Cumberland County with the project. The Virginia Tobacco Region revitalization commission approved $65000 in Tobacco Region Opportunity Funds for the project and funding and services to support the company’s employee training activities will be provided through the Virginia Jobs Investment Program. Braven plans to create a total of over 80 new jobs within 18 months of the first phase of this project. (Read the article PlasticsToday published about this project.)

Virginia’s chemical recycling bills a “step backwards.”

A January 26 2021 report in the online newsletter Blue Virginia criticized two plastics “chemical recycling” bills in the Virginia Assembly saying that these bills “represent a step backwards” for Virginia’s climate and public health. SB1164 and HB 2173 are “rapidly moving forward” in the current session and “represent textbook examples of ‘greenwashing’” according to Blue Virginia.

HB 2173 Advanced Recycling defines advanced recycling as a “manufacturing process for the conversion of post-use polymers and recovered feedstocks into basic hydrocarbon raw materials and other material.” The bill also defines “gasification” “post-use polymers” and other terms related to advanced recycling. SB 1164 is also an advanced recycling bill with the same definition as HB 2173 but adding that advanced recycling is “not considered waste management.”

In an attempt to find out if there is any connection between the two bills in the Virginia Assembly and the proposed construction of the Braven Environmental facility I called the Economic Development Authority (EDA) and left messages requesting a progress report on the Braven facility. An assistant at the EDA office said she passed my message along to two other people. Attempts to reach those individuals were unsuccessful. No returned phone calls were received.

All that is being received are promises and commitments. We’re still waiting for the big cleanup to begin.

University researchers pick up the ball.

As some of the world’s largest companies brand owners and Big Oil pour resources into chemical recycling to counter the image of “plastic polluters” another group is also hard at work in its labs — academe.

For example Steven Crossley an associate professor at the University of Oklahoma School of Chemical Biological and Materials Engineering was recently awarded a four-year $2-million collaborative grant by the Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation program of the National Science Foundation to advance polymer recycling technologies in hopes of sending fewer multi-layer plastics to landfills. Crossley's is the latest in a number of ongoing projects in academic settings trying to solve the problem.

Recycling the announcement noted has its challenges and the big one is “for researchers to design a process that allows more of the plastics we use in our everyday lives to end up in our recycle bins rather than the local landfill. But not only does this require scientists to design innovative ways to break down these various types of plastic it also must be economical for the plastic producers and recyclers.”

Another challenge to recycling — especially mechanical recycling — involves the impurities that accompany recyclate to the recycling facility. “Impurities such as food and drink in the bottom of a plastic container . . . are difficult to eliminate and once melted down degrade the quality of the recycled material” said the university.

Steven Crossley of the University of Oklahoma School of Chemical Biological and Materials Engineering is leading a chemical recycling project exploring the use of catalysts to neutralize impurities in recyclate.

That’s where Crossley’s work comes into play. “But what if” he asks “we could design catalysts that target and convert those impurities to either make them more compatible with the rest of the plastic or convert them selectively to carbon dioxide or light gases that could easily be removed producing a pure stream of higher value.”

Crossley’s research group’s efforts will be complemented by computational simulations led by Associate Professor Bin Wang and experimental efforts in a scaled-up continuous system led by Professor Lance Lobban. Both researchers work in the School of Chemical Biological and Materials Engineering at the University of Oklahoma (OU).

As we all know recycling requires the mass participation of consumers actually putting their recyclable items into a recycling bin. As recyclers like to say: “We can’t recycle it if we can’t get our hands on it.” So in addition to upgrading mixed plastic waste streams using catalysts Adam Feltz associate professor of psychology at OU “will incorporate public perception surveys to determine how best to motivate appropriate public participation in plastic waste collection systems.”

That’s certainly one angle I never thought of — a clean and beautiful environment isn’t enough “motivation” for consumers to put their recyclable plastic (and other materials) into the recycling system. We need a psychologist on the team to determine what needs to happen in peoples’ minds to actually motivate them to put recyclable items in a recycling bin.

Talk about “giving it the old college try!”

Supply of recycled plastics fails to meet demand.

The CEN/ACS report cited the “deep skepticism” surrounding the various chemical recycling methods from groups such as Greenpeace and GAIA (Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives) which both have expressed doubt in recent papers that chemical recycling will ever be viable. In GAIA’s report “All Talk and No Recycling: An Investigation of the US ‘Chemical Recycling’ Industry” the group “alleges that the plastics and fossil-fuel industries are promoting chemical recycling ‘as the silver bullet to solve the plastic crisis.’”

The ACC reports that the demand for recycled plastics is increasing to meet brand owners’ sustainability goals. But will there be enough recycled material to meet that demand? The CEN/ACS report said that it’s doubtful. Given the size of the plastic waste problem and the “big commitments of consumer product companies” there are also big opportunities. However meeting demand won’t be easy. Agliyx CEO Tim Stedman told CEN/ACS that his company would “need to build more than 20 plants with 100 tons per day of capacity to meet a target of 30% recycled content in polystyrene packaging in North America and Europe which half the market has already committed to.”

Have consumer products companies over-committed in their “sustainable” promises? People in the industry who commented for the CEN/ACS report say absolutely like Berry’s Robert Flores VP of Sustainability: “There is actually not currently enough [recycled material] out there to meet all those goals quite frankly.”

The CEN/ACS report concludes what most of us in the industry already know and that is despite the demand “environmentalists say the first chemical recycling projects are having difficulty getting off the ground.” Noting the Greenpeace report “Deception by the Numbers” released last September 52 projects were analyzed. These projects make up the $4.8 billion investment figure cited by the ACC. Greenpeace estimates that a third of these projects are not likely to be viable. From my own research over the past several years I think one-third is a bit optimistic.

But that’s the way science operates. Failure is part of the game. Trial and error is the way advances in science are made and there are a few chemical recycling plants in operation that are seeing some measure of success in actually producing fuels and chemicals from the plastic waste they collect from various municipalities. But as they tell me — and as Agilyx’s CEO points out to CEN/ACS — there’s not nearly enough capacity to make a dent in the waste being generated.

PlasticsToday has run numerous articles and blogs regarding the problems being encountered by entrepreneurial start-ups that appear to be good at finding investors but not so great at making any real progress in eliminating plastic waste. CEN/ACS’s report mentions Loop Industries toward the end noting the promises and commitments that company has made over the past three years. We all know the situation Loop Industries has found itself in.

I think that the sub-headline in the CEN/ACS report says it best: “Chemical recycling is attracting billions in capital spending but environmentalists don’t think it will solve the plastic waste problem.”

It’s up to these companies to prove the environmentalists wrong — and they should do so sooner rather than later.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9ydW0uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F1c3Rpbi1taW5uLWlzLW5vdy1tYWpvci1wbGF5ZXItaW4tcGVhbnV0LWJ1c2luZXNzLXdpdGgtaG9ybWVscy1iaWctYnV5LW9mLXBsYW50ZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Austin Minn. is now 'major player in peanut business' with Hormel's big buy of Planters,"AUSTIN Minn. — It’s a party at Hormel Foods these days in the wake of its $3 billion acquisition of the Planters peanuts Cheez Balls and Corn Nuts brands its largest ever deal.

Jim Sheehan Hormel’s executive vice president and chief financial officer said adding the Planters snack brands to Hormel’s meat trays Chi-Chi’s chips and salsas Hormel Chili and Hormel Pepperoni means that soon Austin Minnesota's Fortune 500 company will dominate any gathering like a Super Bowl party.

“Now that we have the nut section you could have a complete social event and never buy a product outside of Hormel’s brand” he said.

This deal which is expected to close in the second quarter shows Hormel’s hunger for the ""high-growth area of snacking” according to Sheehan.

“Snacking is significant. This will give us a number brand in the nut category” he added.

This adds more non-meats to Hormel’s portfolio. When this deal is done 25% of its retail sales will be of non-meat products.

Of course Hormel still has a meaty center with its more than 80-year-old Spam product line which despite its age has been racking up record sales for the past seven years.

The Planters brand has an almost 100% recognition with consumers but Hormel wants to breathe some new life into it. Hormel first identified Planters as a possible acquisition at a strategy meeting in 2016. Talks with the Kraft Heinz Co. about buying Planters started before the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020.

While Hormel is known for regularly buying popular brands in the grocery aisles this deal is on a much larger scale than any it has ever done. In the past five years it has spent a total of $3 billion buying up small companies.

“This is a goal we’ve had for a long time. … to make a very impactful acquisition in the 3 to 4 billion range” said Sheehan. “The genesis of this goes back when we bought Skippy. … We’re an important player in the peanut business.”

Hormel believes that legacy brands such as Planters or even Spam can be preserved while also being updated and expanded. The company has been working to create new products such as Skippy squeeze peanut butter and its plant-based Happy Little Plants line. Rapid innovation is part of the company’s overall strategy.

Of the all products that Hormel sold in 2020 15% of them did not exist in 2017.

Adding Planters to its collection of brands won’t spur any direct changes at the Austin production facilities but Sheehan said it will benefit Austin.

“We are very committed to the community that we are in and this will make us a stronger member of the community” he said. “All of a sudden Austin Minn. is not only a major player with Spam chili and pepperoni. It is now a major player in the peanut business.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MyNC5jb20vbmV3czI0L2JpLWFyY2hpdmUvcHJpbmdsZXMtc3VwZXJib3dsLWFkLWZpbG1lZC1pbi1jYXBlLXRvd24tMjAyMS0y0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pringles' Super Bowl ad featuring frustrated astronauts was filmed in Cape Town,"Among the crop of this year's funniest Super Bowl ads is a Pringles commercial shot in South Africa with local actors.

The ad features two astronauts who fail to draw the attention of Mission Control and a passing ship whose crews are distracted by constructing Pringles' stacks.

South Africans - including local dogs - have featured in popular Super Bowl ads in recent years.

This year’s crop of funniest Super Bowl advertisements features a Pringles ad that was filmed in Cape Town.

The National Football League’s Super Bowl championship – held on the first Sunday in February - is a massive television event in the US and a showcase for the best ads of the world’s biggest brands.

Super Bowl ads cost advertisers upwards of $5 million (more than R70 million) for 30 seconds – and that’s before the massive budgets for the ads themselves.

The Pringles ad features two astronauts back from a space mission stranded in the ocean on a lunar pod.

They repeatedly fail to draw the attention of both Mission Control – as well as a passing ship – because both crews are distracted by constructing stacks of different flavoured Pringles chips trying to find the optimum combination.

Watch the ad here:

The ad was produced by global advertising agency Grey Group and South African Cuanan Cronwright who is a group creative director at Grey New York was a creative lead on the project. Cronwright was creative group head at Ogilvy and Mather in Cape Town until 2014 when he moved to the US.

The ad was filmed in Cape Town harbour as well as Granger Bay and Goodwood. One of the astronauts is played by South African actor Waldemar Schultz who starred in the SABC soap 7de Laan as well as in other productions like The Kissing Booth and TV series Die Byl.

Schultz also featured in another South African production that was a hit ad at the Super Bowl – the 2016 Heinz ad that featured a stampede of Dachshund dogs dressed up as Heinz condiments.

In 2019 South African Melusi Mhlungu wrote a Kraft-Heinz's Super Bowl commercial for their Devour frozen food which quickly went rival.

Food giants Walmart Costco and Kroger – which together totalled net sales worth more than half a trillion dollars last year – are selling Brazilian beef products imported from JBS the world’s largest meat company which has been linked to deforestation.

Brazilian beef has been identified as a key driver of deforestation in the Amazon where swathes of forest are cleared for pasture used for cattle farming. The Amazon is a crucial buffer in stabilising the regional and global climate. Experts say preserving the world’s rainforests is essential if further intensification of the climate emergency is to be averted.

Research by the Guardian the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the nonprofit data analysis agency C4ADS established that in recent years the JBS subsidiary Sampco Inc has imported thousands of tonnes of Brazilian beef destined for grocery chains and other food companies into the US.



The products include shredded and canned (corned) beef as well as frozen meat and steaks. In December Sampco-branded shredded beef produced in a JBS factory in São Paulo was being sold online by both Walmart and Costco and shipping data pinpoints JBS exports of Brazilian corned beef being supplied for sale in Kroger stores.

Between July 2017 and November 2019 Sampco imported more than 5000 consignments of Brazilian beef products totalling 7884 tonnes records obtained by C4ADS show.

Responding to these findings campaigners called on the grocery chains to take swift action to rid supply chains of deforestation-linked products.



“Supermarkets need to go beyond their sustainability rhetoric by setting strict requirements for their suppliers banning deforestation monitoring their suppliers for compliance and dropping contracts with the worst offenders like JBS” said Lucia von Reusner senior campaign director of international campaign organisation Mighty Earth.



Costco declined to answer questions but pointed to its sustainability policies which state: “Our intent is not to source beef from high-risk deforestation regions until comprehensive traceability and monitoring systems are in place.”

A Walmart spokesperson said: “Walmart takes these allegations seriously and will review the claims made. We believe healthy forests sustain biodiversity support livelihoods and play an important role in mitigating climate change. Walmart is working with suppliers on certification monitoring supporting sustainable sourcing regions promoting collaborative action and advocating for effective policy.”

A spokesperson for Kroger said: “We take deforestation seriously as demonstrated by our no-deforestation commitment and continue to engage our suppliers in pursuit of this commitment and to ensure no deforestation is happening in our relevant supply chains.”



JBS beef exports have been linked to farms involved in up to 115 sq miles (300 sq km) of deforestation a year. The company slaughters almost 35000 cattle a day in Brazil.



A JBS spokesperson said: “The spurious allegation that JBS exports are linked to deforestation is irresponsible and based on flawed superficial analysis of the correlation between the concentration of deforestation at municipality level and the location of our plants. Correlation is not causation.”

Campaigners said the latest revelations highlighted the urgent need for US laws that combat deforestation. To date there has not been any significant proposal in the US for federal legislation outlawing agricultural imports linked to tropical deforestation unlike in Britain and the EU where momentum for new rules has recently gathered pace.

“The US is complicit in driving global deforestation through its sales of beef products from Brazil” said Sarah Lake Mighty Earth’s vice-president and director for Latin America. “The Biden administration has an opportunity to advance legislation to restrict the import of products linked to deforestation just as the EU the UK and France are already doing.”

Brian Schatz Democratic senator for Hawaii said before the Covid pandemic that he planned to introduce such legislation. And last week a bill was introduced to the California state assembly that would require contractors supplying products to the state to ensure they are not linked to deforestation overseas.

LITTLE ROCK Arkansas — Snowfall is set to hit central Arkansas by Sunday afternoon. People in the area have been packing grocery stores ahead of the winter weather storm. One Kroger's parking lot was filled to capacity with lines of people waiting Saturday.

Trying to get ahead of Valentine's Day Cedric Vaughn who was shopping for his special lady and his nieces said the store was crazy busy with lines on people on every row of the cash registers.

""I'm actually stopping out to get the lady something and I ran into the crazy line that's in there. No parking spaces available and of course I'm assuming every place is totally full"" said Vaughn.

""Get what you need because you never know how long you're going to be stuck with the weather that we have. I've seen people take you know staples bread cold cuts soft drinks milk cereal. Those types of items"" said David.

His son Devin Hall who helps his father run the business says they haven't had any great rise or fall being a smaller business.

Anna is a 15-year-old who often found herself on the frontlines of the 2019 pro-democracy protests and unrest. Peter Tsang Yu-hung now a 70-year-old retiree was arrested for illegal assembly in 1967 when he was 16 and sentenced to a year behind bars.

Over the past half-century Hong Kong has gone from being a British colony to a Chinese Special Administrative Region that many fear is destined to become just another mainland city.

The younger generation has become increasingly outspoken against Beijing. A survey by the University of Hong Kong in 2016 found that those aged 18-39 tend to vote for pro-democracy parties whilst older groups are more likely to support the pro-Beijing side.

Anna – full name withheld – crosses her arms in an attempt to cover a temporary “STANDWITHHK” tattoo on her forearm. Before the protests broke out she was a regular teenager who spent most of her time hanging out with friends – she shyly admits that she misses those times. “I really wish that could happen but it’s not possible right now. I don’t really care about that anymore. I am more concerned about the future of Hong Kong.”

She says the immediate goal of the protests was for the government to consider the five demands of the protesters including the withdrawal of the extradition bill and an inquiry into police violence. The ultimate goal according to her was independence – albeit far on the horizon. Peter shakes his head violently: “Beijing will never give up Hong Kong this is definite. There is no bargaining.”

Anna remains unfazed and hopeful. She believes that when younger generations grow up and replace those currently in government Hong Kong can be reformed. “We will be able to change Hong Kong one day; it’s just not now.”

In May 1967 protests broke out at an artificial flower factory in San Po Kong where 325 labourers were fired. The next day when sacked workers returned to the factory to negotiate compensation with the management the police showed up. A private labour dispute escalated into city-wide strikes and protests culminating in bomb attacks and several murders.

“They tried to show their loyalty to Beijing to do some revolutionary patriotic thing in Hong Kong” says Gary Cheung the author of Hong Kong’s Watershed: The 1967 Riots. He believes the reasons for the protests were more political than economic. It was a spillover of the Cultural Revolution from mainland China which was enduring political turmoil under Mao Zedong. “Beijing was happy to see some anti-British protests but I don’t think Beijing leadership really seriously considered to take back Hong Kong at that time” he adds.

The riots lasted for five months during which at least 51 people died. The final straw came when two young siblings were killed by a street bomb wrapped like a present near their home in North Point in August 1967. Today the violent episode is rarely mentioned as part of Hong Kong history. The riots effectively ruined the reputation of leftists in Hong Kong. “They are resented by mainstream society” Cheung says.

However a number of those who took part in 1967 still believe that what they did was correct even patriotic. “That’s why they still have bitterness” Cheung said. The leftists believe they received unfair treatment and their actions were misunderstood by the public.

On the other hand the 2019 protests were supported by 59 per cent of Hongkongers according to a survey by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (PORI) in December 2019.

“My father loved China very much indeed however he advised me to stay calm” Peter says recalling the events of 1967. “But a boy of 16 you know…when the dispute started we put away our books.”

Peter and his friends organised rallies in the schoolyard at which they waved Chinese flags and denounced the British government. On December 3 1967 he was sentenced to a year in jail for illegal assembly. “My father was very angry my mother was very sad. I was the only son and I destroyed my life.”

The riots in 1967.

Peter pulls out photos from the day he was released from jail. His school threw him a welcome back party. He poses for a group photo with 20 or so classmates who had also been arrested.

He looks solemnly serious tall for a 17-year-old.

What he could not have imagined back then was that some 50 years later Hong Kong would undergo another massive social movement. This time around some of those involved in the events of 1967 no longer agree with the act of protest. Some 91 per cent of those aged 14- 29 opposed the controversial extradition bill that sparked the months-long protests in 2019. Amongst those aged 65 or older only 47 per cent opposed the bill according to research conducted by PORI and the Project Citizen Foundation in 2019.

Peter says that back in the day they protested because they loved their country and wanted the foreign government gone; now the young protest because they hate their country. He raises his hands in despair his eyes puzzled and concerned. “You love your mother you love your father you love your country. There is a reason for every love and every hate. What is the reason for this hate?”

File photo: Teele Rebane.

“They are trying to force us to change ourselves” Anna responds “It’s not about right or wrong; it’s about having the right to choose your own thoughts.”

The first protest Anna attended was on June 12 2019 the day of the second reading of the bill which would have allowed extradition to mainland China. A citywide strike had been called and people gathered in Tamar Park for “picnics” – a euphemism for civic gatherings. Anna attended simply because she felt she had to. Clashes soon broke out between protesters and police and 150 rounds of tear gas were fired.

Peter shakes his head in disappointment: “You are breaking your parents’ hearts.”

Anna says she doesn’t agree with the use of violence by protesters but believes there’s no other way to make the government respond to their demands. She brings up the 1967 riots when violent demonstrations eventually forced the government to speed up the reform of labour laws.

“But right now in 2019 and 2020 nothing changed” Anna says. “I mean everything changed! It got worse!”

On June 30 2020 China imposed on Hong Kong a national security law intended to curb any challenges to the authority of the central government in Beijing. The new security bill effectively put paid to any resumption of the street protests as it outlaws calls for independence or any acts deemed as subversive or separatist.

The grim prospects don’t deter Anna from wanting to be a journalist when she leaves school. Or maybe a politician – she isn’t sure yet. Her biggest concern right now is the future of free speech in Hong Kong. The recent series of events has worried her as has the possible censorship of information.

Peter says he’s not worried as he believes ultimately that the truth cannot be hidden. “Media is very important but facts are facts. Even if you spread fake news spread lies the facts will come out.”

1967 riots.

Anna disagrees. She knows that misinformation spreads like wildfire. Her own father is an avid supporter of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and often shares information disseminated by the party with the family. In fact he told her that the 1967 riots never happened. This disagreement is a constant source of conflict between the two which often leads to fights in the household that last for weeks. “Cold War” periods as Anna calls them.

One such episode has just ended. Anna confronted her father to ask why he chooses to support the CCP despite the 2019 protests and the Covid-19 pandemic first detected in China. He remains strong in his stance citing China’s rapid growth over the past few decades. He feels mainland China has surpassed Hong Kong on the curve of development.

Peter nods eagerly in support. “You say China this China that. How come China nowadays has become so strong?” he asks with a smile.

Anna shrugs it off. She doesn’t think China’s national development is matched by the improvement in the daily life of its people. “You can’t just say that China is bad. It’s not” she says clarifying that she dislikes the Chinese Communist Party but has nothing against the country or its people.

The one thing the pair do agree on is Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam whom they both dislike with a passion. Lam is the city’s most hated chief executive. Hitting historically low approval ratings week by week she has failed to find solid support from either side of the political spectrum. Peter declares that if he were Lam’s husband he would never have let her become Chief Executive.

As they joke about Lam Anna concedes that Peter and she actually want similar things for Hong Kong but hope to achieve them in different ways. “He really loves his country I really love my city” she says.

“Of course my dear!” Peter responds. “I can see the future of Hong Kong when I look at her.”

In the side parking lot of the old Eldorado Casino site in Henderson’s Water Street District lay what’s left of the sign that used to hang on the back entrance of the property.

New ownership is modernizing the building in a $5 million renovation and that starts by sprucing up the exterior with a new blue and yellow paint job landscaping and signage.

The casino closed since last March because of the pandemic will eventually reopen under new ownership. It was purchased from Boyd Gaming in December by DeSimone Gaming which also owns Railroad Pass in Henderson.

The modernization will come with another significant change — the property will be renamed The Pass when it reopens. They anticipate a spring opening pending approval from the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

The new name is a nod to a cross-pollination marketing effort with Railroad Pass but also an effort to stand apart since an assortment of other casinos around the country including one in Reno already claim the Eldorado name.

“As Boyd said in its press release when the sale was announced the (Eldorado) was a nonessential asset for Boyd but it’s going to be a very essential asset for me” said Joe DeSimone the company’s owner and operator.

It is eerily quiet at the shuttered property which opened in 1961 and is a favorite of longtime Henderson residents on this afternoon as owner DeSimone walks through.

He points to a bay of outdated slot machines and says they will be replaced. He looks over blueprints showing more changes including an $800000 sports book upgrade and new banquet room. They will also bring back table games to become the only downtown Henderson property with a casino pit.

The new offerings include an “upscale” Italian restaurant and a 24-hour café that will be named after his daughter Emelia.

There were be a shuttle taking patrons between the two properties which are about seven miles apart. They will also share the same rewards club.

“It’s going to be busy in here all hours of the day once we open” he said. “That’s the goal. It’s going to be fun.”

The building is wedged between the new Lifeguard Arena — headquarters for the minor league Henderson Silver Knights — and the Rainbow Club casino. The arena will also host youth hockey events to bring many visitors to the area some of whom will stumble into the property.

That’s especially true because just steps away from the arena is a 500-space parking garage that came with the transaction of the casino. DeSimone doesn’t plan to charge casino patrons to park.

“Having the Eldorado property reopened is only going to reinvigorate that area and play off the arena” said Michelle Romero a Henderson councilwoman whose district encompasses Water Street.

Future upgrades could include a hotel tower which would give the property the lone hotel rooms in downtown. It would be perfect for families in town for youth hockey at the arena.

“Depending on the needs downtown that could be an option” DeSimone said. “People are spending money down here and I think that’s only going to continue. There’s momentum here.”

A real estate developer by trade — he owns First Federal Realty in Henderson — DeSimone said he took an immediate liking to the casino industry after purchasing Railroad Pass from MGM Resorts International in 2015.

He rattles off names of some of the most well-known executives in Las Vegas gaming — Kirk Kerkorian Sheldon Adelson and new Las Vegas Sands CEO Rob Goldstein — and says they give him inspiration.

He lauded companies like Boyd and MGM saying “Nevada should be proud to have them” but said an independent casino operator can sometimes bring a certain hands-on mentality that a big company might not be able to. That’s how he operates his properties.

“Those are wonderful companies to deal with” DeSimone said. “But having a small-businessperson with the flexibility and capital and motivation necessary to liven up a place that makes sense. We don’t have the overhead or obligations that a Strip hotel has. I try to talk to my employees at Railroad Pass every day and I listen to them.”

Soon new signs will be hung outside the building to further usher in a new era. DeSimone is confident it will remain a locals favorite calling his plans a perfect fit for Water Street.

Jon Mast CEO of the Manatee-Sarasota Building Industry Association said this year’s event will feature 86 single-family homes and nine communities. The three featured developments are Lakewood Ranch The Islands on Manatee River and North River Ranch.

Many of the area's top builders are participating including Neal Communities Taylor Morrison Meridian WCI/Lennar Medallion Stock Development John Cannon David Weekley M/I Homes DR Horton Pulte and Toll Brothers.

New this year is a custom home division featuring two distinctive homes and two entries in the remodelers’ category. A total of 46 subcontractors’ work will be on display. In all over 140 properties will be featured Mast said.

Model homes from Parrish to North Port and Englewood are open during the annual Parade of Homes event. Builders also compete for awards with judging occurring Feb. 20 after a Realtor preview on Feb. 17.

The winners will be announced at the parade’s socially distanced “Awards and Gala” event March 4 at the Hyatt Regency Sarasota. COVID-19 social distancing protocols mean that only about 150 people will be able to attend the gala compared to 380 in years past Mast said.

The popular parade is a self-guided tour of properties that extends through March 14. Most models in the Parade of Homes are open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday and from noon to 5 p.m. on Sunday. The MSBIA suggests calling the models to check on times. Model phone numbers are listed on the individual model pages in the Parade of Homes guide and on the Parade of Homes website.

Low interest rates and a seemingly endless supply of retiring baby boomers are fueling the housing market in Southwest Florida. Mast said a sellers’ market continues in the area and nationwide leading to an overwhelming demand for homes.

“Some builders are hitting the pause button on sales so the parade's hitting at an odd time because prices and materials continue to rise"" he said. ""It's a good time to be in the business whether you're a Realtor or a builder. But it's really a seller's market at this point because there's so many buyers that want to buy.”

Prices are up nationwide and in Southwest Florida. According to CoreLogic single-family home prices in the North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton Metropolitan Statistical Area increased 7.57% in November compared with November 2019. Prices were up 0.68% from October’s values.

The median sales price for a single-family home in Sarasota County surged 19% to $349695 up from $293750 in November 2019. The average sales price was $541339 up from $409733 in November 2019 a 32.1% increase.

Manatee County experienced more modest increases both in median and average sales prices in November. The median single-family sales price of $350500 was up 7.2% from $327000 a year ago.

Real estate analysts expect the trend to continue despite economic difficulties and unemployment caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Two of the area’s communities made a national best-sellers list and the Sarasota area continues to garner attention as a top retirement destination.

Lakewood Ranch in Manatee and Sarasota counties and Wellen Park in North Port were ranked No. 2 and No. 4 respectively on John Burns Real Estate Consulting and the RCLCO lists of the 50 top-selling master-planned communities in the country.

Lakewood Ranch ranked second in the nation with 2149 home sales in 2020 up 30% from the 1648 sold in 2019. The 33000-acre community features miles of trails and paths parks offering a disc golf course watercraft launches and dog parks along with nationally recognized sports venues like the Premier Sports Campus and the Sarasota Polo Club.

Wellen Park formerly known as the West Villages ranked fourth just behind Summerlin in Las Vegas. Wellen Park recorded 1415 home sales in 2020 up 11% from 1273 sold in 2019.

Sarasota also was named the Best Place to Retire by U.S. News & World Report for 2020-21 and the 16th Best Place to Live.

Lennon was famous for his sharp tongue. Although he often explained his comments away as dry humour they often had a harsh bite and were sometimes a little cruel. In 1965 Jones was a young aspiring star enjoying his first hit on the charts It's Not Unusual. He was not expecting the biggest pop star in the world to insult him when they met backstage on the TV show Thank Your Lucky Stars but he was ready to fight back. And Elvis was very impressed when he heard the story later.

Jones said: ""I was doing Thank Your Lucky Stars. I had It’s Not Unusual out my first hit record in 1965. The Beatles were on the show. ""I went to watch them rehearse in the afternoon. I’m sitting there where the audience would be later on with my manager Gordon Mills. I’m waiting for The Beatles to come on; I want to watch them rehearse you know. ""John Lennon was the first one out on the floor and he looks up at me you know and he’s got the guitar and he says (to the tune of It’s Not Unusual) 'It’s not a unicorn it’s an elephant.'""

A few years afterward the Welsh star described the moment to Elvis. The pair became close friends when they both had various residences in Las Vegas during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Elvis had famously fallen out with Lennon the only time they met also in 1965. They had completely opposing views of the Vietnam war - the Beatle was a lifelong and very vocal pacifist while Elvis had proudly done his military service in Germany. Elvis even lobbied President Nixon to have Lennon thrown out of America. Jones' manager in Vegas Chris Hutchins had also been the man who set up the Beatles' meeting with The King so he was aware of the history. He described what happened when the subject of Lennon came up one night.

Hutchins recalled how Elvis said: ""He (Lennon) should’ve been kicked out long ago.” Apparently Jones replied: ""I had a run-in with him myself. He made some smart remark at a TV studio in England where we were appearing on the show Thank Your Lucky Stars. I wanted to take him outside and see what sort of hiding his intellect would stand.""

Jones was stopped from retaliating back in 1965 by his manager. He explained: ""Gordon Mills said 'That’s his sense of humour don’t get (the wrong idea).' Which it was. And then we became friends later on. He was taking the mick or taking the p**s. That was his sense of humour."" Sensing trouble brewing Lennon's bandmate Paul McCartney had also tried to defuse the situation at the time. Jones later added: ""Paul McCartney said to me 'If John Lennon made fun of a song it means he likes it because he wouldn’t make a comment on it if it didn’t strike him.'""

Lisa Marie lost her father when she was only nine years old. She inherited the house where Elvis had doted on her day and night which has since been preserved exactly as it was when The king tragically passed on August 16 1977. Over forty years later fans still suffer intense grief over their idol's death but Lisa Marie has spoken powerfully of trying to deal with losing someone who was at once simply her father but also so much more than that and so much larger than life - as much in private with her as he was on stage.

Elvis remains present in popular culture as much today as ever but Lisa Marie has her own intensely personal and overpowering connection with her father. She said: ""I'm talking about somebody in my eyes that was to me so overwhelmingly grand and powerful – and sometimes dark depending on mood. And there was that for the first nine years of my life. ""Maybe I have been in search of something like that. It's very hard to compete with that in my mind.""

Elvis Presley life and dates

When Benjamin was a little boy of six or seven Lisa Marie bought him Star Wars toys but also collected her own memorabilia including a Darth Vader watch and an action figure which she kept in her office. It may sound like a strange connection but just think about what the entire cinema saga is based around. The original Star Wars films dealt with the orphan Luke searching for his father a shadowy presence who was later revealed to be a dark and overpowering figure. Lisa Marie added at the time: ""I'm sure it's connected in some weird way to the grandness and the bigness of an earlier loss in my life. Some sort of representation of this grand powerful – not dark and evil – but this thing in my life that went away. And maybe it's some twisted f***ing way to try and replace that.""

Sir Cliff remains one of the nation’s most successful singers after selling more than 21.5 million singles in the UK alone. In the UK Single Chart he is the third best selling artist – falling behind The Beatles who are at the top and Elvis Presley in second. Sir Cliff has had 130 singles albums and EPs reach the UK Top 20 which is more than any other artist during more than six decades in the music industry. Last year he also made history by becoming the first musician to have a UK Top 5 album in eight consecutive decades.

“It’s ridiculous! Has everyone forgotten me?

There’s room for everyone.” Sir Cliff later admitted that Mr Gormley “was absolutely right” and “The Beatles’ success was a daft thing” for him to “get het [sic] up about”. DON'T MISS

In earlier years Sir Cliff had been more supportive of The Beatles and when they met for the first time at a house party in 1963 they shared a joke about their rivalry. Sir Cliff recalled: “John Lennon was very funny and asked me to delay releasing my next single to give their follow-up to Please Please Me a chance.” Before the Imagine singer’s death in 1980 he also said: “Before Cliff and the Shadows there had been nothing worth listening to in British music.” In later years Sir Paul confessed that “the main reason” The Beatles went to Hamburg Germany was because of Sir Cliff. He said: “Cliff and The Shadows had got everything sewn up in Britain.”

Well for whatever reason it worked for them… They were tremendous.” In the Sixties they came to blows when trying to record new material – Sir Cliff was working on his Good News and The Beatles on Magical Mystery Tour. He said: “They are forever associated with Abbey Road studio two. “Yet amusingly Paul McCartney told me they always felt that I was EMI’s favourite and they could only use it if I wasn't’ there.”

Sir Paul told him: “Every time we phone up to book it we get told ‘No you can’t have it – Cliff is using it!’” Sir Cliff found his response “funny” and explained: “Every time I ask to use it they always say that you are in there.” While the two laughed it off later – for a time Sir Cliff found it incredibly frustrating. Sir Cliff considered The Beatles as his “arch-rivals” but he didn’t always feel that way about the band.

She said: ""The upstairs at Graceland even when Elvis was here was always a very private part of the home. Even Elvis’ closest friends and family didn’t go upstairs unless personally invited.

Thursday’s going to be a nerve-wracking day for David Scholz the principal engineer and head of the team that built the aeroshell.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHA6Ly9hc2lhdGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvZ3J1bW1hbnMtbG9uZ3Nob3QtdWFzLWNhbi1zZWFyY2gtZGVzdHJveS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grumman's LongShot drone can search & destroy,"Aerospace giant Northrop Grumman is wasting no time in this competition.

Just two days after DARPA named it as one of three competitors for the LongShot contract the company released an image of its concept for an air-launched unmanned aircraft system (UAS) Aviation Week reported.

Imagine an unmanned aircraft speeding ahead of its launch aircraft that itself can fire multiple air-to-air intercept missiles that can seek out and destroy.

No pilots to risk just a throw-away UAS that can potentially avoid enemy radar and return to base unharmed to be used again.

That’s the thing about unmanned systems they lack the romanticism of the past.

After their missions are completed — if they are lucky to return — they are duly checked out and parked in a lonely darkened hangar.

They don’t get to go to the bar and brag about their exploits.

Nevertheless Northrop aims to combine its skill set in digital engineering with an “extensive knowledge in advanced technology weapons autonomous systems and strike platforms to increase weapon range and effectiveness” said Jaime Engdahl Northrop’s program director for kinetic weapons.

DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) selected Northrop Lockheed Martin and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. to develop competitive designs for the LongShot program Aviation Week reported.

The LongShot concept appears similar to a previous DARPA program that involved Northrop which was known as the Flying Missile Rail. But Northrop said that program did not directly influence the company’s proposal.

“The real challenge that DARPA posed with LongShot was to investigate whether innovations in multimode propulsion can significantly increase the efficiency of delivering weapons at extended ranges and whether that efficiency can provide significant advantage to our warfighters” a Northrop spokeswoman said.

LongShot would allow fighters and bombers to take off with air-to-air missiles attached to a powered UAS that can separate and fly far ahead of the launch aircraft Aviation Week reported.

The missiles depicted on the LongShot UAS concept appear to be of a previously unseen design. The externally carried missiles also cut down on the stealth characteristics of the weapon. Credit: Northrop Grumman.

Easier said than done of course.

A key challenge is to complete a series of events including finding tracking and engaging a target at very long range with an autonomous missile launching system.

According to The War Zone compared to the LongShot concept art that DARPA itself released which shows a very cruise missile-like design Northrop Grumman’s proposal has a more airplane-like planform.

It also has a more traditional wing and tail configuration rather than a flying wing design which the company has become very well known for over the years.

Overall this particular design seems more consistent with a number of “loyal wingman” type drones that various other companies have in different stages of development War Zone reported.

In particular it has a number of very general similarities including a v-tail and top-mounted air intake to Kratos’ XQ-58 Valkyrie.

The US Air Force is currently conducting tests using XQ-58As as part of its Skyborg program which is seeking to develop a suite of artificial intelligence-driven systems capable of operating loyal wingman drones and fully-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV) among others.

Interestingly while Northrop Grumman’s LongShot concept has stealthy features including a chined fuselage it is shown carrying a pair of missiles externally which would increase its overall radar cross-section War Zone reported.

It’s not explicitly stated that the design is intended to carry weapons internally but it likely does as the renderings show weapons bay doors.

Even being able to carry smaller hit-to-kill air-to-air missiles internally in a stealthy configuration would be highly beneficial.

This would give the system more flexibility and allow it to also carry outsized missiles that feature longer-range and larger warheads such as the ones shown in the rendering War Zone reported.

Also the missiles depicted one of which has a skull and crossbones sticker of some kind on its nosecone also appear to be a previously unseen design.

Spurred by rapid technological advancements from Russia and China and an ever more dangerous battlefield DARPA is exploring new lethal engagement concepts by leveraging multi-modal propulsion weapon systems that can be operationally deployed from existing fighters or bombers Intelligent Aerospace reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL25ld3Mvd2VhdGhlci8yMDIxLzAyLzE0L3dpbnRlci1mbHVycmllcy1hcnJpdmUtaW4tZGFsbGFzLWZvcnQtd29ydGgtYWhlYWQtb2YtbWFqb3Itc25vd3N0b3JtL9IBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dlYXRoZXIvMjAyMS8wMi8xNC93aW50ZXItZmx1cnJpZXMtYXJyaXZlLWluLWRhbGxhcy1mb3J0LXdvcnRoLWFoZWFkLW9mLW1ham9yLXNub3dzdG9ybS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Snow accumulating across Dallas-Fort Worth and much more expected,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.dallasnews.com', port=443): Read timed out.

When you look at the F-22 compared to its 4th generation predecessors the aircraft clearly stands out… but what exactly made it the first of a new generation rather than a more advanced approach to the existing generation of fighters?

Generational designations often (or at least used to) come from within the aviation community itself. Each generation comes with a somewhat subjective list of capabilities that may have existed in some particular aircraft before but become requirements across the board for fighters of the next generation.

Fighter generations are fairly subjective so here’s how the Air Force broke down what new capabilities prompted a new generational designation:

1st Generation: Jet propulsion

2nd Generation: Swept wings range-finding radar and infrared-guided missiles

3rd Generation: Supersonic flight pulse radar and missiles that can engage opponents from beyond visual range

4th Generation and beyond: High levels of agility some degree of sensor fusion pulse-doppler radar reduced radar signature fly-by-wire look down/shoot down missiles and more.

Because new 4th generation fighters are still being produced it is perhaps the muddiest of all fighter generations. As a result 4th generation fighters are often further broken down into sub-generations such as 4 4+ and 4++. These more advanced 4th generation platforms often boast some 5th generation capabilities but not all.

In the case of the first 5th generation fighter the F-22 Raptor the most important thing differentiating it from its 4th generation counterparts was how stealth was an intrinsic part of the aircraft’s design. Rather than first designing a fighter for aerodynamics and performance and then seeking ways to reduce radar signature F-22 development prioritized stealth from day one.

Of course that wasn’t all that made the F-22 special and although it was in fact the first actual stealth fighter on the planet it also possessed several other essential 5th generation attributes. The F-22 came with highly integrated computer systems capable of communicating with other networked assets. It is a high-performance airframe capable of serving in a multi-role capacity. As a result it maintains a higher degree of situational awareness than can be found in older platforms.

The F-22 also brought with it super-cruising capabilities — which means being able to sustain supersonic speeds without the use of its afterburner. For an intercept fighter like the F-22 the ability to super-cruise means being able to close with enemy aircraft at extremely high speeds while still saving enough fuel for the fight once they arrive. Conversely the Air Force’s workhorse 4th generation multi-role fighter the F-16 Fighting Falcon will burn through all the fuel it has onboard within a matter of minutes with its afterburner ignited.

As a result for some time super-cruise capabilities were considered a part of what makes a 5th generation fighter a part of the 5th generation… That is until no other 5th generation fighter made it into the skies with that capability. Today only the F-22 offers super-cruise capabilities within its generation and as such it’s become a valuable trait but not a part of the generational distinction.

Today there are four operational 5th generation fighter platforms in the world: America’s F-22 and F-35 China’s J-20 and Russia’s Su-57 flying alongside more than 25 different 4th generation platforms. Here’s a rundown of what exactly sets these four highly capable fighters apart from even the most modern and advanced 4th generation platforms like the F-15EX.

Stealth

A high degree of maneuverability

Advanced avionics systems

Multi-role capabilities

Network or data fusion capabilities

While some still debate the finer points of what’s required of a 5th generation fighter these traits are commonly accepted. Some of these capabilities were present on 4th generation aircraft but each must be present in a 5th generation platform. This begs the question then… what will be the criteria for a 6th generation fighter when 5th generation platforms are still so rare?

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.

Over sixty years ago on September 12 1953 Jackie Bouvier walked down the aisle at Saint Mary's Roman Catholic Church to marry the future president of the United States then-junior senator from Massachusetts John F. Kennedy. For the occasion the bride picked an ivory silk-taffeta gown with a portrait neckline and full bouffant skirt—a dress that would take its place as one of the iconic wedding dresses throughout history. But while famous wedding dresses in the years that followed were identified perhaps not just by who wore them but by who designed them the tailor who created Kennedy's gown Ann Lowe remained relatively anonymous in the contemporary lore surrounding Kennedy because she was a Black woman.

Lowe was one of the most sought after couturiers of the era but in spite of the fact that she worked for many America's great family dynasties (think: the DuPonts the Rockefellers the Roosevelts and the Kennedys as well) she faced near-constant racial discrimination. Her place in sartorial history carved the way for independent designers of all races and creeds but it's only in the last few years that the designer has at last been getting her due.

Born to a lineage of seamstresses in Alabama Lowe made her name at New York's S.T. Taylor Design School and following graduation opened her own shop Ann Lowe Gowns catering to Manhattan's social elite. Lowe once told Ebony about her particularities concerning who she designed for saying ""I am not interested in sewing for... social climbers. I do not cater to Mary and Sue. I sew for the families of the Social Register."" This is how Lowe came to be acquainted with Janet Lee Bouvier Jackie Kennedy's mother.

Lowe's biographer Julia Faye Smith explained to Elle that she had previously designed dresses and gowns for Jackie and other members of the Auchincloss and Bouvier families so she knew their taste well. ""When it came time for the wedding her mother had definite ideas about the type of gown she wanted her daughter to have. Large elegant fabric a fairy tale dress. There are questions about what Jackie really wanted and if she liked the final product as much as the world did. Perhaps we'll never know.""

It's been reported that originally Jackie wanted to wear a simple French-style gown to get married thanks to a recent trip to Paris but JFK's father had final approval of the design. The end result after conferring with the bride was a gown made of 50 yards of silk taffeta... and it did not go over without a snag.

Ten days before the wedding a water line that broke and destroyed not just the wedding gown but the bridesmaids dresses too. What then ensued was an all-hands on deck mission to recreate everything with new fabric working day and night to recreate Lowe's designs in time for the historic nuptials. Not only did the designer suffer a monetary loss from the experience she also reportedly never told the bride or her mother about the mishap.

Following the wedding Lowe did not get the credit she deserved despite the clamor for who designed the gown. Reportedly when Kennedy was asked who made her wedding gown she originally responded ""a colored dressmaker did it."" Lowe remained relatively obscured from name recognition from that point regardless of her ongoing working relationship with the First Lady.

Lowe came back into the forefront of the conversation in 2019 when marketing student Keshaun Connor tweeted a thread about the designer's life after visiting her exhibit at the Smithsonian which now was over 13 thousand retweets and over 31k likes.

One tidbit revealed in the thread: Lowe also designed icon Olivia de Havilland's gown from the 1947 Oscars.

Since the thread's publishing a few years ago Lowe has received more recognition for her capabilities and accomplishments as well as her perseverance in the face of adversity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9waWxvdG9ubGluZS9uYW1lL21hcnktbG93ZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xMjQxNzkwM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mary Lowe Obituary (2021) - Norfolk VA - The Virginian-Pilot,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/pilotonline/name/mary-lowe-obituary?id=12417903 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9waWxvdG9ubGluZS9uYW1lL21hcnktbG93ZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xMjQxNzkwM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiuAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53dmdhemV0dGVtYWlsLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY29sdW1uaXN0cy9mcmFua19naWFyZGluYS9mcmFuay1naWFyZGluYS1pbnNwaXJpbmctc3Rvcmllcy1vZi1idWNreS1sb3dlLXJvYmluLWx5b25zLWhhcnZleS1zbWl0aC9hcnRpY2xlXzBiMmI2ZjFlLTg1NmEtNTFlMi1hNzdlLTc0NjVjODU2YWM0Mi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Frank Giardina: Inspiring stories of Bucky Lowe Robin Lyons Harvey Smith,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

Melissa Gilbert and Rob Lowe were together on and off for about six years. They started dating when they were 17 and broke up shortly after getting engaged. Not too long after Gilbert and Lowe went their separate ways the Little House on the Prairie actor met her first husband Bo Brinkman. After knowing each other for only six weeks the playwright proposed. When Lowe found out he was heartbroken according to Gilbert in her memoir Prairie Tale.

Why Melissa Gilbert and Rob Lowe broke up

As soon as Gilbert responded to Lowe’s proposal (it took her a few days because she was dating someone else at the time) she dove into wedding planning. She didn’t get too far before she realized she was pregnant. The former Laura Ingalls actor was ecstatic.

“It was going to be exactly the way I had dreamed” she wrote in her memoir. “I was beyond happy. I wanted to tell Rob the news in person so I left the next day for the Hamptons [where he was working].”

But when Gilbert shared the news with her fiancé he went silent.

“I can’t be a father” Gilbert remembers him saying his voice trembling. He went on to tell her he couldn’t be a husband or a boyfriend either.

“It was like I had stepped into a bottomless pit” she wrote. “I felt the terror of falling and no one to catch me.”

How Melissa Gilbert got together with Bo Brinkman

Gilbert and Brinkman were set up by a mutual friend. The first night they met at a bar he punched someone who said something “rude” about the actor. Six weeks later Brinkman asked Gilbert to marry him and she said yes.

So she started planning a secret wedding that only her and Brinkman’s closest friends would attend. Gilbert didn’t even tell her mother until it was over.

“All of us were loaded into cars and taken to someplace on Long Island where we marched into city hall signed papers and exchanged I do’s in front of a justice of the peace” she wrote.

Rob Lowe was in New York City when Melissa Gilbert married Bo Brinkman

Gilbert found out later that Lowe had been in New York City when she married Brinkman there. News traveled fast and she heard he was “very hurt.”

“I didn’t need too much hindsight to know that I failed to handle the situation as well as I should have” she wrote. “Despite the conversation I’d had with Rob precipitating his departure after Christmas I apparently still needed to make it clear to myself and to him that it was over really over between us. Which by the way it wasn’t. So what did I do? I married a stranger someone I didn’t know at all.”

After Gilbert and Brinkman tied the knot they traveled to Los Angeles where Gilbert’s mother threw them a party in celebration of their marriage. Lowe attended with Chynna Phillips of Wilson Phillips and Gilbert found herself avoiding him the whole evening. When she saw him she thought “What the hell are we doing? I am married to a guy I barely know and there you are with that beautiful woman and we should be together” she wrote.

Gilbert and Brinkman divorced in 1994.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oZWxsb21hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9oZWFsdGhhbmRiZWF1dHkvbW90aGVyLWFuZC1iYWJ5LzIwMjEwMjE0MTA2NzEyL3BoaWxsaXAtc2Nob2ZpZWxkLWZhbWlseS13aWZlLXN0ZXBoLWRhdWdodGVycy1waG90b3MtYWxidW0v0gGTAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlbGxvbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2hlYWx0aGFuZGJlYXV0eS9tb3RoZXItYW5kLWJhYnkvMjAyMTAyMTQxMDY3MTIvcGhpbGxpcC1zY2hvZmllbGQtZmFtaWx5LXdpZmUtc3RlcGgtZGF1Z2h0ZXJzLXBob3Rvcy1hbGJ1bS8_dmlld2FzPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside Phillip Schofield's family photo album with his wife and daughters,"© Photo: Instagram

Ball has undergone three surgeries on his left knee the most recent a cartilage transplant in 2023. There remains some guarded hope that he could return next season but there are no assurances that the damaged knee will allow for him to play again.

Ball 26 signed an original four-year $80 million deal as part of a sign-and-trade with New Orleans in the summer of 2021. After a fantastic start that had the Bulls leading the Eastern Conference in 2021-22 Ball averaged 13.0 points 5.4 rebounds 5.1 assists and 1.8 steals before a knee injury 35 games into the season.

His inactivity has caused his contract to become a blight on the Bulls' salary cap.

Ball was the No. 2 overall pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2017 NBA draft and eventually was traded to the Pelicans as part of the Anthony Davis blockbuster deal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvbWFydGhhcy12aW5leWFyZC1tYW4td2lucy0xbS1ncmFuZC1sb3R0ZXJ5LXByaXplLXBsYXlpbmctamF3cy1pbnN0YW50LWdhbWXSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL21hcnRoYXMtdmluZXlhcmQtbWFuLXdpbnMtMW0tZ3JhbmQtbG90dGVyeS1wcml6ZS1wbGF5aW5nLWphd3MtaW5zdGFudC1nYW1lLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Martha's Vineyard man wins $1M grand lottery prize after playing 'Jaws' instant game,"The Massachusetts State Lottery has given out another $1 million prize and the winner is ""gonna need"" a bigger wallet.

Ron DeSantis barred the sale of lab-grown meat in the Sunshine State.

DeSantis signed the legislation called SB 1084 into effect on May 1 casting it as a bid to stop the World Economic Forum’s goal of forcing the world to eat lab-grown meat and insects “an overlooked source of protein” according to a news release.

Rather “Florida is increasing meat production and encouraging residents to continue to consume and enjoy 100% real Florida beef” the governor’s office added.

DeSantis previously has blasted “the global elite’s plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals.”

4 Jeff Bezos and his fiancée Lauren Sanchez moved to Florida mere months before announcing a $60 million investment into lab-grown meats via the Amazon founder’s Bezos Earth Fund. Bezos Earth Fund

The move comes about a month after the Bezos Earth Fund chaired by the Amazon founder and Sanchez announced a hefty investment into sustainable protein including plant-based fermented and cultivated meats — part of the organization’s larger $1 billion commitment to expanding food production Fortune earlier reported.

“We need to feed 10 billion people with healthy sustainable food throughout this century while protecting our planet. We can do it and it will require a ton of innovation” Sanchez wrote in a statement announcing the $60 million investment.

Lab-grown meats differ from its slaughter-free counterparts like Impossible Foods in that they are grown from real animal cells that are replicated scientifically eliminating the need to farm animals.

Impossible burgers and other vegan proteins such as Beyond Meat meanwhile are made using alternative protein sources like tempeh tofu seitan and beans among other products.

According to science magazine Scientific American the US Department of Agriculture granted its first-ever approval of cell-cultured meat produced by two companies GOOD Meat and UPSIDE Foods last June — less than a year after the Food and Drug Administration declared the companies’ products safe to eat.

Florida for reference ranks 13th in the US in overall cattle numbers with a total herd size of 886000 among 15000 beef producers with total sales of $546 million according to Fortune citing the Florida Beef Council.

Before garnering US approval GOOD Meat had already been selling its cultivated chicken in Singapore. It made its debut in America in a dish curated by well-known chef José Andrés at his Washington DC restaurant China Chilcano.

The nonprofit Good Food Institute reports that the cultivated meat industry has grown to include more than 150 companies backed by $2.6 billion in investments Fortune cited — with Bezos among those funding the sector.

Bezos and DeSantis’s clashing opinions on the lab-grown meat industry are coming to light shortly after the 60-year-old tech billionaire moved from Seattle near Amazon’s headquarters to Miami closer to his space exploration firm Blue Origin’s home base.

In October 2023 it was revealed that Bezos had purchased two mansions on Florida’s exclusive “Billionaire Bunker” the man-made island formally known as Indian Creek Island.

Last month he added a third multimillion-dollar estate to his sprawling Miami portfolio in an off-market transaction reportedly worth $90 million.

For one night only this weekend it also had Madonna.

More than a million people thronged Copacabana beach on Saturday night turning its vast stretch of sand into a massive dancefloor for a free concert by the pop star as she completed her world tour.

“Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world” Madonna 65 told the tightly packed crowd. Pointing out the ocean view and the mountains she added: “This place is magic.”

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

Many wore the red shirts of the National League for Democracy. This party led by Aung San Suu Kyi won the election by a landslide last year as it did in 2015 when the first elected parliament in more than 50 years was established.

“Myanmar communities in New Zealand strongly condemn the illegal actions of the army’s seizure” Tinmama Oo with microphone said on behalf of the organizing groups the Burma Campaign in New Zealand and the Anti-Myanmar Military Coup Movement.

Some 6000 people from Myanmar live in New Zealand. “Most of the first wave of refugees were victims” of the military’s crackdown against a widespread rebellion in 1987-88 said Oo.

“We all are in this together” said Kyaw Hla who spoke as a representative of Rohingya a Muslim nationality in Myanmar. A number have settled here driven from their homes in Rakhine state by brutal military-led assaults.

Some Rohingya had hesitated to join the protest participants told the Militant because Suu Kyi and her party have refused to oppose the military offensive. Shamsul Saa Yu secretary of the Burmese Rohingya Welfare Organisation said the Feb. 1 coup “places Rohingya in a very vulnerable position.” Under the National League for Democracy he said “things were a bit more open than under the military regime.”

Speakers from Amnesty International and the Communist League were given warm receptions. Speaking for the CL this author said working people in New Zealand and around the world should speak out against the coup: “The military acted because it fears working people and the likelihood that they will take the elections as encouragement to push their own interests forward.”

In the final months of his active life Vladimir Lenin the central leader of the world’s first socialist revolution led a political battle within the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. At stake was the continuation of the internationalist proletarian course that brought the Bolshevik-led workers and peasants to power in October 1917. This was threatened by a rising bureaucracy within the state and party led by Joseph Stalin that resulted in a political counterrevolution after Lenin’s death. Part of this fight was over integration as equals into the Soviet Union of former oppressed peoples of the “prison house of nations” under the regime of the czar.

BY V.I. LENIN

December 30 1922

I suppose I have been very remiss with respect to the workers of Russia for not having intervened energetically and decisively enough in the notorious question of autonomization which it appears is officially called the question of the union of Soviet socialist republics.

When this question arose last summer I was ill; and then in the autumn I placed too much hope on my recovery … giving me an opportunity of intervening in this question. However I did not manage to attend the October plenary meeting (when this question came up) or the one in December and so the question passed me by almost completely. …

It is said that a united apparatus was needed. Where did that assurance come from? Did it not come from that same Russian apparatus which as I pointed out in one of the preceding sections of my diary we took over from tsarism and slightly anointed with Soviet oil?

There is no doubt that that measure should have been delayed somewhat until we could say that we vouched for our apparatus as our own. But now we must in all conscience admit the contrary; the apparatus we call ours is in fact still quite alien to us. It is a bourgeois and tsarist hodgepodge. There has been no possibility of getting rid of it in the course of the past five years given the lack of help of other countries and given that we have been “busy” most of the time with military engagements and the fight against famine.

It is quite natural that in such circumstances the “freedom to secede from the union” by which we justify ourselves will be a mere scrap of paper unable to defend the non-Russians from the onslaught of that really Russian man the Great Russian chauvinist in substance a rascal and a tyrant such as the typical Russian bureaucrat is. There is no doubt that the infinitesimal percentage of Soviet and sovietized workers will drown in that tide of chauvinistic Great Russian riffraff like a fly in milk.

December 31 1922In my writings on the national question I have already said that an abstract presentation of the question of nationalism in general is of no use at all. A distinction must necessarily be made between the nationalism of an oppressor nation and that of an oppressed nation the nationalism of a big nation and that of a small nation.

In respect of the second kind of nationalism we nationals of a big nation have nearly always been guilty in historic practice of an infinite number of cases of violence; furthermore we commit violence and insult an infinite number of times without noticing it. It is sufficient to recall my Volga reminiscences of how non-Russians are treated; how the Poles are not called by any other name than Polyachishka how the Tatar is nicknamed Prince how the Ukrainians are always Khokhols and the Georgians and other Caucasian nationals always Kapkasians. …

That is why internationalism on the part of oppressors or “great” nations as they are called (though they are great only in their violence only great as Derzhimordas1) must consist not only in the observance of the formal equality of nations but even in an inequality through which the oppressor nation the great nation would compensate for the inequality which obtains in real life. Anybody who does not understand this has not grasped the real proletarian attitude to the national question; he is still essentially petty bourgeois in his point of view and is therefore sure to descend to the bourgeois point of view.

What is important for the proletarian? For the proletarian it is not only important it is absolutely essential that he should be assured that the non-Russians place the greatest possible trust in the proletarian class struggle. What is needed to ensure this? Not merely formal equality. In one way or another by one’s attitude or by concessions it is necessary to compensate the non-Russians for the lack of trust for the suspicion and the insults to which the government of the “dominant” nation subjected them in the past. …

[N]othing holds up the development and strengthening of proletarian class solidarity so much as national injustice. “Offended” nationals are not sensitive to anything so much as to the feeling of equality and the violation of this equality if only through negligence or jest to the violation of that equality by their proletarian comrades. That is why in this case it is better to overdo rather than underdo the concessions and leniency towards the national minorities. That is [in] the fundamental interest of proletarian solidarity and consequently of the proletarian class struggle.

Throughout the week we post original stories day and night exploring news and travel trends including regular coverage on the impact of coronavirus. Every weekend we will offer you a chance to read the most essential stories again in case you missed them earlier.

Is New Zealand’s New Tourism Ad Brilliant or Tone Deaf?: New Zealand’s latest tourism campaign is approaching marketing from a more unconventional way to say the least. Global marketers have been tackling the challenge of adapting to a more empathetic tone during the pandemic. Some were able to manage as Skift earlier reported but others left many industry observers confused. Pure New Zealand’s recent “Traveling under the social influence” ad is one of the latter. While it aims to discourage influencer-inspired tourist photos at popular sights the campaign instead treads a fine line between genius and insensitivity.

The Drew formerly the Fontainebleau on the Las Vegas Strip on Monday Feb. 12 2018. Richard Brian Las Vegas Review-Journal @vegasphotograph

For more than a decade Las Vegas’ big blue tower could not catch a break.

Soaring above the north Strip the Fontainebleau was supposed to open in 2009 — but the megaresort project instead went bankrupt that year after the economy crashed.

A developer later bought the mothballed skyscraper renamed it and set out to finish it — but he shelved construction last year as the coronavirus pandemic sparked sweeping shutdowns and other chaos and afterward the project faced liens and litigation.

Today the blue-tinted high-rise remains an unfinished eyesore and constant reminder of Las Vegas’ economic implosions. But in a stunning full-circle moment its old developer has reacquired the property raising the prospects yet again that the long-stalled hotel-casino project will finally actually open.

The real estate wing of conglomerate Koch Industries teamed with Florida developer Jeffrey Soffer to acquire the unfinished Drew Las Vegas property on the Strip according to a news release Thursday. Terms were not disclosed.

Soffer was part of the group that originally built the 60-plus-story resort during the frenzied mid-2000s bubble. It was one of many super- sized developments in Las Vegas during that era and one of many mothballed projects to blight the valley after the bubble burst.

But unlike other aborted projects in town that were bought and finished this one remains stuck in time.

No word on name opening date

The new owners did not release details Thursday on their plans for the site including whether they will change the name back to the Fontainebleau or when they expect to resume construction.

A representative for Soffer’s firm Fontainebleau Development told me Friday that it does not have any additional information to share at this time.

Efforts to get a comment Friday from Koch Industries led by billionaire political megadonor Charles Koch were unsuccessful.

The project’s previous owner developer Steve Witkoff acquired the Fontainebleau in 2017 for $600 million. When he announced its new name the next year he also unveiled plans with hotel giant Marriott International to bring the Edition brand and the Strip’s first JW Marriott to the Drew.

Marriott spokeswoman Elynsey Price told me Friday that while the property has new owners “nothing has changed with respect to our role in this project.”

“Marriott remains the hotel operator and we have two brands — the Edition and the JW Marriott — that are a part of this resort and casino complex” she said in an email.

Two derailments

Plans for the Fontainebleau were unveiled in 2005. The project led by Soffer and former Las Vegas casino executive Glenn Schaeffer was named after the 1950s-era Fontainebleau hotel in Miami Beach which Soffer had agreed to buy months earlier.

They broke ground in 2007. But the real estate market soon crashed the economy spiraled and billionaire Carl Icahn bought the mothballed project in 2010 for around $150 million.

He sold it for quadruple his purchase price to Witkoff and Miami real estate firm New Valley a subsidiary of cigarette maker the Vector Group.

Witkoff told me early last year that he was close to obtaining a roughly $2 billion construction loan for the project. But in March as Las Vegas rapidly shut down over fears of the coronavirus outbreak he shelved construction.

Don’t count on the resort to open anytime soon. It still needs plenty of construction work and even if the new owners were able to finish it right away the tourism industry remains badly battered by the pandemic as Las Vegas grapples with sharp drops in visitor levels.

But the pandemic will end at some point — and one day even the Fontainebleau could open.

Credit cards are increasingly taking on a vertical orientation.

This comes as apps like TikTok and Instagram acclimate the world toward a vertically scrolling feed and it also reflects how most consumers use their credit cards anyway — by inserting them into chip readers vertically for example.

Here’s something I bet most you didn’t see coming: TikTok and Instagram are such pervasive cultural forces in the world today they’re starting to quietly influence the design of — credit cards of all things.

In recent days PayPal released new debit and credit card vertical designs for its Venmo app which a company executive said was partly inspired by the vertical orientation of those popular social media apps. Daniela Jorge vice president of design at PayPal told Bloomberg in a recent interview that this is just the way the whole world is thinking now. And what people’s expectations are for apps and consumer products like credit cards. “The world around us is becoming more of the portrait mode and the vertical orientation” Jorge said.

Besides PayPal major banks are already moving in this direction. Bank of America the second-biggest provider in the US of debit card products was one of the first to adopt a debit card with a portrait orientation. Likewise Discovery Bank started offering vertical credit cards in 2018. And the reasons we should expect this trend to continue with more banks adopting a vertical style for their card products include the fact that with the advent of chip readers and tap-to-pay functionality this is how most people handle their cards already.

With a chip reader for example the credit card is inserted into the reader vertically. Likewise as digital wallets increase in popularity — with card owners increasingly utilizing a digital version of their credit card that’s stored in their smartphone — the phone becomes the device with which the consumer pays instead of a physical card. And phones of course are used vertically. When Apple released its new credit card product Apple Card I didn’t even bother obtaining a physical version of the card at all. I signed up and was approved for the credit card which I keep in my iPhone’s wallet app and use it vertically since I’m simply waving the phone in front of a card reader.

Think about the last time you handed your card to someone to horizontally swipe through a reader. It’s probably been a while right? Now consider that two years after these smart payment chip-enabled cards were introduced Experian says that US banks have issued more than 855 million of them. They’re called EMV cards by the way which originally stood for Europay Mastercard and Visa — the credit card companies that created this new payment standard.

“Switching our debit cards to a vertical layout is about more than how the cards look” Bank of America head of consumer and small-business products April Schneider told Bloomberg. “The vertical layout differentiates the debit card from other cards clients use and the addition of tap-to-pay makes the card faster and safer to use at in-store checkout.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRibmV3c3dhdGNoLmNvbS9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL3NjYW0tYWxlcnQtdGV4dHMtZW1haWxzLXBoaXNoaW5nLWZvci1jYW5hZGlhbi10aXJlLWNyZWRpdC1jYXJkLWluZm8tMzQyMzYzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SCAM ALERT: Texts emails phishing for Canadian Tire credit card info,"City police warn of a recent scam.

But for BLK their platform is created to be a loving space for the Black community no matter their reason for joining. Of course the Match Group extension which launched in 2017 is primarily a place for Black singles to connect and potentially find a life partner but BLK is also a hub for enlightening conversations around social issues and a space to reaffirm the Black American experience.

Just in time for Valentine’s Day BLK launched “Once You Go BLK” campaign a celebration of the unlimited potential of Black love. The initiative showcases the journeys of BLK users and small business owners to acknowledge how real people date.

“Once You Go BLK embraces the culture of the Black community while also shedding light on important community topics from state violence to supporting Black-owned businesses” said Jonathan Kirkland Head of Marketing & Brand for BLK. “Our ambition for this campaign is to foster more solidarity from a cultural level with our users while taking the power away from an ugly adage used against us.”

AfroTech spoke with Kirkland — who joined BLK in April 2020 — about Once You Go BLK how BLK has a deeper responsibility to the community beyond dating and a special Black History Month partnership with &pizza.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

AfroTech: Why was BLK created?

Jonathan Kirkland: BLK is the largest dating app for Black singles that launched in August of 2017 and it’s a part of the Match Group which owns all the popular dating apps like Tinder and OK Cupid. Being a behemoth in the industry Match recognized that Black people weren’t being served in the dating app landscape and that Black experiences are different from other people’s experiences in America. So BLK was really creating an inclusive community where like-minded people can connect can have deeper meaningful conversations with people who get each other and who experience similar things.

AfroTech: It’s true that sometimes Black singles feel alienated on dating apps so BLK seems like a safer more enjoyable space for us.

Jonathan Kirkland: Our sister company OK Cupid did a study in 2014 and found out that on their app and other general market apps Black women are considered the least desirable. That means that Black women get the least amount of messages right swipes and replies to them. So for BLK understanding that stat that’s a focus of ours.

For example when the Breonna Taylor decision was made not to charge the cops involved we took out five full-page ads in newspapers around the country that read “Black women deserve better period.” And we followed up with similar programming to target Black women like a survey asking our Black female users if they feel safe in America. We found out that only 3.5% of Black women on BLK feel safe. So now that we know that what are we doing to help change that or mitigate that as much as we can?

AfroTech: Why is it important for BLK to address the needs of the Black community outside of dating?

Jonathan Kirkland: Unlike other apps we have a deeper responsibility to be more than just a dating app. We really just want to be responsive to what’s going on in the world highlight the conversations that are already happening in the Black community and give recognition to everyday Black people like our users.

AfroTech: What can users look forward to from BLK’s upcoming Valentine’s Day campaign Once You Go BLK.

Jonathan Kirkland: Instead of “praising” outdated stereotypes of Black people this initiative will chronicle how Black singles take their own distinct approach to dating from what they look for in a partner and their outlook on both romantic and platonic relationships. In order to bring this campaign to life BLK partnered with its local network of Black business owners and creatives such as T&J Hair Designs for hair honeybeebeats for makeup a Paola Mathe headscarf design and Darian Younce as the set stylist.

AfroTech: We’ll get to get real Black love success stories. That’s inspiring.

Jonathan Kirkland: Yeah and while dating will always be our core product BLK will be moving more into a lifestyle platform as well. You’ll be able to use BLK in “date mode” for a one-to-one connection and “non-date mode” for a one-to-many connection. We’re also considering integrating culturally relevant games like Culture Tags and Black Card Revoked into the app and live-streaming for virtual meet-ups.

AfroTech: Besides the V-Day campaign what other initiatives can users look forward to?

Jonathan Kirkland: We’re currently partnering with &pizza for Black History Month to create the crowd-sourced BLK Pizza Pie based on BLK app users’ favorite selections. We surveyed them on toppings and other ingredients and came up with the final pie. The final ingredients include &pizza dough classic tomato sauce basil fresh mozzarella grilled onion chicken crushed red and black pepper and garlic puree. It’ll be available from now until March 31.

AfroTech: During a weekend all about love what advice do you have for Black singles who are hesitant about dating apps especially during the pandemic?

Jonathan Kirkland: Be open! And as long as you’re upfront with your intentions on the app in the beginning that’ll help save time. If you’re just looking for friendship say that early on. If you are looking for something long-term or just casual state it that way. People are engaging with each other more than pre-COVID-19. We’ve seen an 80 to 90% increase in newly registered users coming to the end of 2020. A lot of that has to do with the mindset changing as well. People want to be socially distant so they’re coming to dating apps to have conversations instead. They’re sending more messages replying more and swiping more. Overall the pandemic has been very good for the dating app industry because it’s a safer way for you to connect with somebody in these times.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzE5NzE4MjcvaG93LWNvdmlkLTE5LWhhcy1jaGFuZ2VkLW9ubGluZS1kYXRpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Covid-19 has changed online dating,"Dating online in 2021 is a dizzying virtual buffet of ways to connect with someone. You can give your match a bouquet of digital roses that cost $29.99 to show them you really do care and didn’t just casually swipe on them while sitting on the toilet like you did with hundreds of others. You can immediately video chat your date to pre-screen them to confirm they’re not creepy. You can change the location on your app to find a lover in a different country and see what happens. You are also probably switching between three different apps to keep optimizing for your best chance of meeting someone special.

The user has all these options because over the last quarter-century online dating went from a stigmatized activity discussed in hushed embarrassed tones to the most common way couples meet in the US. It has completely unequivocally revolutionized how we fall in love—and turned into a multi-billion dollar global industry in the process.

For many online dating is unavoidable. “I never dated until it was online—that’s how I was introduced to dating. And so if I’m single I’m always going to be involved in it” said Kevin who is 30 and lives in Brooklyn and has been dating online for a decade.

“No one goes to a bar to find the love of their life. It’s increasingly hard to date at work because of HR rules” said Eric Resnick a dating coach who has been helping people write their online dating profiles for more than 15 years. Mobile phones have made it difficult to walk up to a stranger because “humans walk around in their own cloud of technology.” So people turn to the apps.

The industry is estimated to have 270 million monthly users globally and grew by about 13% even in the pandemic-dominated year of 2020 (although the pace of growth has generally been slowing). Everyone is dating online even 18-year-olds in high school. But at the center of this massive paradigm shift there’s a tension for daters: online dating has become both inevitable and exhausting.

The era of Tinder has made people especially millennials who’ve come of age along with the rise of mobile technology tired of swiping into oblivion. Many complain that they are not finding meaningful connections while the industry is focused on making money off of their unending search for love. They are at the center of a massive social and financial experiment and it’s wearing on them. The industry has noticed and is trying to adjust or pivot as it hopes to keep attracting new users. The pandemic has accelerated the pace of that change. Experts and insiders say that the apps that define the next era of online dating will be ones that offer more fun safety and community—and potentially have an even closer borderline invasive relationship with users.

Competing for the dater

Kevin toggles between three different apps to meet people—when he’s looking for anything from a casual encounter to a friendship it’s Grindr the app for gay men; when he’s looking for something serious it’s Hinge; more rarely it’s Tinder.

“I’ve downloaded and tried pretty much all of them” he said.

Although Kevin is an avid tech consumer his experience of going back and forth between apps is fairly typical: Many users keep multiple apps on their phone and use them depending on what they’re looking for.

There are countless apps and dating or matrimonial sites but the industry is roughly divided into two segments. There are the mobile-first apps where you swipe or look through a deck of profiles indicating who you like along the way—like Tinder Grindr Bumble or Hinge—which generally cater toward a younger crowd. And then there are the more traditional older services—such as Match.com eHarmony Zoosk or Plenty of Fish—that require users to fill out a more extensive profile and allows them to search for matches based on specific criteria. These older sites have survived the Tinderization of the online dating economy and are holding on or even growing.

Most of those services are owned by one company: The Match Group. It dominates the industry so thoroughly that any user in virtually any place in the world could pick from their roster of apps. “Match Group has essentially created a cradle-to-grave dating cycle” Resnick said. “They have you from Tinder to Our Time [an app for older daters].”

Match has sparked criticism for years accused by industry observers of stifling innovation. Much like Facebook in the social media world Match likes to acquire its competitors. Its dominance makes it harder for small players to enter and survive on their own.

Along with the major general-interest players like Tinder the Match Group also owns niche apps like the Latino-geared Chispa or the rapidly growing app for Black singles BLK both of which the company incubated from the very beginning. “We’re not the first dating app made for Black singles” said Jonathan Kirkland BLK’s head of marketing. “There have been others there are [still] others. But from a resource standpoint they don’t have what we have by being a part of this larger family.”

The head of Match’s North America properties Amarnath Thombre told MarketWatch in September that the company’s strategy is to “have each app run its own experiment” and as the experiments play out the company can use the successful features in its other properties.

Match is also expanding into Asia a market that is a burgeoning online dating behemoth in its own right. The company owns the lucrative Pairs Japan’s most popular dating app and Hawaya its Muslim-focused service launched in Indonesia Malaysia and Singapore among others.

There are other major players. Bumble founded on the premise that women should make the first move launched its IPO on Feb. 11. It also owns Badoo a service that’s very popular in Europe. According to the company’s January filing the Bumble group had 42 million monthly active users in the third quarter of 2020. Or Facebook Dating the latest massive entrant into the market which seems to have fizzled after a big launch—although some industry experts say it still has big potential with its access to massive pools of information about its users.

And despite the competition from the big guys many highly specialized services have been able to survive many years or even flourish. There’s MouseMingle which is specifically for Disney fans or Positive Singles for those with incurable sexually-transmitted diseases which claims to have more than 2 million registered users or the self-explanatory Farmers Only (tagline: “City folks just don’t get it”). These hyper-specific niche sites help people find someone who is highly compatible sharing their passion background or circumstances.

Monetizing the search for love

Ben who lives on New York’s Long Island and is 32 joined Tinder several years ago when “you could just swipe away and like you didn’t have to pay anything.” But over time that changed. He started paying for “Super Likes” a feature that Tinder offers à la carte and that lets the super-liked person know that you well super like them. But that was not enough. “They just kind of kept finding ways to make you feel limited unless you paid.” So he ended up subscribing to a premium version of the app.

What Ben is describing is the freemium business model that many apps have been using in the last several years or are starting to use. (More traditional sites like Match.com have several levels of membership with some add-on features and an extremely limited free version).

Because the apps are free—and most users still use free versions—there is no barrier to entry. The company initially backed by investors builds up a large user base and is then able to introduce a premium offering. Those who want more out of the apps can pay (for example Tinder which launched in 2012 offered its first subscription tier in 2015). And a growing number of users are happy to fork over a couple of bucks at a time or the equivalent of a fancy cocktail or a newspaper subscription to have all the paid options all month (the highest monthly subscription for Tinder is $29.99 but controversially the company charges differently depending on the user’s age and possibly other factors).

Some of the pay-to-play options might sound a bit dystopian like paying to be more visible to people in their carousel of profiles via Bumble’s “Spotlight” feature; or sending someone a virtual rose an offering on Hinge; or changing your location before a trip to check out the dating pool before you arrive via Tinder’s “Passport.”

But executives argue that paying for these features is also in the end better for the user.

“Pretty much everything that we charge for on Hinge we couldn’t really give away for free because then it wouldn’t work anymore” said Hinge’s CEO and founder Justin McLeod. “Think about Roses for example. Roses are really really special” he said. “If we gave everyone unlimited Roses then it would completely defeat the purpose of Roses.”

Buying add-ons became more compelling for users once accessing the sites on their phones became the default and after games like Candy Crush normalized in-app mobile payments. “People are used to spending a buck here and there for their mobile games” said Steve Dean dating coach and industry consultant. What once required users to take out a credit card and painstakingly enter their data now just asks them to use their phone to take a quick scan of the thumbprint or face—it’s that easy.

Unlike the dating app’s cousin the social media platform advertising is not a big source of revenue for the online dating service. But ultimately the business models have a lot in common. “Regardless of the dating site people are the product” Resnick said. “You’re the consumer while you’re looking. But you’re the product when everyone else is looking.”

When you leave a dating site or app because you’ve found what you want you remove yourself from their money stream and you take someone else with you Resnick said. “That’s a very bad business plan.” So while you’re there—experts say the average lifespan of an online dating app user is three to six months—companies will do their best to make as much money off of you as possible.

Something’s broken

The more a user is treated like a product the more exhausting their experience becomes. In the last several years multiple outlets have declared that people are sick and tired of “swiping culture” and that the apps are bad at finding love. Dating if it ever was fun now borders on the tedious.

“Almost every major app is trying to get you to swipe more to log in more frequently to spend more time looking at people and less time engaging with people” said Dean. “There’s been this huge shift toward accumulating human attention with virtually no payout.” Certain features he says make it worse. Paying just to make your profile more visible for a certain amount of time is just “a way to get me stuck swiping more.” The main notification he says he gets on dating apps is one that mimics Uber’s “surge pricing.” The app tells you that it’s primetime for swiping. “It’s basically saying come swipe the roulette.’”

The more traditional dating services have their own manipulative tactics. Match.com does not tell you whether a user you’re sending a message is a paid member or not. If they use the service for free they generally won’t be able to read the message.

The apps can also be addicting. Built into them are the same dopamine triggers that social media apps have made infamous. And users talk about their app experience like a vicious cycle of dependence. Many delete them only to come back later. One user described her usage as “binging.”

Julia 31 who is Polish and lives in Barcelona said that last summer she realized using Bumble sucked the energy out of her. “Going on the app scrolling through all those people sending that first message setting up a date the date itself—everything was so superficial that I became incredibly tired overwhelmed” she said. “It felt like a duty that I should use the app that it was my decision and since I have it something must come out of it.” She deleted it. But after several months she installed it again. “Maybe I’ll meet someone this time” she said she thought. “I had the energy perhaps I also forgot how awful it was I hoped it would be different” she said. She deleted it again after a week.

Several users described a feeling of being overwhelmed by all the choices the app offered. “I can’t wait to delete them all “ said Alissa 22 from Los Angeles. “I think there’s a certain validation aspect on the apps where there’s always someone better taller richer etc. and it really hurts the chances for actual meaningful connections.”

And yet despite these frustrations users keep coming back because it feels like one of the very few ways you can meet someone these days.

Hinge vs. Tinder

A lot of the frustration with online dating stems from the “gamification” of the industry which started when Tinder arrived on the scene in 2012. But that gamification had a significant upside for daters.

“By calling itself a game on the app Tinder single-handedly made it possible for millions of people to enter the dating space because it was no longer this super stigmatized thing” said Dean. It vastly simplified the sign-up process removing a barrier to entry. You didn’t have to spend an hour to fill out a profile crucial in a mobile-first world.

Tinder has been the golden child of the online dating revolution—and it still is the most popular app in the US and in many places around the globe to the point that the Match Group separates its properties into “Tinder” and “non-Tinder” in its business communications. It’s a truly global business that despite many users’ frustrations keeps growing—Tinder generated nearly $1.4 billion for the Match Group in 2020.

Tinder was created as a departure from the traditional dating sites—and many of the apps that are currently the most popular became a response to Tinder by imitating and altering the user experience. Bumble which was created by a former Tinder executive sought to empower women by requiring them to make the first move. But it did keep sparse profiles and swiping to match. It’s now the second-most downloaded app in the US according to data from mobile app intelligence company Sensor Tower.

The latest industry darling is Hinge. When it was founded in 2012 the same year Tinder launched Hinge was strikingly similar to Tinder; McLeod describes the Hinge of that period as “just another app with a swipe feature” while its venture-capital backers encouraged chasing growth and engagement. But when Hinge relaunched in 2016 the company made several seemingly small tweaks that had a big effect. Hinge decided to intentionally rebrand itself as an app for those actually trying to find a relationship versus a casual fling or hookup a reputation Tinder has never been able to shake. “We threw away all those metrics about growth and retention and engagement” McLeod said. “We just made the bet that if we focused on the number of great dates per user that that would lead to our success over the long term.” Hinge started to ask users whether they’d gone on a date and how that date went. “And that is our north star our metric that determines whether a feature lives or dies.” The reasoning went: If people have great dates they will tell their friends about Hinge and the company will grow. And it worked. The Match group which acquired Hinge in 2019 said in its latest earnings release that Hinge downloads grew 63% globally between 2019 and 2020.

One way of getting people on those great dates McLeod says was making a small change to how users interacted with the profiles of their matches. Unlike on Tinder where users are faced with a blank box to message a match Hinge encourages them to respond to a specific element of their match’s profile like a photo or an answer to a prompt provided by the app.

A prompt like “my go-to karaoke song” might not lead to any meaningful exchange according to McLeod but one that requires the user to show more vulnerability like “qualities I’m looking for in a plus-one wedding date” is a powerful conversation starter—which in turn can lead to a good date. (Tinder once copied by everyone else is now taking cues from the success of Hinge—in 2020 it added a “prompts” feature.)

Kevin credits a Hinge prompt with his current relationship. To a prompt that asked “I want someone who…” he answered: “intentionally watches movies with the director commentary tracks.” It was important to him to find someone who shared his passion. A guy responded saying “That’s hot” and that exchange kicked off a conversation. “It definitely put him on my radar much much more than it would have been if it was just a swipe right on Tinder.”

That millennials are tired with the swiping game may not matter much for Tinder. And that’s because most of its users are younger: Gen Z is taking over the app.

“I think that we forget that for someone who’s 18 or 19 they’re not tired they just started and there’s positivity and excitement. Because of where Tinder is in culture [using it] is a rite of passage” said Nicole Parlapiano the company’s vice president of marketing for North America. Tinder which got its start on college campuses wants to be the introduction into the world of online dating. Depending on the location Parlapiano said the share of 18-25 year-olds on the app “hovers around over 50%.”

Indeed the age of people dating online has been falling—especially during the pandemic according to Sensor Tower.

For Peter who is 18 and from New Orleans going on the app was something he was waiting to do—in fact he tried to sign up at 17 but the app wouldn’t allow him to do so. He wasn’t having much luck getting dates the old-fashioned way. “So I was like you know everyone talks about it I’ll try Tinder.”

At the same time he readily admits he treats it like an entertaining game and only goes on when he’s bored. “There’s a lot of people on there just you know looking for no-strings-attached fun. But at the same time I have come across people who are really just looking for friends.”

That sentiment is what Parlapiano sees as a major shift for the company. “I think that really the biggest change we’ve seen in the past four years or so and magnified by Covid is the way that people are looking at Tinder as a people app versus a dating app.” Gen Z she says has a different attitude toward Tinder then their predecessors. They are more flexible in that they are looking for everything from sex to relationships to “situationships” to travel companions. They might make matches simply for conversation to practice flirting or as a little self-esteem boost.

Five ways online dating will change

As the world went into lockdown in March users turned to online dating for some human connection. They arranged video dates met up in the virtual world of the game Animal Crossing went on socially-distanced walks attended virtual sex parties.

“There may be a reprisal of appreciation and enthusiasm for online outlets that way while people are stuck home due to the virus” said Paulette Sherman a psychologist and dating coach. It could have a lasting effect making online dating even more ubiquitous. “People will get more used to it and it will be even less stigmatized and will probably become even more of a habit for some of the holdouts.”

Because of this despite a weak economy dating app companies had a decent year. Bumble’s IPO indicates there is still significant room for the industry to grow and Match posted solid results in its fourth-quarter earnings.

Online dating is an industry that is constantly evolving. Dating online in 2014 was very different from dating online in 2019 to say nothing of 2020 the year the world was turned on its head. Based on conversations with users executives and industry insiders here are some predictions about how it will evolve further.

Apps will be for community-building not just dating

Tinder is not alone in talking about branching out beyond core dating. Bumble has offered its BFF mode for finding friends since 2016 and its networking feature Bumble Bizz since 2017. BLK is moving into the “lifestyle” space like creating forums for conversation or highlighting Black businesses in an effort to foster community.

Mark Brooks a leading industry consultant says that for dating apps to be able to keep monetizing moving into a more community-oriented gear is the way to go. “We want people to stick around have fun. Yes hook up meet up and maybe stick around even beyond that point” he said. “I think we’ll see a general shift away from dating into more community-esque apps.”

During the pandemic apps that aim to combine dating with fun have seen a resurgence. The Meet Group which owns several apps dedicated to meeting people (not necessarily to create matches and relationships but sometimes it happens along the way) has been pivoting to livestreaming in the last several years. On an app like MeetMe you can tune into someone’s livestream and connect with them over chat and send them money. Since the beginning of the pandemic the Meet Group saw livestreamed minutes increase by 40% according to its CEO Geoff Cook—and people have been spending a lot more money while tuning in. And the big guys are catching on. The Meet Group provides livestreaming for Match Group’s Plenty of Fish and the feature is proving to be popular. In February in a massive $1.7 billion deal Match acquired Hyperconnect a Korean “social discovery” company that owns a livestreaming app and a video and audio chatting app that translates conversations in real time.

Cook points out that the growth of the dating industry has generally been slowing. “And so what do dating companies do when you’re saturating the market? Well what they do is they find other ways to engage the user” he said. “They don’t have to just be all about utility they can provide some entertainment value.”

Video dates are here to stay

Since all of our communication has moved to screens during the pandemic one-on-one video dating has also seen a boon. In July and May Tinder and Hinge respectively introduced in-app video chatting; Bumble which already offered the feature saw a boost in usage.

“It prevents catfishing it makes users be able to gain a little of a sense of humanity” said Dean. “When you stare at photos you don’t really get a sense of who people are you don’t see them emote.”

Many of the users I spoke to were still hesitant about video feeling it was awkward but they agreed it was a good addition. McLeod thinks video dating will stick around even after the pandemic. Full-blown dates might not happen much on video but 10-15 minute screenings might. (A check-in like that is also cheaper since there’s no need to pay for dinner or a cab).

Dating may move more slowly

Adding a video step is in some ways a form of slowing down the entire process of getting off that roulette wheel. During the pandemic everything has had to slow down including dating: since interacting IRL is riskier people are chatting longer waiting longer to meet.

But it’s actually a trend that has been percolating for some time now as a reaction to swiping fatigue dubbed by the industry “slow dating.” “We’ve seen that slow dating continues to be a trend as people show more serious dating behaviors and raise the bar on what it means to build trust online when dating” said Priti Joshi Bumble’s vice president of marketing strategy and operations adding that 55% of Bumble users are taking longer to move a match offline. (Not coincidentally the rise of swipe culture also led to a resurgence of the matchmaker industry—exclusive agencies that charge hefty fees for the human touch.)

Apps will hopefully take user safety more seriously

Every female dater interviewed for this article mentioned how they often feel unsafe on the apps or how they are put off by unwanted sexual attention. In October Australian broadcaster ABC published a large investigation into sexual harassment and assault on Tinder revealing how woefully inadequate the company’s response was. “Of the 48 people who told us they reported a sexual offense to Tinder only 11 received a response from the app” ABC reported.

The industry is starting to acknowledge the danger users may encounter by simply using the apps. In 2019 Bumble launched a feature that detects and blurs inappropriate photos. In response to the investigation Tinder started directing users who report violations to support organizations.

Content moderation is slowly getting better Dean said and will continue to do so as the companies implement machine learning and human moderators to detect abusive behaviors. But he added that companies still prioritize keeping user accounts rather than kicking people off the platforms.

Dating could jump to new media

For a true dating revolution to happen the industry needs another media shift like the one from desktop to mobile said Brooks. He predicts that the jump will be to Augmented Reality and that through wearable technology like AR lenses people will get more “intel-on-the-go” about potential matches. “When passing by someone who has double matched or is viable and an exceptional date candidate they will be indicated to them.” (A kernel of this potential revolution is already out in the world: Hakuna Live one of the apps Match acquired in its Hyperconnect deal features augmented reality avatars).

What’s more Brooks thinks we need more “coaxing along” when we’re dating. AR as well as “informed tailored advice” from the dating service will deliver helpful nudges in real time such as: “it’s been 20 days since your last date night might be time for a date at <favorite venue>’” he said. “I think the benefits of timely advice will outweigh the creepiness of having a computer act as an informed advisor.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8veW91cnN0b3J5LmNvbS93ZWVrZW5kZXIvaGlnaC1pbnRlbnQtZGF0aW5nLWFwcC1haXNsZS1yZWxhdGlvbnNoaXBzLXRpbmRlci1idW1ibGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finding love in times of swipe: High-intent dating app Aisle connects singles looking for 'serious' relationships,"In a Jane Austen or Nicholas Sparks novel one may find their perfect partner in the perfect setting. But let’s face it with the pandemic still lurking around chances are your Mr or Miss Perfect is not at the bar doing shots with their friends. They are more likely to be tucked inside their blankets in the safety of their houses swiping left or right on an online dating app.





One such dating app is ﻿Aisle﻿. According to Founder and CEO Able Joseph Aisle is the second-most downloaded dating app in the country and the “market leader in high-intent dating”. So how exactly does the Bengaluru-based company differentiate itself from traditional dating apps like Tinder and Bumble?

“Unlike casual ones high intent dating apps are customised for a certain demographic have detailed profiles and track success stories as their measure of accomplishment” Able explains.

Like Match.com in the US and Pairs in Japan Aisle is designed to connect people of Indian origin from across the globe who are looking for ‘serious relationships’.

Founded in 2014 Aisle finds a middle-ground between dating apps and matrimonial platforms. While the latter is solving for marriage the vetting process is limited to traditions and values and not personal compatibility. Dating apps on the other hand have warmed people to the concept of finding love online by the user intent on most of these casual apps remains unestablished.

“We are solving this problem with Aisle. It is a platform meant for meaningful connections where the intent of users is established” Able says.

In its last quarter the app recorded 16 percent more downloads than Bumble becoming the second-most popular dating app in India.





Aisle is certified by Startup India.

Betting on personal problems

A BBM International Business graduate from Bengaluru’s Garden City College Able moved to Dubai in 2012. There he worked with online shopping club Sukar multi-platform network Citruss TV and ecommerce giant Desado.





“Although I was very fulfilled professionally I found it difficult to connect with like-minded people in Dubai” he says.





Tired of the swipe-culture Able figured no dating app catered to the Indian population looking for meaningful relationships. “No dating app catered to the Indian diaspora in entirety. I was inspired to return to India to look for a solution” he adds.

Able Joseph Founder and CEO of Aisle

Aisle dropped the concept of swiping entirely. In its place it introduced the concept of spontaneous interactions. During the lockdown Aisle was quick to replicate these interactions through live streaming by introducing ‘interact before matching’ technology using a feature called ‘Rooms’.

For high intent users who want the liberty to choose a partner but don’t want to wait for many days to go through profiles one-by-one the platform launched Aisle Concierge. “It works best for users looking to enter long term relationships sooner” Able explains.

Women-first platform

On Aisle women get to decide who they want to connect with as well as be the first to initiate the conversations if they anonymously match with someone.

While Aisle does give women control over conversations unlike Bumble it does not have a 24-hour timer for chat expiration.

“We have also tweaked some of the conversation prompts that we use in our icebreakers and have Indianised them to suit our audience. We think this helps single Indians put forth a more realistic picture of who they are” Able says.

Although the basic version of the dating app is free to use premium users can connect by sending out five ‘invites’ a day which are written notes.

“If the number of invites available to the users was unlimited they would lose value and the overall ‘seriousness’ of the community would dwindle” Able says.

Aisle Concierge is an extension of the platform’s premium service. It works like a priority-based quick-effective matchmaking by browsing through a collection of handpicked profiles.





With Concierge members can browse through thousands of manually curated profiles and can prioritise search results based on the things that matter most to them —– from faith to mother tongue and interests.

Matching high-intent singles

About half of Aisle’s members are from metropolitan cities in India. However during the lockdown people moved back to their hometowns and there was a high adoption of the internet in smaller towns and cities. “We plan to focus on Tier-II a lot more this year” Able says. Nine percent of Aisle’s users are NRIs and 20.2 percent of its revenue comes from Indian’s settled abroad.

Team at Aisle

In 2020 Aisle acquired 2056548 users and enabled 784445 matches. A report by Airnow Data states that Aisle saw 276984 downloads from September to November. Since inception Aisle has acquired over three million users.

Aisle gas so far raised Rs 3.7 crore ($500000) from angel investors including serial entrepreneur Sanjay Mehta former Facebook Director Anand Chandrashekaran and Udhyam founder Mekin Maheshwari.





The dating app’s revenue over the last three years has been growing at CAGR of 85 percent. Able lays out the platform's plans for the next two years. He says “Our goal is to double the user growth MAUs and revenue.”

Dating during pandemic

The COVID-19-led lockdowns forced a lot of singles to live alone. Isolation and boredom made people crave social connection both romantic and platonic and ultimately incentivised them to join dating apps.





Major dating apps including brands under Match Group ﻿Tinder﻿ ﻿OkCupid﻿ Match.com and Hinge recorded an increase in downloads and subscribers from pre-COVID-19 levels. Revenue generated by dating apps increased from $2.52 billion in 2019 to $3.08 billion last year globally as the number of users increased from 250 million in 2019 to 270 million in 2020. Recently women-first dating app Bumble went IPO.





Able reveals that matches per user increased by 20 percent and conversations by 12 percent on Aisle’s platform during the lockdown. He shares tips for singles looking to find the right match on dating apps:





Be in tune with what you are looking for and what you want to get out of the experience. Sit by yourself and imagine what your life can look like with a partner.

Talk about it on your dating profile and with the people you match with. Always stay clear of your motivation to be on the app.

Be in control. Just because there are people out there doesn’t mean you have to swipe yes or no on everyone. Take it slow. Try finding a common ground. Focus on one to three matches at a time that’s how you begin to build some real chemistry.





Business of Apps predicts revenue generated by dating apps to further rise to $5.71 billion by 2025 globally. While the rate of vaccine rollout might have picked up looks like millennials will keep looking for love online.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcXVpcmVtYWcucGgvbGlmZS9zZXgtYW5kLXJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcHMvZG8tZGF0aW5nLWFwcC1zdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zLWNvdW50LWFzLWNoZWF0aW5nLWEwMDMwNC0yMDIxMDIxNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Do Dating App Subscriptions Count as 'Cheating'?,"Ever swiped left at those pesky dating app ads? ""Subscribe here for more matches""? You would be surprised by the millions who've opted to actually pay those premium fees for more well premium matches.

According to Match Group which operates dating apps like Tinder and OkCupid the company managed to earn $2.4 billion in revenues in 2020 thanks to its hundreds of millions of users in over 190 countries.

More than half of the revenue comes from Tinder the cash cow of Match Group and arguably the biggest dating apps in the world. And its bringing in huge revenues to its mother company thanks to its 6.7 million worldwide subscribers who are willing to cash in with the hopes of finding the right match.

That number has been growing exponentially since 2015 when only a few thousand were willing to pay to subscribe to dating apps. Within five years dating apps like Tinder bumped up that number to almost seven million.

Meaning more and more are willing to pay up to ""cheat"" the system to get more matches better matches priority in matching and more.

A lot has changed in dating since way back when. Before anyone interested in you would have to find the right time and place to ask you out. But now? Looks like all you need is a credit card to pay a premium subscription fee of a dating app that will give you VIP treatment via its algorithm. These subscriptions are shortcuts to dating but it looks like millions are willing to take the shortcut. And pay for it too.

But this begs the question: does this count as ""cheating""? No not cheating on another person. But cheating to get at the head of the line.

Simba SC coach Didier Gomez Da Rosa has praised his players for the away win they picked up against AS Vita Club in the first group match of the Caf Champions League on Friday.

Congolese striker Chris Mugalu scored the only goal at the Pentecost Martyrs Stadium Kinshasa to fire the Wekundu wa Msimbazi to a 1-0 win over the Democratic Republic of the Congo side to go top of Group A.

Da Rosa who was handling Simba for the first time in the competition after replacing Sven Vandenbroeck has now said his players deserved to win the match as they were dominant in both halves of the contest.

“We are very happy and satisfied because my players put up the kind of game I had asked them to play” Da Rosa told reporters after the match.

“We have come here and returned home with a very important win.

“As I said before these are kind of results we need to make sure we get out of the group stage and reach the quarter-finals and we exactly got that so the win is very vital for us and it will have some impact when we close group stage matches.

“I am happy for all the players we created a number of chances despite playing away but I am happy we picked a win against a team which beat us 5-0 the last time we met at the same venue so this is an improvement from my lands and I am happy for them.”

It was AS Vita who started the match on a high pushing for an opening goal from the wings. In the fourth minute they won a free-kick in a good area when the captain of the night Mohamed Husseini controlled the ball and Ivorian Pascal Wawa headed the danger away.

The East African heavyweights came into the second half a much-improved side and prevented the Congolese from playing as freely as they did in the first half.

They were eventually rewarded in the 60th minute when midfielder Clatous Chama managed to get into a good position and cut the ball back to Luis Miquissone and the Mozambican's effort was blocked by Ousmane Ouattara's hand and the referee awarded the visitors a penalty.

Mugalu held his nerve to send Simon Omossola the wrong way and give his team a lead. Despite a spirited fight-back from the Black Dolphins Simba held on to get maximum points and go top of their group."

Graeme McCormick who stood to become SNP president in 2023 earlier claimed he could gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

However McCormick’s decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Swinney the former deputy first minister of Scotland as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down. The deadline for nominations is noon on Monday.

McCormick said he reached the nomination threshold of 100 signatures but chose to back Swinney after a “lengthy and fruitful conversation” and said this could be a “fresh start”.

In a statement on Sunday night he said: “John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP our government and our people face and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident as they are advanced will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months.

“This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I’m sure that John’s determination to deliver independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

“I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney’s nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.”

McCormick’s supporters had argued it would have been undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. He won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution over mounting a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson earlier attacked Swinney for criticising the planned challenge and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was going up against him.

Swinney who described himself as the candidate to unite the party after a “difficult” few years said an election contest would delay the SNP’s essential rebuild. But he signalled he would win any potential contest telling Sky News that party members “probably know the outcome” between the two potential candidates.

His call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28.

Once Swinney is named the next SNP leader he will have to win a subsequent vote in Holyrood later in the week to become Scotland’s first minister.

It means the party will avoid a three-week leadership contest which would have been triggered had Mr McCormick not stepped aside and received the required 100 nominations.

Assuming there are no last-minute challengers the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members and Mr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister as early as Tuesday.

Barring a bombshell - Swinney will become leader today Connor Gillies Scotland correspondent @ConnorGillies The SNP establishment is quietly breathing a sigh of relief after a wildcard challenger pulled the plug. Grassroots member Graeme McCormick has been a thorn in the side of the party hierarchy for a long time but the truth is he never stood a chance of becoming leader. Apparently he was gathering the required 100 signatures from party members on his clipboard at an independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday. It doesn't get more grassroots than that. His move to trigger a contest would have delayed the inevitable Swinney win but it would have forced the party to spend three weeks having another internal debate. It would have been difficult (and embarrassing) for Mr Swinney and co as they try and pull a divided party back together. Mr McCormick told Sky News he had a discussion with Mr Swinney on Sunday and it seems the pair came to some sort of agreement. Many will see this as a small diplomatic win for the incoming first minister as he uses soft power to spare the SNP’s blushes. Barring a bombshell Mr Swinney will become leader tomorrow and first minister of Scotland on Tuesday as Humza Yousaf packs his bags and heads for the same door he kicked the Greens out of a few weeks ago.

Who is John Swinney?

What direction will the SNP take?

Earlier on Sunday Mr Swinney warned potential challengers from entering the race saying it would delay the party from ""rebuilding"".

""My bid to become SNP leader has received very very comprehensive support within the SNP. I have sent out a message which is about unifying the SNP to strengthen our party and win Scottish independence"" he told Sky's Trevor Phillips.

""So I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we've had under my leadership and bluntly I would just like to get on with that as quickly as I can do because every day that we spend in an internal contest which I think we all probably know the outcome of we delay the ability for the SNP to start its rebuilding and I want to get on with that as quickly as I possibly can do.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtcm9zdGVyLzIwMjQvNS82LzI0MTQ5ODc1L2NvdWxkLXN0ZWVsZXJzLWZvdXJ0aC1yb3VuZC1pb2wtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWZpbmQtaGlzLXdheS10by10aGUtc3RhcnRpbmctbGluZXVwLWluLTIwMjQtbmZs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024,"The Steelers used their first two picks in the 2024 NFL Draft toward the continued overhaul of the offensive line by selecting tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier. Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey leads GOP rival in Pennsylvania Senate race: Poll,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4630466-pennsylvania-senate-bob-casey-david-mccormick/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

In her suspenseful new thriller Do No Harm Christina McDonald brings a controversial topic right out of the real-world headlines and displays a fantastic ability to truly examine it from all sides. The opioid epidemic is certainly not exclusive to the United States but that is my personal frame of reference and that is where McDonald’s book is set. It is an issue that does not have a pro/con side or a yes/no answer and McDonald deftly examines the various roles and issues that surround this crisis.

Emma is a doctor and her husband Nate is a second generation detective and they have a 5-year-old son named Josh. Josh is diagnosed with a rare form of cancer (I promise that is not a spoiler it is in the summary on the book jacket) and this naturally turns this little family’s life upside down. Emma is a young doctor not yet making the kind of money some of us imagine when we think “doctor” and still working through her medical school debts. Nate working for the police department makes a decent salary but not the kind that has allowed them to have much savings or to be prepared for a life-altering crisis such as this.

Emma ultimately believes that there is no other way to make the kind of money they need for Josh’s treatment in the short amount of time they have available other than to sell opioids that as a doctor she has access to. Obviously this immediately sets up a conflict with her husband as she can not let him know what she is doing in an effort not to jeopardise his job. But the stakes quickly get much higher as the reader watches to see who outwits who in a relationship that up to this point has seemed deep and loving and genuine.

Most impressive is McDonald’s inclusion of characters across the entire spectrum from hardline detective to uncaring drug dealer. She shows the motivations of and effects on casual users addicts doctors afraid of DEA red flags doctors not caring about regulations cartels and patients dealing with genuine pain that are caught in the middle of all of it. Rather than addressing the opioid crisis as a whole she has brought us a cog in a giant wheel allowing us to look at one specific (fictional) situation where a person does “this” because of “this” and faced “these” risks but we get to look at that from many different angles.

But do not for one second think this is a dry dull examination of societal problems because there is so much more to this story. Do No Harm is an absolute page turner! McDonald has once again perfectly balanced little twists that the reader can feel clever for figuring out with big sudden gasp-out-loud moments. Fans of the author’s previous books Behind Every Lie and The Night Olivia Fell should be ready to jump right in to this intense new thriller!

Do No Harm is available from Amazon Book Depository and other good book retailers like your local bookstore as of February 16th 2021.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck raises 2024 profit forecast on surging sales of cancer drug Keytruda,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-raises-2024-profit-forecast-strong-cancer-hpv-drugs-sales-2024-04-25/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."

The error is more often than not the result of one setting value in the MT4 options and can be easily fixed in this case.

What Is Error 4109 — Trade Is Not Allowed?

Error 4109 or translated into English Trade Is Not Allowed is the error code MetaTrader 4 gives when an expert advisor is not allowed to trade.

When you load an expert advisor (EA) onto your chart and it tries to submit orders automatically MT4 checks if the operation is allowed.

The operations are related to the functions to submit modify close and delete orders: OrderSend()  OrderModify()  OrderClose()  and OrderDelete() .

If the option is disabled then the EA cannot submit orders or do perform any other trading actions and the error 4109 gets triggered.

Error 4109 is just one of the many error codes in MetaTrader for which ""Trade is not allowed"" is the corresponding translation.

You can find the full list of error codes on the official website for MQL4 language.

Why Trade Is Not Allowed?

This is a security measure to prevent automated trading.

Automated trading can be risky so MT4 has options to completely disable it.

In rare cases this might be due to the broker disabling trading for specific trading accounts or account types.

How to Check If Trading Is Allowed?

When you load an expert advisor you can easily see if MetaTrader allows automated trading or not.

Next to the name of the expert advisor you can see a face. If the face is sad it means that the EA cannot trade.

In this case if the EA tries to submit any order it will receive the error 4109 ""Trade Is Not Allowed"" response from the server.

You can also check for this error in the Experts tab of the Terminal panel.

How to Fix Error 4109?

Fixing Error 4109 - Trade Is Not Allowed - is very simple and only requires to change two options.

Firstly enable Allow automated trading in the MT4 Options under the Expert Advisors tab.

Once this is done you need to check in the EA's properties whether the Allow live trading checkbox is enabled or not.

When the two options above are properly enabled the result is the smiling face next to the EA name on the chart.

Hopefully now your EA will be able to submit update close and delete orders automatically.

In case your broker doesn't allow EA trading you will continue receiving error 4109 when your expert advisors attempts any trading operation. Unfortunately this cannot be solved using options available in MetaTrader platform — you would need to contact your broker about this issue.

Conclusion

Error 4109 is a common error when using expert advisors in MT4 and it means that ""Trade is not allowed"". Basically the EA cannot submit orders or make any changes to orders.

To fix this error you need to enable automated trading in the MT4 options and enable live trading in the EA's properties.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhcHBsZXIuY29tL25ld3NicmVhay9pbi1kZXB0aC9mYWNlYm9vay1wb2xpY3ktZ2Fwcy1sZWF2ZS1tZXNzZW5nZXItYXBwLXVzZXJzLXZ1bG5lcmFibGUtdG8tZmFsc2UtaW5mb3JtYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook policy gaps leave Messenger users vulnerable to false information,"This is AI generated summarization which may have errors. For context always refer to the full article.

Despite efforts by chat apps to curb disinformation rumors continue to circulate unchecked on these platforms amid the COVID-19 pandemic. They potentially contribute to real world harm.

At a glance:

WhatsApp is the most popular chat app in the world but in the Philippines Facebook Messenger is the chat app of choice. WhatsApp places a low 4th in the country’s total number of active users.

Messenger has slowly been rolling out features to curb the spread of misinformation and disinformation but rollouts are staggered. These features are available in only 8 countries excluding the Philippines and 68 others where Messenger outstrips WhatsApp in popularity.

Unscrupulous users are exploiting these gaps in implementation to get around Facebook’s policies on mis- and disinformation.

Facebook personality Lynn Agno aka “Lynn Channel” has been speaking about COVID-19 in videos live-streamed through her Facebook page since late March 2020. She usually discusses conspiracy theories or unverified claims.

Her content has been flagged by Facebook’s 3rd-party fact checkers at least 4 times which means Facebook has put warning labels on her misleading posts and has notified those who interacted with them. As a repeat offender her page has faced restrictions including having its distribution reduced and its ability to monetize or advertise removed.

Agno is aware of Facebook’s mis- and disinformation policies. In one post she said she was sure she would get fact-checked again but she shared the content nonetheless.

Misinformation is misleading content shared with no intent to harm while disinformation is shared with a deliberate intent to deceive or harm.

On Agno’s personal wall followers suggest ways by which she can get around Facebook’s fact-checking policies and policy restrictions. On a post that was flagged by the United States-based fact checking website Lead Stories one Facebook user tells her to “create a group chat instead.” Other followers urge her to “click and save to phone instead then send through messenger.”

‘MAKE A GROUP CHAT.’ A netizen tells social media personality Lynn Agno aka Lynn Channel to start a group chat to share information that has been debunked by Facebook’s 3rd-party fact checkers.

‘SAVE TO PHONE.’ A netizen advises others to share on Messenger information that has been debunked by Facebook’s 3rd-party fact checkers.

This conversation exposes one critical gap in Facebook’s misinformation and disinformation policy which is clearly known to users: little is being done to curb the spread of misleading information on Messenger the messaging app linked to the main Facebook app.

This is important because apart from being linked to the main Facebook platform Messenger is also the second most popular messaging app globally. In the Philippines and in 73 other countries it is the most popular messaging app.

Growing exponentially

Like WhatsApp the other messaging service owned by Facebook growth in the use of Messenger has quadrupled since 2014. (See the graph below.)

Since WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook in 2014 its users worldwide have quadrupled. Globally WhatsApp already has two billion active users as of 2021 according to Hootsuite and We Are Social’s annual digital reports. Up until 2017 the number of active WhatsApp and Facebook users differed only by a few hundred millions.

Also in 2014 Facebook separated the chat function from its main app redirecting users to download a separate one for Messenger. Since then use of the Messenger app globally has also tripled.

In the Philippines Messenger has been the chat app of choice for the past 6 years and its use in the country has also grown exponentially. The chart below shows growth in the use of specific chat apps among internet users in the Philippines since 2015. Messenger use has quadrupled since 2015.

Comparatively use of other messaging apps among Philippine internet users has not grown significantly.

Data from SimilarWeb as of Tuesday February 2 also show that Messenger is the number one app in the Philippines on the Google Play Store based on Usage Rank. Usage Rank according to SimilarWeb is an algorithm that is based on current installs and active users.

Given the growing number of messaging app users and the way some users are using gaps to get around Facebook’s mis- and disinformation policies the impact of current fact-checking efforts could be significantly undermined if no urgent action is done.

Slow action staggered rollouts

Below is a timeline of when 3 chat apps – WhatsApp Messenger and Viber – began putting in place features to minimize the spread of misinformation and disinformation on their platforms.

Action against misinformation and disinformation has been more aggressive on WhatsApp since 2018. That same year WhatsApp introduced labels to indicate when a message has been forwarded and limited the number of times users can forward a message to multiple chats at once.

In August 2019 they introduced a label to show that a message has been forwarded through a chain of 5 or more people. In April 2020 they announced that these kinds of messages could be forwarded to only one chat at a time.

These same policies have been introduced at a much slower pace in Facebook Messenger.

Messenger began to label forwarded messages in April 2019 almost a year after WhatsApp first began to act. These labels only say that the message has been forwarded and do not identify messages that have been forwarded through a chain of 5 or more people.

“We’re committed to ensuring everyone has access to accurate information and removing harmful content related to COVID-19 across our family of apps” a Facebook representative said in an email to Rappler in September 2020.

“We recently introduced a forwarding limit on Messenger so messages can only be forwarded to five people or groups at a time. Limiting forwarding is an effective way to slow the spread of viral misinformation and harmful content that has the potential to cause real world harm” the representative said.

As of November 2 2020 however this feature remained unavailable in the Philippines.

When they announced its release last September 3 Facebook didn’t mention that it was rolled out in 8 countries only. A Facebook representative specified in an email to Rappler that the forward limit had been made available in the US New Zealand Croatia Sri Lanka Chile Tunisia Australia and Myanmar since August 27 2020. Majority of these countries had elections in 2020.

Limits to fact-checking

Facebook has 3rd-party fact-checking partners in most countries where Messenger is popular. These include Canada Australia New Zealand Iraq Libya Egypt Norway and Greece. In other countries like Afghanistan and South Sudan they do not have partners.

Unfortunately even though information spreads differently on public social media channels versus chat apps Facebook regards their efforts against misinformation and disinformation on their main platform – like 3rd-party fact checking and removing content that may lead to real-world harm – as part of their efforts on Messenger.

This is even though fact-checking posts on Facebook does not guarantee that misleading and potentially harmful messages do not spread on Messenger.

In an email to Rappler a Facebook spokesperson explained that the Messenger and WhatsApp platforms have different user bases and features making it challenging to standardize approaches to misinformation and disinformation across the board.

Facebook said it had run separate tests on forward limits – the number of chats a message can be forwarded to at once – to assess its impact for Messenger while exploring other options to limit the spread of misinformation and disinformation.

Facebook’s fact-checking program labels posts as false or misleading and accordingly sanctions pages that are repeat offenders by limiting their ability to monetize and reduces the distribution of those posts.

Thus while Facebook takes action against the screenshots of false messages shared publicly on the platform it stops there. On Messenger the messages can continue to spread unchecked. Users are still free to take screenshots of photos download videos or forward existing content to their friends and family.

Real world harm

Slower action and staggered rollouts might cause harm in countries where Messenger is the preferred chat app. Hootsuite and We Are Social’s data show that Facebook Messenger is preferred in 74 countries. Their data is based on the average daily Android app users in each country in December 2019.

Among the countries that prefer Messenger over WhatsApp is the US where Facebook says it had been cracking down on mis- and disinformation in the run-up to the presidential elections in November 2020.

Myanmar where Facebook was used to incite hate speech against Rohingya Muslims in 2018 is another country that prefers Messenger. They had a general election on November 8 2020. At the time of writing the country has experienced a coup d’etat ousting the elected civilian government. The new military government has blocked access to Facebook.

Messenger implemented a forward limit in both of these countries.

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic Rappler had spotted false claims on the platform.

Amid measles outbreaks in 2018 3 different people emailed Rappler about a forwarded message warning others not to receive tetanus vaccines at health centers. The hoax claimed that members of the Islamic State (ISIS) were spreading AIDS and killing people through these shots.

Rappler fact-checked the claim on December 21 2018 or 10 days after Congress extended martial law in Mindanao which was originally declared after ISIS-affiliated extremists clashed with government troops in October 2017.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic Rappler fact-checked a number of forwarded messages that caused panic.

In January 2020 at least 5 rumors circulated saying there were COVID-19-positive patients in hospitals or an office building. In March a list of hotels and malls to avoid circulated – these were supposedly places that 11 COVID-19-positive patients frequented.

Also circulated through Messenger were supposed cures against the virus which ranged from ingesting aspirin dissolved in lemon juice boiled with honey or eating boiled garlic and drinking the water used to boil it.

In June a conspiracy theory about COVID-19 spread on Messenger telling recipients not to get vaccinated against the disease once a vaccine is available in the Philippines. The vaccine the message said would be a way to forcibly inject microchips into citizens.

As in the case of the Dengvaxia scare this could affect how people will respond to vaccination when the COVID-19 vaccines are finally available.

All of these illustrate the need for Facebook to act immediately to prevent real world harm. – with Gemma Bagayaua-Mendoza/Rappler.com",,,,,,,,,

The NFL wide receiver who most recently played with the New York Jets announced Saturday he has signed with the Premier Lacrosse League and declared his eligibility to be selected in the league's draft next month.

“As many of you know my roots are in lacrosse"" Hogan wrote on Twitter ""and I’m excited to fight for a roster spot with the best in the world!”

The 33-year-old Hogan was a lacrosse star at Penn State playing on athletic scholarship with the Nittany Lions from 2007-10. He had 57 goals and 14 assists in 43 career games and was a team captain as a senior.

Hogan was hurt most of his sophomore season so he had another year of sports eligibility after his final year. Despite not playing football at Penn State he enrolled at Monmouth and joined the team there — playing quarterback wide receiver cornerback and special teams during his one season with the Hawks.

Hogan then pursued an NFL career signing with San Francisco as an undrafted free agent in 2011. Stints with the Giants and Miami Dolphins followed before he joined the Buffalo Bills where he got his first regular-season playing experience. After four years with the Bills Hogan signed with New England — where he was part of two Super Bowl-winning teams in three seasons.

He played for Carolina in 2019 and joined the Jets last season catching 14 passes for 118 yards in five games before suffering a high ankle sprain. New York waived him from the injured reserve list in December.

Hogan who earned the nickname “7-Eleven” for his propensity to always be open has 216 career receptions for 2795 yards and 18 touchdowns. He would often reference his lacrosse background during TV intros during games.

The Premier Lacrosse League which merged in December with Major League Lacrosse is scheduled to hold its entry draft on March 25. Hogan will be eligible to be selected by one of the league's eight teams among the 24 picks over the draft's three rounds.

RELATED: Las Vegas Travel Guide

According to research from Smart Lighting Industries a U.K.-based team of lighting equipment distributors the Las Vegas Strip is as bright as it is thanks to the presence of 12000000 lights — a dazzling display that takes an estimated $485587824 to run annually. Apparently the money spent by the millions of visitors attracted by the lights each year makes the expense worth it.

With its many casinos and hotels the Las Vegas Strip is the world's most expensive attraction to keep illuminated 24/7 but many other hot spots around the globe are also expensive to light according to Smart Lighting's research.

Though it's in third place just after the Empire State Building (68000 lights at an annual cost of $12918520) New York City's Times Square seems like a low-budget landmark when compared to the price tag of lighting the Strip. According to Smart Lighting's estimations the famous assemblage of ever-illuminated billboards and blinking Broadway lights in the city that never sleeps clocks in at just under $10 million each year.

Going down the list from there things get much more ""affordable."" The Sydney Opera House costs around $1974955 to light each year while London's Buckingham Palace comes in at approximately $1524253 and the Eiffel Tower in Paris at $1335246.

Despite their incredible displays the Statue of Liberty Ain Dubai Luxor Sky Beam and Burj Khalifa are all estimated to cost less than $1 million to light each year.

Is New Zealand’s New Tourism Ad Brilliant or Tone Deaf?: New Zealand’s latest tourism campaign is approaching marketing from a more unconventional way to say the least. Global marketers have been tackling the challenge of adapting to a more empathetic tone during the pandemic. Some were able to manage as Skift earlier reported but others left many industry observers confused. Pure New Zealand’s recent “Traveling under the social influence” ad is one of the latter. While it aims to discourage influencer-inspired tourist photos at popular sights the campaign instead treads a fine line between genius and insensitivity.

In the side parking lot of the old Eldorado Casino site in Henderson’s Water Street District lay what’s left of the sign that used to hang on the back entrance of the property.

New ownership is modernizing the building in a $5 million renovation and that starts by sprucing up the exterior with a new blue and yellow paint job landscaping and signage.

The casino closed since last March because of the pandemic will eventually reopen under new ownership. It was purchased from Boyd Gaming in December by DeSimone Gaming which also owns Railroad Pass in Henderson.

The modernization will come with another significant change — the property will be renamed The Pass when it reopens. They anticipate a spring opening pending approval from the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

The new name is a nod to a cross-pollination marketing effort with Railroad Pass but also an effort to stand apart since an assortment of other casinos around the country including one in Reno already claim the Eldorado name.

“As Boyd said in its press release when the sale was announced the (Eldorado) was a nonessential asset for Boyd but it’s going to be a very essential asset for me” said Joe DeSimone the company’s owner and operator.

It is eerily quiet at the shuttered property which opened in 1961 and is a favorite of longtime Henderson residents on this afternoon as owner DeSimone walks through.

He points to a bay of outdated slot machines and says they will be replaced. He looks over blueprints showing more changes including an $800000 sports book upgrade and new banquet room. They will also bring back table games to become the only downtown Henderson property with a casino pit.

The new offerings include an “upscale” Italian restaurant and a 24-hour café that will be named after his daughter Emelia.

There were be a shuttle taking patrons between the two properties which are about seven miles apart. They will also share the same rewards club.

“It’s going to be busy in here all hours of the day once we open” he said. “That’s the goal. It’s going to be fun.”

The building is wedged between the new Lifeguard Arena — headquarters for the minor league Henderson Silver Knights — and the Rainbow Club casino. The arena will also host youth hockey events to bring many visitors to the area some of whom will stumble into the property.

That’s especially true because just steps away from the arena is a 500-space parking garage that came with the transaction of the casino. DeSimone doesn’t plan to charge casino patrons to park.

“Having the Eldorado property reopened is only going to reinvigorate that area and play off the arena” said Michelle Romero a Henderson councilwoman whose district encompasses Water Street.

Future upgrades could include a hotel tower which would give the property the lone hotel rooms in downtown. It would be perfect for families in town for youth hockey at the arena.

“Depending on the needs downtown that could be an option” DeSimone said. “People are spending money down here and I think that’s only going to continue. There’s momentum here.”

A real estate developer by trade — he owns First Federal Realty in Henderson — DeSimone said he took an immediate liking to the casino industry after purchasing Railroad Pass from MGM Resorts International in 2015.

He rattles off names of some of the most well-known executives in Las Vegas gaming — Kirk Kerkorian Sheldon Adelson and new Las Vegas Sands CEO Rob Goldstein — and says they give him inspiration.

He lauded companies like Boyd and MGM saying “Nevada should be proud to have them” but said an independent casino operator can sometimes bring a certain hands-on mentality that a big company might not be able to. That’s how he operates his properties.

“Those are wonderful companies to deal with” DeSimone said. “But having a small-businessperson with the flexibility and capital and motivation necessary to liven up a place that makes sense. We don’t have the overhead or obligations that a Strip hotel has. I try to talk to my employees at Railroad Pass every day and I listen to them.”

Soon new signs will be hung outside the building to further usher in a new era. DeSimone is confident it will remain a locals favorite calling his plans a perfect fit for Water Street.

“The entire deal with The Pass feels really good” he said. “It feels like it did when I bought Railroad Pass and that’s worked out really well. Ten or 15 years ago I wouldn’t have thought I’d be a casino owner but gaming is great. I love it.”"

The Microsoft Online site is an excellent resource in your search for the right template.

Instructions in this article apply to Microsoft Word for Microsoft 365 Word 2019 Word 2016 and Word for Mac.

What Is a Template?

Templates are pre-formatted document file types that create a copy of the template contents when opened. These versatile files help you quickly create documents like flyers research papers and resumes with no manual formatting. Template files for Microsoft Word use the extensions .dot .dotx or .dotm.

When you open a template Word opens a new document with all the formatting in place ready for you to customize as needed. You can then save the document with a unique filename.

How to Access Online Templates

You can find and download Microsoft Office online templates in Word. Here's how:

Select File > New to start a new document. Select a template or use the search box to find alternatives. When you find the template you want to use select it to see a preview and description. Select Create to open the template.

How to Access Online Templates for Word on the Mac

But of course optimism is a relative term. Do you think we can realistically hold warming to or below a 2 °C increase at this point?

A: That would require us to get the policy right to get many many countries involved and to be lucky on quite a few of the technological advances. That’s pretty much a best case. Anything better than that is not at all realistic and there are days when even that doesn’t seem realistic.

It’s not out of the question but it requires awfully good progress. Even something like do we get [an energy] storage miracle or not? We can’t make ourselves dependent on that. Batteries today can’t within a factor of 20 store for the seasonal variation that you get [from intermittent sources like wind and solar]. We just don’t make enough batteries; it would be way too expensive. So we have to have other paths—like fission or fusion—that can give us that reliable source of electricity which we’ll be even more dependent on than ever.

IMPOSSIBLE FOODS

Q: In the book you cover a broad array of hard-to-solve sectors. The one I still have the hardest time with in terms of fully addressing it is food. The scale is massive. We’ve barely begun. We fundamentally don’t have replacements that completely eliminate the highly potent emissions from burping livestock and fertilizer. How hopeful are you about agriculture?

A: There are [companies] including one in the [Breakthrough Energy Ventures] portfolio called Pivot Bio that significantly reduce the amount of fertilizer you need. There are advances in seeds including seeds that do what legumes do: that is they’re able to [convert nitrogen in the soil into compounds that plants can use] biologically. But the ability to improve photosynthesis and to improve nitrogen fixation is one of the most underinvested things.

In terms of livestock it’s very difficult. There are all the things where they feed them different food like there’s this one compound that gives you a 20% reduction [in methane emissions]. But sadly those bacteria [in their digestive system that produce methane] are a necessary part of breaking down the grass. And so I don’t know if there’ll be some natural approach there. I’m afraid the synthetic [protein alternatives like plant-based burgers] will be required for at least the beef thing.

Now the people like Memphis Meats who do it at a cellular level—I don’t know that that will ever be economical. But Impossible and Beyond have a road map a quality road map and a cost road map that makes them totally competitive.

As for scale today they don’t represent 1% of the meat in the world but they’re on their way. And Breakthrough Energy has four different investments in this space for making the ingredients very efficiently. So yeah this is the one area where my optimism five years ago would have made this steel and cement the three hardest.

Now I’ve said I can actually see a path. But you’re right that saying to people “You can’t have cows anymore”—talk about a politically unpopular approach to things.

Q: Do you think plant-based and lab-grown meats could be the full solution to the protein problem globally even in poor nations? Or do you think it’s going to be some fraction because of the things you’re talking about the cultural love of a hamburger and the way livestock is so central to economies around the world?

A: For Africa and other poor countries we’ll have to use animal genetics to dramatically raise the amount of beef per emissions for them. Weirdly the US livestock because they’re so productive the emissions per pound of beef are dramatically less than emissions per pound in Africa. And as part of the [Bill and Melinda Gates] Foundation’s work we’re taking the benefit of the African livestock which means they can survive in heat and crossing in the monstrous productivity both on the meat side and the milk side of the elite US beef lines.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzIvMTIvMjIyODEwMzMvbWljcm9zb2Z0LWVkZ2UtZXh0ZW5zaW9ucy1tYXJpby1rYXJ0LTY0LXNvbmljLW1pbmVjcmFmdC1nYW1lc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft's Edge extensions store hosted illicit copies of Sonic and Mario Kart 64,"In the hours since we published this story all but one game we found has been removed. We had also seen another Sonic game another Mario game a couple of Pac-Man games and a variety of copies of 2048 Flappy Bird Fruit Ninja Temple Run but they aren’t available anymore. All that remains is what appears to be a copy of Google Chrome’s dinosaur game.

Initially we saw 35 listings across 10 different “developers” with names like “GamePro Inc” “Gamelands” “StayReal” and “Kday” including a number of duplicate games. Many listings even from different developers had very similar descriptions indicating that they could be coming from the same source.

Here are screenshots of just a few of the games we found:

Oddly Microsoft itself appeared to promote the browser extensions in what looks to be a now-deleted tweet from the @MSEdgeDev account which we saw via ResetEra.

We didn’t see this purported tweet ourselves and it isn’t currently on the @MSEdgeDev account right now. But one brave soul on Twitter Jordan Chase said he installed the Mario Kart 64 extension on Twitter — and he said that in a reply to a now-deleted tweet from @MSEdgeDev.

In his tweet Chase said the Mario Kart 64 extension downloaded a ROM of the game. While emulators are generally legal and some sites (like Internet Archive) host abandonware you can play in a browser it’s extremely unlikely that Nintendo which is well-known for cracking down on sites hosting ROMs and pirated content would let people download copies of its most-loved games over free browser extensions.

The Tetris extension also appeared to be a clone of the famous puzzle game though it didn’t download a ROM according to Chase. He also said he installed a Pac-Man extension and it “seems like it’s using direct assets from the original game.” I didn’t install the games myself in case they were doing something nefarious and I’d recommend against putting them on your machine.

Some of the games we found had reviews dating back to October indicating they had been sitting unnoticed in Microsoft’s catalog for quite some time. It’s unclear why they were available for so long.

Many listings attempted to skirt trouble with dubious disclaimers acknowledging the listings aren’t affiliated with the original games. Here’s one we found on the listing for Mario Kart 64 for example:

IMPORTANT: This emulator is not affiliated with nor endorsed by Nintendo. All graphics games and other multimedia are copyrighted to their respective owners and authors. This game is for ALL Mario fans!

Microsoft and Nintendo tell The Verge they are looking into the situation."

Announcing the grant the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) touted an alignment of values namely a shared commitment to global public health. Documents suggest U.S.-based Moderna agreed to uphold the group’s “equitable access principles” — the idea that vaccines should be distributed according to need and at affordable prices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2Zpc3JhZWwuY29tL2ZyYW5jZS1yZWNvbW1lbmRzLW9ubHktc2luZ2xlLXZhY2NpbmUtZG9zZS1mb3ItdGhvc2UtcmVjb3ZlcmVkLWZyb20tY292aWQtMTkv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGltZXNvZmlzcmFlbC5jb20vZnJhbmNlLXJlY29tbWVuZHMtb25seS1zaW5nbGUtdmFjY2luZS1kb3NlLWZvci10aG9zZS1yZWNvdmVyZWQtZnJvbS1jb3ZpZC0xOS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,France recommends single vaccine dose for those recovered from COVID-19,"France on Friday recommended that people who have already recovered from COVID-19 receive a single vaccine dose becoming the first country to issue such advice.

All three COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the European Union are administered in the form of two doses delivered several weeks apart. Israel is also vaccinating using such two-stage shots.

This is because clinical trials showed that immunity against the disease was significantly higher after individuals received two shots.

France’s public health authority said Friday however that people who had already been infected with COVID-19 develop an immune response similar to that bestowed by a vaccine dose and that a single dose after infection would likely suffice.

“A single vaccine dose will also play the role of reminding” their immune system how to fight COVID-19 it said.

The authority recommended a gap of between three and six months after infection before individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 receive a jab.

“At the moment no country has clearly positioned itself in terms of a sole vaccination dose for people who have already contracted COVID-19” it said.

France has accelerated its vaccination program in recent weeks but it is still in its infancy.

As of Thursday over 2.1 million people had received at least one vaccine dose with almost 535800 having already received two.

At least 3.4 million people have had confirmed COVID-19 infections in France although there are likely to have been far more given the relative lack of accessible testing during the pandemic’s first wave.

Two recent US studies suggest that a single vaccine dose may work in individuals who have already recovered from COVID-19.

One paper said that immunity in individuals who had had COVID-19 and then received a single vaccine dose “is equal to or even exceeds” that of people who have not had COVID-19 but received two vaccine doses.

A vaccine still in development by Johnson & Johnson works with a single dose but it is yet to receive emergency use authorisation from EU and US regulators.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXRyb2l0bmV3cy5jb20vcGljdHVyZS1nYWxsZXJ5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZGV0cm9pdC1jaXR5LzIwMjEvMDIvMTMvZGV0cm9pdGVycy1saW5lLXVwLWdldC12YWNjaW5hdGVkLWZpcnN0LXNlbmlvci1zYXR1cmRheS80NDc3NTc4MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Detroiters line up to get vaccinated on first Senior Saturday,"Detroiters line up to get vaccinated on first Senior Saturday

Are the odds in their favor?” noted that “chemical recycling is attracting billions in capital spending but environmentalists don’t think it will solve the plastic waste problem.”

This isn’t news. Consumers and especially anti-plastics activists have lost faith in the plastic industry’s ability to help solve a problem it has been accused of creating and the slow pace of advanced recycling technologies aka chemical recycling hasn’t helped renew confidence that this will be the silver bullet that will rid the world of plastic waste. But attempts continue unabated and the cost of trying is proving to be extremely high.

Even the pace of adoption of various types of plastic from recyclable traditional plastics such as PET and HDPE to bioplastics as alternatives to traditional plastics seems extremely slow. The chemical recycling industry also has taken hits as noted above. For example the CEN/ACS paper opened by saying that in 2022 “Mondelez International intends to start packaging its Philadelphia brand cream cheese in a tube made from chemically recycled plastics. The packaging maker Berry Global will mold the containers. Petrochemical giant Sabic will supply the polypropylene. And the start-up Plastic Energy will produce feedstock for that polypropylene from postconsumer plastics at a plant it is constructing on Sabic’s site in Geleen Netherlands.”

We’re not holding our collective breaths.

For at least a decade I’ve written blogs about the many consumer brand owners such as Kraft Heinz Mondelez and Nestlé being pressured by anti-plastics activist group As You Sow to find alternatives to single-use plastic packaging as a means to end plastic waste in the environment. Through shareholder proposals As You Sow keeps applying the pressure writing about the continued lack of progress these companies are making and the slow pace of adoption of alternative materials most of which are no “greener” than plastics when you examine their life-cycle analyses. Still to appease these activist groups big brand owners keep promising to find the Holy Grail of recycling that will turn mountains of plastic trash into beautifully pure new plastic or millions of gallons of fuel and other base chemicals from which to make new plastics.

Promises promises.

The CEN/ACS report is correct when it says that Mondelez “isn’t the only multinational firm promising a high-profile business to start-ups some of which haven’t even built their first recycling plants yet. Food beverage and consumer product companies — under fire to do something about mounting plastic waste — are clamoring to set up relationships like [Mondelez Berry and Sabic]. They have embraced chemical recycling as a means of incorporating renewable content without the performance compromises common with current recycling methods. Seeing a market recycling companies will spend billions of dollars on recycling projects in the US and Europe in the 2020s.”

An announcement from recycler Agilyx Corp. applauded the National Recycling Strategy announced by the US Environmental Protection Agency touting the “significant progress in domestic investment in the US recycling system. In the past three years 64 projects in mechanical and advanced recycling in the US have been announced valued at $5.3 billion according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC). Together these projects have the potential to divert more than four million metric tons of waste from landfills each year. In addition many companies have made significant commitments to use recycled plastics in their packaging and products” said Agilyx’s announcement of support.

Many of the announced projects for chemical recycling facilities that I’ve written about over the past five years are at this point dead in the water. Some have been limping along for two decades still unable to take in any significant amount of plastic waste to produce commercially viable amounts of fuel chemicals or new plastic. Yet new announcements for chemical recycling facilities pop up in my inbox like dandelions on a spring lawn announcing large investments and making even grander promises of helping solve the plastic waste crisis.

For example Virginia Governor Ralph Northam announced on June 2 2020 that Braven Environmental a company that uses pyrolysis technology to derive fuel from landfill-bound plastic will invest $31.7 million to establish a manufacturing operation in Cumberland County. Virginia successfully competed with North Carolina and South Carolina for the project.

Northam boasted of the “well-paid job opportunities” for the citizens of Cumberland County and the company’s contribution to lessening Virginia’s environmental footprint. Braven received a $150000 grant from the Commonwealth Opportunity Fund to assist Cumberland County with the project. The Virginia Tobacco Region revitalization commission approved $65000 in Tobacco Region Opportunity Funds for the project and funding and services to support the company’s employee training activities will be provided through the Virginia Jobs Investment Program. Braven plans to create a total of over 80 new jobs within 18 months of the first phase of this project. (Read the article PlasticsToday published about this project.)

Virginia’s chemical recycling bills a “step backwards.”

A January 26 2021 report in the online newsletter Blue Virginia criticized two plastics “chemical recycling” bills in the Virginia Assembly saying that these bills “represent a step backwards” for Virginia’s climate and public health. SB1164 and HB 2173 are “rapidly moving forward” in the current session and “represent textbook examples of ‘greenwashing’” according to Blue Virginia.

HB 2173 Advanced Recycling defines advanced recycling as a “manufacturing process for the conversion of post-use polymers and recovered feedstocks into basic hydrocarbon raw materials and other material.” The bill also defines “gasification” “post-use polymers” and other terms related to advanced recycling. SB 1164 is also an advanced recycling bill with the same definition as HB 2173 but adding that advanced recycling is “not considered waste management.”

In an attempt to find out if there is any connection between the two bills in the Virginia Assembly and the proposed construction of the Braven Environmental facility I called the Economic Development Authority (EDA) and left messages requesting a progress report on the Braven facility. An assistant at the EDA office said she passed my message along to two other people. Attempts to reach those individuals were unsuccessful. No returned phone calls were received.

All that is being received are promises and commitments. We’re still waiting for the big cleanup to begin.

University researchers pick up the ball.

As some of the world’s largest companies brand owners and Big Oil pour resources into chemical recycling to counter the image of “plastic polluters” another group is also hard at work in its labs — academe.

For example Steven Crossley an associate professor at the University of Oklahoma School of Chemical Biological and Materials Engineering was recently awarded a four-year $2-million collaborative grant by the Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation program of the National Science Foundation to advance polymer recycling technologies in hopes of sending fewer multi-layer plastics to landfills. Crossley's is the latest in a number of ongoing projects in academic settings trying to solve the problem.

Recycling the announcement noted has its challenges and the big one is “for researchers to design a process that allows more of the plastics we use in our everyday lives to end up in our recycle bins rather than the local landfill. But not only does this require scientists to design innovative ways to break down these various types of plastic it also must be economical for the plastic producers and recyclers.”

Another challenge to recycling — especially mechanical recycling — involves the impurities that accompany recyclate to the recycling facility. “Impurities such as food and drink in the bottom of a plastic container . . . are difficult to eliminate and once melted down degrade the quality of the recycled material” said the university.

Steven Crossley of the University of Oklahoma School of Chemical Biological and Materials Engineering is leading a chemical recycling project exploring the use of catalysts to neutralize impurities in recyclate.

That’s where Crossley’s work comes into play. “But what if” he asks “we could design catalysts that target and convert those impurities to either make them more compatible with the rest of the plastic or convert them selectively to carbon dioxide or light gases that could easily be removed producing a pure stream of higher value.”

Crossley’s research group’s efforts will be complemented by computational simulations led by Associate Professor Bin Wang and experimental efforts in a scaled-up continuous system led by Professor Lance Lobban. Both researchers work in the School of Chemical Biological and Materials Engineering at the University of Oklahoma (OU).

As we all know recycling requires the mass participation of consumers actually putting their recyclable items into a recycling bin. As recyclers like to say: “We can’t recycle it if we can’t get our hands on it.” So in addition to upgrading mixed plastic waste streams using catalysts Adam Feltz associate professor of psychology at OU “will incorporate public perception surveys to determine how best to motivate appropriate public participation in plastic waste collection systems.”

That’s certainly one angle I never thought of — a clean and beautiful environment isn’t enough “motivation” for consumers to put their recyclable plastic (and other materials) into the recycling system. We need a psychologist on the team to determine what needs to happen in peoples’ minds to actually motivate them to put recyclable items in a recycling bin.

Talk about “giving it the old college try!”

Supply of recycled plastics fails to meet demand.

The CEN/ACS report cited the “deep skepticism” surrounding the various chemical recycling methods from groups such as Greenpeace and GAIA (Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives) which both have expressed doubt in recent papers that chemical recycling will ever be viable. In GAIA’s report “All Talk and No Recycling: An Investigation of the US ‘Chemical Recycling’ Industry” the group “alleges that the plastics and fossil-fuel industries are promoting chemical recycling ‘as the silver bullet to solve the plastic crisis.’”

The ACC reports that the demand for recycled plastics is increasing to meet brand owners’ sustainability goals. But will there be enough recycled material to meet that demand? The CEN/ACS report said that it’s doubtful. Given the size of the plastic waste problem and the “big commitments of consumer product companies” there are also big opportunities. However meeting demand won’t be easy. Agliyx CEO Tim Stedman told CEN/ACS that his company would “need to build more than 20 plants with 100 tons per day of capacity to meet a target of 30% recycled content in polystyrene packaging in North America and Europe which half the market has already committed to.”

Have consumer products companies over-committed in their “sustainable” promises? People in the industry who commented for the CEN/ACS report say absolutely like Berry’s Robert Flores VP of Sustainability: “There is actually not currently enough [recycled material] out there to meet all those goals quite frankly.”

The CEN/ACS report concludes what most of us in the industry already know and that is despite the demand “environmentalists say the first chemical recycling projects are having difficulty getting off the ground.” Noting the Greenpeace report “Deception by the Numbers” released last September 52 projects were analyzed. These projects make up the $4.8 billion investment figure cited by the ACC. Greenpeace estimates that a third of these projects are not likely to be viable. From my own research over the past several years I think one-third is a bit optimistic.

But that’s the way science operates. Failure is part of the game. Trial and error is the way advances in science are made and there are a few chemical recycling plants in operation that are seeing some measure of success in actually producing fuels and chemicals from the plastic waste they collect from various municipalities. But as they tell me — and as Agilyx’s CEO points out to CEN/ACS — there’s not nearly enough capacity to make a dent in the waste being generated.

PlasticsToday has run numerous articles and blogs regarding the problems being encountered by entrepreneurial start-ups that appear to be good at finding investors but not so great at making any real progress in eliminating plastic waste. CEN/ACS’s report mentions Loop Industries toward the end noting the promises and commitments that company has made over the past three years. We all know the situation Loop Industries has found itself in.

I think that the sub-headline in the CEN/ACS report says it best: “Chemical recycling is attracting billions in capital spending but environmentalists don’t think it will solve the plastic waste problem.”

It’s up to these companies to prove the environmentalists wrong — and they should do so sooner rather than later.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxnYnRxbmF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyL2h5cGUtbGFkeS1nYWdhcy1saW1pdGVkLWVkaXRpb24tb3Jlb3Mtd29ydGgtaW50ZXJuZXQtZGVjaWRlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is the hype over Lady Gaga's limited edition Oreos worth it?

A “family size” package of Oreo cookies typically sells for $4 to $5 at the grocery store but one version of Oreo cookies is selling for $15 on Amazon and up to $199.95 on eBay. Multiple packs are currently running up to $500.

Why the mark-up? These are Lady Gaga Oreos designed to please her hungry little (cookie) monsters.

More specifically they are “Lady Gaga Limited Edition Chromatica” Oreos created in honor of the out entertainer’s pandemic-delayed Chromatica album from last year. Instead of black and white colors the cookie is made of two pink wafers with green crème filling packaged in a shiny wrapper.

In case you’ve been under a rock the last hundred-plus years Oreos are a “sandwich” cookie introduced on March 6 1912 consisting of two wafers with a sweet crème filling. It’s the best-selling cookie brand in the United States sold here by the Nabisco division of Mondelēz International.

They now come in more versions than they did a century ago including “Double Stuf” “Mega Stuf” “Most Stuf” “thin” chocolate-coated and white chocolate-coated. Around the world the filling has more than 85 flavors including chocolate mint strawberry cheesecake red velvet golden gingerbread Peeps Swedish Fish kettle corn PB&J carrot cake Wasabi hot chicken wings mango blueberry and Key Lime Pie.

In this rendition of the American classic cookies the packages come in different Chromatica-themed designs with three embossed Chromatica-related symbols. They taste like the Golden Oreos although some say they detect the green dye in the filling. Others have said they taste a hint of meat possibly in tribute to the raw beef meat dress that Gaga wore at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards.

Gaga’s Oreos have another twist: They have a QR code on the package that customers can scan to hear “musical messages of kindness” from Gaga herself such as: “I’d share my cookies with you” “Inside we are really made the same” “Kindness rules all” and “Keep looking for Wonderland.”

Some packages tout a contest that offers a chance to win a “meet and greet” with Gaga which “may be virtual.”

The connection to Gaga (aka Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta) in addition to the limited edition label has people hoarding these cookies and putting them on eBay for much more than they cost at the supermarket. In certain areas they’re hard to find making her cookie monsters want them even more.

This is where the internet eager for any crumbs from Gaga does its thing.

On Reddit some users just want to know what the fuss is all about.

“First jockstraps now this?” wonders Redditor contrahall referring to the neon pink Chromatica jockstraps that sell for $30 each on Gaga’s website. (Besides the jockstrap other Chromatica-themed items on ladygaga.com include a $15 bar of soap; $15 bandanna; $20 thong; $25 briefs; $25 coffee mug; $35 T-shirts; $55 pillow; $70 hoodies; $75 sweatpants; $120 rain boots and $150 bomber jacket.)

“Going for that crème-filled vibe I guess” answers throwaway963963963.

“[Is] Gaga the next Oreo spokeswoman?” suggests GaleZepher.

“I really just don’t know what to do with her anymore” sighs BlackJesus420.

Others focus on the money angle and Gaga’s built-in fan base.

“Nothing says capitalism like people hoarding and selling Lady Gaga Limited Edition Chromatica Oreos” says Facebook poster Tim W. showing the screenshot of an eBay listing that’s getting approximately 72 views per hour.

“You already know someone is going to keep a moldy unopened stale package of these for like 30 years to make a quick buck down the line” concurs ChandelierwAtermelon on Reddit.

When fans combine the cookie with another item they can post messages such as this one from SilverMind9: “Going to eat this in my jockstrap.”

“She knows the gays will eat up whatever content she give us” says Redditor OgianttoadO.

“Abandoning my gluten free diet to eat these” confesses lifeislife3.

“Somebody out there’s gonna pull a Vince McMahon and eat an entire box at once for their weekly cheat meal” predicts 2RINITY.

But by far the most vocal commenters on the internet are the dozens of YouTubers who have posted reviews of the cookies and weighed in on the cultural significance of a world that contains Lady Gaga Oreos.

People such as Leeko Rae a social influencer from California who appears in and out of drag for an 11-minute review have a lot to say about Gaga’s cookies.

“If you would have told me a full year ago that Chromatica was going to be one performance and an Oreo release I would have called you a bitter Madonna fan but a full year later here we are.” Leeko says stressing he has nothing against the cookies themselves. “I mean if you can find them good for you. I don’t think this is something that you have to like run out to the store to go get.”

As he takes a bite he adds “it’s cute though. This is nice. You just put them on your little bookshelf with your Chromatica vinyl and jockstrap and turn the party. The Oreos taste great and I guess that’s all that matters at the end of the day right?”

Most online commenters seem happy for Gaga and her Chromatica tie-ins. Many say they’re likely to try her cookies before they disappear — and judging by the buzz they’re getting it’s doubtful this will be the last of the performer-cookie collaborations.

After all if Lady Gaga Oreos can cause such a commotion can Adele Thin Mints or Orville Peck Twizzlers be far behind?",,,,,,,,,

A $150 billion investing arm within banking giant Morgan Stanley is weighing whether or not to move into digital currencies.

Counterpoint Global a unit of Morgan Stanley Investment Management known for its investment in growth stocks is considering whether or not the asset class is suitable according to Bloomberg.

A $150-billion Morgan Stanley investing arm known for its prowess in picking growth stocks is considering adding Bitcoin to its list of possible bets. Counterpoint Global  a unit of Morgan Stanley Investment Management that’s racked up wins in mutual-fund rankings is exploring whether the cryptocurrency would be a suitable option for its investors according to people with knowledge of the matter. Moving ahead with investments would require approval by the firm and regulators.Morgan Stanley’s affirmation would put the heft of an almost-century-old marquee Wall Street name behind a volatile asset class that’s still struggling to win acceptance in much of the traditional financial industry. But a four-fold jump in four months has stoked customers’ interest making the digital asset even harder to ignore.After catching the attention of hedge fund moguls including Alan Howard and Paul Tudor Jones cryptocurrencies have recently made headway with more mainstay firms such as Mastercard Inc. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. Just this week Tesla Inc  the leading maker of electric cars also got behind Bitcoin with a $1.5 billion investment and plans to start accepting the cryptocurrency as payment.A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. The review could ultimately result in Morgan Stanley opting to stay away from Bitcoin. Previous rallies in the cryptocurrency have also attracted flurries of Wall Street interest only to fizzle.Much of the industry’s skepticism centers on Bitcoin’s unpredictable price swings and the lack of things it can buy more than a decade since its creation. But faithful followers have felt vindicated this year. Billions of dollars have been pouring into the cryptocurrency through vehicles including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.Even institutional investors barred by the rules of their funds from holding Bitcoin directly have turned to such trusts. For Wall Street firms an inability to offer Bitcoin to those clients raises the risk of losing them to other managers.

Bloomberg recently reported that Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s subsidiary Cointerpoint Global “is exploring whether the cryptocurrency would be a suitable option for its investors.”

According to Morgan Stanley’s website Counterpoint Global chooses to invest in assets “whose market value can increase significantly for underlying fundamental reasons.” This suggests that the bank believes Bitcoin may be undervalued compared to its fundamentals.

JPMorgan Chase also hinted that it might eventually introduce Bitcoin services. JPMorgan’s co-president Daniel Pinto believes that if investors and asset managers start using Bitcoin the bank “will have to be involved.” Pinto however said that the current demand was not strong enough but conceded it may grow in the future.

Even though Bitcoin has risen sharply in the past few months its dominance has fallen from about 69.71% on Jan. 4 to 60.9% currently. This shows that altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the past few weeks. With an eye on altcoins let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may trend in the next few days.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin broke above the $41959.63 resistance on Feb. 8 with a strong up-move but since then the momentum has weakened. Although the price has been nudging higher the leading cryptocurrency is facing profit-booking at intermittent levels.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the price turns down from the current levels and slips below $46000 the correction could deepen to the strong support at $41959.63. If the BTC/USD pair rebounds off this support it will suggest the bulls continue to accumulate on dips which is a sign that the uptrend is intact.

The bulls will then try to drive the price above the psychological barrier at $50000 and resume the uptrend with the next target objective at $60974.43. On the other hand if the bears sink the price below the 20-day exponential moving average ($41349) the pair may drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($36070).

This is an important support to watch out for because the price has not dipped below the 50-day SMA since Oct. 9. Hence a break below it will indicate a possible change in trend. The next support on the downside is much lower at $28850.

The 4-hour chart shows the pair has formed a rising wedge pattern that will complete on a breakdown and close below the support line. If that happens the pair may drop to $43720.85 and then to $41959.63.

Contrary to this assumption if the price turns up from the current levels or the 20-EMA and rises above the wedge it will invalidate the bearish setup. A breakout above $50000 could attract short-covering from the aggressive bears and may result in a quick up-move to $55000.

BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) broke above the $539 resistance on Feb. 12 and this attracted buying from the bulls. The altcoin picked up momentum and soared above the $631.71 resistance on Feb. 13

The long wick on today’s candlestick suggests short-term traders may be booking profits after the recent runup. The BCH/USD pair may now correct to $631.71 and if the bulls can flip this level into support it will indicate buying on every minor dip.

If the bulls can push the price above $730.02 the uptrend could reach $900. Both moving averages are sloping up and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the overbought zone suggesting an advantage to the bulls.

Contrary to this assumption if the price dips and sustains below $631.71 the correction could deepen to $539.

The 4-hour chart shows the bears are defending the $720 resistance and the bulls are buying on dips to $650. If the buyers can propel the price above $730.02 the uptrend could resume.

On the other hand if the price again turns down from $720 the bears will try to pull the price down to $631.71. If this support cracks the decline could extend to the 20-EMA and then to the 50-SMA.

EOS/USD

EOS broke out of the long basing formation and started a new uptrend when it soared above the $3.95 overhead resistance on Feb. 9. The altcoin picked up momentum and the bulls pushed the price above the $5.4861 resistance on Feb. 13.

However the failure to sustain the price above $5.4861 may have attracted profit-booking from the short-term traders. This has started a correction that could extend to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $4.5014.

If the price rebounds off this level the bulls will again try to push and sustain the price above the $5.4861 to $5.6118 overhead resistance. Contrary to this assumption if the bears sink the price below $4.5014 the EOS/USD pair could drop to $3.95.

Such a deep correction will suggest that the momentum has weakened and the pair could then consolidate in a wide range between $3.95 and $5.6118 for a few days.

The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls have purchased the dip to the 20-EMA. If the pair sustains the rebound the bulls will again try to push the price above $5.6118. If they succeed the uptrend could resume.

The next target objective on the upside is $6 and if that level is also scaled the uptrend could reach $7.50. On the other hand a break below the 20-EMA could extend the correction to the 50-SMA.

XMR/USD

Monero (XMR) broke above the $190 resistance on Feb. 12 and resumed the uptrend. The 20-day EMA ($174) has turned up and the RSI has moved into overbought territory which suggests the bulls are in command.

XMR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears are currently defending the psychological level at $250. The first support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at 213.6152. If the price rebounds off this level it will suggest that traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.

A break above $254.45 will open the doors for a rally to $300 where the bears may again mount a stiff resistance.

Contrary to this assumption if the bears sink the price below $213.6152 the correction may deepen to $190. Such a deep fall may delay the start of the next leg of the uptrend.

The 4-hour chart shows the bears are defending the $240 to $254.45 resistance zone but the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. If the price rises from the current level or rebounds off the 20-EMA it will signal strength.

If the bulls can push the price above the overhead resistance a rally to $268 and then to $300 is likely. This bullish view will invalidate if the XMR/USD pair dips and closes below the 20-EMA.

XTZ/USD

Tezos (XTZ) broke above the previous all-time high at $4.4936 on Feb. 12 and has made a new high at $5.6471 today. Whenever an asset hits a new high it indicates that bulls are in control.

Another thing that usually happens when a major resistance is broken is that the price turns down and retests the breakout level. In this case the price could dip to the breakout level at $4.4936.

If the price rebounds off this level it will suggest that traders are buying on dips and have flipped the previous resistance to support. The bulls will then attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $5.6471.

If they succeed the XTZ/USD pair could rally to $7.1407. This bullish view will invalidate if the pair breaks and sustains below $4.4936.

The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls could not sustain the price above $5.40 which may have attracted profit-booking from short-term traders. The bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-EMA.

If the price rebounds off this support it will signal strength. A break above $5.6471 may resume the up-move. On the other hand if the price dips below the 20-EMA and the $4.4936 support the correction could deepen to the 50-SMA.

Bitcoin fell as much as 5.6% to $45914 in Asian trading hours after having posting a record peak of $49714.66 on Sunday while rival crypto ethereum slid more than 8%.

Once on the fringes of finance bitcoin is fast gaining legitimacy as an asset class and has leapt 20% in the week since electric carmaker Tesla Inc announced it had $1.5 billion in bitcoin and would accept the currency as payment.

It is up more than 60% for the year to date and has gained more than 1100% since hitting a one-year low last March.

""There's this unadulterated wave of big players (buying) that has continued to push the price higher"" said Chris Weston head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone. ""We might be seeing one or two big funds just cashing out"" he said.

""The big question is: OK you want to buy the pullback but how big is the pullback that we are talking about?""

Besides Tesla's investment Bank of NY Mellon last week said it formed a new unit to help clients own and trade digital assets.

Bloomberg reported on Saturday that Morgan Stanley's investment arm is weighing a bet on bitcoin.

And Geely just set the record for largest car mosaic.

The Chinese car company gathered 1339 cars together on December 31 2020 in anticipation of the Chinese New Year on February 12. The company organized the cars into the shape of an ox with the words “2021 Chinese ox” spelled out as well.

There are some pretty serious stipulations required for a car mosaic to qualify for the record. The mosaic has to be m ade up of cars in such a way that it forms a recognizable pattern if you view it from above. Cars have to be spaced no more than 7.87 inches apart and the whole mosaic has to cover 3588 square yards.

The display organized by Geely Emgrand Official Clubs clocked in at around 8455.96 square yards. It apparently took more than 30 hours to assemble the whole thing. And since masks aren’t required in China now the adjudicator got to present the award in person.

According to Guinness World Records the Chinese character for ox (牛) can also be used to represent 'awesome' which is exactly what Geely did with its car display.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2FuZ2VsaWNhbWFyaWRlb2xpdmVpcmEvMjAyMS8wMi8xMy9icmF6aWwtdGVjaC1yb3VuZC11cC1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LXJlc3BvbmRzLXRvLW1hc3NpdmUtZGF0YS1sZWFrLXRvdHZzLXJlc3VsdHMtaGVhbHRodGVjaC1ncm93dGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brazil Tech Round-Up: Government Responds To Massive Data Leak Totvs Results Healthtech Growth,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelicamarideoliveira/2021/02/13/brazil-tech-round-up-government-responds-to-massive-data-leak-totvs-results-healthtech-growth/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2FuZ2VsaWNhbWFyaWRlb2xpdmVpcmEvMjAyMS8wMi8xMy9icmF6aWwtdGVjaC1yb3VuZC11cC1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LXJlc3BvbmRzLXRvLW1hc3NpdmUtZGF0YS1sZWFrLXRvdHZzLXJlc3VsdHMtaGVhbHRodGVjaC1ncm93dGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

With New Partnerships The Company Is Ready For A Closer Look,"BlackBerry Ltd (NYSE: BB) has been hot lately and not only for its WallStreetBets fame. BlackBerry released some big news including information about its QNX and IVY systems partnerships.

Investors are closely watching to see if BlackBerry can regain its former glory. It has been nearly 13 years since the company's shares reached an all-time high on June 2 2008 and a lot has changed for the Canadian tech company.

What Happened: A short squeeze that began in February 2008 launched shares of BlackBerry more than 80% within four months reaching a high of almost $150. Investors were buying the stock based on BlackBerry’s dominance in the mobile phone industry.

BlackBerry’s QWERTY keyboard phones quickly fell from popularity when consumers switched en masse to phones made by competitors such as the iPhone produced by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and the Galaxy by Samsung Electronics Co.

But BlackBerry wasn't just about its mobile phone handset. BlackBerry’s focus has always been security software with the mobile phone industry just one outlet for that business. In the past decade BlackBerry went back to the drawing board and refocused its strategy back on what it has always been best at: software. Some might say BlackBerry was never a mobile phone company to begin with.

Why It Matters: BlackBerry has always been about security. Over the past 10 years while BlackBerry seemed to fade into the shadows advancements in vehicle architecture and robotics were expanding. The company was developing software products and systems that would eventually help it to capture partnerships with some of the world’s leading companies.

In the past month BlackBerry has announced partnerships with Baidu Inc (NASDAQ: BIDU) and Hyundai Motor Company GDR's (OTC: HYMTF)-backed Motional for its QNX system.

In 2020 BlackBerry had a stream of partnership announcements including its largest with Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) for AWS to market Blackberry’s IVY platform for use in smart vehicles. The company also unveiled partnerships between its crisis communication system AtHoc and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) for its Microsoft Teams platform and ServiceNow Inc (NYSE: NOW) for incident response management.

BlackBerry has also released new security software such as its Mobile Threat Defense Solution and Unified Endpoint Security which is used by institutions and governments including the U.S. Air Force.

Benzinga's Take: In contrast to the 2008 short squeeze where BlackBerry share prices soared on hype its next act might be a rise based on its stock being viewed as a value play.

Its industry-related growth and proprietary software make it a great partner for automakers and tech companies looking to increase their system security. This is a time when the dangers posed by international hackers are heightened as seen in with the SolarWinds hack in December 2020.

The term small cap can be used to define established companies with a small market capitalization ranging anywhere between $300 million and $2 billion. While we define the term healthcare as an organization that provides medical care and attention to an individual. In a recent article we covered the Top 10 Large-Cap Healthcare Stock to Buy Now.

Investing in small-cap stocks can be tricky. Risk and volatility are inevitable. However the fact that these stocks have a smaller size may mean more room for upside potential given the circumstances. For instance the average return for the Russell 2000 is 15% in the year after a presidential election since 1980. Which is around 4% better than the large-cap stocks. Small caps also tend to outperform large caps when coming out of an economic recession and when expectations of economic growth go from bad to less bad and eventually to good the greater economic sensitivity given by small caps can be helpful to a more rapid recovery.

On the other hand investing in healthcare stocks can be very rewarding given the significance it has to the economy. In the US the healthcare sector will account for 19.4% of GDP in 2027. The number is an increase from 17.9% in 2017. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exemplified the importance of the healthcare sector in finding solutions to ending the pandemic. According to an article from the Health System Tracker healthcare workers now account for a larger share of the employed workforce which went from 10.8% in February up to 11.5% in May.

The Biden Administration commits to the Affordable Care Act which will add Medicare-like public options that will allow a greater number of consumers to receive health insurance. We also like small-cap healthcare stocks (like biotech or gene technology stocks) because that's where a large number of cutting edge research is done. Combining small-cap stocks that have the possibility for major growth and health care stocks that provide innovative solutions to the economy today may be one of the solutions to a portfolio with great growth potential.

“Mednax is a business that I have followed for many years. The crown jewel is the pediatric business in which the company provides physician staffing to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and related specialties at various hospitals. It’s a business with a strong competitive advantage given the company’s dominant position very inelastic demand and limited reimbursement risk. The pediatric business has moderate organic growth characteristics which the prior management supplemented with many tuck-in acquisitions over the years. These acquisitions leveraged the back office scale while allowing the local physician groups’ autonomy of operation. Unfortunately the company eventually ran out of meaningful acquisitions to make in this space and the old management was unsatisfied with simply running a very entrenched high ROIC and FCF business and returning capital to shareholders. Instead they took on extra debt to pursue growth through acquisitions in what they considered to be adjacencies: first in anesthesiology and then in radiology. Not surprisingly these adventures outside the company’s area of core competitive advantage didn’t go well. Debt piled up far faster than profits. This led to an activist investor nominating directors to the board and then the board replacing the CEO. The new CEO was previously the CEO of Quality Care Properties. This was a company where he improved performance over this 2-year tenure and which he then sold at an attractive price. His first steps at Mednax were simple: sell off the non-core divisions and reduce debt. I made the investment after the sales were completed leading to a clean balance sheet and the company returning to its roots as a pediatric-centered company. This company doesn’t screen well to many investors since its historical financials are messy and are obscured by the old businesses (now sold) and the seemingly large debt pile (already reduced). This is a perfect set-up: the nature of the business is different than what most investors believe it to be based on a superficial assessment. The new management is now focused on improving efficiencies and running the core business better. I would not be surprised if the ultimate plan were to sell the company in a few years at a nice profit. However I am not banking on that and would be equally happy if management just executes on its low-risk plan of running the business well within its area of competitive advantage. I purchased the stock at less than 10x normalized EPS for a business that I believe is likely to grow mid-single digits long-term. I paid ~ 65% of my base case value with ~ 35% downside to my worst case. I believe the Business Quality to be Excellent (1 out of 5) Management Quality to be Above Average (2 out of 5) and Balance Sheet to be Above Average (2 out of 5). In the short-term birth-rates a key driver of demand are likely to be negative. This may create quarters where the company reports results lower than Wall Street expectations. I am not at all concerned or deterred by that. If anything I would be happy to add to the position if such an event occurs and the market over-reacts given our long-term investment horizon.”

8. Natus Medical Inc (NASDAQ:NTUS)

No of HFs: 24

Total Value of HF Holdings: $72 Million

Total Value of HF Holdings: $246 Million

Michael Doheny’s Freshford Capital Management is one of the top hedge funds having positions in the stock which had $107 million invested at the end of September. An insider recently purchased 1648 shares at around $14 in August 2019. The stock is up 157% since then. Silver Ring Value Partners mentioned CVET in its Q4 2020 investor letter:

“Business Vision in 5 Years: The distribution business continues to grow at a moderate clip. The company’s Vets First Choice SaaS business both adds a substantial number of new vet practices and meaningfully increases the revenue per practice in the U.S. The company develops a growing business in Europe which is several years behind the U.S. in its maturity. These developments lead to an explosion in profits as the relatively high contribution profit margins from the SaaS business make Vets First Choice the more profitable of the two divisions. What Can Prevent It From Getting There:

-Market structure changes so that vets give up on selling drugs to consumers cede that business to others like Chewy’s and increase prices for their services to maintain practice profitability

-Consolidating suppliers squeeze the economics out of the distribution business

-Vets prove more resistant to adopting Vets First Choice software and the majority never reach the revenue potential that it offers.”

Just look at the career of Dr. David Langer who is the chairman of neurosurgery at Lenox Hill Hospital which also provides the backdrop for “Lenox Hill” a Netflix documentary series. The show follows four doctors — including Dr. Langer — and their patients at the hospital.

Dr. Langer had early dreams of becoming a cardiologist but when he was 22 his father had a serious stroke which left him partly paralyzed. “It was worse than death for him” recalled Dr. Langer who turned his interests to the nervous system around that time. “I think psychologically I was trying to save him” he said. “Then you end up in a Netflix show. It’s the sliding door and randomness of life that’s incredibly humbling.”

Dr. Langer 57 lives with his wife Dr. Nancy Lipsitz 57 who is an anesthesiologist at Carnegie Hill Endoscopy their daughter Molly Langer 17 and their Goldendoodles Cooper and Stark on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Often Dr. Lipsitz’s daughters from a previous marriage Sydney and Rachel Lipsitz both 25 will drop by for a visit or Dr. Langer’s son Ben Langer 22 will be home from college.

BED DOGS BED A pawing on my shoulder from Cooper wakes me at 6. I throw on a T-shirt and sweats which are pseudo pajamas and take the dogs out — there’s a closed street with a small park on 91st Street — so they can do what they need to. I’m back in bed by 6:30.

It's a battle the search giant is sure to face in other countries.

Last month Google said it may stop providing search results in Australia if the government passes a new bill forcing it to pay the country's publishers for the news links and snippets its search engine surfaces. Leaving Australia would deprive its 25 million citizens of the world's most widely used search engine which handles almost 95% of the country's daily searches.

Watch this: Google: How it got so big 09:34

""We don't respond to threats"" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters on Jan. 21. The country makes its own rules on ""things you can do in Australia"" he added.

Tempers have since cooled and Morrison had a ""constructive"" conversation with Google CEO Sundar Pichai last week. But the seven-month battle over Australia's proposed News Media Bargaining Code bill which also covers Facebook  is far from over. It moved to a new phase on Friday when a bipartisan Senate committee released an inquiry report recommending the House of Representatives pass the bill.

The clash between Google and Canberra will ripple far away from Australia's pristine beaches. Countries around the world are reckoning with the havoc Google Facebook and other tech companies have wreaked on their media landscapes. A Canadian minister has backed Australia's proposed Media Code and called for Google and Facebook to pay publishers in his country. Alex Saliba a member of European Parliament told CNET that he wants to include similar measures in upcoming EU legislation. Competitors are watching too. Microsoft  Google's chief search engine rival has urged similar regulations in the US.

""It will be a very powerful precedent"" said Frank Pasquale a professor at Brooklyn Law School who researches technology law and policy. ""It is emblematic of a global fight by Google on regulatory actions on all levels.""

Entering the House of Representatives last December the News Media Bargaining Code bill was designed by Australia's competition watchdog the ACCC to force Google and Facebook to negotiate with publishers. It would require Google and local publishers to reach an agreement within three months of becoming law or a government-appointed panel will decide the compensation. It also would require that Google inform publishers of changes to its algorithm before they take effect.

Google says paying for snippets that come up in search undermines the idea of an open internet. The company also argues the arbitration process is likely to result in unfairly high fees. The search engine's exit from the country would be a ""worst case scenario"" a Google spokesman said in a statement. ""We remain committed to reaching a solution for a workable Code as we have been throughout this whole process.""

Google's Showcase strategy

Google's threat to remove Search from Australia isn't without precedent. The company removed its Google News product from Spain in 2014 when the government passed a copyright law forcing it to pay publishers for headlines and news snippets. Removing search from Australia will have little financial impact on the company: It made more than $160 billion in revenue in 2019 with around 2.5% of that coming from sales in Australia.

But cutting pesky markets isn't a long-term strategy. Google search is already blocked from China the world's most populous country. The EU which is also scrutinizing the company will be much harder to walk away from.

Google is hoping to preempt legislation like Australia's by expanding its News Showcase a feature in the Google News app on Android and iOS that delivers curated news from participating publications. After launching News Showcase in Germany and Brazil last October Googled brought the initiative to Australia in early February as Australia's senate deliberated the News Media Code bill. Google has committed $1 billion to publishers via News Showcase over the next three years.

Seven Australian publishers joined the project at launch in early February. One of the country's biggest media companies Seven West Media has since signed up too. But confidentiality agreements prevent them from revealing how much Google pays them. The Australian Financial Review has reported that the publications will be paid between AU$200000 and AU$2 million (US$150000 to US$1.5 million). In France 90 million euros (US$109 million) will be split between 120 publications over three years according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

This satisfies some publishers like Reuters which signed a deal to be part of News Showcase around the world. Germany's Der Spiegel and Brazil's Piaui national outlets have also welcomed the initiative.

But Nine Entertainment a big publisher that owns both the Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian Financial Review says Google and Facebook should pay publications about AU$900 million (US$695 million) each year. News Corp which owns Fox News is another big proponent of Australia's proposed Media Code.

""This is what monopolies do they put an offer in the form of Google Showcase but not offer to negotiate"" a Nine spokesperson said. ""It has to be all on their terms and that is not an approach we will participate in we support the legislation the government is proposing as the best way to secure a fair payment for our content.""

Good regulation?

Australia's proposal has critics including some publishers who say the Media Code could have unintended consequences. The editorial boards of Bloomberg and the Financial Times have argued that news publications get more from Google and Facebook through search engine and social media traffic than the platforms get from the publications.

Amanda Lotz a digital media professor at the University of Technology Queensland echoes this sentiment. She points to recent research done in the UK which found that just 3% of the average person's online time was spent reading news.

""If news was somehow not available on Facebook's feed anymore people would still spend the same amount of time on Facebook"" she explained. ""With Google it's the same thing. Most of Google's revenue is coming through search and most searches have nothing to do with news.""

Google says 2% of searches in Australia are news-related.

Google has gone on a PR offensive. Apart from a popup on Search explaining its reasons for opposing the code a video featuring Mel Silva its managing director in Australia was uploaded to YouTube and promoted heavily on Twitter. Google/YouTube

Smaller publications have expressed concern that the Code balances power between Big Tech and Big Media but does little for them. Last September a group of 10 publishers wrote a statement to the ACCC outlining concerns with the Code. If the Code becomes law many outlets would be too small to be eligible for payment they said. Smaller publishers would also find it more difficult to compete with Nine or News Corp if they lost the traffic Google and Facebook provide they added.

""We believe it is important for measures to be introduced to bring the Australian media industry to a more even playing field"" the statement read ""however we are concerned that the current proposal has potential to just further entrench the large traditional media companies and accidentally destroy media diversity in the process.""

A 'paradox' of a threat

Still the Australian government's effort is inspiring lawmakers around the world.

The EU is readying two pieces of legislation the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act designed to target Big Tech companies. The DSA will hold Google responsible for illegal content on its platform like articles encouraging terrorism and the DMA will enforce stricter anti-competition measures. The Media Code being proposed in Australia has already caught the eye of Alex Saliba a member of European Parliament from Malta.

""Australia's plans to make Facebook and Google pay for news content address the acute bargaining power imbalances they have over media organizations providing news services"" he said in a statement to CNET. ""The only question is if the DSA and the DMA are the appropriate legislation to introduce such a system.""

In the US Google's search and advertising businesses are under increasing attack by lawmakers as well as state and federal prosecutors. Google faces three major antitrust lawsuits including a landmark case by the Department of Justice and a complaint by a bipartisan coalition of states. In response to those cases Google has argued that competition ""is just a click away.""

Australia however underscores Google's dominance. Microsoft says its Bing search engine is ready to replace Google but few see it as a true alternative.

Google's threat to pull out of Australia is a ""paradox"" said Pasquale the Brooklyn Law School professor because it undermines the argument the company has been making in the face of antitrust criticism. If competition is so abundant Google's ultimatum wouldn't be such a powerful bargaining chip.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaW50ZXJjZXB0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzEzL25ld3MtcmFnZS1lY29ub215LXBvc3Rqb3VybmFsaXNtLWFuZHJleS1taXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Understand the Rage Economy,"The attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6 underlined a disturbing phenomenon that has become undeniable at this point: the fragmentation of the American public into a multitude of angry factions radicalized in different ways online and holding completely different baseline perceptions of reality. The problem of deliberate misinformation undermining democracy has received lots of attention but in many ways the power of fantastic lies to grab people’s allegiance is also a byproduct of a deeper problem: extreme polarization driven by news media monetizing anger in order to survive.

This phenomenon is at the core of what media ecologist and author Andrey Mir in a new book calls “postjournalism.” Mir’s book titled “Postjournalism and the Death of Newspapers” is a sweeping look at how the news media evolved and shaped the world over hundreds of years from newsletters for traders published in medieval Venice Italy to modern print newspapers television and finally the internet. For pretty much everyone the news media is the major force that shapes how they perceive the world outside their direct experience. During an era when the main technology for producing and disseminating information changes the world changes as well. For better or worse we are living through one of those eras now.

The collective psychological impact of new technologies like social media has been written about in a wave of books over the past few years. Equally significant has been the underlying economic shift that has gradually transformed even traditional media outlets into something wholly different. Journalism traditionally relied on an advertising-based revenue model and that economy also subtly incentivized a particular lens through which the world was depicted: an upbeat-as-possible unifying worldview that made advertisers happy and promoted the needs of consumerism even as it often overlooked or suppressed stories that fell outside its parameters.

When advertisers suddenly flocked to social media the traditional economic model that underpinned the media and allowed even smaller papers to afford luxuries like foreign correspondents suddenly collapsed. Today established news outlets not only struggle to find advertisers after Facebook and Google swallowed up the market but they must also compete with a seemingly infinite number of other websites companies and even individuals committing “acts of journalism” or just putting out entertainment thus forcing them to battle for a finite slice of an attention economy that they cannot possibly corner.

The loss of the old advertising paradigm simply killed many local news outlets which have shuttered at an incredible rate over the past decade. The surviving large organizations have sought desperately for a new model to support themselves. A lucky few have been able to rely on the patronage of philanthropists supporting journalism as a pure social good. But many others have been forced to do something not seen since the era of mass-produced penny tabloids: relying primarily on readers to support them through subscription and membership fees. As Mir argues this change in the economic structure of the news media has quietly transformed what journalism itself is about turning it from a theoretically neutral means of “manufacturing consent” into a political cause that people are rallied into supporting usually by inciting them to some form of outrage. This change has most directly impacted print-based media but television news outlets like Fox News that still draw a majority of their revenue from cable subscriptions also have strong incentive to capitalize on the rage economy. Facebook’s algorithmically generated news feeds meanwhile have the lucrative advantage of always knowing exactly what people want to hear and driving their engagement accordingly something that is only now bringing the company under regulatory threat for fostering extremism.

Unfortunately for society as a whole one of the best ways to monetize engagement on the internet is by generating rage.

This phenomenon became very stark after the election of former President Donald Trump (an event that would have been impossible in the pre-social media world in which the old media acted as gatekeepers) when his opponents rushed to subscribe to liberal-leaning outlets like the New York Times and the Washington Post in the expectation that doing so would help fight his presidency. Trump’s supporters likewise flocked to outlets that supported him in the face of what they viewed as a siege by liberal elites. Some older journalists expressed unease at the idea of explicitly taking a side even in the face of such an inherently polarizing figure but the economic structure of their industry now made it inevitable. Any time that outlets seemingly veered from the script and upset their readers’ expectations they were immediately threatened with losing their now-vital economic support. Even Fox News is menaced with having its ratings taken by the even-seedier One America News Network when it fails to deliver the obsequious and outrageous coverage that Trump’s partisan supporters demand.

Just as the advertising model incentivized news outlets to project a business-friendly view of the world the new model requires readers to stay not just satisfied but also engaged enough that they are willing to maintain economic support. Unfortunately for society as a whole one of the best ways to monetize engagement on the internet is by generating anger and hatred usually directed at some other group of people. This rage-driven model is at the heart of what Mir calls postjournalism. In its most extreme forms in venues where the old professional ethics and standards of journalism have been discarded or never took root postjournalism will produce mobs whose rage is incomprehensible to those outside their bubbles like the QAnon conspiracy theorists who sacked the Capitol.

“As postjournalism needs to amplify people’s frustration for profit it spirals up into the amplification of extremes and therefore polarization. The outraged and polarized audience is a side effect of this new business model” Mir told me in a lengthy email exchange about the book. “Seeking support from the audience in the conditions of fading attention the news media are forced to amplify and dramatize issues whose coverage is most likely to be paid for. If the ad-driven media of the past tended to manufacture consent the reader-driven media must manufacture anger.”

“There is no evil plot nor ‘liberal bias’ nor ‘right-wing conspiracy’ behind this” Mir adds. “Such are simply the environmental settings for a media industry that has lost its ad revenue and news business to the internet.”

The recognition that something has gone terribly wrong with how people consume information has led to calls for censorship or even appointing a government “reality czar.” Following the Capitol riot there has been a wave of deplatformings of individuals from social media extending all the way to the former president himself. But this is at best a short-term solution. Given how new conflicts constantly emerge in society simply banning all people who believe the wrong things from using the internet is not remotely sustainable.

A return to the old hierarchical world of news media is highly unlikely and that’s a good thing on balance. But creating a worthwhile new media landscape will require protecting news organizations from the Darwinian economic pressure that forces them to peddle outrage.

Creating a worthwhile new media landscape will require protecting news organizations from the Darwinian economic pressure that forces them to peddle outrage.

Countries such as Canada Australia and Norway have been rolling out programs for greater public funding of journalism. But that could be more challenging in the United States where government-funded outlets are more at risk of political pressure. A plan circulated by Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2019 may be closer to the mark: placing a tax on targeted advertising and redistributing money from tech companies back to traditional journalism. A program like that would reduce the incentive for large outlets to lean on polarization as a business model while rescuing many local news outlets from complete oblivion.

For the average person consuming the news in a context where rage has become currency it might help to simply be aware of that context and consume information without being manipulated. The digitalization of human interactions that has been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic makes it more urgent than ever to deal with these platforms responsibly.

“When one sees enraged users on social media or journalists very selectively covering news in the mass media it must be understood that these users and journalists are under the influence of the media” Mir writes in his book. “Being subdued to the environmental force of media does not release anyone from the personal responsibility for what is done on social media or in the news media but at least this explains that people are pushed towards more polarization and rage by the environmental settings of this particular media environment.”

The people who ransacked the Capitol are of course responsible for their own actions and though social media technology may have helped motivate them in this particular way Trump’s extremism and incitement drew upon deep historical fissures related to race and status. Even so it might help for all of us to better understand the technological and economic context that gave rise to that bizarre mob along with many other recent calamities. Mir argues that understanding the deeper influences of this new media environment can have a “therapeutic effect” in a world that otherwise “looks unexplainably insane.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50Lzc1MDVhMjIyLTMwZDktNGJhMy1iMmZiLTQ4ZmY0ZGFhZmU4MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nine Entertainment urges Australian MPs to ignore Big Tech threats over news code,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

Detectives believe missing Sydney millionaire Melissa Caddick had plans to flee Australia and could be hiding out somewhere with the help of people in the community.

Speaking to 2GB NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said there would ""absolutely"" be people helping her while flagging the possibility she may have drastically changed her appearance.

""We don't have specific leads on that at the moment but you have to safely assume her journey was one to leave Australia and go overseas … [but] at the moment there are challenges to get out of the country"" he said.

""She would have to have the help of someone.""

Caddick is accused of swindling clients including friends and family out of millions of dollars through her finance business Maliver Pty Ltd.

It's alleged she used the cash to fund her lavish lifestyle which featured luxury ski trips and designer jewellery.

The 49-year-old was last seen on November 11 by her husband Anthony Koletti the day after her AU$7m Dover Heights home was raided by Australian Federal Police and the corporate watchdog.

She was ordered to hand her passports over and her assets were frozen.

Caddick left to go for a run on the morning of November 12 and hasn't been seen since.

Her 15-year-old son told police he heard the front door close about 5.30am.

Investigators have combed through hours of CCTV footage but are yet to find any sign of the Sydney mother.

Detectives have also followed up dozens of tip-offs from residents in South Australia Queensland and Victoria but nothing has come from any of the leads.

""Every day we continue to talk about her we are one day closer to finding her"" Fuller said.

""At some stage she will realise she will have to turn herself in and face these allegations. The sooner she does that if she's alive the better.""

When asked if he could say one thing to the missing woman Fuller urged Caddick to come home.

""I'd say to her she's not the first person to have alleged to have engaged in fraudulent activity"" he said.

""For her and her family it is time to come home.""

Caddick was officially added to the Australian Federal Police missing persons registrar at the weekend almost exactly three months to the day since she was last seen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFnZS5jb20uYXUvbmF0aW9uYWwvc29sbHktcy1sb3ZlLWlzbGFuZC1sb3NzLWJ1dC13YWl0LXRoZXJlLXMtbW9yZS0yMDIxMDIxNC1wNTcyZWYuaHRtbNIBZmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWFnZS5jb20uYXUvbmF0aW9uYWwvc29sbHktcy1sb3ZlLWlzbGFuZC1sb3NzLWJ1dC13YWl0LXRoZXJlLXMtbW9yZS0yMDIxMDIxNC1wNTcyZWYuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solly’s love island loss - but wait there’s more,"The marathon saga of Solomon Lew’s fight over a Thai villa should have wrapped up last week after a Singaporean court ruled the rag trader had no claim to the island home he thought he was purchasing.

The price was a drop in the ocean for the chairman of Premier Investments who is valued at more than $2 billion. However the pursuit of Andara’s Villa 29 was personal because it was the house where he proposed to wife Roza in April 2017. But we digress.

Last week Singapore’s Court of Appeal upheld an earlier decision that the chap with whom Lew struck his property deal didn’t have the authority to sell it. And for that reason Villa 29 remains the property of Swiss businessman Christian Larpin.

The editorial boards of Bloomberg and the Financial Times have argued that news publications get more from Google and Facebook through search engine and social media traffic than the platforms get from the publications.

Amanda Lotz a digital media professor at the University of Technology Queensland echoes this sentiment. She points to recent research done in the UK which found that just 3% of the average person's online time was spent reading news.

""If news was somehow not available on Facebook's feed anymore people would still spend the same amount of time on Facebook"" she explained. ""With Google it's the same thing. Most of Google's revenue is coming through search and most searches have nothing to do with news.""

Google says 2% of searches in Australia are news-related.

Google has gone on a PR offensive. Apart from a popup on Search explaining its reasons for opposing the code a video featuring Mel Silva its managing director in Australia was uploaded to YouTube and promoted heavily on Twitter. Google/YouTube

Smaller publications have expressed concern that the Code balances power between Big Tech and Big Media but does little for them. Last September a group of 10 publishers wrote a statement to the ACCC outlining concerns with the Code. If the Code becomes law many outlets would be too small to be eligible for payment they said. Smaller publishers would also find it more difficult to compete with Nine or News Corp if they lost the traffic Google and Facebook provide they added.

""We believe it is important for measures to be introduced to bring the Australian media industry to a more even playing field"" the statement read ""however we are concerned that the current proposal has potential to just further entrench the large traditional media companies and accidentally destroy media diversity in the process.""

A 'paradox' of a threat

Still the Australian government's effort is inspiring lawmakers around the world.

The EU is readying two pieces of legislation the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act designed to target Big Tech companies. The DSA will hold Google responsible for illegal content on its platform like articles encouraging terrorism and the DMA will enforce stricter anti-competition measures. The Media Code being proposed in Australia has already caught the eye of Alex Saliba a member of European Parliament from Malta.

""Australia's plans to make Facebook and Google pay for news content address the acute bargaining power imbalances they have over media organizations providing news services"" he said in a statement to CNET. ""The only question is if the DSA and the DMA are the appropriate legislation to introduce such a system.""

In the US Google's search and advertising businesses are under increasing attack by lawmakers as well as state and federal prosecutors. Google faces three major antitrust lawsuits including a landmark case by the Department of Justice and a complaint by a bipartisan coalition of states. In response to those cases Google has argued that competition ""is just a click away.""

Australia however underscores Google's dominance. Microsoft says its Bing search engine is ready to replace Google but few see it as a true alternative.

Google's threat to pull out of Australia is a ""paradox"" said Pasquale the Brooklyn Law School professor because it undermines the argument the company has been making in the face of antitrust criticism. If competition is so abundant Google's ultimatum wouldn't be such a powerful bargaining chip.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaW50ZXJjZXB0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzEzL25ld3MtcmFnZS1lY29ub215LXBvc3Rqb3VybmFsaXNtLWFuZHJleS1taXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Understand the Rage Economy,"The attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6 underlined a disturbing phenomenon that has become undeniable at this point: the fragmentation of the American public into a multitude of angry factions radicalized in different ways online and holding completely different baseline perceptions of reality. The problem of deliberate misinformation undermining democracy has received lots of attention but in many ways the power of fantastic lies to grab people’s allegiance is also a byproduct of a deeper problem: extreme polarization driven by news media monetizing anger in order to survive.

This phenomenon is at the core of what media ecologist and author Andrey Mir in a new book calls “postjournalism.” Mir’s book titled “Postjournalism and the Death of Newspapers” is a sweeping look at how the news media evolved and shaped the world over hundreds of years from newsletters for traders published in medieval Venice Italy to modern print newspapers television and finally the internet. For pretty much everyone the news media is the major force that shapes how they perceive the world outside their direct experience. During an era when the main technology for producing and disseminating information changes the world changes as well. For better or worse we are living through one of those eras now.

The collective psychological impact of new technologies like social media has been written about in a wave of books over the past few years. Equally significant has been the underlying economic shift that has gradually transformed even traditional media outlets into something wholly different. Journalism traditionally relied on an advertising-based revenue model and that economy also subtly incentivized a particular lens through which the world was depicted: an upbeat-as-possible unifying worldview that made advertisers happy and promoted the needs of consumerism even as it often overlooked or suppressed stories that fell outside its parameters.

When advertisers suddenly flocked to social media the traditional economic model that underpinned the media and allowed even smaller papers to afford luxuries like foreign correspondents suddenly collapsed. Today established news outlets not only struggle to find advertisers after Facebook and Google swallowed up the market but they must also compete with a seemingly infinite number of other websites companies and even individuals committing “acts of journalism” or just putting out entertainment thus forcing them to battle for a finite slice of an attention economy that they cannot possibly corner.

The loss of the old advertising paradigm simply killed many local news outlets which have shuttered at an incredible rate over the past decade. The surviving large organizations have sought desperately for a new model to support themselves. A lucky few have been able to rely on the patronage of philanthropists supporting journalism as a pure social good. But many others have been forced to do something not seen since the era of mass-produced penny tabloids: relying primarily on readers to support them through subscription and membership fees. As Mir argues this change in the economic structure of the news media has quietly transformed what journalism itself is about turning it from a theoretically neutral means of “manufacturing consent” into a political cause that people are rallied into supporting usually by inciting them to some form of outrage. This change has most directly impacted print-based media but television news outlets like Fox News that still draw a majority of their revenue from cable subscriptions also have strong incentive to capitalize on the rage economy. Facebook’s algorithmically generated news feeds meanwhile have the lucrative advantage of always knowing exactly what people want to hear and driving their engagement accordingly something that is only now bringing the company under regulatory threat for fostering extremism.

Unfortunately for society as a whole one of the best ways to monetize engagement on the internet is by generating rage.

This phenomenon became very stark after the election of former President Donald Trump (an event that would have been impossible in the pre-social media world in which the old media acted as gatekeepers) when his opponents rushed to subscribe to liberal-leaning outlets like the New York Times and the Washington Post in the expectation that doing so would help fight his presidency. Trump’s supporters likewise flocked to outlets that supported him in the face of what they viewed as a siege by liberal elites. Some older journalists expressed unease at the idea of explicitly taking a side even in the face of such an inherently polarizing figure but the economic structure of their industry now made it inevitable. Any time that outlets seemingly veered from the script and upset their readers’ expectations they were immediately threatened with losing their now-vital economic support. Even Fox News is menaced with having its ratings taken by the even-seedier One America News Network when it fails to deliver the obsequious and outrageous coverage that Trump’s partisan supporters demand.

Just as the advertising model incentivized news outlets to project a business-friendly view of the world the new model requires readers to stay not just satisfied but also engaged enough that they are willing to maintain economic support. Unfortunately for society as a whole one of the best ways to monetize engagement on the internet is by generating anger and hatred usually directed at some other group of people. This rage-driven model is at the heart of what Mir calls postjournalism. In its most extreme forms in venues where the old professional ethics and standards of journalism have been discarded or never took root postjournalism will produce mobs whose rage is incomprehensible to those outside their bubbles like the QAnon conspiracy theorists who sacked the Capitol.

“As postjournalism needs to amplify people’s frustration for profit it spirals up into the amplification of extremes and therefore polarization. The outraged and polarized audience is a side effect of this new business model” Mir told me in a lengthy email exchange about the book. “Seeking support from the audience in the conditions of fading attention the news media are forced to amplify and dramatize issues whose coverage is most likely to be paid for. If the ad-driven media of the past tended to manufacture consent the reader-driven media must manufacture anger.”

“There is no evil plot nor ‘liberal bias’ nor ‘right-wing conspiracy’ behind this” Mir adds. “Such are simply the environmental settings for a media industry that has lost its ad revenue and news business to the internet.”

The recognition that something has gone terribly wrong with how people consume information has led to calls for censorship or even appointing a government “reality czar.” Following the Capitol riot there has been a wave of deplatformings of individuals from social media extending all the way to the former president himself. But this is at best a short-term solution. Given how new conflicts constantly emerge in society simply banning all people who believe the wrong things from using the internet is not remotely sustainable.

A return to the old hierarchical world of news media is highly unlikely and that’s a good thing on balance. But creating a worthwhile new media landscape will require protecting news organizations from the Darwinian economic pressure that forces them to peddle outrage.

Creating a worthwhile new media landscape will require protecting news organizations from the Darwinian economic pressure that forces them to peddle outrage.

Countries such as Canada Australia and Norway have been rolling out programs for greater public funding of journalism. But that could be more challenging in the United States where government-funded outlets are more at risk of political pressure. A plan circulated by Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2019 may be closer to the mark: placing a tax on targeted advertising and redistributing money from tech companies back to traditional journalism. A program like that would reduce the incentive for large outlets to lean on polarization as a business model while rescuing many local news outlets from complete oblivion.

For the average person consuming the news in a context where rage has become currency it might help to simply be aware of that context and consume information without being manipulated. The digitalization of human interactions that has been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic makes it more urgent than ever to deal with these platforms responsibly.

“When one sees enraged users on social media or journalists very selectively covering news in the mass media it must be understood that these users and journalists are under the influence of the media” Mir writes in his book. “Being subdued to the environmental force of media does not release anyone from the personal responsibility for what is done on social media or in the news media but at least this explains that people are pushed towards more polarization and rage by the environmental settings of this particular media environment.”

The people who ransacked the Capitol are of course responsible for their own actions and though social media technology may have helped motivate them in this particular way Trump’s extremism and incitement drew upon deep historical fissures related to race and status. Even so it might help for all of us to better understand the technological and economic context that gave rise to that bizarre mob along with many other recent calamities. Mir argues that understanding the deeper influences of this new media environment can have a “therapeutic effect” in a world that otherwise “looks unexplainably insane.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50Lzc1MDVhMjIyLTMwZDktNGJhMy1iMmZiLTQ4ZmY0ZGFhZmU4MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nine Entertainment urges Australian MPs to ignore Big Tech threats over news code,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

Detectives believe missing Sydney millionaire Melissa Caddick had plans to flee Australia and could be hiding out somewhere with the help of people in the community.

Speaking to 2GB NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said there would ""absolutely"" be people helping her while flagging the possibility she may have drastically changed her appearance.

""We don't have specific leads on that at the moment but you have to safely assume her journey was one to leave Australia and go overseas … [but] at the moment there are challenges to get out of the country"" he said.

""She would have to have the help of someone.""

Caddick is accused of swindling clients including friends and family out of millions of dollars through her finance business Maliver Pty Ltd.

It's alleged she used the cash to fund her lavish lifestyle which featured luxury ski trips and designer jewellery.

The 49-year-old was last seen on November 11 by her husband Anthony Koletti the day after her AU$7m Dover Heights home was raided by Australian Federal Police and the corporate watchdog.

She was ordered to hand her passports over and her assets were frozen.

Caddick left to go for a run on the morning of November 12 and hasn't been seen since.

Her 15-year-old son told police he heard the front door close about 5.30am.

Investigators have combed through hours of CCTV footage but are yet to find any sign of the Sydney mother.

Detectives have also followed up dozens of tip-offs from residents in South Australia Queensland and Victoria but nothing has come from any of the leads.

""Every day we continue to talk about her we are one day closer to finding her"" Fuller said.

""At some stage she will realise she will have to turn herself in and face these allegations. The sooner she does that if she's alive the better.""

When asked if he could say one thing to the missing woman Fuller urged Caddick to come home.

""I'd say to her she's not the first person to have alleged to have engaged in fraudulent activity"" he said.

""For her and her family it is time to come home.""

Caddick was officially added to the Australian Federal Police missing persons registrar at the weekend almost exactly three months to the day since she was last seen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFnZS5jb20uYXUvbmF0aW9uYWwvc29sbHktcy1sb3ZlLWlzbGFuZC1sb3NzLWJ1dC13YWl0LXRoZXJlLXMtbW9yZS0yMDIxMDIxNC1wNTcyZWYuaHRtbNIBZmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWFnZS5jb20uYXUvbmF0aW9uYWwvc29sbHktcy1sb3ZlLWlzbGFuZC1sb3NzLWJ1dC13YWl0LXRoZXJlLXMtbW9yZS0yMDIxMDIxNC1wNTcyZWYuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solly’s love island loss - but wait there’s more,"The marathon saga of Solomon Lew’s fight over a Thai villa should have wrapped up last week after a Singaporean court ruled the rag trader had no claim to the island home he thought he was purchasing.

Readers will recall Lew commenced litigation in 2017 after he had struck an agreement to buy the villa inside Phuket’s glitzy Andara Resort — only to find a month later it had been bought by a Swiss businessman who paid almost $3.5 million more.

The price was a drop in the ocean for the chairman of Premier Investments who is valued at more than $2 billion. However the pursuit of Andara’s Villa 29 was personal because it was the house where he proposed to wife Roza in April 2017. But we digress.

Last week Singapore’s Court of Appeal upheld an earlier decision that the chap with whom Lew struck his property deal didn’t have the authority to sell it. And for that reason Villa 29 remains the property of Swiss businessman Christian Larpin.

But the story did not end there."

Cindric the defending series champion survived a wreck-filled Xfinity opener at Daytona winning the Beef. It's What's For Dinner. 300 in overtime over Brett Moffitt and Harrison Burton.

RACE REPORT:Cindric wins wreck-filled Xfinity opener at Daytona

""Oh my goodness what an awesome race"" Cindric said. ""We had a really fast Mustang. Just an unbelievable effort.""

Here are five takeaways from Saturday's chaotic race:

1. Going to overtime

Cindric ran up front most of the day and led what was left of the field to the green to start overtime.

The defending champion took control going into Turn 1 and never looked back holding off runs by both Moffitt and AJ Allmendinger over the final two laps.

""We were coming off a lot of momentum last year but nothing is guaranteed"" Cindric said. ""We just had to keep working hard.""

2. A win for Penske

Cindric drives for Team Penske and will run the No. 21 Wood Brothers Ford which has an alliance with Penske at the Cup level full-time in 2022. This was Penske's first Xfinity win on the Daytona tri-oval.

Moffitt admitted after the race there was nothing he could do to get around the defending champ.

""With how few cars we had left the runs just weren’t huge"" he said.

3. Gentlemen start your tow trucks!

Why were there so few cars left? Well most of them were in the garage.

Saturday's 300-miler featured nine cautions including the inevitable Daytona Big One in the waning laps.

With 15 laps to go Ty Dillon made it three-wide at the front of the pack but couldn't clear Daniel Hemric causing a multi-car pileup going into Turn 3 that included 14 cars.

Dillon radioed to his team that Hemric ""drove him up the track"" but Justin Allgaier who was involved in the incident saw it differently.

""Just guys trying to be overly aggressive especially with that many laps to go"" he said. ""I knew business was going to pick up but guys were trying to make moves that are veterans who know better.""

4. Pit-road mayhem

The first big incident of the night happened at the beginning of Stage 3 when Michael Annett made a move to pit under green.

Unfortunately he dove left too late and was spun by the No. 13 of Chad Finchum. Annett who won this race in 2019 went spiraling into the pack taking out multiple cars.

""I cant get my hand out the window any further"" Annett said. ""I was waving them off down the backstretch slowing down coming into Turn 3 .... it's unfortunate. We tore up a really good Chevrolet.""

5. Lengthy red flag

Brandon Jones who won the night's opening stage also saw his race come to an end early after spinning coming to the checkered flag at the end of Stage 2.

He ended the night in much finer fashion however leading the NextEra Energy Resources 250 coming off the final corner and ending up with a third-place finish after being passed by eventual winner Ben Rhodes coming to the checkered flag on the 2.5-mile track.

Roper who snuck into the field as the final driver to lock in on qualifying speed started 31st Friday night and stayed back in the pack — out of trouble — for the majority of the 250-mile distance.

However he came to life during the final stage picking his way through several late-race accidents to have a shot during the final restart where he restarted inside the top 10 and rocketed to the front.

Roper took the green flag found defending series champion Sheldon Creed in the draft and the pair hooked up. Roper shoved Creed all the way to the lead at the white flag but when Creed slapped the outside wall approaching turn one the Texan had to take evasive action to keep his hopes alive.

He ducked to the inside in front of Rhodes and suddenly found himself leading exiting turn two.

Roper’s only problem? The push Rhodes gave him was strong enough it got him too far out front.

“I knew I was a sitting duck whenever I didn’t feel the push it just pulls the motor back” Roper said after the race. “[Ben Rhodes] sucked me back when he got to the spoiler. You hear all of that in the truck and you just know (what’s coming).”

As the field exited turn four and roared toward the checkered flag Rhodes moved to the outside lane with help from his ThorSport Racing teammate Grant Enfinger and powered past Roper.

At that point the die was cast. Roper ended up third after Jordan Anderson charged from 11th to second and nearly snookered both Roper and Rhodes in the final few feet.

Though he could see a potential win at Daytona out his windshield Roper also couldn’t discount the significance of a podium result to his single-truck family-owned race team.

“It’s bittersweet” Roper said of the finish. “You can’t be upset with a third in this series; this is probably the most competitive series in the circuit I believe. Just to make this race we were this close to not making it. But to get a good finish like that you’ve got to be happy for your guys that work on this thing so hard … and I’m happy for the team.”

Though Friday night’s result was big in terms of Roper’s confidence as a driver it also meant a lot financially considering his operation is less well-funded than some of the bigger teams in the series.

“We’ve got some work to do to be able to run like we want to run” Roper said. “So any time you can finish well and get a great finish like this and bring funds back to better your equipment it’s huge in racing like this.

“The financial side of it is huge to be able to help us get two or three more races to the schedule without any issue.”

Could he have done anything differently to hold the lead in the final run to the checkered flag?

“I had the wheel turned further than I should have left off of [turn] four” Roper said. “I wish I had known [Anderson] was coming and I probably would have thrown a little more block on him but I didn’t know he was there until it was too late … and there wasn’t any sense in taking him out because I was too late to throw it anyway.

“All I could do was hold her to the mat and see what happened.”

Roper’s season will continue Feb. 19 with the BrakeBest Select 159 from the Daytona Int’l Speedway road course the famed facility’s 3.61-mile 14-turn layout that integrates parts of the superspeedway with the infield road course used for the Rolex 24 endurance race."

Not many people can say they walked into a store and turned down the chance to buy a pair of Nike SB Dunk Low SP Chocolates or the Danny Supa in the early 2000s all because of a fat tongue. But that’s exactly what Concepts’ creative director Deon Point did. He says “A Dunk with a fat tongue didn’t make sense to me especially if I didn’t actually need to skateboard it.” Needless to say he regrets that now.

But aside from passing on those highly-coveted Dunks there’s not much Point regrets when it comes to sneakers. In fact for him it’s all about what can he do what can he push and how can he bring you on his journey of jokes fun and genius ideation.

Spoiler: he never misses the joke. In this interview for HYPEBEAST’s Sole Mates he was full of them and full of stories. From growing up and not really understanding the whole skateboarding craze — noting that skateboarders weren’t the cool kids back in the 1990s — to not getting the Dunk hype back then either during a time of AF1 and AJ1 proliferation Point’s journey has been about not just getting into sneakers but changing the way we enjoy them.

We won’t give too much away just yet but expect the unexpected from Point. His thought process is somewhat reversed: idea first then research to a) back it up and b) refine. The Concepts x Nike Dunk SB “When Pigs Fly” is the perfect example of thinking of an iconic sneaker under pressure but keeping it inspired and authentic. How do you do this? Draw from niche realms to show vision but reference reality counter-culture and society to show a grounded and relatable nature. This not-so-simple recipe and more about Deon Point’s relationship with sneakers and most importantly the true story behind the “When Pigs Fly” design can be found below.

HYPEBEAST: What got you into sneakers?

Deon Point: I’m old enough to remember everything that came out in its original format. For some of us that didn’t have the money to obtain sneakers at that age that’s what has helped usher a retro market. Once I finally got money and really got into shoes that was it: clothes were secondary. Shoes first outfit last. Things have changed over the years but for me that’s when I first started falling in love with it [during the 90s]. Accumulating shoes back then was almost like bragging rights. Having 10 20 30 shoes was a big deal back in high school but now these kids have masses. It’s not the same.

In the 1990s you didn’t just accumulate any kind of shoe it was quite specific right?

Exactly. And we were extremely focused on keeping them clean we didn’t have all the modern methods. It was basically what was under the kitchen sink a toothbrush and you did your best. We were crafty back then. But to your point you’d get shoes that stuck out at school getting them first was obviously a thing as much as it is now but there was no internet so getting them and showcasing it was a big deal back then.

What was your “It” shoe in the ‘90s?

I was a little smaller than my classmates so I was trying to get the kid’s versions of shoes. The Sky Jordan 1 (essentially the Air Jordan 1 but a take-down version) but as I got a little bit more interested it was specifically athlete based. Jordan was driving the marketplace still it was a little slow out the gate but by the IV people were pretty hip. Bo Jackson and those types of shoes too. It was scattered and not so focused on one particular model but having the athlete focus was huge for sure.

What’s your first memory of SB Dunk?

When I started shopping at Concepts they were one of the first retailers to carry SB. This was the first series of SBs — New York Chocolates Danny Supa — I walked in and I remember they had them in a glass case. I was a “preferred customer” back then I would just spend all my money there. They told me the price I think they were $600 a piece but it was a little bit of a hefty price tag than what I was accustomed to paying and I didn’t understand why so I actually passed on all of them.

I got hip on the second series and bought anything I could get my hands on and to this day I regret not just pawning up and paying out the money. I didn’t understand what it was at the time Dunks weren’t really popping — it was the Air Force 1 era Jordans were still reigning supreme. A Dunk with a fat tongue didn’t make sense to me especially if I didn’t actually need to skateboard it.

The Dunk is having a huge moment now what do you think of that? Especially seeing you lived during its pinnacle?

I don’t think I’ve ever witnessed a resurgence quite so fast in anything as long as I’ve been a part of this. I didn’t expect it to boom so quickly but I couldn’t be happier. Kids are investing interest in what’s coming out next but also the retros. For someone like me it’s kind of unique to see that. Typically when you speak about music kids usually side on what’s new and current and f*ck anything that’s old. This is different. While they’re chasing what’s coming next they’re also on the hunt to try and track down something vintage that they hold in high regard.

Are you more excited by collaborative Dunks or sourcing old Dunks?

That’s a great question! I’ve known Travis [Scott] and those guys for quite some time so I can say that he was on it very early. When Dunks’ energy was dissipating a bit he and his crew were on vintage shoes and stuff like that so I commend him for that getting on the stage and doing what he did helped everything else.

As for me… I’m not necessarily a sneakerhead because it’s primarily work-based and I’ve been through it all. I don’t get excited but there are moments where that excitement is recaptured. I think I’m just happy to see it full-circle.

Throwing it back to the “When Pigs Fly” Dunk you designed what was that whole process like?

That was tough for us. What we wanted to do was to speak to kids getting shaked down at skate spots. Not being a skater myself I’ve always had this affinity for backstories and how that came about because when I was growing up skateboarders were not the cool kids at all. Now they’re doing runway shows and dictating fashion. I thought that was cool even back in 2012.

We don’t take it too seriously and we don’t want to.

Seeing videos of kids getting shaked down mall cops security always running up on them I thought ‘How can we make a shoe like this?’ so we pitched a police uniform upper on the Dunk Low with donut sprinkles underneath. Another one was with a pink suede underlay which with fairness was calling a cop a pig back then but it was meant to be jovial and fun and lighthearted it wasn’t about the tension that there is.

We did that and SB was like ‘Are you guys f*cking crazy you can’t do this.’ At the time SB was pretty much the lone wolf of Nike they were allowed to do things that nobody else could. Talk about pushing the pace. We had carbon fiber on there we had State Trooper shirting material and everything was to tear away and the underlay would be pink. When they caved in on that we had to hit the drawing board I distinctly remember them coming back to us like ‘Okay this is going to happen but you have four days to submit or else this won’t be in the line for next year.’ This put us in a conundrum to say the least.

We went to a Nike showroom at this hotel all the celebrities used to stay there and they finessed a budget to showcase there. They had these crazy paintings on the wall and I remember my SB rep Will Campbell — we’re shooting a couple of beers ideas are back and forth — saying “I don’t think anything’s going to slide through in four days.” He literally said the words “When pigs fly” to an idea I had like there’s no chance of that happening and oddly enough it’s the weirdest story of any shoe we ever did there was a painting of flying pigs in the hotel room. I was sitting there like this is way too weird but has anyone ever made a shoe based on a phrase?

1 of 4 2 of 4 3 of 4 4 of 4

So us being Concepts us making a shoe based on a phrase isn’t enough. I dived into everything that was pigs. I looked at Pink Floyd’s Animals cover I looked at pigs in cartoons then there’s legal who would be on our backs if we directly tied it to something.

What I ended up doing — and nobody in the world knows this — I looked at the movie Porky’s. I was like this is way over the top… It was like the American Pie of my generation. I watched the whole movie and I couldn’t think of anything that came out of the movie. But as I was about to turn it off there was a mayor of the city and he has this pink Hudson Hornet — like the car from the movie Cars — low-and-behold this villain drives a pink Hornet and it has a flying emblem like a Rolls-Royce but it was a flying pig. Dude it was perfect. I’m going to make a shoe based on this car. I didn’t tell anybody of course there’s no direct tie to Porky’s but I don’t want anyone getting pissed or legal to be on me.

We made the pink shoe the silver Swoosh is piping detail on the car and just differentiate and break it up a little bit I added the blue under the Dunk Hi lace eyelets on the top they fold over to resemble a pig flying in the sky. One detail I don’t think anybody knows is the tongue tag is blue and yellow and that was more to break up the color. We were worried pink shoes were going to be considered not skate or tough enough so I took the license plate of cars in Miami where the film was filmed they were navy and yellow so that’s where we added the plate. A lot of people ask me about the colors and I’ve never really told them. It gave me enough of a backstory where I felt comfortable pitching it as a Concepts project but it got a little wiry when we did clothing to accompany it… Nike called me like “We cannot do a Porky’s shoe” and I was like “I promise you it’s not a Porky’s shoe.” Which in fairness I felt comfortable saying because it’s based on a car in a fictional movie.

That’s the first time saying it. It feels like a weight off my shoulders.

Is that why you chose to spotlight this shoe over any other Concepts shoe you’ve done?

I thought it’d be cool to let people know how difficult it is to come up with a great idea and get through the red tape that is legal. Right now you’ll get shot down 50 times before you get a yes. The other side is the urgency that we had to come up with an idea.

For the Turdunken we did that three or four years ago.

Concepts always has a really interesting angle of inspiration. How and why do you think against the grain especially with something like the Dunk?

I appreciate that and that’s awesome I’m glad you asked. A lot of people don’t take this into account: when I started the founder [Tarek Hassan] was wearing Gucci and luxury and I was too I was big into labels in the early 2000s. For us we always wanted to weave luxury in — with the Lobster a lot of people took it as a joke as a Boston food but for us it was the start of something. You look at UNDFTD it’s sports-based Supreme is skate we wanted our niche.

When we do an eight ball shoe it’s not really a cocaine movie shoe it’s based on luxury. Casino in the knit epi leather on there it’s a luxury element that we weave into sport. That’s been an underlying theme throughout I just don’t think we’re as pronounced for people to get it. When we break away from that we go super silly and really add humor. We don’t take it too seriously and we don’t want to I read designers and there’s always this whole intricate vibe of why they did a blue shoe and I’m always just like ‘This sounds like total bullsh*t.’ For me let’s go against the grain and have fun and be unapologetic about it. Lobster to me was still funny even though there’s a luxury element to it. Hudson’s are a luxury vintage car but it’s more fun to me. Even Turdunken it dates back to when kings used to eat and they stuffed 16 animals into another for a banquet.

What can the sneaker industry learn from Concepts’ inspirations and collaborations and the way it does it’s collaborations?

We were one of the pioneers we were one of the first guys to step into the arena but we were also very late on the Internet held out in the middle of nowhere. It was about finding out who we wanted to be staying true to that even if we didn’t do a great job of communicating. It makes sense to us and everything we do. We’ve done some off the wall zany stuff but for us we considered it risk. There’s a lot of stuff we’ve done that separates us from the pack.

I always tell kids you have to find out where you fit in. Find what’s missing and find a way to align that with your views and mission. A lot of kids want to mirror what’s happening in the marketplace for us if we did that we wouldn’t have made it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpY2tzb25maXJlLmNvbS9uaWtlLWFpci12YXBvcm1heC1wbHVzLWF0bGFudGEtcmVsZWFzZS1kYXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Release Date: Nike Air VaporMax Plus Atlanta,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with (""Connection broken: InvalidChunkLength(got length b'', 0 bytes read)"", InvalidChunkLength(got length b'', 0 bytes read)) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpY2tzb25maXJlLmNvbS9uaWtlLWFpci12YXBvcm1heC1wbHVzLWF0bGFudGEtcmVsZWFzZS1kYXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWV0aGluay5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9oYW5kcy1mcmVlLXNuZWFrZXLSATpodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVldGhpbmsuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvaGFuZHMtZnJlZS1zbmVha2VyP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike unveils its first hands-free sneaker: The GO FlyEase,"Nike sells more shoes than any other company in the world and while the shapes styles and sizes of its sneakers may vary they all have one thing in common: you need to use your hands to put them on.

That may seem intrinsic to shoes but that’s changing in 2021 as Nike has just announced its first completely hands-free sneaker — and the design was inspired by a letter from a teenage boy.

Shoe Stress

In 2012 Matthew Walzer was 16 years old and like many people his age he was thinking a lot about college.

However unlike his peers Walzer wasn’t just considering majors and dorm setups — he was wondering whether he’d be able to find someone at school to tie his shoes.

Walzer had been born with cerebral palsy a disorder that affects some of his motor skills and he lacks the hand flexibility needed to put on and tie laces.

So with college on the horizon he decided to take his problem to the largest footwear company in the world.

“My dream is to go to the college of my choice without having to worry about someone coming to tie my shoes every day” Walzer wrote in a letter to Nike. “I’ve worn Nike basketball shoes all my life. I can only wear this type of shoe because I need ankle support to walk.”

“At 16 years old I am able to completely dress myself but my parents still have to tie my shoes” he continued. “As a teenager who is striving to become totally self-sufficient I find this extremely frustrating and at times embarrassing.”

Birth of the FlyEase

The letter ended up in the hands of Nike designer Tobie Hatfield who began working with Walzer on a prototype. Before the end of 2012 the teen had a pair of custom Nikes on his feet that he could put on and take off without any assistance.

When I put the shoes on every morning they give the greatest sense of independence

Matthew Walzer

“When I put the shoes on every morning they give the greatest sense of independence and accomplishment I have ever felt in my life” Walzer told Nike.

The company didn’t stop there though.

Hatfield and his team continued to develop the shoes and in 2015 Nike released the FlyEase a sneaker with a zipper and strap closure that makes them easier for people with limited mobility to put on and take off.

Now the company has taken the design to the next level with a completely hands-free sneaker: the GO FlyEase.

Nike’s Hands-Free Sneaker

Nike’s GO FlyEase doesn’t have any zippers straps or laces at all. What it does have is a “kickstand” a “tensioner” and a “diving board.”

Usually the part of a sneaker that touches the ground (the outsole) is just one straight piece but for the hands-free sneaker Nike split it in two — a front and a back — connected by a hinge.

The company then added a little ledge to the back part by the heel (right where you probably already step on your shoe to take it off when you don’t feel like untying the laces).

This back part of the outsole is the kickstand and when you step on it with the toes of your opposite foot the GO FlyEase pops open at the hinge.

A band that swings from one side of the shoe around the heel and back to the other side — the tensioner — holds the shoe in this open position so you can slide your foot out.

The diving board is the part of the sneaker that touches the bottom of your foot (the insole). Nike left that in one piece so when the shoe is in the open position there’s a wedge-shaped gap between the diving board and the kickstand.

When you want to put the shoes on you just step into them and press your foot down on the diving board. The tensioner then pulls the kickstand up around your heel and holds it in place.

Universal Design

While the journey to the GO FlyEase began with a call for great accessibility the hands-free sneaker isn’t exclusively for people who have trouble tying laces — they could appeal to anyone who likes the look of sneakers but the ease of slip-ons.

“What I love about this shoe in particular is we listened to the extreme needs of (people with specific limitations)” Sarah Reinertsen the senior director of Nike Ease told Fast Company. “But with this solution we feel like it’s a universal proposition.”

The GO FlyEase costs $120 and Nike plans to make it available to members of its rewards program on February 15. The general public will have to wait until later this year to get their hands on the hands-free sneaker.

By Maria Saporta

The optics were not good.

Norfolk Southern Atlanta’s newest Fortune 500 company was bulldozing on the land that once housed the Chattahoochee Brick Co. a company that manufactured millions of bricks that helped in the building of Atlanta by using convict labor and many workers died on the site. That history came to light in 2009 in the Pulitzer Prize-winning book – “Slavery by Another Name” – Doug Blackmon.

The land currently is owned by Lincoln Energy Solutions which planned to build a fuel terminal with mega oil tanks but it ran into community and city government opposition. Lincoln was denied permits to build out the fuel terminal so it filed a lawsuit in 2016. But for unexplained reasons it withdrew its lawsuit one week before the hearing was scheduled.

The community found out last year that Lincoln had leased the 75-acre site to Norfolk Southern which has special development powers awarded to railroads. It appeared Norfolk Southern would be able to develop the property into a rail transfer facility without having to go through all the regulatory hurdles.

Needless to say residents in nearby communities felt Lincoln and Norfolk Southern had done an “end run” to develop the project despite widespread opposition.

A community protest was held Feb. 9 with several of Atlanta’s best-known activists including Derrick Boazman a former Atlanta City Councilman.

“This is a crime scene” Boazman said about the horrendous history of Chattahoochee Brick while announcing a “Stop Norfolk Southern Coalition” that includes the Concerned Black Clergy the Rainbow Coalition and NAACP.

“What is happening here is an injustice and economic injustice because Norfolk Southern is benefiting from our tax money to do this” said Vincent Fort a former state Senator of the local tax breaks Norfolk Southern had received to move its headquarters to Atlanta from Norfolk Va. “More than anything else it is a moral injustice. We cannot say that Black lives matter and allow Norfolk Southern to build on the bodies of Black men.”

The optics looked bad for Norfolk Southern. The company which is building its headquarters in a new tower in Midtown prides itself on being a good corporate citizen.

Three days after the protest Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms issued a statement saying she was “seeking to stop development of a fuel terminal” by filing for a preliminary injunction with the Surface Transportation Board which regulates railroads.

“Our Administration will do everything it can to protect the sanctity and significance of this property” Bottoms said in a news release. “A site of such historic and environmental importance needs careful consideration before even limited development occurs.”

On Saturday Norfolk Southern issued its own statement. It said it “will stop work on the site immediately while we engage in further discussions with the City.” (See the full statements from the city and Norfolk Southern below).

Hallelujah!

We now have an opportunity for a reset.

The 75-acre site is not only historically significant it is also environmentally significant.

It sits at the confluence of Proctor Creek and the Chattahoochee River inside I-285 near Bolton Road. For years community leaders and environmental organizations have wanted the property to be part of a Chattahoochee River Park. The idea gained traction when the city did a master plan on how the river could become a public amenity with multiuse trails running along the river. The city even tried unsuccessfully to buy the Chattahoochee Brick land.

Doug Blackmon author of “Slavery by Another Name” also believes we need to preserve the site as a historical reminder of one of Atlanta’s ugliest past. Blackmon describe the site as a place where “people were starved to death worked to death and whipped to death” while working as free prison labor. The plant originally was built by James English who served as Atlanta’s mayor from 1881 to 1883.

“There’s no doubt a substantial number of people died at Chattahoochee Brick and were buried there” said Blackmon who would like Norfolk Southern to be transparent in any archeological studies that it conducts on the property. “But it doesn’t really matter whether there are bones in the ground. We need to remember places where horrifying things were done by other human beings. We need to remember that even if there are no bones in the ground.”

Jeff DeGraff manager of media relations for Norfolk Southern said the railroad plans to build a memorial to acknowledge the site’s history.

“We were aware of some of the issues with the site” DeGraff said in an interview before the company decided to stop work on the project. “The parcel itself is uniquely situated for us. It’s adjacent to our main line. It is already in an industrial area. It’s sitting vacant. It’s being adjacent to I-285 is ideal.”

Norfolk Southern was planning to develop the property as transfer facility to better serve its customers including Lincoln. It also expected to expand services to other customers who would offload their products such as other commodities on the site.

“We can assure you that this is a Norfolk Southern project to benefit our customers” DeGraff said. “This is an opportunity for us. This is not an end run around.”

But the site is also an opportunity for Atlanta to be reimagined in a new way – much as the Atlanta BeltLine is transforming a circular rail corridor into one of the most successful urban redevelopment initiatives in the country.

The Chattahoochee Brick is a once-in-a-life opportunity to open up the Chattahoochee River as a place that welcomes Atlantans to enjoy the riverfront. If the site is fully redeveloped for industrial purposes that opportunity will be lost.

“From my perspective the historical and environmental issues are real” Blackmon said. “We have an obligation to acknowledge what happened. This should be a time for Atlanta to have an open conversation of what this place means in our history. These ugly things in the past are central to our story of how our city became a great city. This place was central to the creation of modern Atlanta.”

I do not know whether there’s the possibility to find a middle ground between Norfolk Southern’s desire to build a transfer facility and the vision to create a Chattahoochee River Park on land that would also include a significant historical memorial detailing what happened on the site.

But I do know the Chattahoochee Brick property gives Norfolk Southern an opportunity to demonstrate whether it will be a model corporate citizen in Atlanta.



City of Atlanta’s Feb. 12 statement on Chattahoochee Brick Company Property:

City files petition to protect historic site and Chattahoochee River water supply.

ATLANTA—The City of Atlanta filed a Petition for Preliminary Injunction with the Surface Transportation Board seeking to stop development of a fuel terminal on a property that was the former location of the Chattahoochee Brick Company. This property is located on the Chattahoochee River just north and west of Bolton Road.

“Our Administration will do everything it can to protect the sanctity and significance of this property” said Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. “A site of such historic and environmental importance needs careful consideration before even limited development occurs.”

The Chattahoochee Brick Company was owned by former Atlanta Mayor James W. English. The brick company which supplied material for the construction of houses and buildings in Atlanta used leased “convict” labor in its manufacturing processes working primarily African American men under terrible conditions – some even to their death in furtherance of this enterprise. It is widely believed makeshift graves were created on the site – of which likely remain to this day.

Additionally this property is on the Chattahoochee River – Atlanta’s and the larger region’s supply of drinking water for which great success has been achieved improving water quality.

The Surface Transportation Board is an independent federal agency which primarily regulates railroads. The City of Atlanta is challenging the development of the fuel terminal on a variety of regulatory grounds.

Norfolk Southern’s full statement issued on Feb. 13:

We share the Mayor’s view of the historical significance of this site and recognize that any entity seeking to develop it takes on a special responsibility to do so in a socially and environmentally responsible way. That’s why we will stop work on the site immediately while we engage in further discussions with the City. Throughout this process we have worked closely with local officials and held multiple meetings to listen to the concerns of community stakeholders. We have committed to build a memorial to ensure the atrocities committed at the site are never forgotten. We are abiding by all applicable regulations and are conducting extensive clean-up of the site. We support the vision of many in the community for a network of trails along the Chattahoochee. In addition to the environmental reviews associated with cleaning up the site we have engaged experts to perform an archeological and historical survey as well as archaeological excavation in certain areas. There has been no evidence of a cemetery on the site but given the tragic legacy of the site we have continued to exercise great care.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvYnJvd25zLWZhbi1iYXR0bGluZy1raWRuZXktY2FuY2VyLXdoby13YXRjaGVkLXRlYW0tY2xpbmNoLXBsYXlvZmYtYmVydGgtZGllcy9hcnRpY2xlXzZhMTY5NDliLWY4ZjAtNTZhOS1hZWY4LTE4NzQwYjgyZTY3OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Browns fan battling kidney cancer who watched team clinch playoff berth dies,"Memphis TN (38111)

It has already started scanning 366 original Doncaster Works drawings which will enable it to build the yet-to-be named third Gresley class V4 No 3403.

This week marked the 80th anniversary of the unveiling of the original V4 prototype.

Trust chairman Steve Davies said: “We are in the pre-launch phase of the project to build our third new main line steam locomotive the yet-to-be-named Gresley class V4 No. 3403 – Sir Nigel Gresley’s final design.

""With the order for construction now placed on Darlington Locomotive Works the scanning of the drawings commenced and further components acquired we are well positioned for the formal launch of the project.

“We want to be ready to start assembling our new Gresley class V4 as soon as our new class P2 is completed.""

It is anticipated the project will cost about £3m and will take five years depending on how fast funds are raised.

Mr Davies added: ""Our new Gresley class V4 is an ideal locomotive for regional main line tours repeat main line itineraries and the longer main line connected heritage railways.

""Unlike with our class P2 where we have had to do a considerable amount of development work to complete the job that Sir Nigel Gresley started in 1934 there will be very little redesign work needed as there were no known problems with the Gresley class V4s.""

The trust is planning to launch a founder's club to help fund the early stages of the project the details of which will be announced later in the year.

The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) class V4 was a 2-6-2 steam locomotive designed by Sir Nigel Gresley who also designed the Flying Scotsman.",,,,,,,,,

The deal which modifies a $958 million contract originally awarded in 2019 provides for the exercise of three option contract line items to procure eight G/ATOR Gallium Nitride full-rate production systems with associated travel and one lot of the initial provisioning package (spares) in support of Program Executive Officer Land Systems Quantico Virginia.

Within the contract work will be performed in Linthicum Maryland and is expected to be complete by Feb. 28 2024.

The G/ATOR is a highly expeditionary three-dimensional short-to-medium-range multi-role radar that will replace several legacy and retired systems such as the AN/TPS-63. The difference will be easy hardware/software replacement the capability for elevation tracking and assisting the AN/TPS-59A(V)3 Long-Range Radar in filling in gaps in radar resolution.

This multi-mission air surveillance system can detect identify and track airborne threats common to combat environments. These include cruise missiles aircraft and remotely piloted vehicles as well as rocket artillery and mortar fire.

Northrop Grumman says the long-range high-performance AN/TPS-80 replaces five of the Marine Corps’ single-mission radars with one multi-mission system reducing cost and complexity while streamlining training. It consolidates the air surveillance air defense and counterfire target acquisition missions of the AN/TPQ-46 UPS-3 AN/TPS-63 AN/MPQ-62 and AN/TPS-73 into one package with radar power and communications elements.

In addition earlier in August 2020 the U.S. Marine Corps has confirmed that it is replacing its legacy ground weapons locating radar with a new AN/TPS-80 Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR) multi-role radar system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhdHJpb3RsZWRnZXIuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8wMi8xMy9mbGlnaHQtZW5naW5lZXItd29ya2luZy1uYXNhLWhhcy1zb3V0aC1zaG9yZS1yb290cy80Mzk0MTczMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flight engineer working for NASA has South Shore roots,"Name: Tom Harkins

Hometown: Weymouth

In the news: Harkins is a flight engineer working on NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.

Now you know: Harkins is working on the most powerful space telescope ever built with a sunshield the size of a tennis court.

His story: Ever since he was a kid Tom Harkins would tinker with LEGOs try to build things figure out how everyday objects work and fix broken items around the house with his dad. So engineering was always a natural fit for him he said.

After graduating from the University of Notre Dame in 2008 where Harkins focused on aerospace engineering his senior year and took classes on aircraft design and development he started working for aerospace and defense company Northrop Grumman in California.

Harkins initially worked on other projects in a rotation program that took him around the country from Florida to California and he ended up on the James Webb Space Telescope team in 2013.

He now works out of his home in Maryland where he lives with his wife and young kids who he said find dad's work exciting. Harkins even has a model of the telescope at home for his kids.

""I tell my son who's 4 and my daughter who's 2 even though she's just starting to understand what it can (do)"" Harkins said ""I talk to other students and professionals and it's inspiring. It's part of the reason I became an engineer. It's like how can we take an idea and make it into a physical reality — we make this idea of taking pictures of distant galaxies into a real machine that can do it.""

NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has become a household name but come October the James Webb Space Telescope will launch from French Guiana South America and become the most powerful space telescope ever built Harkins said.

The James Webb Space Telescope is unique in that it looks into the infrared area of the electromagnetic spectrum as opposed to only the visible light area of the spectrum like the Hubble telescope does.

Harkins said the telescope is like a ""time machine"" as it will essentially allow scientists to look back in time as close to the Big Bang as possible — which was over 13 billion years ago. This is possible in the same way that human beings on earth view light from the sun that is eight minutes old Harkins said.

As a flight engineer Harkins spends most of his time working with his team on contingencies — using a simulator to practice every possible situation that could go wrong and figuring out how they might respond.

Unlike the Hubble Space Telescope which exists in the same orbit as the International Space Station the JWST will be sent into orbit one million miles from earth Harkins said. With no astronauts coming to save the day they need to make sure they have planned for everything.

The effort is an international collaboration Harkins said between NASA which provided the engineering design and development aspects of the project the Canadian Space Agency which contributed a few instruments and the European Space Agency which is providing the launch vehicle.

""Scientists from many many countries are gonna be wanting to get their hands on this data"" Harking said. ""It's gonna push the boundaries of discovery. And so the whole world is participating.""

Just two days after DARPA named it as one of three competitors for the LongShot contract the company released an image of its concept for an air-launched unmanned aircraft system (UAS) Aviation Week reported.

Imagine an unmanned aircraft speeding ahead of its launch aircraft that itself can fire multiple air-to-air intercept missiles that can seek out and destroy.

No pilots to risk just a throw-away UAS that can potentially avoid enemy radar and return to base unharmed to be used again.

That’s the thing about unmanned systems they lack the romanticism of the past.

After their missions are completed — if they are lucky to return — they are duly checked out and parked in a lonely darkened hangar.

They don’t get to go to the bar and brag about their exploits.

Nevertheless Northrop aims to combine its skill set in digital engineering with an “extensive knowledge in advanced technology weapons autonomous systems and strike platforms to increase weapon range and effectiveness” said Jaime Engdahl Northrop’s program director for kinetic weapons.

DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) selected Northrop Lockheed Martin and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. to develop competitive designs for the LongShot program Aviation Week reported.

The LongShot concept appears similar to a previous DARPA program that involved Northrop which was known as the Flying Missile Rail. But Northrop said that program did not directly influence the company’s proposal.

“The real challenge that DARPA posed with LongShot was to investigate whether innovations in multimode propulsion can significantly increase the efficiency of delivering weapons at extended ranges and whether that efficiency can provide significant advantage to our warfighters” a Northrop spokeswoman said.

LongShot would allow fighters and bombers to take off with air-to-air missiles attached to a powered UAS that can separate and fly far ahead of the launch aircraft Aviation Week reported.

The missiles depicted on the LongShot UAS concept appear to be of a previously unseen design. The externally carried missiles also cut down on the stealth characteristics of the weapon. Credit: Northrop Grumman.

Easier said than done of course.

A key challenge is to complete a series of events including finding tracking and engaging a target at very long range with an autonomous missile launching system.

According to The War Zone compared to the LongShot concept art that DARPA itself released which shows a very cruise missile-like design Northrop Grumman’s proposal has a more airplane-like planform.

It also has a more traditional wing and tail configuration rather than a flying wing design which the company has become very well known for over the years.

Overall this particular design seems more consistent with a number of “loyal wingman” type drones that various other companies have in different stages of development War Zone reported.

In particular it has a number of very general similarities including a v-tail and top-mounted air intake to Kratos’ XQ-58 Valkyrie.

The US Air Force is currently conducting tests using XQ-58As as part of its Skyborg program which is seeking to develop a suite of artificial intelligence-driven systems capable of operating loyal wingman drones and fully-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV) among others.

Interestingly while Northrop Grumman’s LongShot concept has stealthy features including a chined fuselage it is shown carrying a pair of missiles externally which would increase its overall radar cross-section War Zone reported.

It’s not explicitly stated that the design is intended to carry weapons internally but it likely does as the renderings show weapons bay doors.

Even being able to carry smaller hit-to-kill air-to-air missiles internally in a stealthy configuration would be highly beneficial.

This would give the system more flexibility and allow it to also carry outsized missiles that feature longer-range and larger warheads such as the ones shown in the rendering War Zone reported.

Also the missiles depicted one of which has a skull and crossbones sticker of some kind on its nosecone also appear to be a previously unseen design.

Spurred by rapid technological advancements from Russia and China and an ever more dangerous battlefield DARPA is exploring new lethal engagement concepts by leveraging multi-modal propulsion weapon systems that can be operationally deployed from existing fighters or bombers Intelligent Aerospace reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsYWNrZW5naW5lZXIuY29tL25ld3MvZ21zLWdlcmFsZC1qb2huc29uLXJlY29nbml6ZWQtYXMtMjAyMXMtYmxhY2stZW5naW5lZXItb2YtdGhlLXllYXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM's Gerald Johnson recognized as 2021's Black Engineer of the Year,"The 2021 Black Engineer of the Year Awards (BEYA) held Thursday Feb. 11 through Saturday Feb. 13 was an all-digital event.

Here’s What You Need to Remember: The U.S. Coast Guard helps intercept dangerous shipments of illegal drugs and supports the U.S. Navy securing international waterways thwarting terrorism crime and piracy. In addition perhaps most of all they regularly rescue people on the brink of death. As a service the U.S. Coast Guard is at times under-recognized despite being increasingly in demand as threats to the homeland continue to mount due to the growing global reach of major power rivals.

Within the Coast Guard mission scope is a balanced yet crucial need to patrol both littoral and deep-water areas as part of an integrated operational approach a task assigned to the services’ medium endurance cutters. However the current fleet of twenty-nine legacy medium endurance cutters (which used to be thirty-three not too many years ago) have been in service for decades and are reaching obsolescence and are badly in need of replacement.

There is where the Coast Guard’s emerging Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) enters the equation a new ship envisioned as a more capable better networked larger and far more advanced high- tech medium endurance cutter than has ever existed.

A U.S. Coast Guard report on the ship had stated that the OPC will provide a capability bridge between the national security cutter which patrols the open ocean in the most demanding maritime environments to the smaller and the fast response cutters which serve closer to shore.

The Coast Guard selected Eastern Shipbuilding Group Inc. (ESG) to build the ship by choosing them to continue into phase 2 of the OPC development which includes detail design and construction. While smaller than some of the largest shipbuilders ESG officials say the company is known for building highly complex ships of very high quality on time and on budget and has helped design the practical design and technological configuration of the ship. The first cutter in the class of the new fleet Argus is slated to set sail at some point in 2022.

“ESG came through with a great price for the government with a ship almost matching the operational capabilities of their largest assets but offering a significant cost reduction in both construction and over the life of the vessel. One of the things I focused on was I did not want to reduce future capabilities of any acquisitions program while knowing we had to get the Coast Guard fantastic ships at affordable prices” said Adm. Robert Papp (RET) former Coast Guard Commandant and current President of the DC offices of ESG.

At 360 feet the ESG OPC is much larger than the 210-foot and 270-foot medium endurance cutters they are replacing and also engineered with an entirely new sphere of command and control systems sensor technologies and networking applications. This new dimension of technology is of great significance to Coast Guard planners who anticipate that new levels of networked yet disaggregated operations will increasingly be necessary. Northrop Grumman and ESG drew from state of the market technologies to build this ship.

“When you build a Navy ship you have to focus on power and speed. The Navy has oilers that can refuel ships whereas most Coast Guard ops are independent of the fleet. You don’t have a supply ship so you must have room onboard for fuel food and supplies and you need to conserve that fuel” Papp said.

The epic voyage has sold out in a single day! By the time the cruise departs the industry will no doubt be back to some normality and that confidence remains in the sector.

Cruise Bookings Boom

It’s very rare to have some good news in the cruise industry these days but we finally have something positive from Oceania Cruises part of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. The luxury line’s epic 180-day world cruise that departs in 2023 has sold out in just one day.

Bookings opened for the public on January 27 2021 and even though these types of sailings usually attract loyal cruisers in this case more than one-third of all bookings came from first-time and first to Oceania guests.

Bob Binder President and Chief Executive Officer of Oceania Cruises said:

“The response to our epic 2023 around the world voyage clearly illustrates the enthusiasm that experienced travelers have for immersive and memorable travel experiences.” “Despite the challenges the world faces today travelers are clearly bullish on the future and are embracing these new opportunities to travel the world and create lifelong memories.”

The cruise line has seen a steady increase of interest in its offering during the past year. In fact Oceania has seen booking levels up to 50% for those who are new to the brand. Additionally a full 20% of world cruise guests opted to extend their voyage up to a total of 218 days.

It’s not clear why the interest is up but possible this type of sailing in a more intimate setting provides more confidence for cruisers during these difficult times. Smaller ships with lower capacity could be the new boom in the industry.

The 180-Day World Voyage

The line’s 2023 Around the World in 180 Days voyage is the most extensive and in-depth of any world cruise available. Calling on 96 ports in 33 countries across four continents the voyage also includes three full days cruising in Antarctica and affords guests access to more than 60 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

The Insignia cruise ship will sail this dream offering departing San Francisco California on January 15 2023. The 684-passenger vessel will end the cruise back in San Francisco on July 13 2023 and the voyage is costing guests over $41000!

There is also the option to book the 200-day cruise which covers the same segment to the 180-day cruise but ends in New York on August 2 2023.

At the moment just like most other cruise lines Oceania Cruises has suspended operations. At the moment cruises are canceled through April30 2021.

Those looking to buy graphics cards are competing between scalpers and miners to get cards. Mind you many allege that NVIDIA is directly selling cards to miners. Some may say I'll settle for a gaming laptop but miners are also buying gaming laptops to mine crypto. If you go one step lower and settle for a console you'll have to deal with scalpers because consoles are also being resold due to the low stock and high demand.

Tariffs Chinese New Year & Raw Material Supply All At Fault For Causing GPU Shortages

Last December I covered data regarding the resale market of these products but I decided an update was necessary due to the issue worsening. Michael Driscoll went ahead and collected all the data of these products being resold on eBay in January. Tom's Hardware worked with him to get updated data on the graphics card market. The new data to say the least is disappointing from the perspective of an observer and disheartening from the perspective of a buyer.

Why are we seeing a spike in the pricing of these components? It's not the most simple case here. Most would assume since the pandemic seems to be more under control the production would return to a normal state but that simply hasn't happened. Many factors have caused this. The most obvious answer to the shortage is the lack of raw materials. The supply chain has been disrupted so production is also going to be disrupted. AMD has said on multiple occasions said that getting substrate packaging has gotten increasingly difficult.

Source: Michael Driscoll

A person who doesn't have the full picture would respond with if the shortage is still continuing why are the prices continuing to increase with roughly the same demand? The most obvious of those would be the tariffs but the price jump on the resale listings for lower-end cards is greater than the price jump on the MSRP of those cards. Certainly a factor but it's definitely not the main reason why the price might have occurred.

The location of these factories is in Asia specifically in Taiwan and China. The reason this is important is because of the celebration of the Chinese New Year. This holiday pretty much shuts down work in these regions for one to two weeks. If no stock is coming from the factories resellers can squeeze the market and get people who need or really want a GPU to buy at an even higher price.

Data Shows That 15300 Graphics Cards Have Been Sold On eBay From Both NVIDIA And AMD

Let's look at the data. Roughly 15300 graphics cards from both AMD and NVIDIA have been sold on eBay since the start of January. The majority of the cards are from the green team. Over 14000 NVIDIA cards ranging from the RTX 3060 Ti to the RTX 3090. Around 3000 RTX 3060 Ti have been sold on eBay. The RTX 3070 had around 5400 sold on eBay is by far the most popular card. The RTX 3080 falls 2nd behind the RTX 3080 with around 3400 sales. The king of the lineup falls in last with roughly 2300 sales.

AMD suffers the same fate but fewer cards are sold due to less stock. The RX 6900 XT had 334 sales. The RX 6800 XT had 448 sales and the RX 6800 is close behind with 434 sales. Combine all of these and you get a total of 1216 sales. That doesn't even amount to the sales of a single NVIDIA card. That just goes to show the shortage issues AMD is facing because the MSRP of these cards vs the performance in crypto mining would make a popular option. AMD only accounts for roughly 8 percent of the graphics card resale market.

On top of being sold at an incredible rate people are paying exorbitant amounts for these cards. Let's look at the increase of the resale price from January to February. Let me remind you that the January price we are comparing to the February price is not the MSRP. It is the average resale price on cards already well above their MSRP. The average January resale price of the RTX 3060 Ti was $690 the RTX 3070 was $804 the RTX 3080 was $1290 the RTX 3090 was $2087 the RX 6800 was $865 the RX 6800 XT was $1179 and the RX 6900 XT was $1458.

The card that took the biggest leap in February is RTX 3060 Ti the with a 33% jump in resale price ($920). It was closely followed by the RTX 3080 with a 24% jump ($1593). This was followed by the RX 6800 with an 18% jump ($1018). Closely behind it is the RTX 3070 with a 17% jump ($940). Then comes the RX 6800 XT with a 11% jump ($1312). The one least impacted was the RX 6900 XT with an 8% jump ($1570). The RTX 3090 may not have had the most significant jump at 14% but the average resale price is $2379. It might as well be renamed to the Titan RTX for this generation.

All this may make you feel like a console is a solution but that is not the case. Consoles are also being scalped. The data we used was only from eBay but other websites like StockX have also started to add these cards to the marketplace. The time to buy hardware is not now and the shortages look to be getting worse. For all consumers who want this hardware your best bet is trying to catch restocks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2FkZ2V0LmNvbS9udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA2MC1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUtMTg1ODQ5MDY3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3060 debuts February 25th if you can find it,"NVIDIA has set a release date for the GeForce RTX 3060 although the wait won't be the biggest challenge. According to The Verge the $329 mid-tier GPU will be available from retailers on February 25th at 12PM Eastern. You'll have to snap up a third-party video card. Unlike the RTX 3060 Ti and other higher-end boards there won't be an official Founders Edition.

The base 3060 is a spiritual successor to cards like the GTX 1060 and RTX 2060 and brings features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing and DLSS to a sub-$350 NVIDIA card for the first time. It's the slowest of the RTX 30 family to date with 'just' 3584 CUDA cores a 192-bit memory interface and a 1.32GHz base clock. However it also has the most memory of any mainstream NVIDIA GPU with 12GB of RAM — it may be a better pick if you need that headroom more than you do raw computing power.

The challenge as you might guess is finding the RTX 3060 in stock. NVIDIA has been dealing with GPU shortages for months due to both a surge of cryptocurrency mining and limited demand to the point where it has resumed selling years-old cards just to have products available. Production isn't expected to improve until NVIDIA's fiscal quarter ends in late April. If you don't act quickly enough you may have to pay a premium for the RTX 3060 (or wait several weeks) to get one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vaW5zdGFsbC1yZWluc3RhbGwtb3Blbi1udmlkaWEtY29udHJvbC1wYW5lbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How To Open Nvidia Control Panel (& What To Do If It's Disappeared),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vaW5zdGFsbC1yZWluc3RhbGwtb3Blbi1udmlkaWEtY29udHJvbC1wYW5lbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9xdWFsY29tbS1taWNyb3NvZnQtZ29vZ2xlLW9wcG9zZS1udmlkaWFzLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLWFybS1sdGQtMTUwMjk1MTk4MS5odG1s0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc3RhdGVzbWFuLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3F1YWxjb21tLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1nb29nbGUtb3Bwb3NlLW52aWRpYXMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tYXJtLWx0ZC0xNTAyOTUxOTgxLmh0bWwvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qualcomm Microsoft Google oppose Nvidia’s acquisition of Arm Ltd,"A group of tech giants including Qualcomm Microsoft and Google have reportedly informed regulators around the world that they are against Nvidia’s acquisition of British chip designer Arm reports said on Thursday.

The companies raising objections to the deal which is reportedly already under review by the Federal Trade Commission have approached regulators in the US EU UK and China a CNBC report said.

These companies fear that the acquisition will lead to changes in how Arm licenses out its chipmaking technology despite Nvidia pledging that it will not force Arm to change the way it interacts with other businesses The Verge reported on Friday.

Nvidia is a leader in GPU which creates interactive graphics on laptops workstations mobile devices notebooks and PCs among others.

The company announced in September 2020 its intention to buy Arm Ltd from SoftBank in a $40 billion deal. Its rivals now fear that any restrictions on Arm’s licences could hurt them.

Qualcomm’s processors rely on Arm’s technology while Microsoft and Google are reportedly working on their own Arm-based chips.

Nvidia’s rivals do not appear to be convinced by the argument that the company will not interfere in Arm’s licences of chipmaking technology.

On its part Nvidia had said that the acquisition of Arm is intended to push its Artificial Intelligence (AI) efforts.

When announcing the acquisition both the parties involved had said that their combination brings together Nvidia’s leading AI computing platform with Arm’s vast ecosystem to create the premier computing company for the age of artificial intelligence accelerating innovation while expanding into large high-growth markets.

“This combination has tremendous benefits for both companies our customers and the industry” a CNBC report quoted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang as saying when the deal was announced.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbWJyaWRnZWluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL2J1c2luZXNzL252aWRpYS1zLWNhbWJyaWRnZS0xLXN1cGVyY29tcHV0ZXItd2lsbC1iZS1hLWZvcmNlLWZvci1saWZlLXNjaWVuY2VzLTkxNTY0NDcv0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbWJyaWRnZWluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL2J1c2luZXNzL2FtcC9udmlkaWEtcy1jYW1icmlkZ2UtMS1zdXBlcmNvbXB1dGVyLXdpbGwtYmUtYS1mb3JjZS1mb3ItbGlmZS1zY2llbmNlcy05MTU2NDQ3Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘NVIDIA’s Cambridge-1 supercomputer will be a force for life sciences’,"NVIDIA Cambridge-1 supercomputer (44354186)

While NVIDIA awaits regulatory approval for its $40bn bid for Arm the US technology company is progressing its vision for a starring role in the Cambridge ecosystem by engaging with the local community.

The first two major goals are creating an AI centre of excellence in the centre of the city and launching the UK’s most powerful supercomputer the Cambridge-1.

Among the first companies to harness Cambridge-1 for research will be GSK and AstraZeneca. Additionally researchers from Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust King’s College London and Oxford Nanopore Technologies plan to use the system.

The inward investment will start to yield results in the first half of this year says David Hogan VP Enterprise EMEA (Europe Middle East Asia) at NVIDIA. David discussed the company’s plans at an online Cambridge Network event on January 28.

“We had a very very positive response” he says of the occasion – NVIDIA’s first event as a member of Cambridge Network.

“The ecosystem really outreached to us and for us that’s part of the journey.”

The next step will be the Cambridge-1 launch.

“The supercomputer will be focused on health and life sciences in collaboration with GSK and AstraZeneca and others including NHS organisations” David confirms.

David Hogan VP Enterprise EMEA at NVIDIA

“The Cambridge-1 is for grand challenges where a lot of research needs to be done – Covid research for instance which has huge power requirements: we expect to be operational in the first half of the year.”

The supercomputer’s data-crunching capabilities will see it ranked number 29 on the latest TOP500 list of the world’s most powerful supercomputers and in the top three for energy-efficient supercomputers on the Green500 list. The data centre that handles the mechanics – data centres being a key NVIDIA revenue stream – will be located in Harlow.

“The data centre there is hosted by KAO Data Centres – they host the system and we run the platform” says David.

Yet no quantum involvement?

“Quantum is a different technology” replies David.

“They can use NVIDIA technology and a lot of work to enable quantum is being done with NVIDIA GPUs [graphics processing units] like modeling quantum computers. It is an area of research for us – and others – looking at what quantum could and couldn’t be.”

Along with the supercomputer comes a proposed new AI centre of excellence featuring a new Arm-based supercomputer.

“If the deal is approved this will be an international centre of artificial intelligence using NVIDIA and Arm architecture” says David “and around that will be built a centre of excellence to attract world-leading talent around the development of AI especially for start-ups.”

NVIDIA Ampere A100 GPU

NVIDIA’s Inception its AI acceleration platform data science and high performance computing start-ups will provide go-to-market support expertise and technology.

“It’s a big opportunity to upskill people in terms of knowledge and expertise” David notes.

“So for example the US and China are doing more in this space so we are looking to create real breakthroughs in science and technology in the UK for wider use.

“For Cambridge one of the central points is that it’s a key location – with Arm based in the city – as we go forward.”

It is as well to consider that NVIDIA may see buying Arm as the jewel in the crown of its booming data centre business because an NVIDIA-owned Arm brings challenges for the two companies’ very different licensing models. Arm’s success is based on its open licensing model which allows it to sell its chips designs to technology and automotive companies – including ostensible competitors – across the globe.

The challenge is for the engineers in the individual companies to make best use of the architecture. So would NVIDIA’s chip arm adopt an open licensing model to become compatible with Arm’s strategic reach?

“One reason to acquire Arm is to invest in that model to enable as many people as possible to build on their success and to infuse NVIDIA’s intellectual property to enhance Arm’s existing architecture” David says of the arrangement.

“Arm has been fantastic and with NVIDIA there is a lot more capability – the Internet of Things for example has not been realised to its full extent at the moment. What’s starting to happen is that machines are talking to machines with not thousands but billions of interconnections every day traffic control for instance or 5G virtual reality and augmented reality.

“Some systems need to be independent such as autonomous cars so all these things need to be able to interact continuously: Arm and NVIDIA together transforms how that happens. So we see value at the edge – it’s already there on mobile – but also for data centres.”

NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD

Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed to improve response times and save bandwidth. It is crucial to the development of autonomous cars but the big question is how to ensure this functionality is available on the cloud?

“It takes place on as many locations as possible – cloud providers or data centres it depends on the workload. There’s lots of data flowing back from the cloud but some data comes from an on-premise data centre so with certain data that can be challenging.”

NVIDIA is making significant progress on autonomous driving. New software-defined architecture built on the NVIDIA DRIVE platform will be incorporated as standard in Mercedes-Benz’s next-generation fleet. A primary feature will be the ability to automate driving regular routes from address to address.

“NVIDIA’s DRIVE platform for Mercedes is a great example of what we’re doing” says David. “It involves multiple AI for a smart system in vehicles. In addition when you’re not driving you have the opportunity to have experiences in that vehicle it could be for entertainment or for work so the car becomes a very different platform it’s not just enabling autonomous driving.”

The autonomous era is already kicking in.

“Level 2 is where the industry is going right now” explains David. “That’s assisted driving the car guides you and takes proactive action to keep you safe.

“Levels 3 and 4 could be autonomous including motorway driving or city driving where well mapped. Level 5 is no steering wheel.

“We’ll be in level 3 or 4 for the next two or three years and level 5 from 2025 – that’s dependent on regulatory approvals as well as building the car.”

One of the more intriguing possibilities of the Arm/NVIDIA compact – assuming regulatory approval – will be whether Arm becomes more games-friendly. Under Softbank the company seemed to be steering away from games but NVIDIA has had a deep games pedigree since it started trading in 1993 – and its recently launched GeForce platform lets you play games anywhere on any device.

“Our gaming heritage has enabled us to do some amazing things” notes David “but in 2012 our founder Jensen Huang took a big decision to pivot the company towards AI so for us this [Cambridge development] is part of that journey.”

Indeed in 2020 NVIDIA’s data centre sales surpassed its gaming revenue for the first time since it was founded – but the future still awaits the outcome of the regulatory process.

“We suspect the whole regulatory process probably has another year to run” David concludes. “We’ve estimated 18 months and meanwhile we’ll continue our engagement and in the next few months we have the Cambridge-1 launch and the GTC Conference in April where delegates can learn about AI ...we’re expecting 100000 people to attend.”

Michael McDowell prevailed as the finish of the 2021 Daytona 500 was overshadowed by a wreck that involved race leader Joey Logano.

Because the caution flag waved NASCAR officials had to review the video to check if McDowell was in first place and thus the race winner.

Logano had the finish line in his sights when he got bumped by Brad Keselowski. The fiery crash looked far worse than it proved to be as all the drivers involved exited their cars.

Logano and Keselowski are teammates but Logano probably isn't feeling a ton of unity at the moment.

That opened the door for McDowell's improbable triumph. He led only one lap on the night and made it count. This is the first win of his NASCAR Cup Series career and it means he'll collect one of the coveted 16 playoff spots.

On what proved to be such an unusual day he was an appropriate victor.

Denny Hamlin dominated much of the race winning the first and second stages. He maintained the lead into the final stage until the cars all headed to pit road with just under 30 laps remaining.

As they exited pit road the Ford cars formed a convoy as Hamlin and his fellow Toyota drivers became separated. That left Hamlin vulnerable and powerless to stop the line of Fords led by Logano. A small pack of Chevrolets pushed Hamlin further back and he was running by himself on the inside.

The three-time Daytona 500 champion was unable to recover.

Hamlin's stage wins at least ensure he doesn't come away totally empty-handed in an event that got off to an inauspicious start.

Fans didn't have to wait long to see ""The Big One."" On the 14th lap Kyle Busch bumped the rear of Christopher Bell who made contact with Aric Almirola. Almirola took out Alex Bowman before hitting the wall and a 16-car wreck was underway.

That left track officials with a massive cleanup effort to get the action back underway. Then Mother Nature intervened. Lightning and inclement weather forced the race to be delayed. Motorsports.com's Jim Utter noted the red flag extended for more than five-and-a-half hours.

For the teams involved in the massive crash that set up a race against the clock to get cars back up to the standard required to re-enter the race. Tyler Reddick's No. 8 car was in rough shape as he warmed the engine back up.

As they awaited the signal to return to their vehicles drivers had to get creative to pass the time.

Jimmie Johnson reflected on one positive from his retirement:

There were some initial problems in terms of getting the track fully dry. Once the green flag waved the action largely went without any issues right up until the last lap.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vZnJvbnRzdHJldGNoLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzEzL2hlcmVzLXdob3MtZHJvcHBpbmctdG8tdGhlLWJhY2staW4tdGhlLTIwMjEtZGF5dG9uYS01MDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's Who's Dropping to the Back in the 2021 Daytona 500,"Two more Daytona 500 entries will start the 2021 NASCAR Cup Series season from the rear of the field on Sunday (Feb. 14) at Daytona International Speedway.

Joe Gibbs Racing’s Martin Truex Jr. and Richard Petty Motorsports’ Erik Jones will fall to the back prior to the green flag for the Daytona 500. Jones will also begin next weekend’s Daytona road course event from the tail end after a larger violation.

Jones who qualified 31st will be running the Daytona 500 after an engine swap which usually sends a driver to the rear of the field if one is made after a qualifying session. According to NASCAR Jones’ No. 43 team violated a section of the NASCAR rule book that if an engine swap is made in a primary car after competing in the Duels at Daytona Feb. 11 the team is to move to the rear of the field for the start of both the Daytona 500 and the following week’s race.

Truex who qualified 26th for his 16th Daytona 500 had a radiator/oil cooler change. He will have to work his way through the field to attempt a win after a second-place finish in this race back in 2016.

Jones and Truex will join seven other drivers who have pulled their backup cars out of the hauler for Sunday after issues in Thursday’s Duels. The others include William Byron Cole Custer Ross Chastain Brad Keselowski Chase Briscoe Kaz Grala and Anthony Alfredo.

Officials said Mitsubishi Corporation has proposed the Public-Private Partnership Authority to invest in the project of Bangladesh Railway as it has been working on the terminal as a consortium member.

It ushers a ray of hope for the rail authorities as another Japanese company has failed to work on the multimodal transport hub (MMTH) project they said.

But they feared that the new proposal might create new problems in the implementation of the estimated $200-million project.

Mitsubishi is likely to place its concept plan in the next Bangladesh-Japan joint platform meeting on February 24 the officials mentioned.

Along with Fujita of Japan and Samsung of Korea Mitsubishi was awarded the third terminal construction work in December 2019.

Despite lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic sources said progress in the terminal work was recorded good.

The MMTH was one of the potential PPP projects in the second platform meeting in 2018.

Sujitsu Company of Japan was selected by the Japanese ministry of land infrastructure and tourism for the project forming a sub-working group.

But it failed to prepare a master plan in which it said the land was not enough to develop the transport hub.

Later the ministry formed another sub-working group with Mitsubishi as the next potential investor for the project.

BR and PPPA officials said these issues were discussed in a meeting with the prime minister's office with its principle secretary in the chair on December 14.

They said the Japanese firm has a plan to link the terminal with the airport station through a tunnel.

""But the problem is the MMTH and the third terminal's operation and management are the projects of two different agencies which cannot be put together under PPP"" said an official seeking anonymity.

They hope to get a solution from the design of the Japanese company in the next platform meeting.

The PPPA included the MMTH project after a cabinet committee on economic affairs approved it on October 17 in 2018.

The Gardena (Calif.) Junipero Serra product is the No. 30-ranked overall player and the second-ranked pro-style quarterback according to the industry-generated 247Sports Composite. Plenty of reactions from the media poured in shortly after Murphy announced is pledge. While not a member of media Sarkisian took to Twitter to share something.

Sarkisian cannot officially comment on Murphy's commitment due to NCAA rules. However that didn't stop him from sharing a video from Texas super fan Matthew McConaughey celebrating at a Longhorns football game. It doesn't take much to know what Sarkisian was referring to.

Check out what he shared below shortly after Murphy's announcement:

“Texas was the only school on my list that I couldn’t find a single negative about” Murphy told 247Sports recruiting analyst Greg Biggins. “Football is the biggest thing going in Texas. It’s more then just a sport it’s a staple of life and everyone is so passionate about it there.

“Austin is a great city and when you’re the quarterback there you have a chance to be the face of the program. I’ve never been to Texas but my mom and my dad have I have cousins out there and I’ve talked to a lot of other people who said I would fit in really well. This is an incredible opportunity for me to play at such a storied program for a great head coach and I couldn’t pass it up.”

Sarkisian is a huge reason why Murphy chose Texas. He didn't shy away from that while speaking with Biggins.

“I think he’s the perfect coach to prepare me for the next level” Murphy said. “He’s a Cali guy and someone I’m really comfortable with. I look at what he’s done in the past and how he develops quarterbacks and I think he can help me reach my goals which are to play in the NFL. I love his offense and think I fit in really well with what he wants to do scheme wise.

A global shortage of computer chips has caused shutdowns at several automotive manufacturing plants — and car dealerships are already reflecting the shortage.

Car shoppers can expect to see an impact in the availability of certain car models due to the chip shortage as well as a price increase according to Cars.com executive editor Joe Wiesenfelder. Dealerships may also be less likely to offer deals as supplies dwindle.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""Consumers in the market of considering buying a car should shop now because choices and prices could worsen over the next two quarters"" Wiesenfelder told Insider.

Car companies began halting production at manufacturing plants in North America in the beginning of January.

Automotive companies stand to lose billions of dollars due to the disruption in supply. Alix Partners told Bloomberg car companies could lose over $14 billion in the first quarter and about $61 billion overall in 2021. Though Wiesenfelder said the industry could make up for the cuts by the end of the year.

Semiconductor chips have become an essential part of the manufacturing process for vehicles. The chips are used in navigation bluetooth and collision-detection systems and account for about 40% of a new car's cost according to a report from Deloitte.

The lack of chips has forced automakers to prioritize production of their higher-priced and more-profitable models.

Here are some of the models Cars.com said may see price increases or limited availability.

Toyota has already started increasing prices

The Toyota Tundra was one of the first cars to see a halt in production.

Cars.com said the Tundra has seen a drop in inventory of almost 27% for the month of February. Some Toyota models have already demonstrated price increases including the Tacoma which has gone up about $584 or 1.6% despite only a 4% decrease in inventory according to Cars.com.

Many Japanese carmakers are seeing an impact. Honda was one of the first car companies to warn of computer chip shortages according to Bloomberg.

The Japanese carmaker has slashed production at several major manufacturing plants. A Honda spokesperson told Insider plants in Ohio Alabama Indiana Georgia and Canada have been impacted.

In particular shoppers can expect to see some pressure on the Honda Accord Civic Insight and Odyssey as well as the Acura RDX.

Nissan has had to adjust production in both Japan and North America. A spokesperson told Insider the company is continuing to assess the long-term impact of the chip shortage. For now the models that have seen slowdowns for the carmaker include the Nissan Altima Frontier and Titan.

In February Subaru reported it planned to cut its production plan for 2021 by about 58000 cars. The models impacted by the cut include the Subaru Ascent Impreza Legacy and Outback.

Ford and General Motors expect to lose billions of dollars

Ford began slowing down production at its plant in Louisville in January. During Ford's fourth-quarter earnings call CFO John Lawler said the chip shortage could cut the company's first-quarter production by 10% to 20% — a $2.5 billion hit to revenue.

The car models that will be impacted by cuts at Ford plants include the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair which are produced at the Louisville plant. Cars.com said there will also be declines in production of the Ford Edge and Explorer as well as the Lincoln Aviator and Lincoln Nautilus.

During GM's fourth-quarter earnings call the company said it expects to see a negative impact of $1.5 to $2 billion this year.

The company announced last week that it was closing three of its North American plants. The manufacturing sites will remain closed until at least mid-March a spokesperson told Insider.

The closures are expected to impact the Buick Encore Cadillac XT4 and GMC Terrain. The company's Chevrolet line will also see some slowdowns as the sites that produce Chevrolet Equinox Malibu and Trax have been impacted.

Fiat Chrysler and Volkswagen also feel the pinch

In January Fiat Chrysler suspended operations at plants in Ontario and Mexico. The slowdowns will impact several Chrysler Dodge and Jeep products. Cars.com said dealerships will likely have lower inventories for the Chrysler 300 Pacifica and Voyager. The Dodge Challenger and Charger may be in shorter supply as well as the Jeep Cherokee and Compass.

A spokesperson from Stellantis said the company will continue to adjust production levels as necessary.

BMW Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen were some of the first car companies overseas to report shortages. In December Volkswagen had already begun lowering production rates. The Volkswagen Atlas Atlas Cross Sport and Passat have already been impacted by the supply disruption.

A Volkswagen spokesperson said the company anticipates the shortage will only impact production during the first half of the year.

""Volkswagen will do everything in its power to largely recoup lost vehicle production in the second half"" the spokesperson told Insider. ""So far there have been no negative effects for our customers caused by the semiconductor situation. There may be slight delays in deliveries in individual cases in the coming future.""

The aim was to invest in local startups. By supporting companies which show potential and give good results the CCP wanted to find a national champion in this field.

However this reckless investment in startups by the local governments led to the creation of multiple Non-Performing Assets which were in hiding till the pandemic hit. However the story of a much-celebrated company evaporating in an instant and taking all the investment with itself has shocked the Jinping regime.

The Chinese provinces of Wuhan and Hubei had termed such a startup as a star project. Wuhan Hongxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (HSMC) riding on this wave of recognition received $20 billion in investments. However later it was found out that the whole company was fake the founder was a conman and every promise that the company had made was false. This was the biggest fraud in recent history and has rocked China and seems like the joke is on the Xi Jinping-led CCP government.

36Kr conducted a probe on the billions dollar fraud by the Wuhan Hongxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (HSMC). HSMC was jointly formed in November 2017 by the Wuhan Dongxihu District Government and Beijing Guangliang Lantu Technology a company registered by an individual named Cao Shan. However as the things were unearthed it was found that Cao Shan was not even the real name of the HSMC founder.

Cao’s name was in fact Bao Enbao who borrowed the name of his family’s driver. He had not only forged his name but the credentials were falsified too. TSMC never had a VP named Cao Shan and Acer did not even have an office in New York while it was the credentials he had used to fool the authorities in China. In reality Bao had only completed primary school and lacked the technical expertise required to make semiconductor wafers.

Such issues have been extensively covered by TFI. It was earlier reported how the trade war followed by the second cold war with the USA made Chinese companies starved of consumers as well as of supply lines. The Trump administration had banned the sale of semiconductors based on American secretive design and blacklisted the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) – the largest semiconductor manufacturer in Jinping-led China.

As reported by Nikkei Asia The NDRC is trying to work with other government departments and has put tighter supervision in place over semiconductor projects. However the Jinping administration still hasn’t learnt from these developments and is adamant about chip development and manufacturing. The geopolitical tensions between China and the US are unlikely to be resolved soon and Chinese manufacturers’ access to US-produced chips and other key components have been severely restricted which is why the Jinping administration is trying to work things out.

A veteran investor based in the Yangtze River Delta industrial region revealed to 36Kr “The semiconductor manufacturing industry is extremely complicated with many stakeholders. It is difficult to pinpoint responsibility and hold anyone accountable when something goes wrong during the process. Besides when actual fraud is found local governments will swallow their pride absorb the losses and stop talking about it.”

The Nikkei Asia piece aptly asks how did HSMC manage to pull the wool over the eyes of its suppliers industry veterans and government backers simultaneously? The Jinping administration is keenly interested in gathering information from other countries but how did it miss such a big fraud in its own backyard?"

It happens because AWS pricing is complex expensive at scale and penalizes customers for hard to estimate usage elements such as data transfer and storage performance which involves taking volume size provisioned IOPs and throughput into account for every volume.

AWS provides discounts for three-year commitments on products like compute but ties those reserved instance commitments to particular compute shapes operating systems and regions. While discounting can help win business the deployments are tying customers in to AWS-only services and there’s no guarantee that pricing will be there in the future.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides better performance at a significantly lower cost than AWS. Our pricing structure is simple predictable and transparent with none of surprises associated with AWS. Additionally OCI charges the same flat rate for all regions worldwide which means there are no hidden cost variances if your business expands globally.

Oracle also provides Universal Credits which enable customers to use any Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or platform service in any region at a significant savings with a predictable monthly spend commitment. But just because your spend is monthly doesn’t mean your usage has to be: these credits don’t expire at the end of the month—they can be used any time during their 12-month contract window.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZC9jaGFtYXRoLXBhbGloYXBpdGl5YS1raW5nLW9mLXNwYWNzLXdhbnRzLXlvdS10by1rbm93LWhlLXMtbmV4dC13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC0xMTYxMzE4ODQ4NDQ2Ni5odG1s0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9uZXdzL3dvcmxkL2NoYW1hdGgtcGFsaWhhcGl0aXlhLWtpbmctb2Ytc3BhY3Mtd2FudHMteW91LXRvLWtub3ctaGUtcy1uZXh0LXdhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0L2FtcC0xMTYxMzE4ODQ4NDQ2Ni5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chamath Palihapitiya king of SPACs wants you to know he’s next Warren Buffett | Mint,"Chamath Palihapitiya has already drafted the next chapter in his charmed-life story.

The immigrant kid who bootstrapped his way into riches at Facebook Inc. made billions as a risk-hungry investor and became the pied piper of the current blank-check craze now envisions himself as nothing less than the Warren Buffett of the Reddit era.

“Nobody’s going to listen to Buffett"" Palihapitiya the founder of Social Capital said in a Bloomberg “Front Row"" interview. “But there has to be other folks that take that mantle take the baton and do it as well to this younger generation in the language they understand.""

The language of course is social media. That’s where the 44-year-old billionaire talks up his deals trolls the establishment and hypes “all things Chamath."" Recently he stoked speculation he might run for governor of California. Occasionally he tweets out shirtless selfies to his 1.3 million followers. His feed is a digital stream of consciousness.

With Twitter as his bullhorn Palihapitiya has become the undisputed king of special-purpose acquisition companies the hottest thing on Wall Street. Together with Ian Osborne a public-relations soothsayer turned financier he has sponsored six SPACs raised a total of $4.34 billion and acquired businesses in space travel health insurance financial services and real estate.

Lightning Rod

Along the way Palihapitiya has made a fortune for himself and his investors and helped whip up a frenzy that has everyone from Colin Kaepernick to former House Speaker Paul Ryan racing to market their own SPACs. He’s also a lightning rod for skeptics who pooh-pooh his success as the product of relentless self-promotion and see blank-check companies as proof of a bubble inflated by massive government money-printing.

If SPACs are emblematic of a speculative mania then Palihapitiya is the face of that moment.

Palihapitiya said anything that popular will lure its share of copycats and wannabes and inevitably many will fail. He’s confident his brand and investing acumen will not only make people rich but help democratize finance and level the playing field for ordinary investors.

Plus there’s that whole Buffett thing. He fancies growing his empire into a Berkshire Hathaway-esque conglomerate for the 21st century complete with investor conference calls an analyst day and its own must-attend annual meeting. All of which in his vision will generate enough wealth to shrink the inequality gap in America.

It’s pretty grandiose stuff.

“I do want to have a Berkshire-like instrument that is all things you know not to sound egotistical but all things Chamath all things Social Capital"" he said.

It was also Palihapitiya who took a leading role in the frenzy around so-called meme stocks tweeting on Jan. 26 that he’d bought GameStop Corp. call options and helping fuel its short-lived surge. He exited the trade before GameStop crashed making a $500000 profit he donated to charity.

Palihapitiya then joined Reddit’s WallStreetBets crowd in bashing short-sellers and denounced Robinhood Markets which temporarily limited purchases of meme stocks as a “bunch of corporatist scumbags.""

He acknowledges such rhetoric isn’t exactly Buffett-like. But then again perhaps that’s the point.

“Who I am is a byproduct of my generation and my media culture which is faceted -- not always great facets but multifaceted"" he said. “You have to speak in the language of the times in order to get your point across.""

SPAC Boom

Palihapitiya’s bro-ish manner -- cocksure and full of swagger -- isn’t for everyone. It’s arguably what caused his venture-capital firm to implode in 2018. But his SPACs have delivered results at least so far.

The first SPAC he raised with Osborne merged with Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic in 2019 and now trades at $59 up from the standard offering price of $10. His five others also are well above $10 including the two that haven’t announced acquisitions yet -- a testament to investors’ confidence and also to the central-bank largess that has inflated risk assets globally.

Critics contend SPACs are flawed and dangerous with incentives that overwhelmingly favor sponsors and insiders at the expense of individual investors. Palihapitiya says he’s working with Credit Suisse Group AG on ways to reduce share allocations to hedge funds and to allow retail money to participate in so-called PIPE financings.

“On the deals that I do I take a 20% carry and I think that I can find targets and find opportunities that will make that more than reasonable in the final analysis"" he said adding that in every one of his SPACs he has invested millions of dollars of his own money. The only reason he said he’ll ever sell any shares is to release cash for other endeavors.

Rise Fall and Rise

In Silicon Valley where his rise was meteoric and ultimately turbulent everyone knows who “Chamath"" is. It’s getting that way in financial circles too. Not quite a “Jamie"" or “Ray"" but on his way there.

Born in Sri Lanka Palihapitiya emigrated to Ottawa as a boy. He worked part-time at Burger King to help his parents make ends meet. After getting a degree in electrical engineering from the University of Waterloo and trading derivatives for a year he moved to California.

At Facebook his responsibilities included the nascent mobile business and international markets. He left in 2011 to found Social Capital and took early stakes in Slack and SurveyMonkey. Palihapitiya also bought part of the Golden State Warriors basketball team in 2011 Bitcoin in 2012 Amazon.com Inc. shares in 2014 and Tesla Inc.’s convertible debt in 2015.

And then it all seemed to fall apart. His marriage dissolved his key partners in Social Capital left and several investors balked at committing new funds. Many thought Palihapitiya had flamed out.

Three years later he’s bigger than ever.

Palihapitiya estimates his wealth at somewhere between $10 billion and $15 billion much more than public disclosures would suggest. Most of that -- the insurance software and health-care businesses he owns privately his SPACs the new seeding program he started for amateur money managers -- will become part of the holding company he’s modeling on Berkshire.

One of Palihapitiya’s slogans is that only two things matter: inequality and climate change. He said investing in solutions for both is his mission at Social Capital. That’s why he’s also making a “huge bet"" on securing critical supplies for lithium-ion batteries so the U.S. isn’t at China’s mercy in its efforts to tap green energy. He expects the effort to cost billions.

His populist appeal has won Palihapitiya millions of fans. Recently it lent credibility to the rumor he planned to run for governor. While Palihapitiya is upset about everything from taxes to crime rates in California and is funding the #RecallGavinNewsom effort he insists he has no intention of seeking office.

Instead he said he’ll back candidates who share his centrist ideals and eventually plans to spend “hundreds of millions a year"" building a machine that can rival the conservative influence of the Koch and Mercer families.

In the meantime Palihapitiya says he has no plans to “cut and run"" like the other billionaires fleeing his state including Tesla’s Elon Musk and Oracle Corp.’s Larry Ellison. His strategy: be loyal stay on brand hide nothing.

“I make better decisions when I am authentic and transparent"" he said. “The best way to do that is just to be living my life out for everybody to see.""

A refreshed 2021 model coming later this year takes that to the next level — manipulating currents under the chassis as well as around the truck.

The result is up to 6% better fuel economy for the new model compared with a similarly equipped T680. The hood of the new model is 8 inches narrower than today’s T680 introduced in 2012. A restyled bumper keeps the same approach angle and ground clearance.

“Changes to the hood and bumper keep air flow closer to the cab and reduce turbulence” Kenworth Chief Engineer Joe Adams said.

Kenworth revealed the new model virtually on Thursday evening at its headquarters in Kirkland Washington. It shares many of the changes made to the Peterbilt Model 579 revealed a week earlier. Kenworth and Peterbilt are sibling brands of PACCAR Inc. (NASDAQ: PCAR).

Other T680 enhancements:

15-inch digital display operated from the steering wheel

Optional LED headlamps with built-in infrared heater to quickly clear ice and snow

Standard LED side turn indicator

Additional optional advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS)

The more fuel-efficient 2021 PACCAR MX-13 12.9-liter engine seamlessly integrates with the PACCAR 12-speed transmission and PACCAR 40K axles

Aerodynamic improvements

Kenworth introduced the industry’s first truly aerodynamic design with the T600 in 1985. For the refreshed T680 Kenworth used simulations and wind tunnel testing to verify the performance of each component. That included a vane near the windshield that reduces air wake next to the side windows.

Adams declined to say how much of the fuel efficiency gain comes from aerodynamics. The new 2021 PACCAR MX-13 engine which meets Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations also improves fuel economy.

But the changes many of them optional include an air dam design that guides and controls under chassis airflow while protecting the radiator. A ducting system within the hood structure features a passive flap or air shutter which opens and closes behind the fender based on air pressure and wind conditions.





General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) debuted active air shutters on its Chevrolet Cruze compact sedan 12 years ago.

Under-cab chassis fairings with rolled edges manage airflow off the hood. A new attachment system makes replacing a damaged fairing faster and easier Adams said.

Behind the cab optional side extenders cover 28 inches to help close the gap between the tractor and trailer and smooth airflow from the top and sides of the tractor onto the trailer. Fleets can order openings on either side of the tractor for frame and component access. Tandem drive axle fairings that smooth air from the chassis also are available.

Digital display allows 4500 gauge combinations

The T680 and its Peterbilt sibling both get a standard 15-inch digital display which supplies information far beyond the capability of analog gauges. Drivers can personalize how much data they see. Pressing buttons on the steering wheel scrolls up and down through 38 functions all centrally displayed. The current T680 displays 23 functions to the side of the dash.

“We followed the methods of the Human-Centered Design process” Adams said. “Drivers want contextually relevant information when they need it.”

The digital dash allows drivers to select between two minimized views a basic view and a maximized view. The minimized views show only the truck speed tachometer and standard content in the header and footer area. The maximized view adds gauges for axle temperatures torque air filter and brake application.

The display system supports nearly 50 layouts with more than 4500 gauge view combinations from which a driver could create a “favorites” view. In all views the driver will be altered to warnings or faults.

“While the factory layout of content is prioritized and intuitive we wanted to give drivers the quick and easy access to information and a layout that fits their needs” Adams said.





The functionality extends to when the truck is parked. Pressing an exterior self-test switch activates a full systems check analyzing and summarizing the status of multiple systems. When the driver shuts off the truck the screen switches to a trip summary view that displays average fuel economy idle time cruise control use and potential mechanical issues.

“The in-cab technology we’re able to equip today’s trucks with has come a long way in just a few years “ Adams said. Because the system has no mechanical parts it is expected to last for 1 million miles and be more reliable than traditional instruments.

Advanced safety systems

The T680 offers a host of safety systems several based on the standard Bendix Fusion safety suite. Optional Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) which Daimler Trucks North America first offered in its 2020 Class 8 Cascadia tractor is offered for the first time. LKA uses camera input to identify when the truck is leaving its lane and nudges it back to the center.

Another Bendix-based feature is optional torque-assisted steering which reduces driver fatigue by adding torque to the steering column. Volvo Trucks North America brought Volvo Dynamic Steering technology from Europe for the 2020 model year.

The additional torque reduces steering strain at low speed and adjusts to improve stability at road speeds when encountering crosswinds highway crowning soft shoulders or emergency situations like tire failure.

The T680 also includes adaptive cruise control which “reads” traffic conditions via front-facing radar. It modulates the throttle and brakes to keep the truck at a preset distance from the vehicle in front of it. When the slowdown clears the system accelerates the truck back to the set speed.

The lane departure warning uses lane markings to sense drifting from fatigue or distraction. When active it continually monitors the truck’s location in relation to lane markings and emits an audible warning when an unsignaled lane change is detected.

Collision mitigation will automatically apply brakes if the drive ignores warnings about a potential crash. Side object detection monitors the passenger side of the truck and uses audible and visual alerts to let the driver know when an unseen object or vehicle has entered certain zones.

Paramount studios announced Friday that they will be remaking the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic musical “The King and I”.

Originally filmed by Fox studios in 1956 the film won five out of nine Academy Award nominations including best actor.

Stage versions have won several Tony Awards most recently in 2015 when the show won Best Revival and Best Lead Actress in a musical.

The story follows English schoolteacher Anna Leonowens and her son as they leave England to teach the royal children of the King of Siam (now present-day Thailand).

It features the iconic songs “Shall we dance?” and “Getting to know you.”

According to Deadline Paramount sees this as an opportunity to bring “a tremendous opportunity to reimagine this classic story with a contemporary perspective that explores diversity and the contrasting world views of the characters by drawing from real history and the musical.”

UMG one of the “Big Three” record labels alongside Warner Music Group and Sony Music is based in Santa Monica California and led by CEO Lucian Grange.

The company announced the decision in a statement early Saturday morning adding that the IPO would take place on the Euronext NV exchange in Amsterdam and that it estimates the value of the record label at $36.4 billion.

UMG’s artists include Taylor Swift Lady Gaga The Rolling Stones Alicia Keys Post Malone Billie Eilish Billy Joel J. Balvin and Coldplay among many others.

In its statement Saturday Vivendi added that it would also distribute 60 percent of the company’s share capital to existing shareholders. Vivendi owns 80 percent of UMG with a consortium led by China’s Tencent holding the remaining 20 percent. The Tencent consortium had owned 10 percent of the label but acquired an additional stake in December last year for $3.7 billion.

A special meeting will be held next month to vote on a change to the corporate by-laws which would allow the transactions to take place. Once those are approved a separate vote will be scheduled to approve the UMG spinoff and distribution.

The record labels are in the midst of an astonishing corporate resurgence driven by streaming music services like Spotify and Apple Music as well as social apps like TikTok and Instagram which license songs to be used in posts by their users.

PYPL,PayPal,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYm9sZC5jb20vcGF5cGFsLWNlby01MC1vZi1jcnlwdG8taG9sZGVycy1vcGVuLXRoZS1hcHAtZGFpbHktYW1pZC1iaXRjb2luLXN1cmdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PayPal CEO: 50% of crypto holders open the app daily amid Bitcoin surge,"Online payment giant PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) records a surge in engagement numbers from cryptocurrency holders using its app.

Speaking during Investor Day 2021 the company’s President and CEO Dan Schulman notes that at least 50% of crypto holders open Paypal’s app daily five months after allowing cryptocurrency trading.

In this line PayPal is now courting the digital currency sector as a critical segment towards its future growth strategy. PayPal currently allows the trading of Bitcoin Ether and Litecoin for U.S. customers. Sources close to the company further indicate plans to roll out the United Kingdom feature.

The entry of PayPal into the cryptocurrency sector contributed immensely to the current Bitcoin rally. This comes as the Bitcoin bull run continues having hit an all-time high of $49000 on February 12.

PayPal CEO Dan Schulman now considers Bitcoin to become a key player in the financial world.

“There’s no question that digital currencies and the underlying technology have the potential to drive the next wave in financial services” said Dan Schulman.

Besides cryptocurrency trading PayPal plans to enable users to pay with crypto across the 29 million merchants. The feature is likely to roll out within the first quarter of 2021.

PayPal new products to spur active accounts growth

PayPal is also hoping other newly launched products in 2020 like buy now pay later and QR codes emulate digital asset trading’s success. At the same time PayPal’s other product Venmo will add cryptocurrencies during the current quarter.

Due to the growing product portfolio PayPal CEO Schulman expects the company to have 750 million active accounts in five years from 377 million in 2020. He notes that the firm is actively working with the product compliance and risk teams to deploy new features.

The new products line also helped PayPal post strong 2020 Q4 earnings. The total payment volume grew 39% to $277 billion beating Wall Street’s $267.7 billion estimates.

Paypal’s new products launched in 2020. Source: PayPal Q4 earnings release.

PayPal one-stop app ambitions

The product line-up is part of making PayPal a one-stop platform for daily financial services. Jonathan Auerbach PayPal’s EVP and chief strategist notes that:

“Our crypto services will help broaden the range of financial services offered through the PayPal and Venmo apps supporting the transformation of those apps to being ‘destination apps’ so not only for financial services but for commerce.”

PayPal is among the leading financial institutions that are making strides towards the cryptocurrency sector. For instance Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA) set up rails to process crypto transactions.

Simultaneously electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) recently revealed it had invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. The revelation largely contributed to the new all-time high by the asset. Similarly cab-hailing firm Uber recently stated that it is open to allow cryptocurrency payments.

But the once-happy couple has been breaking up for years — and on Valentine’s Day some sellers may no longer be able to sell items on eBay at all without connecting an old-school bank account instead.

This morning I received a final warning that I would need to add a bank account by February 14th or else “your ability to revise or relist existing listings or create new listings will be disabled.”

eBay tells The Verge this isn’t the deadline for every seller — it’s rolling out in phases and a quick scan of the web shows it’s been going on for at least a couple years. This isn’t the final phase either as eBay tells us the rollout won’t be complete until 2022. But I suspect it’s moving fast: I got this message despite rarely ever selling items on eBay and company tells me the “majority of sellers” will have eBay-managed payments by the end of this year.

Digging up a bank account and plugging it into your profile may not be the only annoyance here by the way. You could be waiting a lot longer for your money as eBay’s managed payments site points out:

Three to six business days is a long time to theoretically wait for money that could have instantly popped into your PayPal. (That said my last eBay sale didn’t immediately release my funds to PayPal either. Shrug emoji.)

On the plus side eBay says most sellers should actually pay lower fees than before and provides a variety of case studies at this page — but it’s not like eBay’s really passing along the savings. Previously eBay would typically take a 10 percent cut and PayPal would take a 2.9 percent cut for a total of 12.9 percent of your take; now eBay will take a 12.35 percent cut in the same situations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYmdyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jcmVkaXQtY2FyZHMtbWFqb3ItY2hhbmdlLWNvbWluZy12ZXJ0aWNhbC1vcmllbnRhdGlvbi10YXAtdG8tcGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A radical change is coming to the way major credit cards work,"The credit cards that dominate the spending habits of so many consumers from companies that range from Mastercard to Visa and even Apple with its Apple Card are slowly changing the look and feel that consumers have come to expect from these card products.



Credit cards are increasingly taking on a vertical orientation.

This comes as apps like TikTok and Instagram acclimate the world toward a vertically scrolling feed and it also reflects how most consumers use their credit cards anyway — by inserting them into chip readers vertically for example.

Here’s something I bet most you didn’t see coming: TikTok and Instagram are such pervasive cultural forces in the world today they’re starting to quietly influence the design of — credit cards of all things.

In recent days PayPal released new debit and credit card vertical designs for its Venmo app which a company executive said was partly inspired by the vertical orientation of those popular social media apps. Daniela Jorge vice president of design at PayPal told Bloomberg in a recent interview that this is just the way the whole world is thinking now. And what people’s expectations are for apps and consumer products like credit cards. “The world around us is becoming more of the portrait mode and the vertical orientation” Jorge said.

Besides PayPal major banks are already moving in this direction. Bank of America the second-biggest provider in the US of debit card products was one of the first to adopt a debit card with a portrait orientation. Likewise Discovery Bank started offering vertical credit cards in 2018. And the reasons we should expect this trend to continue with more banks adopting a vertical style for their card products include the fact that with the advent of chip readers and tap-to-pay functionality this is how most people handle their cards already.

With a chip reader for example the credit card is inserted into the reader vertically. Likewise as digital wallets increase in popularity — with card owners increasingly utilizing a digital version of their credit card that’s stored in their smartphone — the phone becomes the device with which the consumer pays instead of a physical card. And phones of course are used vertically. When Apple released its new credit card product Apple Card I didn’t even bother obtaining a physical version of the card at all. I signed up and was approved for the credit card which I keep in my iPhone’s wallet app and use it vertically since I’m simply waving the phone in front of a card reader.

Think about the last time you handed your card to someone to horizontally swipe through a reader. It’s probably been a while right? Now consider that two years after these smart payment chip-enabled cards were introduced Experian says that US banks have issued more than 855 million of them. They’re called EMV cards by the way which originally stood for Europay Mastercard and Visa — the credit card companies that created this new payment standard.

“Switching our debit cards to a vertical layout is about more than how the cards look” Bank of America head of consumer and small-business products April Schneider told Bloomberg. “The vertical layout differentiates the debit card from other cards clients use and the addition of tap-to-pay makes the card faster and safer to use at in-store checkout.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vc2FzaGFyZXMuY28uemEvZm9yZXgtYnJva2Vycy10aGF0LWFjY2VwdC1wYXlwYWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Best Forex Brokers that Accepts PayPal ☑️ (Updated 2024*),"The Top 10 Best Forex Brokers that accept PayPal revealed.

Today we're looking at KFC's collab with Walkers Max.

The collab you didn't realise you needed KFC has teamed up with Walkers Max to offer up some finger-lickin' crisps. To ensure the new flavour doesn't go unnoticed PepsiCo's in-house media and creative agency team have captured what happens when these two brands come together.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbWFyY29tbW5ld3MuY29tL3dhbGtlcnMtcHJvdmVzLXNvbWUtdGhpbmdzLWp1c3QtbWFrZS1wZXJmZWN0cy1zZW5zZS13aXRoLW5ldy1tYXgteC1rZmMtdHYtY2FtcGFpZ24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walkers Proves Some Things Just Make Perfects Sense With New Max X KFC TV Campaign – Marketing ...,"To mark the launch of the new Walkers MAX x KFC flavoured crisps and its on-pack promotion offering a 2 for 1 KFC Meal with every pack this weekend will see the national debut of the brand’s hotly anticipated TV ad.

“Our focus for 2021 is to bring smiles back to the nation. If it doesn’t make you laugh it isn’t a Walkers campaign – and this latest creative won’t disappoint” explains Fernando Kahane marketing director Walkers Snacks at PepsiCo.

Matt Watson creative director at PepsiCo states: “There are some things in life that once you’ve seen them just make perfect sense. KFC flavoured crisps – a no brainer right? But something else we noticed was the distinct resemblance that our very own brand ambassador Gary Lineker has with Colonel Sanders himself.

“The new creative sets out to bring this almighty coincidence to the nation with one continuous take capturing a moment in time where these two great brands come together in real life finishing with the biggest of all – and it just makes perfect sense.”

The advert was created by PepsiCo’s in-house media and creative agency team and directed by Rollo Jackson who carries with him an impressive portfolio of award-winning films music videos and commercials.

The ad premieres on Saturday 13th February with a 30” TVC spot during the final of The Masked Singer and will feature heavily across AV digital and social media until early April. A further 40” spot will feature on Sunday 14thFebruary during ITV’s Dancing on Ice and Channel 4’s The Great. The media plan will be supplemented with Walkers’ first ever TikTok Top View creative and a Twitter Spotlight takeover both going live on Tuesday 16th Feb.“We are extremely proud to partner with KFC on this initiative which materialised as a result of our longstanding relationship via our beverages brands” Kahane continues. “Every campaign product launch and activation that we actively engage in at Walkers must deliver fun; it has to be democratic timely and tap into popular culture. It has to get everyone talking whilst creating a long-lasting connection with our brand.”

Hazell White Senior Brand Manager at KFC UK & Ireland states: “The collaboration with Walkers MAX made perfect sense from the start. When it came to the ad we couldn’t ignore the fact that The Colonel had his very own doppelganger. At KFC we love working with visionaries so it’s been amazing to have the creative mind of Rollo Jackson behind the camera for this.

“We’re excited for the nation to see the true Gary Lineker and hope they enjoy the ad whilst tucking into some Walkers MAX x KFC flavoured crisps.”

Walkers MAX Kentucky Fried Chicken and Walkers MAX Double Crunch Zinger are available all-year-round and have launched with a limited time on-pack promotion giving consumers a 2 for 1 KFC Meal for One with every pack. Consumers simply need to buy a promotional pack and take it to their local KFC restaurant for takeaway or drive-thru to claim a 2 for 1 KFC Meal for One

Valid until 31st July 2021 the offer can be used for dine-in at a later date once restaurants have fully reopened as long as customers hold onto their promotional crisp packs*.

Created in-house by PepsiCo’s creative team “It makes sense” begins with Lineker eating a packet of the KFC crisps outside “Colonel’s News” newsagents.

In a tone similar to KFC’s 2019 campaign “What the cluck” a voiceover asks: “KFC-flavoured crisps – it’s a no-brainer. So why did it take us so long?”

It ends with Lineker eyeing up the Colonel’s classic white ensemble in the window of a suit shop with the reflection making it appear as if he was wearing it.

The ad debuts tonight (Saturday) during The Masked Singer on ITV and will run until April alongside digital activity including a Twitter Spotlight takeover and a limited-time on-pack KFC meal two-for-one promotion.

It was created by Andrew Jordan and Alex King and directed by Rollo Jackson through Somesuch.

Media duties were handled by PepsiCo which unveiled its in-house creative and media agency in September 2020 in keeping with plans to ""redefine"" its European marketing output to be faster and better connect with its customers.

Fernando Kahane managing director at Walkers told Campaign that the idea was inspired by online comparisons between Lineker and Colonel Sanders – something that (believe it or not) has been a talking point for years.

He remarked that it had taken Walkers “too long to act” on the collaboration as consumers have been asking for KFC-flavoured crisps since 2009.

Kahane admitted that he was “concerned” by the prospect of turning Lineker into KFC’s brand mascot but said the Match of the Day host “thought it was fantastic”.

“It's really great to have a partner with a sense of humour and his shared ambition to drive smiles” Kahane added.

Walkers appointed VCCP to its creative account across Walkers and Sensations in July 2020 after a pitch against Uncommon Creative Studio.

But according to Kahane a decision was made to handle this ad in-house because VCCP is currently handling Walker's upcoming rebrand which is set for release next month.

“We thought that it would make more sense to use our in-house agency to move quickly and to give up space for VCCP to focus on the campaign that we're going to be launching” he said.

“The whole thing about the internal agency is agility – they do work as an extension of our marketing team – and in this case it made sense to use them.”

Walkers decided not to release a TV spot at Christmas last year. Instead it ran a social media ad starring LadBaby with cameos from Lineker Aled Jones Carol Smillie and East 17's Tony Mortimer.

From now on the brand is aiming to “stop thinking ‘interruption advertising’ and think more ‘entertainment advertising'” to better engage with the public across social channels Kahane explained.

“The idea is to create an ecosystem where we have both internal and external agencies working together” he continued.

Kahane claimed that the brand's upcoming work will ""drive as much traffic"" as Weetabix's unlikely collaboration with Heinz Beanz by ""tapping into something that consumers already do”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhc3Npb25hdGVpbm1hcmtldGluZy5jb20vcGVwc2ljby1pcy1yZWJyYW5kaW5nLWF1bnQtamVtaW1hLXByb2R1Y3RzLWFzLXBlYXJsLW1pbGxpbmctY29tcGFueS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PepsiCo is rebranding Aunt Jemima products as Pearl Milling Company,"PepsiCo Inc.announced the debut of Pearl Milling Company the new name of the pancake mix and syrup varieties previously found under the Aunt Jemima brand. There’s no more Aunt Jemima a brand of pancake mix and syrup. It has been rebranded as the Pearl Milling Company instead.

In 1888 in St. Joseph Missouri the Pearl Milling Company was founded and according to PepsiCo it was the originator of the famous self-rising pancake mix that would later become known as Aunt Jemima. Branded goods from The Pearl Milling Company will enter the markets in June 2021. In the same familiar red packaging previously found under the Aunt Jemima brand it will give individuals all their favorite pancake mix and syrup varieties. Until June the products will continue to be available under the name Aunt Jemima without the character image.

Besides the Pearl Milling Company has dedicated $1 million to empowering women and black girls. this is in addition to a five-year commitment of over $400 million to strengthen Black businesses and communities and increase Black representation at PepsiCo. It was in June last year that PepsiCo revealed it would update the Aunt Jemima line’s name and logo. At most American breakfast tables the smiling black woman has become a staple.

In a 19th-century minstrel song that expressed nostalgia for the antebellum South the Aunt Jemima character has roots. For more than 130 years Aunt Jemima has existed and they accept that their roots were based on a racial stereotype. Although work has been done over the years to improve the brand in a way that is intended to be adequate and respectful.

The Washington Redskins an NFL team dropped ‘Redskins’ from its name following sponsor pressure in July last year. The ‘Redskins’ is called a racial insult against Native Americans. The Matter of Black Lives served as the trigger.

Mike McDermott heads that effort at Pfizer where he’s been president of global supply since 2019. He previously served in other operations management positions in his 30-year career at Pfizer.

The COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech was the first to get the green light from Britain in early December followed by the United States Europe and other countries.

Pfizer makes the vaccine’s main component a piece of genetic code called messenger RNA or mRNA for short. It uses other companies called contract manufacturers to make the vaccine’s protective shell and to fill inspect and package vials.

The Associated Press spoke with McDermott recently about addressing this production challenge. The conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q: After developing your vaccine so quickly how is Pfizer approaching the need to make billions of doses in record time?

A: There is a dire need to vaccinate more people quickly. We are expanding our capacity to make more vaccine as quickly as possible. We are making process improvements adding more manufacturing lines within the Pfizer and BioNTech facilities expanding use of contract manufacturers and adding more suppliers.

Q: What are those process improvements?

A: These involve getting more productivity from our existing lines. We look at reducing wait times when changing over between batches doubling of our batch size increasing yields per batch. We’re reducing cycle times from the start of manufacturing to shipping.

Q: What else are you doing inside your Kalamazoo Michigan factory?

A: We went from one production line to four lines and from one shift to three shifts. We are expanding everywhere possible. We haven’t taken a day off since October.

Q: With new variants of the virus emerging can Pfizer quickly update its vaccine to block those versions?

A: Our mRNA platform technology is the perfect science to be able to make modifications quickly. In essence there would be no changes to the manufacturing network. That altered genetic material would come into the system – and production would begin immediately on a new vaccine version.

Q: Recently Pfizer hiked its production forecast for this year from about 1.3 billion doses to about 2 billion. Are you sure you can do that?

A: Right now we can potentially deliver approximately 2 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine by the end of 2021. We are confident in this commitment but of course are constantly looking for ways to make and distribute more doses faster.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9taWRkbGUtZWFzdC8yMDIxMDIxNC1sZWJhbm9uLXN0YXJ0cy1jb3ZpZC0xOS12YWNjaW5hdGlvbi1jYW1wYWlnbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lebanon starts Covid-19 vaccination campaign,"Lebanon received its first batch of COVID-19 vaccines on Saturday with aid from the World Bank which said it would monitor the inoculation drive to ensure the shots go to those most in need.

A truck carrying the first batch of doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) arrives at Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut Lebanon February 13 2021.

About 28500 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine landed at Beirut airport the first of 2.1 million doses set to arrive in stages throughout the year.

Doctors hope this will ease the pressure on hospitals battered over the past year by a financial crisis and a port explosion and now fighting some of the region's highest infection rates.

In its first operation funding the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines the World Bank reallocated $34 million from an existing health project in Lebanon to help launch the vaccination programme.

""We will MONITOR fair and transparent distribution to PRIORITY groups"" Ferid Belhaj its regional vice president wrote in a tweet. He said health workers and the elderly would be first in line warning against favouritism.

Caretaker health minister Hamad Hassan told reporters it was a ""dream come true"" that the first vaccines had arrived nearly a year after Lebanon detected its first case of the virus.

He pledged the vaccines would eventually reach everyone seeking to dispel fears that politicians would try to jump the queue.

""The best gift""

Firass Abiad head of Rafik Hariri hospital said its medical staff would get their shots within 24 hours.

""The best gift one can ask for on Valentine's day"" he said on Twitter on Saturday.

The country has also booked 2.7 million doses through the global COVAX scheme for poorer countries and officials say talks are underway for some 1.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

The total number of doses ordered so far would cover about half of Lebanon's population of more than six million which includes at least a million Syrian refugees.

Hassan has said Lebanon's president parliament speaker and premier would get some of the first vaccines to boost morale.

Nearly a month into a strict lockdown that has cut off livelihoods and fuelled protests the government began lifting some restrictions this week. Still most businesses are closed and a 24-hour curfew remains in effect.

Since January a surge in infections has flooded Lebanon after lax measures during Christmas. The outbreak took the nation's total death toll to almost 4000.

Many ICU wards have filled up with shortages of dollars and medical supplies spawning a black market for oxygen tanks.

""Many Holocaust survivors never spoke to their children of the horrors they endured"" he added.

Bourla's parents were of 2000 survivors from a community of 50000 nearly eradicated by the Holocaust in Thessaloniki Greece where he was born. He began by retelling the story of his father.""My father's family like so many others had been forced from their homes and taken to a crowded house within one of the Jewish ghettos"" recounted Bourla. ""It was a house they had to share with several other Jewish families. They could circulate in and out of the ghetto as long as they were wearing the yellow star.""""But one day in March 1943 the ghetto was surrounded by occupational forces and the exit was blocked. My father and his brother (my uncle) were outside when it happened. Their father (my grandfather) met them outside told them what was happening and asked them to leave the ghetto and hide because he had to go back inside as his wife and two other children were home. So later that day my grandfather Abraham Bourla his wife Rachel his daughter Graziella and his youngest son David were taken to a camp outside the train station and from there left for Auschwitz. My father and uncle never saw them again"" Bourla recounted.He explained how his father and uncle were able to escape to Athens. Thanks to local police who were helping Jews escape from the Nazis they were able to obtain fake IDs with Christian names.""When the Germans had left they went back to Thessalonki and found that all of their property and belongings have been stolen or sold. With nothing to their name they started from scratch becoming partners at a successful liquor business that they ran together until they both retired.""Bourla then followed with his mother's story.According to Bourla his mother was well known which caused her to hide at home ""24 hours a day"" out of fear of being recognized on the street and turned over the Germans. She left the house very rarely but it was during one of her rare ventures outside that she was captured and taken to a local prison.""My Christian uncle my mother's brother-in-law Costas de Madis approached a Nazi official and paid him a ransom in exchange for a promise that my mother would be spared"" Bourla said.""However my mother's sister my aunt didn't trust the Germans. So she would go to the prison every day at noon to watch as they loaded the truck of prisoners. One day her fear had been realized and my mom was put on the truck. She ran home and told her husband who then called the Nazi official and reminded him of their agreement - who said he would look into it. That night was the longest night in my aunt and uncle's life because they knew that next morning my mom would likely have been executed.""""The next day my mom was lined up with other prisoners. And moments before she would have been executed a German soldier on a motorcycle arrived and handed some papers to the men in charge of the firing squad. They removed my mother from the line. As they rode away my mom could hear the machine gun slaughtering those that were left behind. Two or three days later she was released from prison after the Germans left Greece.""Eight years later his parents met by way of matchmaking through which they agreed to get married according to Bourla.""My father had two dreams - one that I would become a scientist and two that I would marry a nice Jewish girl. I'm happy to say he lived long enough to see both dreams come true"" Bourla said.Afraim Katzir Director of the Sephardic Heritage International said that ""It is very inspiring that it is the son of Holocaust survivors who is on the front line of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.""The Sephardic Heritage International (SHIN) DC according to their website builds intercultural bridges while raising awareness of Sephardic and other underrepresented Jewish heritages and the cultures arts and history of the Middle East North Africa the Iberian Peninsula Greece the Balkans and Central and Western Asia.During the virtual event the embassies of Israel and Morocco in Washington DC came together for the first time ever.This Thursday February 18 Dr. Bourla will be joining another zoom event with the Jewish Heritage Museum as a part of the museum's new series ""Legacies"" which highlights notable people who share a connection to Jewish identity heritage and the Holocaust."
PCG,PG&E Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uYmEvamF6ei9uZXdzL2VuZC1zZWFzb24tZ3JhZGVzLWV2YWx1YXRpbmctamF6ei1rZXlvbnRlLWdlb3JnZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,End of Season Grades: Evaluating Jazz PG Keyonte George,"Despite the Utah Jazz going just 31-51 on the year there were plenty of memorable and enjoyable pieces to the season. One of the brightest was Keyonte George the rookie out of Baylor who burst onto the scene from day one and seized the Jazz starting point guard role.

It’s hard to expect any more from the 20-year-old who was taken with the 16th pick in last summer's draft. George averaged 13.0 points 4.4 assists and 2.8 rebounds per game for the Jazz. Those numbers were good for fourth in scoring and second in total assists amongst all rookies this year. The passing in particular was a lot better than advertised after not being asked to do much of that while at Baylor.

George’s scoring remains the most intriguing piece of his game. He recorded three games in which he scored over 30 points and went over 20 points in nine others. When he’s playing confidently he can get buckets from all three levels and has plenty of juice from long-range. On February 15 George etched his name into the record books when he knocked down nine three-pointers which tied him for the rookie record and put him all alone for Jazz rookies.

An underrated storyline from the season was the leadership role the rookie took on as the season progressed. Jazz head coach Will Hardy thrust him into the starting point guard role early on and along with this came added responsibility- a responsibility that George seemed comfortable with. Heading into his first full offseason George will have even more of an opportunity to be a leader for this Jazz team that is looking to improve.

Despite all the positives it wasn’t a perfect season for George. He like the Jazz's other guards struggled with efficiency. There was a point in the middle of March where George seemed to have figured out how to get to his spots and score more efficiently but those numbers dipped as his teammates missed games and his name became more prominent on opposing scouting reports. Judging by his end-of-season comments he’s not worried about the misses. George said getting stronger and in better shape would result in the shots falling at a higher clip.

Defensively George is still a work in progress. Although his length stands out there's still plenty of room to grow. He has enough size to play either backcourt position which he used to showcase some nice individual defensive sequences. His off-ball awareness needs to improve as does his general focus on that end but he certainly has the potential to be a fine defender in this league.

One area where George can improve is in his words emotional intelligence. He’s immensely talented but he needs to keep his head up when he misses a shot or makes a silly turnover. He’s young though and there’s so much good that it’s hard to dwell on the bad.

Overall it was a very promising season for George. He’ll head into a big offseason with a lot to learn but a great foundation of skills & intelligence to build on. In a postgame press conference Hardy said that Keyonte could become the future of the Jazz program. That is high praise from his head coach but it is certainly a quote that should make you feel good as a Jazz fan.

McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

Point guard Deivon Smith is transferring to St. John's from Utah giving Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino a veteran replacement for Daniss Jenkins next season.

A fifth-year senior Smith ranked sixth in the country with 7.1 assists per game last season. He averaged 13.3 points and 6.3 rebounds for the Utes compiling five triple-doubles -- second most during a single season in NCAA history and the most by any Pac-12 player.

In a St. John's news release Monday Pitino said the 6-foot Smith reminds him of Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier a standout player for Pitino at Louisville.

""Super excited to have Deivon Smith joining the Johnnies"" Pitino said. ""Total dog who rebounds creates and scores.""

Smith from Decatur Georgia played his freshman season at Mississippi State and then spent two years with Georgia Tech. He shot a career-high 46.7% from the field in 28 games during his only season at Utah.

Two of his triple-doubles came during Utah's run to the NIT semifinals and he scored a career-best 28 points against tournament runner-up Indiana State on April 2.

Smith becomes the third notable transfer the Red Storm have landed this offseason joining 7-foot-1 center Vincent Iwuchukwu from USC and 6-foot-7 forward Aaron Scott from North Texas. They both committed last month.

At point guard St. John's also returns sophomore Simeon Wilcher a touted recruit who began to show marked improvement late last season in his limited role as a freshman. Wilcher averaged 2.8 points and 9.1 minutes in 28 games as Jenkins' understudy.

Jenkins followed Pitino from Iona to St. John's for his senior season and propelled the Red Storm to a 20-13 record including 11-9 in conference play for their most Big East wins in 14 years. They reached the Big East tournament semifinals for the first time since 2000 losing 95-90 to eventual NCAA champion UConn.

Jenkins led the team in scoring (14.9 points per game) assists (5.4) steals (1.6) and minutes (30.7) earning second-team All-Big East honors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vZmFzdGVyc2tpZXIuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvZm9ydC1rZW50LW91dGRvb3ItY2VudGVyLWlzLWFjY2VwdGluZy1hcHBsaWNhdGlvbnMtZm9yLWl0cy1wZy1wcm9ncmFtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fort Kent Outdoor Center is Accepting Applications for its PG Program – FasterSkier.com,The Fort Kent Outdoor Center in Fort Kent Maine is currently accepting applications for our 2024-2025 post graduate program.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”"

""This was undoubtedly one of the biggest gymnastics competitions our girls have ever competed in other than a regional or national competition"" club head coach/director Lorrie Bertolet said about last week's WOGA Classic in Frisco Texas.

Dennis seized two individual first places — on the vault (9.25) and the balance beam (9.775).

Club members also with third-place event finishes included: Oliver (vault 9.275; uneven bars 9.225) Ketcher (balance beam 9.325) Mallory Stephens (Level 9 Junior B vault 9.4) Dennis (floor exercise 9.6) Lyndsey Lief (Level 7 Junior B uneven bars 9.4).

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

IT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping shopping shopping often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?

Stephen Procter a ceramist specializing in art for the garden has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.

Stephen who is Vermont-based has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together and how.

Margaret Roach: Hi Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].

Stephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.

Margaret: I know whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels your pots and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story I keep looking around my garden with a different eye I have to say thanks to you. So: thanks to you.

Stephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.

Margaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens didn’t you? About 20 years ago.

Stephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny I’ve been to several pottery events recently and I don’t really feel like a potter even though I work in clay.

People say potter or pottery and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah they are. They are. So again I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them although they do have a hole a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of we’ll say discussion but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter] about functional ceramics functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is whether it’s art or not.

Stephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.

Margaret: Yeah decorative. So yours are decorative but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?

Stephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people they define spaces they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.

Margaret: Well but I think the garden is I mean to me what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating is it? I mean hopefully it elevates us and the space.

Stephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way especially it in a certain sense reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.

Margaret: Yeah. Well when we did the “Times” story you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens whose work I’d read but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it but it was beautiful.

Stephen: Sadly I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.

Margaret: Right. And so from that I wrote down one line I remember “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it no longer wild.”

Stephen: Oh I love that line.

Margaret: And so there’s that sort of there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship yeah?

Stephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden which is already cultivated is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation to my mind.

Margaret: Right. Now I said in the introduction that yours because they’re this very high-fired stoneware they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration not just the placement and the scale and so forth but also the durability. And yours can do that.

Stephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element a non-plant element of another substance but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed and it changing the wilderness people kind of rise up to it too when they see one of these don’t they [laughter]?

Stephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts and apparently other people do too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious and I see that happening and I always feel like oh the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.

Margaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play and how do we figure it out where to place such a statement.

So if someone contacts you and says so I’m thinking I want something but I don’t know what or where you sometimes go and go on a walk with them I guess or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean what’s the beginning of that process of that exploration process?

I mean I always say one of the most important things about garden design and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles is don’t forget besides walking around outside don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors because I’m indoors a lot right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration like the placement not just from the outdoor experience but from key views within the living space.

Stephen: Absolutely I do. And it can make a big impact oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont Judith Irven who was talking about she and her husband in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes and the wind.

Margaret: And I think some of this people may think oh right I’ve used sometimes a pair of well-placed chairs is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow and especially in the snow there’s just something so it’s like “Ooh someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.

Stephen: Yes exactly.

Margaret: Yeah that come hither kind of but not right now kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says I think I want something but I don’t know what and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?

Stephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of I think of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.

At the inside bend of a path along a garden pathway is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter] if you will as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are I think of as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.

And then there are more interesting and I think more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that and reveals only part of itself creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.

Margaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.

Stephen: Well exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured it’s a very geometric herb garden and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple which I think would be a really interesting … I mean it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.

Margaret: You were just mentioning two pots and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.

Stephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting and it’s not just my own experience but people I work with and when we place pieces in the garden it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases this has been a surprising discovery for me a very relatively small piece say a globe of 24 inches tall maybe even a little shorter if it relates to a larger vessel it can hold its own in a large space because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost if it has a big brother [laughter] it can tag along.

Margaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens and I think this is a good time I don’t know rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at and I feel like before I get distracted by oh those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view creating almost axial endpoints like “Ooh look up there.”

And I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance but let’s look out there too.

Stephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.

Margaret: Well and it’s interesting that you say that because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years one of the things they’ve told me when I was like “Oh well I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like “Yes that’s a great idea. But along the way maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis not a literal path but a visual path maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements spots of gold to help you travel there.”

So that sort of duet again or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas I guess is what I’m saying come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.

Stephen: In a sense they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another to another to another to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned a particular palette of plant you’re using to accomplish a similar thing.

Margaret: You just said choreograph and you’re giving yourself away because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?

Stephen: Yes I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.

Margaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that and you’re teaching not only I think at your place but elsewhere including I think in Europe this year for the first time maybe?

Stephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June which I’m really looking forward to.

I want to qualify slightly what you said there Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years against my better judgment I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly I discover “Oh my gosh your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]

Margaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.

Stephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay self-taught and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.

Margaret: I didn’t ask you yet but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now I know that it’s smallish and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas or is there so updates ahead?

Stephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter] she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.

Margaret: And is there any new planting going to go on or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?

Stephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.

Margaret: And now a third requirement which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]

Well I’m so glad to talk to you again and as I said I hope that this will just some of these thoughts from your experience working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you Stephen.

Stephen: Thank you so much. It’s been a pleasure.

P&G although saying they are mainly cruelty-free now continues experimenting on animals.

Plenty of makeup is tested on animals like rodents — and dogs and cats — something state Rep. Sara Carruthers (R-Hamilton) wants to change.

""Some of this stuff is just inhumane sick and unnecessary"" Carruthers said. ""A lethal dose test involves forcing rats to swallow large amounts of chemicals until the subject dies so that you can determine the dose that causes death.""

She and state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Cleveland) introduced House Bill 495 which would stop the majority of animal testing for cosmetics sold in Ohio.

Not only would this save animals but it would also help the economy — since consumers want cruelty-free products Carruthers said.

The vegan cosmetic market is growing exponentially in part because of Generation Z's interest in ""ethically sourced products"" according to UNiDAYS a popular student shopping app that conducts market research.

But Carruthers' background is what made her interested in animal rights.

""My great great grandfather did it — they did use animal testing"" she said.

Carruthers is a descendant of Cincinnati-based company Procter and Gamble and she wants companies like hers to stop animal experimentation. Although her family still has some influence they no longer have a vote in the company policies and have no position on the board. She says her family no longer owns any part of the corporate giant but their Procter-side of the family continues to be a fixture in the Cincinnati area.

I reached out to P&G whose spokesperson said in a statement that their PETA cruelty-free brands are not tested on animals. However that is a small percentage. They have 79 brands and only 13 are on the PETA-certified list.

""P&G has invested over $480 million in non-animal test method development over decades and is partnering with groups like PETA and the Humane Society International & US working closely with governments to end animal testing globally"" the company said.

Some countries still mandate testing on animals they added.

A significant portion of their products are made in China according to 2018 testimony given to the U.S. Trade Representative and Chinese regulations require testing on products like toothpaste hair treatments and anything with sunscreen in it like a moisturizer or foundation.

I asked for a multitude of clarifications on their ""cruelty-free"" policy including data backing up their statements of being anti-animal testing. They were not addressed in their short statement.

It isn't just the United States and China that they have plants. They have factories on all continents minus Antarctica. Some locations have rules against animal testing some require it and others have other types of restraints — such as Japan which holds each ""institution responsible for self-regulation"" according to researchers.

""Let's go for made in America right?"" Carruthers said. ""We have modern testing methods like human cell-based tests sophisticated computer models.""

But bioethics expert and law professor at Case Western Reserve University Sharona Hoffman says the change could be a huge blow to medical advancements.

""Computer modeling is not a substitute for all animal studies — and also you have to worry about the expense"" Hoffman said.

Carruthers responded that data has shown that animal alternatives are actually cheaper but Hoffman is doubtful.

""Growing tissue in labs is quite expensive"" the professor said.

The bill language is broad and it could seemingly impact research to help burn victims or patients who want reconstruction surgeries after cancer or trauma.

""If you're talking about lipstick or blush I would probably agree that you don't need to use animals"" Hoffman said acknowledging that makeup isn't the true concern of hers. ""But for other treatments we have to remember 'cosmetic' is very very broad.""

The National Association for Biomedical Research is also concerned stating that the bill may have a negative impact on ""new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual — cosmetic and medical — application.""

NABR's full statement from spokesperson Eva Maciejewski:

""Measuring the safety and efficacy of a new molecule or compound usually involves preclinical testing with animals and adjunct methods and then phased human clinical trials. Scientists and regulators strive to reduce the number of animals used. They also prioritize the development and adoption of refinement methods. However scientists cannot observe the combined effects of a new molecule or compound on the body’s interconnected systems over time by relying exclusively on artificial intelligence organ chips and other non-animal methods. They also need to use animals to determine if the new molecule or compound is safe enough to begin human clinical trials. It is therefore unclear whether the proposed state bill HB 495 could have a negative impact on new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual - cosmetic and medical - application.""

""Animal studies do not proceed without any oversight"" Hoffman added. ""This isn't just some scientist collecting rats in the garage and then experimenting on them.""

Carruthers argued there are exceptions such as when there is no non-animal method available.

""This is a no-brainer"" the lawmaker said.

This bill will likely be heard in the coming months. She also introduced another bipartisan bill to crack down and try to prevent puppy mills which she said she talked to P&G about.

They were run by executives who were proudly capitalist and believed in the country’s founding principles.

No longer it seems. Big businesses’ support of green-energy legislation various social-justice edicts and the silencing of right-wingers on Twitter have become so routine it’s almost not news anymore.

The question is why? People who work at these companies regularly complain to me that most employees view their employers’ new corporate leftism with disdain. They believe it’s a nuisance pushed by a vocal fringe of the workforce.

Companies cave they say because they just don’t need the hassle of explaining to the left-wing business media why they’re not supporting AOC’s Green New Deal.

The conventional wisdom among economic conservatives I speak to is that corporate America’s wokeness can’t last forever because in the long run it’s unprofitable. Example: Ratings for the social-justice-posturing NFL were weak all year as was this year’s Super Bowl. That means the NFL will have to go back to football.

If Nike sales decline amid the sneaker brand’s embrace of the ultimate social-justice warrior former NFL QB ­Colin Kaepernick the founder of the down-on-one-knee movement market forces will likely prod the company in a new direction.

That’s why the NBA — another big business — just made the pre-game national anthem mandatory after one of its owners liberal tech entrepreneur Mark Cuban enraged many fans by pulling it from the start of Mavericks games.

Remember 74.2 million consumers voted for Donald Trump in part because they can’t tolerate virtue signaling being thrown in their faces every minute of their lives.

All of which makes sense until you understand the left-wing forces that have assembled to transform corporate America into something resembling the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. The left might hate capitalism but it has been busy implementing capitalist tools to bend big business to its will.

Changes in the money management business underscore just how successful the left has become. Shareholder votes once focused on prosaic topics such as approving mergers or rubberstamping CEO pay or changes in leadership.

Today they’re fraught affairs where companies are getting bombarded by demands for corporate diversity (more women minorities and transgender people in positions of power) green energy and overt support of what the left calls social justice.

OK corporate diversity is a worthy goal. But since when were many shareholders looking to invest for retirement so concerned about whether they were holding stock in a company that supports eliminating greenhouse emissions or canceling Columbus Day?

Answer: When those shareholders became progressive activists who learned how to influence money managers to tout politics instead of profits.

Proxy advisory firms are hired by big money managers to provide guidance on various corporate-governance issues and shareholder votes. That makes the advisory firms very powerful since most Americans invest through mutual funds and other managed accounts.

And it’s no secret that the progressive-left agenda has gained support from these outfits in recent years. With that trillions of dollars in shareholder votes from ­places like Larry Fink’s BlackRock and Vanguard are now openly supporting left-wing causes.

You might say these firms are pushing an agenda that’s based on rigorous analysis. Some studies show that corporate diversity leads to higher profits. Global warming could destroy the economy.

It’s easy for companies to join the leftist mob when it comes to favoring the Green New Deal — until it actually kills jobs like President Joe Biden canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline. The Bismarck Tribune via AP

Studies also show the opposite — that diversity has no impact on profits. Global warming is real but not the immediate existential threat that requires us to kill jobs by killing the Keystone XL Pipeline during a pandemic recession.

But the power of the left is hard to ignore. They find common ground with public pension funds run by liberal politicians who also want to sway corporate behavior leftward.

It wasn’t so long ago when companies used to ignore the investor crank who bought one share of stock and came to shareholders meetings to lob insane questions at the CEO. Money managers and proxy firms weren’t swayed by outside forces to vote a certain way.

But most shareholder votes now involve progressive edicts under the guise of so-called Environmental Social Governance investing. ESG as it is known on Wall Street is a way to measure everything from a firm’s compliance with green-energy initiatives to its embrace of causes such as Black Lives Matter.

The average retail investors in mutual funds have no say or vote in this vast transformation even as their money is being used for political purposes. The fund is responding to the vocal minority that figured out how the game is played.

Vincent Harinam a law- enforcement consultant and Ph.D. candidate at the University of Cambridge in an article last July on the Web site Quillette wrote: “When it comes to the culture wars the goal of a corporation is not to maximize profits but to minimize losses.”

That means constantly appeasing the vocal and organized minority and corporate America’s lurch to the left won’t end anytime soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlcGFpcmVyZHJpdmVubmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8xMy9leHBlcnRzLWV4cGxhaW4tYXBwcmFpc2FsLWNsYXVzZS1wcm9jZXNzLWFuZC1waXRmYWxscy10by1hdm9pZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Experts explain auto insurance appraisal clause process — and pitfalls to avoid,"Share This:

Three professional appraisers late last year gave collision repairers and customers some considerations on whether a disputed repair bill merited invoking an appraisal clause and how to handle the process.

Collision Hub CEO Kristen Felder also warned body shops on the Nov. 11 2020 “World Fair” broadcast that the consumer exercising a right to appraisal might not be the “magic bullet” a repairer expects.

It might not always be in the best interest of the policyholder according to Felder. Sometimes another strategy would be the better move according to the show.

Before we get going one caveat: This article and analysis is for informational purposes only and is not legal advice. Consult with a qualified attorney before taking any action. Felder offered a similar caveat regarding her company’s Nov. 11 show also featuring Larry Montanez co-owner of P&L Consultants and Mark Olson CEO of Vehicle Collision Experts. (Together she estimated the trio had probably been involved in 8000-10000 RTA proceedings.)

Invoking the RTA

An “appraisal clause” or “RTA” offers a means for a customer — or an insurer — to resolve a dispute over the amount the insurer owes the customer for a loss without having to go to court. (Remember: Your customer is the one who actually owes your body shop not the insurer. The insurer owes the customer indemnification for their loss such as the cost of the repair.)

They’re not necessarily going to be present in every insurance policy and their parameters can vary based upon the wording of an individual policy. But the general concept goes something like this:

After reaching an impasse on the amount owed the consumer either the insurer or policyholder can invoke the appraisal clause. Each side hires an appraiser and both appraisers agree upon a third appraiser to serve as an “umpire” with the umpire’s costs split between the policyholder and insurer. If any two out of the three agree on a dollar value for the loss that amount is binding.

Montanez said body shops need to realize: “It’s not a shop thing.” It’s only the policyholder who has rights under the appraisal clause.

﻿

Montanez said that in most states he’d seen the RTA can be invoked prior to repairs during them or after the work is completed. He said he only gets involved before or after the repair; after significant work and not just minor disassembly you might as well just finish the repair he said.

Olson described being involved in an RTA on a vehicle with significant damage and a “klunk” in the transmission. He said they couldn’t start the appraisal clause process until the cause of the “klunk” was determined. Otherwise the final RTA dollar amount — which is binding — might not be enough to address the undetermined issue he said.

However he also warned about a shop jumping the gun. He offered this scenario: A $10000 MSRP car currently worth $9500 sees an insurer writing a $6000 repair estimate and a shop writing a sheet for $8000.

If the shop just decides to repair the car and let the RTA process play out “you might be fixing a total” Olson said. The insurer only owes the vehicle actual cash value — not the cost of repairing it he said.

Felder noted that “that’s gonna make you real mad” when the insurer’s designated appraiser declares the vehicle a total pays the customer and takes posession.

Montanez said that a shop should have sought at least two supplements before the customer invokes the appraisal clause. Felder said that sometimes consumers can jump the gun and the insurer has never even received a supplement prior to the RTA demand.

Montanez described a hypothetical shop advising a customer to write an RTA based on the discrepancy between a initial curbside or photo estimate for $1000 and the shop’s $9000 supplement. Yet had the shop simply requested an adjuster follow up and view the vehicle in-person the adjuster might well have agreed the damage was far more extensive. But they didn’t get the chance to do so.

Montanez suggested customers should formally notify the insurer they’re exercising their right to an appraisal. This could be done in a phone call but he instead recommended certified first-class mail and sending the insurer a fax and email as well.

Customer’s best interest

As Felder observed the RTA might not be the right move for your customer

“They’re one more tool” Olson said.

Montanez agreed and described an RTA as not even rising to the level of a tool like a frequently used 10mm socket or wrench.

“It’s probably your 17mm socket” Montanez said — merely “used occasionally.”

Montanez said he denied more RTA cases than he accepted and often there’s a better strategy to resolve the situation. This might be as simple as having the customer making phone calls about the matter according to Montanez who said one would be shocked how often this resolved the dispute.

Appraisal clauses aren’t fast or easy “it can be expensive” and you might not win according to Felder.

Felder said an appraisal process can be done in as little as a couple of weeks but she’s seen it go two years. Montanez said the fastest he’s see was three hours with the worst being a year and a half. “I average about three months” he said.

She said the process could involve an appraiser’s fee of $495-$600 and half of an umpire’s $600-$750 bill. If the appraisal clause format requires retaining an umpire up front the consumer might be out $1000 prior to having negotiated anything she said. (In other scenarios one might be able to save money by waiting to see if the insurer and consumer’s appraisers can reach agreement before moving to hire an umpire Montanez indicated.)

Felder said she advises that it’s not worth pursuing an RTA without at least a $3000 difference between the shop and insurer estimates.

As Olson put it: Suppose the appraisal clause process costs the customer $1000 and finds the customer’s appraisal $3000 above the insurer’s. The umpire “splits the baby” and produces an appraisal $1500 higher than the insurer’s.

“You spent a grand to chase $1500” Olson said. Small-claims court would be better he and Montanez indicated.

“I love small claims court” Felder said.

Felder said to make sure that the appraisal clause would be in the customer’s best interest. Explain the process and cost she said. It’s OK to give an opinion but “remember you’re not an attorney” she said. Don’t declare that it’ll be a guaranteed payout and “you don’t want to be interpreted as giving legal advice” she said.

A facility whose customers start frequently invoking an RTA means “a target on you” she said. An insurer might seek to determine if the shop is illegally coaching the policyholder — and the shop could find itself in trouble for practicing law without a license. Olson said the insurer might even seek to examine the policyholder under oath about their interactions with the shop.

From an insurer’s perspective it “feels weird” to have multiple RTAs coming out of a single shop. They suspect “you’re running a fraud ring.”

Felder said her procedure is to explain the process if a customer asks but add the caveat “‘I’m not an attorney'” and she can’t advise what the customer should do. “‘You should talk to your attorney'” she would say.

“Make sure that your house is clean” she said. She noted one shop who uses “prefab” communications with customers and “he doesn’t deviate.”

An appraisal clause would be contained within a first-party insurance policy — assuming it even exists in there. If the other insured driver admitted liability “always go third-party” Montanez said.

Felder agreed saying she hates when a shop tells a customer with a valid third-party claim to file a first-party claim so as to exercise its appraisal clause.

“I can get a lot better under tort law” she said. Relief in a small-claims court from an at-fault party wouldn’t be limited to the “four corners” of one’s own first-party insurance policy according to Felder.

“That’s the worst advice you can give to anybody” Montanez said of switching to a first party claim instead of a third-party claim where the other party has admitted liability.

Picking an appraiser

Felder also warned that an “extreme and distinct difference” exists between RTAs invoked on a repairable vehicle and a total loss.

The two types of appraisers need completely different knowledge and documentation she said.

Olson said sometimes insurers will even assign a classic car appraiser and he must spend time explaining collision repair to them. They’re good at their speciality but they lack an estimating system and don’t know how to write a sheet he said. “It’s crazy” he said.

The customer should make sure whoever they hire has a background in collision repair and estimating according to Felder. The appraiser should be current on training familiar with OEM procedures and operate different estimating systems she said.

Shops should check with other shops for a reference on who to recommend to a customer check their license if it’s required and see how they did on past RTAs.

Determine any conflict of interest Felder said; Olson said you want them to be truly independent.

She encouraged repairers to think about who they’d recommend to consumers and then reach out to that person and make a connection. The next couple of cases the repairer thinks might work repairers should first call that prospective appraiser and have them offer perspective she said.

A good appraiser will reassess the loss — potentially writing more than the shop did. Felder she hasn’t encountered a situation yet where she didn’t assess a higher amount than the repairer.

However hiring the wrong appraiser will find them simply negotiating the shop’s estimate against the insurer’s last one according to Felder.

“It’s only coming down” Olson said.

In a similar vein Olson advised not to trust an appraisers’ assertion they always win — they’re probably really just getting a partial win.

A situation where the appraiser wrote $10000 the other side said $5000 and the final RTA value was $7500 — “that’s a ‘split the baby'” rather than a win according to Olson. The customer got $2500 but lost out on $2500 more according to Felder.

Montanez said he’d only truly won about a dozen appraisals out of 2000-3000.

All of the others saw him conceding part of what he had originally wrote; for example producing an estimate for $19000 and settling for $18000 with a party who estimated $14000.

It’s still a win for the customer who did better than they would have otherwise. Montanez said he’s never saw a case end with less than an umpire who “cut the baby in half.” But it’s not an absolute victory for the appraiser according to Montanez.

Picking an umpire

The two appraisers might find an impasse on picking an umpire together. Olson said a situation can arise where the other side will just reject every umpire the other appraiser suggests out of hand not even bothering to vet them. Faced with such a situation he said his strategy would be to see if he could live with any of their choices for the process would go faster.

If agreement can’t be reached on an umpire the parties would have to go to a judge.

Often a judge doesn’t know any appraisers or the industry and they’ll just select a mediation company or a retired judge according to Olson.

A judge going this route instead of selecting a regular umpire is expensive with the customer paying $1000-$2000 for their half of such a selection according to Olson. He said his umpire bill would be “a lot more affordable than a retired judge.”

Felder said she’s never encountered one of these situations that cost less than $3000 — meaning each side is now paying $1500.

Hands off

Once the shop’s customer invokes their right to appraisal the shop is “now out of the equation 100 percent” Felder said. “You are done. … You can’t talk to anyone.”

The vehicle owner must handle the process. The repairer can’t talk to the insurer or their designed appraiser Felder said.

If the insurer’s appraiser needs to see the vehicle they would contact the customer’s appraiser who would arrange the appointment. If the insurer’s appraiser called the shop directly the shop would say “‘I can’t talk to you.'”

If the insurer calls the shop and wants to work out a deal “you can’t talk” she said.

Don’t do anything that the customer’s appraiser doesn’t instruct you to do Felder said.

In their southwest Las Vegas office John Acres and his son Noah have one of those big boxy Motorola DynaTAC cellular telephones that Jerry Seinfeld used in his sitcom as a reminder of just how far technology has come in a relatively short period.

Back in 1981 the elder Acres armed with a big idea and the technology to support it set out to change how casinos view their gaming customers. As founder of Electronic Data Technologies John Acres invented the first player tracking system for casino floors.

The innovation was followed by other revolutionary technologies over the years including progressive jackpot systems that increased play on slots loyalty and bonus systems.

Now 40 years after creating his groundbreaking player-tracking technology John Acres is setting out again to change the gaming industry — this time with his son Noah assisting with the new company called Acres Technology which they plan to take public in the third quarter of this year.

It’s familiar ground for the senior Acres who along with Mike Stone founded Mikohn Gaming in 1985 created progressive jackpot systems that increased play on slots.

In 1992 he started a company Acres Gaming and through it came innovations in loyalty and bonus systems that resulted in gamblers playing more frequently.

The Acres Advantage system debuted at Crown Casino in Melbourne Australia and its success led to other installations at MGM Mandalay Bay and Station Casinos properties according to Noah Acres. That company was later sold to IGT where the loyalty system is now known as IGT Advantage.

And in 2009 through Acres 4.0 he developed systems that reduced costs while increasing play.

AGA Hall of Fame

Those innovations earned John Acres a spot in the American Gaming Association Hall of Fame.

“I sold my last company for $143 million and I retired” he said of the Acres Gaming sale. “But then I noticed that Amazon was doing some amazing things with data and realized that casinos could benefit from that same technology and the technology that the casinos were using wasn’t keeping pace with what the rest of the world was doing.”

It didn’t take long for him to unretire and develop what’s next on the supplier side of the casino floor — a product called Foundation that will gather 1000 times more data than systems that are currently installed on most floors.

Foundation is indeed the foundation of the new company and the Acres team has already begun showing its capabilities to the nation’s largest casino companies in a bid to take market share from IGT which bought Acres 4.0 and its existing technology in 2004.

The Acres name itself could sell product.

“Certainly John Acres is a true innovator on the supplier systems and technology side of gaming going back many many years” said Marcus Prater executive director of the Las Vegas-based Association of Gaming Equipment Manufacturers.

“He’s the type of guy that when he announces something new it certainly gets everyone’s attention because of his past successes” Prater said.

“The technology side of our industry has been fortunate and we need as much innovation as we can in the supplier side of the business right now” he said. “Overall as an industry we need to keep innovating and I’m glad to hear John has got something new to show us.”

But just exactly what will Foundation do for the player the gaming consumer who in 2019 gambled and lost $7.9 billion on casino slot machines to their owners?

“It’s a question we often get” Noah Acres said in a January interview at the company’s small manufacturing plant off the 215 Beltway near Buffalo Drive. “What can I do with that constant stream of electronic data?”

Learning from players

For openers it can help a casino company learn even more than it knows now about its customers. More important casinos can do something proactively if they sense that players are becoming unhappy with their losses.

“I can detect when you’re becoming unhappy and I can either send an employee out to talk to you I can send a message to your phone I could put a message on the slot machine screen” Noah Acres said. “The message might be something like ‘Hey for the next 10 minutes we’ll double all your pays.’ It could be ‘Here’s 20 bucks of free money.’ It could be a free drink coupon. It could be anything. It’s up to the casino what they want to do. But the fact is right now the casinos can’t measure an experience in real time and they can’t do anything about it and now we’re giving them the tools to do both.”

The system does that by monitoring play. On video poker machines for example it can determine if a player makes mistakes in basic strategy. Rather than see a player quit or go to a rival casino for a change in luck managers monitoring play can be proactive in how they approach the customer.

The broad capacity of data also is capable of providing bonuses to players based on what they personally enjoy.

Some players like machines that are close to a sportsbook so they can watch a particular game on a big screen as they gamble on a slot.

Sports bonuses

Maybe that particular player is a fan of the Vegas Golden Knights and is watching a game against the rival San Jose Sharks. If the Knights score a goal against the Sharks and a player’s profile indicates he’s a Knights fan the system could trigger for example an exclusive 90-second bonus period during which all the player’s winnings are doubled.

Because player profiles are personalized the system can develop customized bonusing whether the player is a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers the Chicago Bears or any other team.

The additional data stream will enable slot machines to tie in with whatever is on the casino sportsbook’s betting board. Noah Acres believes the personalized experience will be attractive to younger players who crave that special attention.

Noah Acres said another advantage of Foundation is that it is designed with an open platform to interface with any slot machine manufacturer’s game. That’s a huge advantage in today’s mergers-and-acquisitions world in which a company may buy multiple casinos that have their floors populated with machines manufactured by different companies.

How big of an advantage?

“The average nationwide casino reinvests 20 percent to 30 percent of what players lose back to player comps” Noah Acres said. “A lot of that is highly inefficient and wasted. If you’re Caesars (Entertainment) before the merger they did around $4.5 billion of gaming win (annually). So to reinvest 25 percent back in the players is over $1 billion.

“Every 1 percent efficiency the gain is $10 million of new profit and we’re giving you 1000 times more data. There’s a lot of efficiencies you can gain” he said. “I think it’s going to make a massive change in the industry.”

Cashless floor prospects

Foundation also is expected to be in the center of the industry’s next big innovation the cashless casino floor.

With the new ability to connect player accounts directly to machines through a smartphone app a player could buy credits with a few phone clicks.

It also could speed table-game transactions. A player could punch in the proper codes to buy chips at a blackjack table and at the same time print out a receipt that is deposited in the cash box for auditing purposes.

“Our cashless solution is superior to our competition because we designed it as a component to be open to anyone and everyone to use in the way they want” John Acres said. “Others use proprietary technologies and proprietary interfaces where only they can decide who gets to use their resources. We allow casinos to use any payment providers they want.”

The company’s goal is to be recognized as the undisputed industry leader in cashless casino transactions by the end of the year.

“We’re going to do over 30000 machines this year throughout the nation on cashless” Noah Acres said.

And by the third quarter he said he hopes Acres Technology becomes a publicly traded company.

Noah Acres said he believes that $20 million to $30 million will be raised in the company’s initial public offering. He said friends and family already have invested in the initial IPO expenses.

Once the company is public it will shift from its current hardware emphasis to software on the system. Because of the open platform customer companies can dream up their own applications.

“If a developer has an idea for a bonus report or promotion we’ll give you the development tools for our platform and you can go out and create it and sell it” Noah Acres said.

It’s what customers would expect from a gaming innovator who’s seen his technology evolve from a boxy cellphone to something akin to the latest smartphone over its lifetime.

A response to an activist’s query under the Right to Information RTI ) Act has shown that one in five awards announced by the insurance ombudsmen was pending at the end of FY20.The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India ( Irdai ) has said that it has not taken any disciplinary action against any insurance company so far for not complying with the order of the ombudsman.The RTI query was filed by Jeetendra Ghadge  who took an interest in the matter after his own experience with the ombudsman. He managed to get his order implemented within two months with help from the ombudsman’s office but was surprised to see how lightly insurers were treating the orders.According to the response 9528 awards were issued by various ombudsmen across the country against insurance companies in the previous financial year. Of this insurers had complied with 7664 orders but 1864 were pending at the end of the year. Public sector insurers Oriental New India and National Insurance had the highest number of pending orders at 480 303 and 289 followed by Bharti Axa Life at 198 and Star Health at 142.Irdai has said that it has not acted against any insurer so far for delay in implementation. According to Vinay Sah ombudsman for Maharashtra excluding Mumbai there are instances when insurance companies take more than a couple of months. His orders now incorporate a condition that the award is to be complied with within one month failing which interest will be applicable at bank rate plus 2% from the date of original rejection of the claim until payment.Insurers say a majority of the claims pertain to health insurance where there is a high scope for dispute. This is because insurers frequently reject claims on the grounds of a pre-existing condition or non-disclosures. In life insurance Bharati Axa Life Insurance has the highest number of pending claims followed by Life Insurance Corporation.The larger private companies are much more prompt in settling the Ombudsman’s order.

It happens because AWS pricing is complex expensive at scale and penalizes customers for hard to estimate usage elements such as data transfer and storage performance which involves taking volume size provisioned IOPs and throughput into account for every volume.

AWS provides discounts for three-year commitments on products like compute but ties those reserved instance commitments to particular compute shapes operating systems and regions. While discounting can help win business the deployments are tying customers in to AWS-only services and there’s no guarantee that pricing will be there in the future.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides better performance at a significantly lower cost than AWS. Our pricing structure is simple predictable and transparent with none of surprises associated with AWS. Additionally OCI charges the same flat rate for all regions worldwide which means there are no hidden cost variances if your business expands globally.

Oracle also provides Universal Credits which enable customers to use any Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or platform service in any region at a significant savings with a predictable monthly spend commitment. But just because your spend is monthly doesn’t mean your usage has to be: these credits don’t expire at the end of the month—they can be used any time during their 12-month contract window.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3Qtam91cm5hbC5jb20vbmV3cy90b3Atc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLzAyL3JlbW5hbnRzLW9mLWRyaXZlLWluLWVyYS1jYW4tc3RpbGwtYmUtZm91bmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Remnants Of Drive-In Era Can Still Be Found,"Evidence that Chautauqua County once basked in a post-war glow made only brighter by several drive-in movie theaters might be hard to come by today.

But just like any good detective story depicted in movies displayed across towering screens overlooking hundreds of family-filled automobiles at dusk the devil is in the details.

At its peak there were a half-dozen drive-ins reaching just about all corners of the county. Most were built in the late 1940s or early ’50s at a time when rural families were expanding and vehicles were cheaper to own.

The drive-in became an alternative to traditional in-door theaters and owners could draw customers with double-features prizes and a place to grab a bite — of course rain or shine.

However in the decades since their prominence most of the concession stands and giant screens that made up the simple establishments have long been demolished or left to nature. In some instances the only proof comes from aerial views showing the faint signature pie-shaped outlines where cars once crowed fields or concrete slabs.

News that developers are looking to bring a drive-in theater back to Chautauqua County may give nostalgia-seekers a glimmer of hope.

Advanced Production Group of Dunkirk is proposing to resurrect the former Van Buren Drive-In located along West Lake Road and Van Buren Drive that ended its 42-year run in 1991. By 2011 the last remnant of the drive-in — the skeleton used to keep the screen upright — was blown down by a microburst storm.

At present the project calls for three screens along with a multi-purpose field with a performance stage on one end and a concession stand for food and drinks at the other. The multi-purpose field if the project comes to fruition will be utilized as a secondary screen location as well as community events dance recitals weddings sporting events farmers markets graduations and car shows among others. The second screen would be 24 feet by 16 feet and allow for movies to be shown twice a day three times a week for children and the elderly.

Dan Beckley of Advanced Production Group said in a recent interview he hopes to have the main screen — 60 feet by 25 feet — installed by May 10 and open that weekend to customers.

“In a perfect world I’m able to obtain all the permits in a timely fashion” he said.

The project Beckley estimates will cost “far north of $1 million” due to all the infrastructure required.

“We’re ready to take on the challenge” he added. “This should be a pretty good economic impact.”

The original Van Buren Drive-In opened in July 1949 with construction only taking about a month and a half. Partners in the project which according to an article in the Evening Observer cost $100000 included Irving Cohen and his son Gary Cohen of Rochester; Merle Dizel of Jamestown; and Albert Shapiro of Buffalo.

With capacity for 800 vehicles the drive-in was by far the largest in the county. A 58-foot steel tower helped keep a 50-foot-by-40-foot screen in place.

At the time the drive-in featured state-of-the-art technology.

“The individual speakers which were completely installed by Wednesday night are a big improvement over the general loud speaker system first used in drive-in theaters” the Evening Observer reported the day of the location’s opening. “Each parking space has a stand with a speaker which is attached in the car and the volume is adjustable.”

Based on several websites that keep track of drive-ins — including newyorkdriveins.com — and a review of newspaper clippings there have been seven major drive-in theaters located at one point or another in Chautauqua County.

¯ The Westfield Drive-In opened in May 1952 on East Main Street and was owned by Joseph Catania. With room for 500 vehicles at the time of its opening it had “the largest screen of any drive-in theatre in Western New York and has (an) individual sound system for each car” an article in the Westfield Republican stated.

The Westfield Drive-In closed in 1986 and a fire reportedly destroyed the screen in the ’90s. All that remains at the site is portions of concrete formerly used for parking.

¯ The Falconer Drive-In at 3218 Falconer Kimball Stand Road opened in August 1955 and had enough space for more than 300 vehicles. The final season is reported to be 1987 with the former snack bar converted to an eatery Sister’s Restaurant that remains to this day.

Unlike other former drive-ins located in the county the structure used to screen the movies remains standing in an otherwise empty field.

¯ The Lakewood Drive-In opened at its 171 W. Fairmount Ave. location in May 1950. According to advertisements in The Post-Journal at the time the drive-in had space for 400 vehicles.

The final season was reported to be 1989; the land is now occupied by Dipson’s Lakewood Cinema.

¯ Midway Drive-In opened in August 1947 with room for 250 cars opposite Midway State Park in Maple Springs. It is believed to have closed in 1970 making it the shortest-lived locally.

¯ Pic 17 Drive-In was big enough to fit 500 cars when it opened for shows in June 1950. It was located at present day 3209 Fluvanna Ave. Ext. in Fluvanna near the city of Jamestown.

An advertisement in The Post-Journal shortly before its opening stated Pic 17 was “Jamestown’s Newest-Most Deluxe” and that “The Moon Always Shines at Pic 17 with the latest in artificial moonlight.”

The drive-in closed in 1987. In its place is Pic 17 Self Storage.

¯ Park 60 Drive-In had two screens and was located at 1529 Foote Ave. near Jamestown. Unlike the county’s other drive-ins built in the post-World War II era Park 60 opened in May 2001 part of a renaissance for the industry.

The drive-in had room for 320 vehicles and was open seasonally from April through September. It closed after the 2014 season.",,,,,,

The companies raising objections to the deal which is reportedly already under review by the Federal Trade Commission have approached regulators in the US EU UK and China a CNBC report said.

These companies fear that the acquisition will lead to changes in how Arm licenses out its chipmaking technology despite Nvidia pledging that it will not force Arm to change the way it interacts with other businesses The Verge reported on Friday.

Nvidia is a leader in GPU which creates interactive graphics on laptops workstations mobile devices notebooks and PCs among others.

The company announced in September 2020 its intention to buy Arm Ltd from SoftBank in a $40 billion deal. Its rivals now fear that any restrictions on Arm’s licences could hurt them.

Qualcomm’s processors rely on Arm’s technology while Microsoft and Google are reportedly working on their own Arm-based chips.

Nvidia’s rivals do not appear to be convinced by the argument that the company will not interfere in Arm’s licences of chipmaking technology.

On its part Nvidia had said that the acquisition of Arm is intended to push its Artificial Intelligence (AI) efforts.

When announcing the acquisition both the parties involved had said that their combination brings together Nvidia’s leading AI computing platform with Arm’s vast ecosystem to create the premier computing company for the age of artificial intelligence accelerating innovation while expanding into large high-growth markets.

“This combination has tremendous benefits for both companies our customers and the industry” a CNBC report quoted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang as saying when the deal was announced.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3N3b3JsZC5pbi9hcnRpY2xlL21pY3Jvc29mdC1nb29nbGUtcXVhbGNvbW0tYXJlLWNvbmNlcm5lZC1vdmVyLW52aWRpYXMtYXJtLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLTM3NzMyN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Google Qualcomm are concerned over Nvidia's Arm acquisition,ERROR: You must `download()` an article first!,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdzbWFyZW5hLmNvbS9leHlub3NfMjEwMF92c19zbmFwZHJhZ29uXzg4OF9iYXR0ZXJ5X3Rlc3RpbmdfdGhlX3NhbXN1bmdfZ2FsYXh5X3MyMV91bHRyYV92ZXJzaW9ucy1uZXdzLTQ3NjQ4LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exynos 2100 vs Snapdragon 888: Battery testing the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra versions,"Samsung has been releasing two versions of most of its premium smartphones in recent years - one with a Qualcomm chipset and another one with its own Exynos chips.

In the Galaxy S21 family the chipsets in question are the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 (US&China) and Samsung's own Exynos 2100 available on every other market.

We already looked at how the two models compare in benchmarks and performance. Now it's time to see how they fare in battery life.

Here is a specs comparison between the chipsets powering the two models for reference:

Chipset Samsung Exynos 2100 Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 CPU 1x 2.9 GHz – Cortex-X1 3x 2.8 GHz – Cortex-A78 4x 2.2 GHz – Cortex-A55 1x 2.84 GHz – Kryo 680 Prime (Cortex-X1) 3x 2.42 GHz – Kryo 680 Gold (Cortex-A78) 4x 1.8 GHz – Kryo 680 Silver (Cortex-A55) Manufacturing node 5nm EUV 5nm GPU Mali-G78 MP14 (14 cores) (Vulkan 1.1 OpenCL 2.0 DirectX 12) Adreno 660 (Vulkan 1.1 OpenCL 2.0 DirectX 12) Memory support LPDDR5 3200 MHz max 50 Gbit/s max size 16GB LPDDR5 3200 MHz max 50 Gbit/s max size 16GB Storage UFS 3.1 UFS 3.0 UFS 3.1 Multimedia support Max display res: 4096 x 2160 Video capture: 8K@30fps 4K@120fps; playbak: 8K@60fps Max display res: 3840 x 2160 Video capture: 8K@30fps 4K@120fps; playbak: 8K@60fps Neural processor (NPU) Triple-core NPU (up to 26 TOPS) Hexagon 780 26 TOPS Modem LTE Cat. 24 up to 3000 Mbps down 422 Mbps up; 5G SA/NSA/Sub6/mmWave up to 7.35 Gbps down 3.67 Gbps up LTE Cat. 22 up to 2500 Mbps down 316 Mbps up; 5G SA/NSA/Sub6/mmWave up to 7.5 Gbps down 3 Gbps up

The Exynos 2100 and Snapdragon 888 versions of the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra have nearly identical battery endurance showing only slight variance hardly-noticeable in real-world use.

To be fair this is not an entirely new development. Other battery comparisons have already arrived at essentially the same conclusion. Mind you this does not necessarily negate nor contradict the fact that at peak performance levels the Exynos 2100 seems to outpace the Snapdragon 888 slightly but with the caveat of being about 26% less efficient in a performance per watt race at its higher clock speeds. You can read more about that here.

The thing is that in real-world use which our proprietary battery endurance test suit tries to simulate the phone is never really pushed to the max. It's a marathon not a sprint. Here are the new battery endurance results as achieved by the Snapdragon 888 unit:

And here are our original ones as published in the full review of the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra done on our original Exynos 2100 unit.

Our battery tests were automated thanks to SmartViser using its viSerDevice app. The endurance rating above denotes how long a single battery charge will last you if you use the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G for an hour each of telephony web browsing and video playback daily. We've established this usage pattern so that our battery results are comparable across devices in the most common day-to-day tasks. The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritty. You can check out our complete battery test table where you can see how all of the smartphones we've tested will compare under your own typical use.

It is important to note a few things about the testing methodology. The standby tests were conducted with the best possible network signal in the default state of the S21 Ultra namely with S-Pen on and AOD off.

The on-screen tests were done in native 1440p resolution with Adaptive refresh rate mode turned on while constantly monitoring the actual refresh rate with Android 11's built-in tool.

Our web browsing script refreshes pages every 10s and every refresh triggered a spike in the refresh rate to 120Hz which then dropped back down to 60Hz 1-2s later. We reckon that's a behavior fairly representative of real-world use - you swipe on the screen refresh rate shoots to 120Hz you then read for a bit it goes down.

As for the video playback the phone maintained a 48Hz refresh rate throughout the test - since it does actually do that when playing back 24fps content we think that this too is a good representation of real-life usage.

For those of you hankering for more details on the numbers themselves we'll start with the two on-screen tests - web browsing and offline video playback. The web browsing result is so close between the two units that it is easily within the margin of error. The same is mostly true for the offline video playback result.

If we are into nitpicking it does seem that the Snapdragon 888 was a little bit more power-efficient in decoding our h.264 test clip. Really nor by much though.

This is the perfect time to remind you of Samsung Display's outstanding achievement in creating a new breed of more energy-efficient OLED panels starting with the Galaxy S21 Ultra.

Standby times between the two handsets were nearly identical which is great news since standby represents a big chunk of what a handset typically does on a daily basis.

The only notable difference we saw was in the call tests. Again the difference is not huge by any stretch of the imagination but it still caught our eye especially since the common consensus seems to be that Qualcomm's X60 5G modem is a bit more efficient than Samsung's Exynos one. However those claims are mostly related to efficiency in 5G network connectivity. Our call test is deliberately executed over a 3G or 4G connection to keep it comparable to older tests as much as possible.

In any case this year the difference between the Exynos 2100 and Snapdragon 888 versions of the Galaxy S21 Ultra seems to be nearly intangible in practical terms. Hopefully this marks the beginning of a new equality trend in camp Samsung for good.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlYWxudGVjaC5jb20vc25hcGRyYWdvbi04NzAtdnMtc25hcGRyYWdvbi04ODgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Snapdragon 870 vs Snapdragon 888 Comparison: What's the Difference?,"Snapdragon 870 comes as an update to the previous year’s flagship the Snapdragon 865. Much of the processor has remained the same as the previous generation. There have only been updates regarding clock speed with the Prime Kryo core clocked at 3.2 GHz. But the Snapdragon 870 is not the flagship processor from Qualcomm. As a top-tier flagship performer from Qualcomm we now have the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888. How does the Snapdragon 870 fair against the Snapdragon 888? Let’s find out in this article.

Snapdragon 870 vs Snapdragon 888

The Snapdragon 870 is just a small update over the previous generation Snapdragon 865. At the same time the Snapdragon 888 is the flagship processor from Qualcomm made to power the best of the best smartphones.

CPU and GPU

Snapdragon 870 is an octa-core processor with one prime Kryo 585 core(Cortex-A77) core clocked at 3.2 GHz and three performance Kryo 585 cores(Cortex-A77) clocked at 2.4GHz and four power-efficient Kryo 385 cores(Cortex-A55) clocked at 1.8 GHz. And coming to the Snapdragon 888 we see another octa-core setup with one prime Cortex-X1 core clocked at 2.84GHz three performance Cortex-A78 cores clocked at 2.4GHz and four power-efficient Cortex-A55 cores running at 1.8GHz.

The Snapdragon 888 is built on a 5nm manufacturing process while the Snapdragon 870 is built on a 7nm manufacturing process making the Snapdragon 888 slightly better in terms of power efficiency.

Regarding GPU we have the Adreno 650 running on the Snapdragon 870 while the Snapdragon 888 has the Adreno 660 taking care of the graphics. Qualcomm claims that the Adreno 660 is capable of 35% faster graphics rendering compared to the Adreno 650.

AI and ISP

The Snapdragon 870 houses the 5th generation Hexagon 698 processor which offers 15 TOPS performance while the 6th generation Hexagon 780 on the Snapdragon 888 offers 26 TOPS performance. That is quite the jump in terms of AI performance.

As for the image processor we have Spectra 480 ISP inside the Snapdragon 870 that supports 8K UHD recording at up to 30fps and 4K recording at up to 120fps. The Spectra 580 ISP inside the Snapdragon 888 also offers the same but there are improvements in terms of 10-bit HEIF image capture support. There are also improvements in the single double and triple-shot images for the Spectra 580.

Connectivity

Additionally the Snapdragon 870 only supports up to Quick Charge 4+ while the Snapdragon 888 goes a step further with support for Quick Charge 5. Even in terms of connectivity the Snapdragon 870 supports Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1. However the Snapdragon 888 goes a step further by providing support for Wi-Fi 6E and even Bluetooth 5.2. Furthermore we get a Snapdragon X55 external 5G modem on the Snapdragon 870 and the Snapdragon 888 houses a Snapdragon X60 integrated 5G modem.

As recently as 2015 business was booming and poised for growth according to Fortune. But somewhere along the way the shop—recognizable for its country club aesthetic—lost its sheen. Now Ralph Lauren has announced plans to reduce its corporate footprint and shutter some retail stores globally according to Retail Dive. Read on for more on Ralph Lauren's store and office closures and for more on businesses that have been crushed by COVID check out This Iconic Department Store Is Filing for Bankruptcy.

In recent years Ralph Lauren expanded to cater to a wider range of consumers by distributing in factory stores and outlets and over time it eroded its core customer base and their willingness to pay top dollar. Then the pandemic hit. The new retail landscape marred by economic instability and widespread lockdown measures prompted a quick decline for Ralph Lauren in both wholesale and retail sales. In North American brick-and-mortar locations comparable sales were down 30 percent according to Retail Dive.

According to a recent earnings call with investors Ralph Lauren will reduce its corporate footprint by 30 percent and will close up to 10 stores globally as a part of a larger plan to focus on digital sales which was in place before the pandemic began. The closures are intended to help the company save on exorbitant rent costs executives revealed on the call. Jane Nielsen CFO and COO of Ralph Lauren reportedly expressed that this would help the company ""embrace new ways of working"" and to ""pivot resources to our key strategic priorities."" These cost-saving changes are projected to save the company $200 million to $240 million according to a press release.

The good news? There's reason to be hopeful if you're a Ralph Lauren fan. Analysts say that if the company can continue to cut costs and devise a strategy to stay relevant among younger shoppers—not just their parents—the brand could rebound as the economy stabilizes. ""Having already worked to optimize its brand portfolio and create a leaner cost structure we believe [Ralph Lauren] is taking the necessary steps to better position itself for the post-pandemic environment"" analysts with Telsey Advisory Group told Retail Dive.

After recently being sold to Tru Kids Inc. those brick-and-mortar locations pivoted from functioning as more traditional toy stores to focusing on more ""experiential"" features. However those plans were thwarted as COVID-19 caused widespread closures of malls and other retail outlets.ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb

""As a result of COVID-19 we made the strategic decision to pivot our store strategy to new locations and platforms that have better traffic"" a spokesperson told CNN Business while confirming the closures. The company will continue to sell online in the U.S. and more than 700 stores will remain open internationally.

Tom Pelissero of NFL Network reported Saturday that Winfield has been fined $7815 by the NFL.

The NFL fined #Bucs CB Antoine Winfield Jr. $7815 for mocking Tyreek Hill’s signature peace sign after a late fourth-down stop in Tampa Bay’s Super Bowl win. — Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) February 13 2021

Winfield was flagged for taunting with 4:06 to play last Sunday at Raymond James Stadium after breaking up a pass intended for Hill.

The gesture was retaliation for Hill flashing a peace sign at Winfield at the end of a 75-yard touchdown catch en route to embarrassing the Bucs for 269 receiving yards and three touchdowns in a 27-24 Chiefs victory on Nov. 29. Hill was neither penalized nor fined for his gesture.

“The taunting it was just something I had to do” Winfield said immediately after the Super Bowl.

“When we played them earlier (this season) Hill went off on us. He backflipped in front of my face and gave me the peace sign so it was only right that I gave the peace sign back to him at this moment. It felt amazing to be able to do that.”

The fine is figurative coins under the sofa cushions compared to the Bucs’ per-player compensation for their playoff run.

WAS IT THE SAME TEAM?

Saints News Network's guest writer Jameis1of1's author gives an editorial on the narrative that Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady won Super Bowl LV with the same team Saints quarterback Jameis Winston had in 2019.

ESPN reporter Diana Russini recently tweeted:

The Bucs are the same “talented team” that managed to go 7-9 last year. Added Tom Brady and are in the Super Bowl.

Fox Sports’ Undisputed co-host Skip Bayless also recently tweeted:

DO PEOPLE REALIZE HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS FOR TOM BRADY TO TAKE A 7-9 TEAM WITH NO PRESEASON GAMES THROUGH WASHINGTON’S NO. 2 D THROUGH DREW BREES AND AARON RODGERS TO A SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP IN HIS FIRST YEAR AWAY FROM NEW ENGLAND AT AGE 43?

And on nearly every sports talk show across the nation on Monday morning following the Super Bowl sports media talking heads could be heard parroting such talking points and feeding the exact same narrative to their audiences coast to coast.

However the question remains is such a narrative true or is it merely being accepted by the sporting public as true simply because popular talking heads say it’s true?

Now of course everyone knows that Brady didn’t take the exact same team that Jameis Winston led to a 7-9 record in the 2019 season to a Super Bowl victory in the 2020 season as even the most casual football fans know that every team experiences at least a little bit of turnover each season. However is the narrative being parroted coast to coast even “mostly true”?

THE NEW PLAYERS

To answer this question let’s simply look at the following irrefutable statistical facts.

Firstly in the Buccaneers Super Bowl victory over the Kansas City Chiefs the Buccaneers scored 31 points. Do you know how many of those 31 points were scored by players that were on the 2019 Buccaneers team when Jameis Winston was its quarterback? ZERO! That’s right zero as in zilch nada nil none.

New star tight end and future first-ballot Hall of Famer Rob Gronkowski scored 12 points. New kicker Ryan Succop - who replaced Tampa Bay’s 2019 5th round draft pick (yes Bucs General Manager Jason Licht actually drafted two kickers during the Jameis Winston era in Tampa both of whom were cut by the team before their second season even began) Matt Gay - scored seven points.

New star wide receiver and future Hall of Famer Antonio Brown scored six points. And the former #4 overall pick in the 2017 draft running back Leonard Fournette - now known as Playoff Lenny - scored the remaining six points.

Not one single player who played with Jameis Winston in 2019 scored one single point in the Super Bowl. And it wasn’t just in the points tally where the impact of truly new Buccaneers could be felt.

Tristan Wirfs the star rookie right tackle who was PFF’s third highest-graded offensive player in a Super Bowl in the past 15 years - tied with Russell Wilson the year he won Super Bowl MVP - protected Tom Brady marvelously. And Antoine Winfield Jr. the star rookie and starting safety for the Buccaneers came up with a huge interception of the Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes during the game as well!

In fact even when one looks at total offensive touches and total yards one can easily see the 2020 Bucs offense was carried in the Super Bowl by their new skill position additions rather than by anyone Jameis Winston played with over the previous five seasons in Tampa. In the Super Bowl the Bucs’ skill players who were on the 2019 team accounted for just 19 touches and 124 total yards and again zero points scored. The new skill position additions to the 2020 team accounted for a whopping 31 touches 224 total yards and all 31 points scored!

In short the Super Bowl was actually a perfect example of why the current popular narrative being pushed by mainstream sports media outlets is laughably false.

However I imagine many readers will think to themselves “Okay sure the Super Bowl was dominated by players Jameis Winston never played a single game with but the season itself was different.” Such readers would be wrong.

THE TWO TEAMS

The 2020 Bucs team amassed 6145 total yards of offense with 2148 of those yards - a huge 35% - coming from brand new skill position players that Jameis Winston never played a single down of football with. Likewise the 2020 Bucs team scored 492 points with 256 of those points - an enormous 52% - being scored by brand new teammates of Tom Brady that Jameis Winston never played a single down of football with in his five years in Tampa.

On the defensive side of the ball star rookie safety Antoine Winfield Jr. was a major addition to the 2020 team as not only did he intercept Patrick Mahomes in the Super Bowl he starred for the Buccaneers all year long. Winfield Jr. was 3rd on the team in tackles passes defended and forced fumbles and had head coach Bruce Arians saying at the end of the season that he should have won the rookie of the year award over Washington’s star defensive end Chase Young.

Then there is the matter of the kicker. In the Buccaneers’ 2019 season Jameis Winston’s kicker was the just drafted and soon to be cut rookie Matt Gay. Gay finished the season 24th in field goal percentage left 29 points on the board with his missed kicks on the season and was roundly blamed by Bucs fans everywhere for stealing defeat from the jaws of victory in at least two games during the 7-9 2019 season.

On the other hand Tom Brady’s kicker in 2020 was 12th-year veteran Ryan Succop a kicker who had been to the playoffs three times in his career and made every single one of his 13 playoff kicks. Succop finished the 2020 season 11th in the entire NFL in field goal percentage and left just 14 points on the board with missed kicks all season long and certainly never managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory the way Matt Gay had done multiple times the season prior.

All of the above said it should be abundantly clear to any unbiased reader that the current narrative being pushed by sports media outlets and individuals alike namely that Tom Brady won a Super Bowl with the same team Jameis Winston went 7-9 in 2020 is patently false.

Now in regards to how Jameis Winston’s 2019 season with the Buccaneers compares to Tom Brady’s 2020 season with the Buccaneers allow me to unveil for the first time the infographic to top all infographics at least as far as this 2019 Jameis Winston vs. 2020 Tom Brady discussion is concerned:

Credit: Infographic courtesy of Jameis1of1

The above infographic speaks for itself and tells a great many stories all of which the media could cover but won’t as many of the obvious stories the above irrefutable statistics tell don’t mesh well with the prevailing false media narrative that Jameis Winston was “the problem” in Tampa in 2019 and that Tom Brady took the same team Winston went 7-9 with to an 11-5 record and a Super Bowl victory.

FINAL POINTS

Finally it feels necessary to make two more points.

Firstly casual football fans should be aware that the great Peyton Manning the very year after he left the Tennessee Volunteers - a team which he never even led to a victory over the rival Florida Gators let alone to an NCAA title - to enter the NFL Draft the team replaced him with Tee Martin and immediately had a perfect season and won the NCAA Title.

However I’m sure everyone is aware that the mainstream sports media never spun the narrative that Peyton Manning had held the Volunteers back and that Tee Martin was the upgrade they needed all along.

Secondly casual football fans should also be aware that the great Drew Brees the very year after he was kicked to the curb by the San Diego Chargers - a team he had led to a 9-7 record in the 2005 season - was replaced by Philip Rivers who immediately led the Chargers to a 14-2 record in the 2006 season.

Yet here we are 15 years later and Philip Rivers has recently retired with Drew Brees retirement expected any day now and it’s Brees not Rivers who’s considered the sure-fire first-ballot Hall of Famer and a top 10 all-time NFL QB.

So while this may be a strange lesson to try and teach in an article being published by Saints News Network on Sports Illustrated it really is true that you can’t always buy the narratives the media is selling even those being sold by mainstream sports media.

It has been well publicized that Kevin Owens had a goal of jumping off the pirate ship at Tampa's Raymond James Stadium last year during WrestleMania. During a WWE Network documentary Owens talked about going to the stadium and immediately realizing it was something that he had to do. However WWE was forced to move the show last year due to COVID-19 and Owens ended up substituting jumping off a WrestleMania sign inside the WWE Performance Center.

This year WrestleMania will emanate from Raymond James Stadium and Owens told Ryan Satin of FOX that he hasn't abandoned hope of jumping off the pirate ship.

""No I want to do it. I can't promise people that I'm going to do it because you know circumstances and whatever"" he said. ""But I can promise everybody that I'm gonna try as much as possible to do it. I'll do my best. I'll annoy anybody I can. I will get into anyone's ear I possibly can. I will literally do everything in my power to get to the point where I can jump off that ship.

Owens' match for WrestleMania 37 has yet to be determined. He will take place in SmackDown's Elimination Chamber match next weekend.

European retailers are now listing GeForce RTX 3060 graphics cards at 490 EUR.

Retailers offering GeForce RTX 30 graphics cards have now significantly increased pricing on the upcoming model which will be launched on February 25th. According to NVIDIA internal embargo guidelines the manufacturer expects the initial batch of new SKUs to be sold at MSRP. This usually means that retailers who take preorders are expected to fulfill them in a matter of days sometimes weeks but ensuring that the price that was listed at launch has not changed.

Unfortunately we have regularly seen retailers canceling preorders only to force customers to reorder the same card at a significantly higher price. So far NVIDIA has done absolutely nothing to prevent this from happening but technically there is not much it can do except severely limit the supply to said store or distributor in the future.

Meanwhile European retailer ProShop which operates in a number of European countries is already listing the cards at increased prices before anyone even had a chance to order one at MSRP. Proshop now offers GeForce RTX 3060 at 499 EUR or 2799 PLN minimum. Official MSRP in Europe is 329 EUR or 1599 PLN. That’s a 52% and 75% increase over NVIDIA MSRP.

Proshop is not the only store taking advantage of increased demand on the new graphics cards. In fact increased pricing on yet unreleased RTX 3060 graphics cards has been observed in Europe for over a week now. Some retailer such as PCDiga has even increased pricing by nearly 100 EUR in just one week. At this point both RTX 3060 ti and RTX 3060 are listed at almost identical prices.

Zillow said it’s buying ShowingTime for $500 million and will use the company’s technology to make it easier for people to request tours through the Zillow website and app.

ShowingTime has a network of nearly one million agents across North America and has developed relationships with hundreds of Multiple Listing Services (MLSs) Zillow said.

ShowingTime enables real estate agents to post their listings' availability for showings so that agents who represent buyers can schedule home tours online with minimal clicks from their mobile device. Buyers can also use the site to schedule a tour for themselves without the need for an agent.

Bobby Green made weight on Friday for his UFC 258 bout with Jim Miller. Minutes later he collapsed and was in a medical emergency that forced the cancellation of the bout.

Green tipped the scale at 156 pounds with 15 minutes left in the official UFC 258 two-hour weigh-in window. But when the fighters appeared a short time later for their face-offs Green and Miller were surprisingly absent.

Following the face-offs UFC president Dana White met with reporters informing them that Green had collapsed in the back following the weigh-in.

“Bobby Green just collapsed back there. Doctors are looking at him. They’re trying to rehydrate him right now” White said.

At that point it was unclear what would happen to the bout. It was later scrapped from the fight card altogether. A featherweight preliminary bout between Ricky Simon and Brian Kelleher was elevated to the UFC 258 main card.

Late Friday night Green posted to his Instagram account admitting that he has a few ""hills to get over in fighting"" including the weight cut.

He then went on to address the medical issues that plagued him at Friday's weigh-in.

""So to be clear I have air pockets in my lungs I guess and my kidneys failed"" Green wrote.

""I messed my back up in training. I thought it was just pain from that.""

Green gave no indication about his recovery from the medical issues or when he might be able to fight again.

UFC 258 now moves forward as an 11-bout fight card headlined by Kamaru Usman putting his welterweight title on the line opposite former teammate Gilbert Burns.

“We believe in the people and potential of Canton’s Southeast community and know that decent affordable housing can help families and neighborhoods redefine their futures” said Beth Lechner executive director of Habitat for Humanity East Central Ohio. “We are truly humbled that Republic sees Habitat’s work as key to renewing the strength and stability of our Southeast Canton neighborhoods.”

With a nationwide workforce of 36000 employees Republic Services specializes in domestic recycling and non-hazardous solid waste disposal.

As part of the National Neighborhood Promise grant local Republic Services employees will volunteer with a southeast Canton cleanup and beautification project and donate products and services.

""After a year of unprecedented challenges our diverse neighborhoods need support more than ever and we're proud of our continued commitment to creating spaces where people can thrive"" Donald W. Slager chief executive officer of Republic Services said in a statement.

""For three years the Republic Services Charitable Foundation has partnered with proven local organizations to strengthen communities in need by providing support designed to build and support neighborhood revitalization.""

Ward 4 Councilwoman Chris Smith considers herself one of Habitat's biggest cheerleaders.

""I love Habitat; I support anything Beth does especially in the Fourth Ward"" Smith said. ""Habitat brings enlightenment and hope to families. Instead of just a house it's a home. Families can turn a key to a home they someday can call their own. I'm very supportive of Habitat.""

Habitat for Humanity East Central Ohio serves Stark Carroll Tuscarawas Harrison and Jefferson counties. The ministry partners with families to build or improve a place they can call home.

Habitat homeowners help build their own homes alongside volunteers and purchase the homes with an affordable zero-interest mortgage. The local chapter has built nearly 600 new homes since it began in 1988. To learn more visit habitateco.org

In the United States that’s led to a glut in supply and drop in the value of plastic glass and cardboard.

These changes have led San Antonio’s Solid Waste Management Department to shift its messaging when it comes to what people should put in their blue recycling bins according to David Newman the department’s director. The department has revamped its webpage and launched a phone app in the hopes of getting people to focus on disposing only of core products: paper plastic containers aluminum and glass containers.

“Ten years ago we were really pushing people to recycle: ‘Give us as much as you can give us.’” Newman said in a phone interview this month. “Today we’re pushing quality. We’re saying ‘We want your recyclables but we want you to do it correctly.’ We can only take these things that are acceptable in our program and that’s how we sustain the recycling business.”

Bigger changes lie ahead as the City considers what to do about a recycling processing contract that expires in 2024. Local solid waste entrepreneurs say it could be an opportunity to think more broadly about what they call the circular economy where materials formerly seen as waste can be reborn as useful products.

“We can’t recycle our way out of the problem” said Kate Gruy Jaceldo whose Compost Queens business offers organic disposal options for homes and businesses and provides compost in return.

Before 2017 the sales of recyclable material fully offset the cost of processing bottles cans containers cardboard and paper Newman told the City Council’s Committee Health and Equity Committee in October. Now recycling costs the City $13 per ton Newman said.



Fortunately that’s still cheaper than the disposing of waste in a local landfill which costs the City $25 per ton he said. But that could change when the current contract expires in 2024.



Newman said Solid Waste has enough time to carefully weigh three options to process San Antonio’s recycling tonnage:

It could extend its current contract with Republic Services which along with Waste Management is one of the two main players in the North American solid waste industry.

It could put out a request for proposals for a new contractor. Waste Management also owns a processing facility in the San Antonio area and smaller competitors could also see an opportunity to step into a new market.

A third option would be for the City to build its own processing center and either staff it with City employees or contractors Newman said.

“If we were to go with new contractor or build a facility there’s a lot of lead time ahead a couple of years and then we have to go through a whole contracting process” Newman said. “That’s why we’re starting early and at this point that’s three years out.”

Solid Waste officials plan to bring more details to the Community Health and Equity Committee in late March he said.

Asked whether San Antonio residents could see their waste fees go up because of higher recycling costs Newman didn’t rule it out though he said it’s not the main expense in the department’s $150 million budget.

“It’s just a little too early to tell at this point but it is not a dominant factor of our expenses” Newman said.

‘Getting really creative about uses’

Owning its own processing center could offer the City some intriguing opportunities that might be harder to achieve when contracting the work to a third party according to Christopher Moken a former solid waste coordinator with the Alamo Area Council of Governments (AACOG). Working for AACOG which covers a 13-county region Moken got a wide-ranging view of the recycling crisis in the San Antonio region.

“If the City does go the route of doing their own facility that could be very interesting from the point of view of being able to utilize some of the newer technologies out there as far as source-separating materials” Moken said.

Moken described a system in Eskilstuna Sweden where residents separate their waste into seven different color-coded bags and rely on a machine to sort them by sight. The city has been called the “world capital of recycling” and boasts some of the lowest landfill rates on the planet.

The U.S. “really shot itself in the foot” by moving toward commingling its recycling Moken said. Commingling is when all recycled products are collected in one container with the job of separating them shifted to the processing center. The system is more convenient for residents but causes problems with contamination when people mix recyclables and non-recyclable waste.

Ultimately the focus needs to be on the corporations that manufacture the materials in the first place Moken said.

“We really need to be having a conversation about forcing the manufacturers to at least take on some sort of standardization whether it’s the same colors or the same kind of materials and just make it easier for the downstream recyclers and easier for consumers” Moken said.

Moken is the founder of Re-Mat a nonprofit focused on keeping used mattresses out of the landfill. Re-Mat launched two and a half years ago and Moken has struggled to find $100000 in funding and an affordable lease agreement on a 10000-square-foot facility needed to begin recycling up to 20000 mattresses in his first year.

In California Connecticut and Rhode Island legislatures have required mattress manufacturers to pool their resources and create statewide recycling programs. Residents can visit ByeByeMattress.com and find disposal sites near them.

“That unfortunately normally has to happen at a state level” Moken said. “I don’t see that happening anytime soon in Texas which is kind of a shame.”

On a local level Jaceldo said that there’s still “potential for a lot of products to become something else.” City officials could look to the local startup talent base for help she said.

“With all these City tech programs that are building entrepreneurs put them on the waste stream” she said. “We either have to incentivize keeping the materials away [from the waste stream] to begin with or getting really creative about uses.”

Quality over quantity

One sign of changes in recycling is how Solid Waste officials are thinking about the City’s recycling goals.

In October Newman told council members that San Antonio appears to be well short of its 2010 goal of diverting 60 percent of its waste from local landfills by 2025. In the City’s 2020 fiscal year the rate of recycled composted and mulched waste was 36 percent Newman said.



Still that’s far above a former rate of only 7 percent in 2010. Diversion rate might not even be the best way to measure success anymore.

“We know that the 60 percent goal is a good goal it is technically achievable but it would have to be done in a very perfect scenario” Newman said.

For now Solid Waste has shifted emphasis from quantity to quality something that experts say is essential to reduce contamination when the wrong items end up in the recycling stream.

But it’s proven difficult for even the most recycling-savvy to keep track of what’s acceptable. Even Jaceldo whose business involves keeping waste out of landfills admitted she struggles to keep up with exactly what’s recyclable and what’s not.

“I do think whatever they do there needs to be a real information campaign about it” Jaceldo said.

For example Solid Waste’s webpage used to state that residents could put plastic film bags inside other plastic film bags and dispose of them in their blue bins. Another formerly accepted product was clamshell-shaped take-out containers made of white polystyrene foam.

In its new education campaigns and on its webpage of recycled items Solid Waste no longer lists those as accepted items even though Newman said the City’s contract requires Republic to receive them at its processing center.

“It’s technically in our contract for them to accept it and for them to do the best they can to recycle them” Newman said. “But we’re no longer pushing those so you don’t see them advertised.”

There’s also the problem of manufacturers relying on materials that are inherently less recyclable. Speaking to council members Newman used coffee as an example saying its packaging has shifted from highly recyclable aluminum tins to less recyclable plastic cylinders and more recently to foil bags that can only end up in the landfill.

Another example is newspapers driven to near-extinction in the waste stream by the rise of digital media and decline of print journalism.

“It used to be 10 years ago that newspapers which are very heavy made up a big chunk of our recycling” Newman said. “Today you can’t find any newspapers. There are very few there.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMubWFzc2xpdmUuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvbWFzc2xpdmUvbmFtZS9lZHdhcmQta3Vib3NpYWstb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NzIwODc5MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Edward Kubosiak Obituary (2021) - Northampton MA - The Republican,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.masslive.com/us/obituaries/masslive/name/edward-kubosiak-obituary?id=7208790 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMubWFzc2xpdmUuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvbWFzc2xpdmUvbmFtZS9lZHdhcmQta3Vib3NpYWstb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NzIwODc5MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

But having champagne taste on a beer budget I spent years learning where to scratch the itch of getting something really nice but for a lot less. Having lived in both London and Paris and using the Eurostar train between the two cities like a commuter train for shopping day trips I know where to go for the odd designer bargain.

In this list I am sharing my favorite places to look and hunt for bargains. I have tried to provide pairs of similar stores in each city where possible so you can judge where you might want to spend some of your travel budget on your next trip to Europe.

Happy shopping.

Pandora Dress Agency London

Steps away from Harrods you know that anybody leaving their designer labels in Pandora Dress Agency a resale agency has probably only worn the item once. Bursting at the seams with Chanel Hermes Dior Burberry and every other label that comes to mind you can get your hands on a Chanel jacket for less than $2000 or an on-trend Gucci bucket bag for $1000. A fun way of shopping is to go to Harrods look at what the current fashion is then pop across to Pandora and get something similar cheaper. Note that twice a year Pandora has a sale and you can get even better bargains.

Les 3 Marches De Catherine B Paris

Les 3 Marches de Catherine B which is in fact two neighboring boutiques just by the Saint-Germain-des-Pres market is a little treasure trove for anybody coveting Chanel and Hermes. The owner Catherine has an extensive collection of pre-loved bags accessories and clothes from these top labels and you can even get your hand on a Birkin without needing to be a celebrity or spend years on a waiting list. Alas her stuff is not cheap with a basic Birkin starting at around $7200 which is roughly the same as new but the snag here is that if you walk into a Hermes store they will not have a Birkin in stock. Please note that the staff can be somewhat stand-offish — best to just ignore them.

Pro Tip: As will all resale agencies you only get what another customer has brought in. So you might find the perfect item but not in your size or color. Go with an open mind or check out their goods online before you go and call to reserve it if you find perfection.

TKMaxx London

TK Maxx is the British equivalent of TJ Maxx a chain of stores that sells high street and designer at bargain prices. In London there are several stores with my favorites being near Covent Garden on Long Acre as well as on Kensington High Street. Look for the Gold Label for good designer brands such as Armani Ralph Lauren and Joseph but be aware that not all TK Maxx stores offer the designer corner. Also the better the area the better the offerings with the store on Kensington High Street for example regularly having Louis Vuitton bags in stock.

La Piscine Paris

Like TK Maxx La Piscine is a chain of stores in Paris that sells designer labels from boutique closures or end of lines. All new but you never know what you’ll get. One day you find a Dior top; other days Dolce and Gabbana shoes. My favorite stores are at Odeon and on Rue des Francs-Bourgeois in the Marais where you can just pop in before you settle on a café terrace for a coffee.

Pro Tip: In both TK Maxx and La Piscine patience is key. Their supply often gets added to daily and different stores across the city often get slightly different stock. With both having stores across their respective city make a battle plan and while sightseeing plan to walk past a few of the stores dotted around the city and have a quick browse.

The Dresser London (Connaught Village)

The Dresser is a smaller dress agency or resale store near Marble Arch off Oxford Street. It may not specialize on the huge labels but you can still find them and much more in between making it potentially more affordable. Dig deep and you will unearth a Chanel bag but you also find more local labels such as Smythson Mulberry and Bric’s. You will find a lot of London-typical trench coats from Burberry to McQueen which are classics and never go out of fashion. Have a look online first but go in person to double-check that you made the right choice.

Closet2Closet Paris (Marais)

Another smaller depot-vente or re-sale agency in the heart of the Marais Closet2Closet allows you a sneak peek into what Parisiennes have or used to have in their closets — and maybe take it home to yours. While there are plenty of classic staples such as Chanel and Hermes you also find typically Parisian hip labels such as Isabel Marant and Maison Martin Margiela. Their selection of accessories is superb with lovely scarves and custom jewelry to spruce up any outfit.

Pro Tip: As with the above resale stores you have got to go in with an open mind as you don’t get the choices of colors or sizes as you do when buying new. What you do get is a look at what real people are wearing and the opportunity to snap up something no longer available in the shops.

Cancer Research UK London (Marylebone)

In Britain charity shops can be found in every high street and it is worth popping into every single one as you go. This Cancer Research is my personal favorite in my go-to neighborhood of Marylebone. This is an upmarket area so you can be lucky to find some very good labels and quality clothes here. My daughter found her prom dress here and outshone a fair few of her friends who wore new designers and her dress had cost me a mere $30.

Another good charity shop is the British Red Cross in Chelsea.

Emmaus Alternatives Paris

In France charity shops exist but are sadly not as ubiquitous as in the UK. The most commonly found charity store is Emmaus Alternatives. There is an interesting one on the lovely Boulevard Beaumarchais just off Place de la Republique. You can be lucky as I have found a Missoni top there once so do pop in and look through the hanging rails. But quite honestly save the charity-shop shopping for the UK — you will have better chances.

Pro Tip: Location is key when it comes to charity shops: The better the surrounding area the better the castoffs you will find in the shop. People donate close to home and in a big city don’t bother driving further away. So find the most expensive residential area and start searching.

The Bicester Village London

The Bicester Village is an outlet village not far from Oxford and sells last season’s luxury designer wares. With designers such as Armani Balenciaga Mulberry Missoni Stella McCartney Bottega Veneta and more — altogether some 160 boutiques including homewares Bang and Olufsen and kid’s and men’s clothes — you are assured to find something special at prices that are up to 60 percent reduced. My favorite Missoni cushions come from the outlet; otherwise I could never have afforded them.

Get there by train from London Marylebone in 45 minutes.

La Vallee Village Paris

La Vallee Village is the same idea as Bicester Village just in French. A 45-minute train ride from Charles de Gaulle-Etoile on RER A stop at Val d’Europe just before Disneyland Paris and you are in designer heaven. Over 100 labels including names such as Valentino Celine Max Mara Carolina Herrera Burberry Repetto Isabel Marant and even a Tumi luggage outlet to make it easier for you to carry everything home in. There are a couple of cafes for lunch and the village is also attached to a large shopping mall with all the global and French high street stores — plus a large food court so you can really make a day of it. A recent splurge of mine bagged me a Carolina Herrera shirt for a mere $120 reduced from $900 odd.

Pro Tip: These outlet villages not only sell at reduced prices but also have sales. In France the sales are always in January and July while in England the dates differ. Sign up for updates from the villages and then hit them on Monday mornings during the sales for even bigger bargains.",,,,,,,,,,,,
RCL,Royal Caribbean Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlcmFkaW8ubmV0L25hc3NhdS1zYXlzLWNydWlzZS1zaGlwcy1jb3VsZC12aXNpdC1ieS1zcHJpbmctcGVuZGluZy1hcHByb3ZhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nassau: Cruise Ships Might Visit by Spring 2021,"According to Mike Maura the CEO of Nassau’s cruise port ships from both Carnival Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean Group could be doing simulated sailings to the Bahamas in a few months.

“We Are in High Demand”

During an interview with Guardian Business Maura provided a far more detailed update than any given by cruise lines or the Centers for Disease Control. The site reported him as saying that the port has “been in discussions with cruise lines and with the Ministry of Tourism around the possibility of including Nassau in a simulated call.” He added that these sailings could begin within two months. It’s worth noting however that a day after his comments were published both Royal Caribbean Group and Carnival Cruise Line axed all sailings through the end of April.

As part of the current Conditional Sail Order issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention any ship wishing to resume revenue-generating sailings must first take part in simulated sailings designed to test the effectiveness of newly-implemented health and safety protocols.

“It’s tremendously valuable to us as a cruise port operator” he added “because it gives us a chance to test our protocols and tweak what needs to be tweaked and also obviously gives the government… the opportunity to test its protocols.”

While cruise lines have not been particularly forthcoming with information regarding their dealings with the CDC Maura said that things have definitely been progressing. “Over the last six weeks you have far better communication between the individual cruise lines and the CDC” he reported.

He added that the cruise lines have been “cycling their ships into U.S. ports with the purpose of meeting with and complying with the various CDC requirements continuing to make improvements in terms of medical facilities and infrastructures on board the ships as well as onboarding crew.”

Perhaps the biggest surprise to come out of the interview was Maura’s claim that between April and the end of the year Nassau has approximately 950 berth bookings with some looking at overnight stays. “We are in high demand” he said.

So just before we get started within the last 24 hours we had some breaking news from Carnival Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean which we will update you on later in the video.

We’ve also got some big news stories from this week including crew members needing to be vaccinated before returning to the ships a world-first feature revealed from MSC Cruises more cancellations from Carnival cruises to nowhere to continue for Quantum of the Seas and more.

180-Day World Cruise Sells Out in a Single Day!

We get started with this impressive news of Oceania Cruises’ 180-day world cruise selling out in just one day! Who said there is no demand in cruising!

Bookings opened for the public on January 27 2021 and even though these types of sailings usually attract loyal cruisers in this case more than one-third of all bookings came from first-timers and those first booking as an Oceania guest.

The line’s 2023 Around the World in 180 Days voyage is the most extensive and in-depth of any world cruise available. Calling on 96 ports in 33 countries across four continents.

The Insignia cruise ship will sail this dream offering departing San Francisco California on January 15 2023. The 684-passenger vessel will end the cruise back in San Francisco on July 13 2023 and the voyage is costing guests over $41000! Let us know what you think of this and if it’s worth the price in the comments.

More Cancellations for Two Carnival Cruise Ships

Carnival Cruise Line has extended its suspension for just two ships that are based out of Australia. This won’t impact the operations out of the United States but will still have a huge impact on the industry down under.

So Carnival Splendor cruises are now cancelled through 28 June 2021. Previously cruises were suspended through May 19 2021. Carnival Spirit cruises are now cancelled through September 12 2021 and previously they were suspended through June 12 2021.

Carnival Cruise Line has already stated that guests who are impacted by the further cancellations should expect an email very soon about their options. It’s just going to take even longer until resuming cruises safely can happen.

For now cruise ships operating in Australian waters with a passenger capacity of over 100 are banned until March 17 2021.

Quantum of the Seas to Remain in Singapore

Royal Caribbean has announced an extension of Quantum of the Seas‘ season of cruises to nowhere out of Singapore. The island nation is one of the few countries where cruising has been allowed to proceed successfully for the last few months.

Royal Caribbean’s decision was expected as Quantum of the Seas was initially scheduled to reposition to Alaska for the summer season. The cruise line has been exceedingly successful with short ocean cruises from Singapore which are limited to Singapore residents only.

Royal Caribbean has been successfully sailing in Singapore since December 2020 and will continue to do so between March 22 and June 21 2021.

Quantum of the Seas is one of the few cruise ships sailing worldwide and is certainly proving that guests can indeed do cruising safely. The line has introduced some groundbreaking measures to provide guests with peace of mind while sailing.

World’s First Humanoid Robotic Bartender at Sea

I thought Royal Caribbean was the cruise line leading the way with robots! Well MSC Cruises has revealed the world’s first humanoid robotic bartender at sea named Rob!

So Rob will be working very hard at the very futuristic venue MSC Starship Club aboard the MSC Virtusoa which was recently delivered to the cruise line on February 1 2021. The club will have 3D holograms an immersive digital art wall and a 12-seat infinity digital interactive table giving guests the opportunity to explore space with their own personalized galactic tour.

There will be specific vertical digital cockpits where guests can make their orders. Rob will then get to work using all his skills to make the perfect cocktail. He’ll be able to cater to many guests thanks to him being able to speak eight languages.

Rob will be able to showcase his dance moves along with telling people jokes riddles and space trivia offering a witty bar experience just like with a real bartender.

The MSC Starship Club has been a concept that’s been in the making for almost six years. The cruise line has been pushing the boundaries and innovations to make it a reality. MSC Virtuosa will begin sailing this April in the Mediterranean.

Royal Caribbean Crew Member Vaccine Requirement

Royal Caribbean has confirmed that crew members will need to be vaccinated before going back to work on the cruise ship. In a letter recently sent to the crew members the company speaks about the new opportunities the vaccine offers for them to go back to work as well as offer protection to their family and the guests onboard.

There is as yet very little known how the cruise company will be administering the thousands of crew members with the vaccine. The process will likely be different depending on where each crew member lives when they are supposed to be boarding and most importantly when ships will be allowed to sail.

Royal Caribbean has said it will continue to update its crew members with the necessary information and has asked for patience to go through the details.

No updates yet on guests needing to be vaccinated. A lot of it depends on the CDC and the requirements needed for the Conditional Sailing Order.

Royal Caribbean Not to Cancel Canada Sailings

Staying with Royal Caribbean it has just come out that the cruise line will not be canceling any of its Canada sailings including departures from the country port visits and cruises to Alaska.

The cruise line says it is working through potential options with the Government of Canada and the USA and the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA). For now the cruise line is asking guests to keep their bookings until an alternative solution is completed. Canada announced recently that cruise ships are banned from its waters for one year.

Carnival Options on Longer Sailings

And we end with a huge development from Carnival Cruise Line. New options have been detailed for those who have a booking on a cruise which is 8-days or longer. A letter has been sent out which details two options.

Option 1 lets guests maintain their exiting booking while the cruise line continues to explore options on the longer sailings. Guests will automatically receive a $100 onboard credit should the voyage still go ahead.

If that cruise is eventually cancelled and guests have not yet received the enhanced value offer they can instead take advantage of what other guests can receive on other sailings during the suspension of operations.

For option 2 guests may choose to cancel their booking any time by March 31 2021 and receive a full refund. The future cruise credit and onboard credit if any can be retained as long as the next cruise is booked by September 30 2021 for a cruise that departs by April 30 2023.

This provides peace of mind for those who were worried about the longer sailings. In November 2020 Carnival announced that cruises over seven days through October 31 2021 were to be temporarily removed as a precaution and while dealing with resolving the details with the CDC.

The marketing event now in its 39th edition is traditionally held during January but due to the impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on travel and in-person events the event will take place in an online environment from May 11-14 2021.

Vanessa Ledesma acting Director General and CEO of the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association (CHTA) which hosts the annual gathering confirmed that Marketplace organizers are crafting an agenda that will allow participants more time to engage with tour operators travel advisors partners trade and consumer media and influencers to network showcase and sell their destinations and services.

Although not meeting face-to-face is a major change for CHTA’s marquis event Ledesma is confident that participating in what has become one of the region’s most highly anticipated travel tourism and hospitality events will deliver countless benefits to attendees. “This virtual edition of Marketplace provides access to the world with no restrictions and opens the event to a broader audience as the logistics of travel are removed thereby facilitating further connectivity and networking” she said encouraging would-be participants to take full advantage of the robust line-up of events and offerings.

Major destination partnership opportunities are also being developed: “There will be pre-Marketplace components that will help global buyers to gain a better understanding of the destinations and suppliers and to receive briefings on entry requirements and safety protocols” advised Ledesma.

In its virtual format Caribbean Travel Marketplace which typically lasts for just over two days will be presented over the course of four days in May. According to Ledesma: “It’s longer than usual because the online format allows us to incorporate supplemental elements without impacting the core buying and selling appointments.”

In preparing for its inaugural online format the Caribbean Travel Marketplace task force reviewed feedback from attendees of previous Marketplace events and analyzed other virtual events to incorporate best practices. The show will seek to maximize attendees’ time and avoid long hours spent in front of a computer screen. Events will be scheduled to accommodate the participation of delegates located in multiple time zones and will allow for more than one representative per company at pre-scheduled appointments.

“We are excited about the opportunity to develop and execute an event that is representative of our diverse culture and legendary hospitality. Caribbean Travel Marketplace has been a groundbreaker in its 39 years having held some of the most iconic and memorable events in the region. We are ready to showcase the region and our diverse product offerings to the world virtually” Ledesma noted.

She also confirmed the launch of “CHTA: Forward Together” the association’s membership drive which highlights the myriad benefits of membership in the organization that represents and promotes the interests of the private sector of the most significant economic driver in the Caribbean. The Forward Together campaign highlights the association’s powerful advocacy its hallmark Caribbean Travel Marketplace the Resilience Series Caribbean Hospitality Industry Exchange Forum (CHIEF) Taste of the Caribbean and Health Training Series.",,,,,,

But when ""roast master"" Jeff Ross said a joke about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft Brady seemed quick to shut it down.

During Ross’s joke presentation he mentioned Brady being taken 199th overall in the NFL Draft and he said he walked into Kraft’s office to tell him something.

""’I’m the best decision your organization has ever made’"" Ross said.

But Ross wasn’t done.

""’Would you like a massage?’"" he said.

WARNING: VIDEO BELOW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

The Los Angeles Forum was a mixture of laughs and groans as Ross poked fun at a serious charge that Kraft had faced in early 2019.

In February 2019 Kraft was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors that included a secret video recording in the spas’ lobbies and rooms. Police said the recordings showed Kraft and other men engaging in sex acts with women and paying them.

Kraft would plead not guilty to the charge issued a public apology in March 2019 and would be cleared of a soliciting sex charge in 2020.

Brady turned toward Ross once the joke was said and as Ross looked over at Kraft in the crowd Brady came into frame and tried to whisper something to Ross. But it was caught by a microphone.

""Don’t say that s--- again"" he said quickly to Ross who acknowledged it with a laugh.

Brady likely knew there were going to be some things said that he might not like but he seemed to want the subject of the jokes to stay with him not his former owner.

One Saturday last month several dozen members of the Alaskan Independence Party a small largely unknown political group whose primary goal is to put Alaskan secession from the United States to a vote gathered in Fairbanks for their biennial convention.

Among the topics of conversation: whether to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president.

The party ultimately rejected Kennedy who is running as an independent after a few outspoken members said they did not want him atop their 2024 ticket according to John Howe the party's chairman who was involved in the discussions.

""There was serious consideration"" Howe a machine shop owner told ABC News.

The decision to pass on Kennedy was seen as a blow to the candidate -- ""They wanted us to put him on the ballot"" Howe said -- as Kennedy works to overcome the biggest obstacle to his plans to run as a major outside candidate in November: getting on the ballot across the country.

Typically independent candidates must undergo the painstaking expensive process of gathering thousands of signatures from registered voters in each state in order to qualify for ballot access.

But a candidate can bypass those requirements if a political party that already has ballot access in a given state nominates them to lead their ticket there.

Kennedy has successfully employed that strategy in Michigan and California where he will technically appear on the ballot as the nominee for the Natural Law Party of Michigan and the American Independent Party of California.

What's more his campaign has been in contact with minor parties in at least six other states too ABC News has learned through conversations with leaders in more than a dozen minor parties across the country. (The Kennedy campaign did not return requests for comment for this story or respond to the details that the party leaders provided.)

""As the campaign sees and recognizes that these are very convenient vessels out there it's a clever move and it's not a surprise they do it"" Derek Muller a University of Notre Dame professor specializing in election law told ABC News.

Early polling of the 2024 race suggests Kennedy could take a notable amount of support in a close race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden the two leading candidates -- if Kennedy makes it on the ballot. A new ABC News/Ipsos survey of adults found Kennedy with 12% in a hypothetical five-way election with Trump Biden and two other candidates Cornel West and Jill Stein.

Kennedy's campaign claims to have made it on the ballot in 10 states so far including the battlegrounds of Michigan Nevada and North Carolina. Elections offices in three states have confirmed to ABC News that Kennedy is on the ballot. In other states officials have said they can't yet confirm his candidacy.

Kennedy's strategy of linking with minor parties has encountered both challenges and success. In some cases like Alaska the parties have rejected him while in others they are actively speaking with his campaign about nominating him.

His campaign tried and failed to earn the nomination of the Unity Party of Colorado which chose instead to back West another independent candidate Tijani Cole the party's chairman told ABC News in an email.

The Alliance Party a national group with ballot access in South Carolina has been more receptive.

""National Alliance Party leadership has begun early conversations with the campaign for potential mutual support"" Phil Feuhrer the party's national co-vice chair told ABC News in an email.

Besides nominating Kennedy to lead the party’s ticket in South Carolina Feuhrer said the party is discussing helping the Kennedy campaign gather signatures across Minnesota to appear as an independent candidate there.

""If we reach full agreement with the campaign and our internal statewide leadership teams it would include placement onto the South Carolina ballot as well as the Minnesota Independence-Alliance taking lead on placing the campaign onto the Minnesota ballot"" Feuhrer added using the official name of Minnesota's branch of the party.

""Those conversations are young and still ongoing"" he said.

Kennedy's camp is also in talks with the Reform Party which has ballot access in Florida and Mississippi according to party leaders.

Jenniffer Desatoff the party's Florida chair told ABC News they are ""continuing communication with the Kennedy campaign at this time."" (Kennedy's campaign also contacted the Ecology Party of Florida but was informed the party does not have a ballot line in the presidential race the party's chair Cara Campbell told ABC News.)

Elsewhere the Kennedy campaign twice reached out to representatives of the Constitution Party which has ballot access in nearly a dozen states but the party and the campaign were never able to connect Donna Ivanovich a spokeswoman for the party told ABC News.

Meanwhile Kennedy has formed a party of its own We the People to secure ballot access in several states including in Delaware Hawaii and North Carolina. In those states the signature threshold to make the ballot is lower for candidates aligned with a party than for independent candidates.

Although other independent candidates ally with minor parties for ballot access -- like West is also doing in the 2024 race -- the breadth and ""coordination"" of Kennedy's effort stands out said Muller the Notre Dame election law expert.

""You usually don't see this kind of coordination and effort because the candidacies are usually not serious enough to make the outreach to all these parties in all these different states"" he told ABC News.

But by aligning himself with small often niche parties Kennedy risks absorbing the burden of their sometimes checkered history some observers warned.

The American Independent Party of California which nominated Kennedy last month had backed George Wallace the former Alabama governor and notorious segregationist in the 1960s.

In a video announcing his nomination Kennedy acknowledged the party's past support for Wallace but said it ""has had its own rebirth even before I came along.""

""It's been reborn as a party that represents not bigotry and hatred but rather compassion unity idealism and common sense"" he said.

Another problem with wooing minor parties is that Kennedy's beliefs sometimes don't align with theirs.

The members of the Alaskan Independence Party who rejected Kennedy as the party's nominee were wary he would agree with them on their view that government-owned land should be given back to Alaskans Howe the party chairman told ABC News.

But Kennedy's chances at winning the nomination may have sunk days before the convention when he failed to win over the previous chair of the Alaskan Independence Party Bob Bird in a radio interview with Bird.

""The AIP will not be placing RFK on the ballot"" Bird wrote in a column after the interview casting Kennedy as an outsider.

""Our liberty and prosperity must come from within ourselves"" Bird wrote ""not from a knight galloping in from the Lower 48.""

“I made a boo-boo” Jeffrey S. McConney admitted when describing the erroneous math he scribbled on “TRUMP” corporate letterhead.

The former Trump Organization controller testified about the notes he took during a January 2017 meeting that laid out how the family real estate company was going to surreptitiously reimburse attorney Michael Cohen for fronting the $130000 that silenced the porn star Stormy Daniels. That payment kept her from going public about her decade-old one-night stand with Trump in the days before the 2016 presidential election.

The farce was laid out in black and white with handwritten notes explaining the fuzzy math at play.

Cohen would be paid $180000 which was doubled on paper so that it would make up for the roughly 50 percent taxes the Midtown Manhattan resident would have to pay in federal state and city taxes. McConney wrote “180000 x 2 for taxes” in black pen on the bright white paper. On the witness stand he admitted the company was fine having it “grossed up” to ensure Cohen got his proper share.

The sham continued when tallying up Cohen’s bonus. Initially $50000 was marked as “paid to Red Finch for tech services” but that seemed to morph instead to mean $60000 for Cohen himself.

“Michael was complaining that his bonus wasn’t large enough. This was to make up for whatever he thought he was owed” McConney testified.

The total $420000 was then divided by 12 so that Cohen would get $35000 each month for a year. McConney’s notes of that meeting included a mention that stated “Mike to invoice us” the genesis of what prosecutors say would later be Cohen invoices for fake legal work that Trump gladly paid to keep the hush money deal under wraps.

Monday’s testimony also connected Trump directly to the process a major step forward in the case. Prosecutors showed jurors a copy of a March 28 2017 email in which McConney wrote “I’ll check status tomorrow. DJT needs to sign check.”

On the stand McConney explained that authorizing the money transfers would require having someone actually go to the White House have the then-president of the United States approve the payment himself—while he was president.

But in an instance that exemplifies the lack of intellectual rigor involved in this operation at least one of those checks disappeared on its way back north from Washington to New York City.

After three monthly payments to Cohen in January February and March McConney asked an employee in the Trump Organization accounting department Deborah Tarasoff to cancel a check cut in April that didn’t return.

“It looks like we never got a check back from the White House. It got lost somebody couldn’t find it. I guess it’s the same as lost” he testified.

Paperwork showed that after $105000 was paid by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust the bean counters back in Manhattan realized it would be easier to run the next $315000 in payments through Trump’s personal accounts for the rest of the year.

Matt Colangelo a prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office meticulously went through each of Cohen’s 12 invoices. Every month in 2017 Cohen would email Allen Weisselberg a disgraced accountant who was then the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer but has since been convicted of tax fraud and spent three months at New York’s dreaded Rikers Island jail. Cohen would deliver a curt greeting—mentioning some summer fun a hurricane hitting Weisselberg’s Florida home Thanksgiving the winter holidays—then get right down to business.

“Pursuant to the retainer agreement kindly remit payment for services rendered” Cohen would email Weisselberg each time proudly signing his emails: “Michael D. Cohen Esq. Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”

One by one Colangelo went over every monthly email attached invoice forwarded Weisselberg email and McConney’s copy over to Tarasoff. By the time they got to September McConney was starting to wear down.

“$35000” he said sounding increasingly tired of answering why he knew how much to pay despite there not being any dollar figure on the invoice for supposed legal work. The answer was always the same: that first meeting in January 2017.

“It’s an invoice from Michael Cohen” he groaned when discussing the October paperwork.

When Colangelo asked him to read the email McConney let out a mild whine. “The whole thing?” he asked.

“Why don’t we just do the body this time” Colangelo acquiesced.

The internal Trump corporate emails showed how invoices made their way from Cohen to Weisselberg to McConney to Tarasoff. And the chain would generally end the same way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDYvYXJ0cy9kZXNpZ24vaGFtbWVyLW11c2V1bS1hbm4tcGhpbGJpbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Who's Who of L.A.'s Art World Bids Farewell to a Champion,"The actor Owen Wilson chatted with the artist Ed Ruscha.

In order to achieve success companies must adapt to handling their data much like a commodity by trading and earning a profit off of it. Data is especially valuable when it comes to artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms due to its ability to provide value that enables new AI use cases.

In order for a marketplace to be successful it is essential to take into account scalability quality and price of data. This is where blockchain technology comes in where it will able to provide marketplaces with low infrastructure costs. Data is valuable and blockchains are able to provide the infrastructure that allows transactions to be economical while promoting privacy which has become one of the most important aspects of selling and using data.

Blockchain is going to change data marketplaces

Last September Snowflake became the biggest software IPO to date while Salesforce having been around for much longer has been public since 2004. Because Salesforce has been around for decades its foray into blockchain was almost obvious — a company must adapt to technology advancements to hold its place at the top. Salesforce currently uses blockchain as a low-code platform that allows organizations to share verified distributed data sets across a trusted network of partners and third parties. By adopting blockchain technology Salesforce and Snowflake enable companies to create blockchain networks workflows and apps that deliver new customer experiences.

Technology is always evolving and moving forward never backward so these companies will need to continue to stay aware of trends and innovations in the blockchain ecosystem in order to remain competitive. Gartner predicted that “by 2021 90% of current enterprise blockchain platform implementations will require replacement within 18 months” to stay relevant. This is important to understand because the world is producing more data than ever before due to the adoption of the Internet of Things AI and the digitization of everyday life.

The data collected through our smartphones laptops and watches is naturally more complex and specific than ever before which will help companies make more informed decisions and increase efficiency and profitability. It makes sense that in the future technology will be advancing rapidly and needing replacements more frequently.

How AI and blockchain technology will change data marketplaces

To further advancements in technology through blockchain and AI there are companies that offer autonomous economic agents to help facilitate company decision making. These agents are able to work autonomously on a customer’s behalf and conduct economic transactions to make decisions easier. Customers not only purchase and exchange value sets but they can also use those data sets to train their own AI.

These AI prediction models are able to accumulate relevant and anonymized data. When a company buys and obtains data it is able to effectively train its model which it can then use to make more accurate predictions which can be used across any industry providing tremendous value that would otherwise not be possible without AI.

Blockchain enabling data monetization

Although data monetization has been around for quite a while and is clearly on track to continue to innovate and put money in pockets it has also suffered from poor interoperability problems with data pricing and privacy concerns with a lack of control over ownership. The answer to these impediments is simply the widespread adoption of blockchain technology.

By uniting blockchain and artificial intelligence the capability of building AI models on top of data without risking privacy would be available not only to organizations and companies but also to individuals. According to MarketsandMarkets the consumer data monetization market is expected to have grown to more than $6 billion by 2025. This fast-growing market touches countless industries and plays a huge part in the growth and future of technology.

Utilizing the power of blockchain to unlock the value of data in a decentralized setting will transcend the data market industry bringing security and transparency to transactions and easing both the consumer and the company experience. While data is now as valuable as gold or oil privacy is a new valuable digital commodity as well meaning the future of our world may no longer lie in tangible offerings.

Filter is the latest restaurant from Kyler Smith who already owns The Sauce in University Heights and Downtown.

Filter Filter plans to move into the ground level of the Perry-Payne building blocks away from Sherwin-Williams' new HQ.

Filter will go into the ground floor of the historic Perry-Payne Building where Take 5 Rhythm and Jazz used to be.

""The name 'Filter' comes with a visual dining experience where a lot of Instagram-able moments will happen"" Smith said.

Filter Renderings show what the inside of Filter could eventually look like.

He says he’s adapting the idea from destinations he’s seen in Miami and Los Angeles with curated locations inside the venue to encourage people to post their experience to social media essentially working as free marketing for the restaurant.

“Just around the city it’s going to be that place that you want to go because it’s going to be popular” Smith said.

Filter Filter is designed to inspire customers to share their experiences on social media essentially working as free marketing for the venue.

The Perry-Payne Building was built in the late 1800s and was office space for more than a century. In 2021 it has apartments upstairs with retail space on the ground floor. It’s around the corner from the Warehouse District and it’s just about a block away from the open parking lots where Sherwin Williams plans on constructing its new Downtown Headquarters.

That puts a lot of potential customers just a few blocks away from his doorstep at Downtown Cleveland.

Filter Filter's design is inspired by venues Smith came across in Miami and Los Angeles.

“I’m building it for the everyday person that wants to sit down have a good meal and it’s going to be affordable” said Smith. “We’re going to have a $25 dish a $30 dish.”

That’s why Smith says even though most people are waiting for a COVID-19 vaccine in Ohio and across the nation he’s launching a new restaurant.

Filter Smith says social-distancing and COVID precautions can be built into Filter because it's being constructed while the pandemic is happening.

“Even during the pandemic it still doesn’t scare me because I know people are itching to get out” Smith said.

While other businesses have to adjust to new regulations he says his build out is addressing COVID-19 protocol already including garage doors that will open out to the street improving air flow.

Filter Renderings show what the inside of Filter could eventually look like.

“We could actually build for [the pandemic]” said Smith. “So we already have the social-distancing dividers we’re already doing the garage doors.

Smith plans to open to the public around Memorial Day with a soft opening a few weeks before.

Bridgeworks Update

New renderings show that the residential/retail/hotel space planned for the corner of West 25th Street and Detroit Avenue look considerably different from the original plan.

Panzica and GRAMMAR New renderings show the hotel piece of Bridgeworks on top of the residential units. Previous plans had the apartments closer to West 25th and the hotel tucked behind the apartments.

The updated plans show the hotel space on top of the residential units with that extensive structure situated about 123 feet off of West 25th Street.

Panzica and GRAMMAR The new structure would be about 200 feet tall but would be set back from West 25th Street by about 123 feet.

One of the big criticisms from the Landmarks Commission was about the height of the building in the original plans and how close it was to West 25th Street. Setting it back so far off the corner appears to be an attempt to address those concerns.

Panzica and GRAMMAR The corner of West 25th Street and Detroit Avenue will remain accessible to the public.

Bridgeworks will be presenting at Ohio City Design Review on Feb. 18th.

Irishtown Bend Update

The ""Big 8"" building is completely gone. It's the first building to come down as part of the demolition for the Irishtown Bend project.

Kevin Barry The ""Big 8"" building is completely gone along West 25th Street after being demolished this week as part of the Irishtown Bend project.

Progressive Field is now visible from the sidewalk on the other side of West 25th Street.

1. Brave Ground

Brave Ground paired with ochre for a warm inviting kitchen.

Described as a warm natural and neutral shade that reconnects us to nature and the simple things Brave Ground from Dulux’s Colour Futures 2021 is its Colour of the Year. It chose this shade after months of working with paint company AkzoNobel trend forecasters design specialists editors and architects from across the globe.

The colour in the bedroom with a bright yellow accent.

“Empowering and earthy the colour provides a firm foundation for living” says Oscar Wezenbeek managing director of AkzoNobel Decorative Paints in South-East & South Asia about the psychological effect of the colour. “Evoking a sense of security growth and potential it helps create environments that give us the courage to embrace change.”

It also goes well with the living room plants.

A neutral shade like Brave Ground can play the leading role and the supporting role in our space. Dulux has curated four complementary palettes to bring out its different qualities.

The energising Expressive colour palette pairs the colour with reds and pinks. Trust offers tone-on-tone companion neutrals like clay and chalk. Timeless injects contemporary freshness by pairing it with yellows and ochres. Finally Earth puts it with the cool shades of the sea sky and forest to bring out its restorative effect.

2. Urbane Bronze

American paint company Sherwin-Williams’ 2021 Colour of the Year Urbane Bronze SW7048 is a sophisticated grey with a bronze undertone.

“Urbane Bronze is a comforting colour drawing from nature for a feeling of relaxation and serenity” says Sue Wadden director of colour marketing. “There’s also reassurance in its sentimentality with nostalgic ties to the designs of the ’70s and ’90s but with grey undertones that give it a distinctly modern twist” she adds.

“Urbane Bronze is just one more way to bring in nature through design and is a great colour to accentuate window trim columns and accent walls in commercial spaces. It works well with other elements of biophilic design including large light-filled spaces and indoor greenery.” SUE WADDEN SHERWIN-WILLIAMS

Hailed as the new neutral Urbane Bronze’s anchoring quality conveys a sense of comfort at home. Sherwin-Williams recommends pairing it with natural materials like timber stone or woven textiles for a textured interior that goes well with large windows and biophilic elements.

Urbane Bronze adds intimacy to the bedroom.

Match this colour with other warm neutrals such as off-whites for an updated take on minimalism. Or add greens for a modern take on nostalgic retro ’70s feel.

Urbane Bronze also makes the green of plants pop.

3. Gentle Whisper & Smooth Sailing

Nippon Paint has curated four palettes for Asia. In Singapore it has observed that there is a preference for a muted colour palette called Gentle Whisper from which the soft blue Smooth Sailing BGG 1565 P is its Colour of the Year 2021.

Smooth Sailing introduces calmness to a room.

“As the name suggests we hope for smooth sailing this year” says the Nippon Paint team. The Gentle Whisper palette comprises soothing pastels including muted pink with a beige undertone and grey and blue enhanced by matte silver and frost.

The palette allows us to introduce colour into a room while achieving the same spaciousness generated by an all-white space but with an added breezy and cooling effect. It also helps to create sanctuary-like spaces.

A bedroom awash in Gentle Whisper’s shades of beige.

Nippon Paint recommends keeping to a maximum of three colours in a room – a primary hue such as Smooth Sailing on about 60 per cent of the surfaces and two accent shades.

4. Ultimate Gray & Illuminating

Provider of professional colour standards Pantone has picked not one but two Colour(s) of the Year 2021: Pantone 17-5104 Ultimate Gray a medium-toned grey and Pantone 13-0647 Illuminating a soft sunshiny yellow.

Ultimate Grey

Illuminating

Says Leatrice Eiseman executive director of the Pantone Colour Institute the colour pairing aims to highlight how different elements come together “to express a message of strength and hopefulness that is both enduring and uplifting”.

Leatrice Eiseman

“The union of an enduring Ultimate Gray with the vibrant yellow Illuminating expresses a message of positivity supported by fortitude. Practical and rock solid but at the same time warming and optimistic this is a color combination that gives us resilience and hope. We need to feel encouraged and uplifted this is essential to the human spirit.”

LEATRICE EISEMAN PANTONE COLOUR INSTITUTE

Although presented as a pair Ultimate Gray and Illuminating need not be used in equal proportions. Either can take precedence says Pantone. The two make a great combination to set the mood anywhere at home by adding a dose of sunshine and positivity.

Grey and yellow are perfect for homewares too.

Adding yellow accents in a mostly grey room infuses vitality and liveliness. A bright yellow front door for instance conveys a warm welcome amidst the solid dependable grey exterior finishes.

The colour pairing trend in fashion translates well for sportswear.

Flip the ratio for a bright yellow room with a grey accent that lends a grounding and stately touch.

Whether your work regularly involves handling several application windows and multiple virtual desktops at once or you want to go back and forth between select programs on your Windows 10 PC Task View and Aero Snap are essential tools.

Recommended Videos

Aero Snap is an easy way to arrange any open windows on your desktop with your keyboard mouse or the Snap Assist function and has been around in various forms since Windows Vista. Task View is a quick way to create virtual desktops to simplify and organize your applications and then quickly select the one you want to work with and configure multitasking functions and review document and program activity from the last 30 days.

Windows Aero Snap and how to use it

Aero Snap (shortened to “Snap” in later Windows documentation) allows you to drag windows to the sides or corners of your screen and they will change size automatically. Most Snap functions are available using either the mouse touchscreen or keyboard with some being restricted to just one.

The settings can be toggled to let users decide whether using Snap shows which other windows can be snapped if adjacent windows will be automatically resized and whether Snap will make windows adjust to fill available space. To adjust your Snap options open Settings select System and click on Multitasking.

How to Snap with the mouse Click on the title bar of the window you want to snap and move the window to the edge of your screen. You will see an outline that indicates where the window will snap to. Dragging the window to either side of your screen will snap it to the left or right portion of the monitor.

How to Snap with the keyboard Click on the window you want to snap. Once selected selecting the Windows Logo Key + Left Arrow will snap that window to the left of your screen. Likewise using Windows Logo Key + Right Arrow will snap the selected window to the right. Snaps can also be moved into corners after being snapped by choosing the window and pressing the Windows Logo Key + Up Arrow or the Windows Logo Key + Down Arrow to shift it to your desired corner. After the window has been snapped to a corner it will take up a quarter of the screen which is the smallest area possible for snaps. The Windows Logo Key + Arrow Keys can then be used to move the window wherever it is needed.

How to Snap with Snap Assist

If you’ve snapped a window but still have a large amount of space available on your screen the Snap Assistant will appear. If you have multiple windows open they will be displayed as thumbnails in the available area. In the remaining space on your screen select the thumbnail of the window you want to open. Side-by-side windows can be adjusted at the same time by clicking the dividing line and dragging the mouse. Releasing the mouse will resize the second window to match the first and fill any remaining screen space.

If you have two windows displayed side by side you can resize both windows simultaneously by selecting and dragging the dividing line.

Resize the window on one side to the size you want it to be and then release the mouse button. The other window will resize itself to fit alongside the first one so you won’t have any empty screen space.

Windows Task View and how to use it

By default Windows 10 has the Task View button enabled on the taskbar to the search button’s right. (If you don’t see it right-click the taskbar then click Show Task View Button.) You can also activate Task View by pressing Win + Tab on your keyboard. This keyboard shortcut will work whether or not the Task View button is currently visible.

When Task View launches it will show you all the windows on your desktop whether they’re minimized or maximized. If you’re using multiple monitors the windows on each monitor will appear grouped on each screen. Click on any window to bring it to the front and make it active.

How to use virtual desktops

Task View is also where you access Windows 10’s virtual desktop feature. Any windows opened on this desktop won’t be visible on the first one.

Multiple desktops are a great way to separate tasks — you can use one for work items and one for personal stuff and separate individual applications for ease of use. You can create dozens of virtual desktops but you probably won’t need more than two or three and they become difficult to manage if you have too many.

To close a virtual desktop click the X button above it in Task View. You can also create a new virtual desktop with the keyboard shortcut Win + Ctrl + D or close the current one with Win + Ctrl + F4. To switch between virtual desktops (in the same order as on the Task View bar) press Win + Ctrl + Left or Right.

To move an open window from one virtual desktop to another open Task View with the button or Win + Tab command then click and drag one of the small window icons to another desktop in the row at the bottom of the screen.

Task View Timeline and how it works

Introduced with the April 2018 Windows 10 update Timeline allows you to scroll through any live tasks such as documents or program activity and also records Windows 10 sessions that you’ve logged into for the last 30 days. Recorded events from the Timeline’s history can be quickly selected and opened allowing you to continue earlier tasks with ease.

It is worth noting that unless you choose otherwise Timeline will also send Microsoft information about your device’s activity history. To adjust the settings of this new feature go to Settings > Privacy > Activity History.

AeroSnap + Task View for smooth multitasking

When checking out the AeroSnap feature above you may have noticed that the Task View automatically appears when you snap a window to the right or left side of the screen. This automatic Task View only lasts until you make another click then disappears. If you click any of the window icons in Task View immediately after snapping another window it will automatically fill the space on the opposite side of the screen. It’s a great way to quickly compare the contents of two windows at the same time.

By Maria Saporta

The optics were not good.

Norfolk Southern Atlanta’s newest Fortune 500 company was bulldozing on the land that once housed the Chattahoochee Brick Co. a company that manufactured millions of bricks that helped in the building of Atlanta by using convict labor and many workers died on the site. That history came to light in 2009 in the Pulitzer Prize-winning book – “Slavery by Another Name” – Doug Blackmon.

The land currently is owned by Lincoln Energy Solutions which planned to build a fuel terminal with mega oil tanks but it ran into community and city government opposition. Lincoln was denied permits to build out the fuel terminal so it filed a lawsuit in 2016. But for unexplained reasons it withdrew its lawsuit one week before the hearing was scheduled.

The community found out last year that Lincoln had leased the 75-acre site to Norfolk Southern which has special development powers awarded to railroads. It appeared Norfolk Southern would be able to develop the property into a rail transfer facility without having to go through all the regulatory hurdles.

Needless to say residents in nearby communities felt Lincoln and Norfolk Southern had done an “end run” to develop the project despite widespread opposition.

A community protest was held Feb. 9 with several of Atlanta’s best-known activists including Derrick Boazman a former Atlanta City Councilman.

“This is a crime scene” Boazman said about the horrendous history of Chattahoochee Brick while announcing a “Stop Norfolk Southern Coalition” that includes the Concerned Black Clergy the Rainbow Coalition and NAACP.

“What is happening here is an injustice and economic injustice because Norfolk Southern is benefiting from our tax money to do this” said Vincent Fort a former state Senator of the local tax breaks Norfolk Southern had received to move its headquarters to Atlanta from Norfolk Va. “More than anything else it is a moral injustice. We cannot say that Black lives matter and allow Norfolk Southern to build on the bodies of Black men.”

The optics looked bad for Norfolk Southern. The company which is building its headquarters in a new tower in Midtown prides itself on being a good corporate citizen.

Three days after the protest Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms issued a statement saying she was “seeking to stop development of a fuel terminal” by filing for a preliminary injunction with the Surface Transportation Board which regulates railroads.

“Our Administration will do everything it can to protect the sanctity and significance of this property” Bottoms said in a news release. “A site of such historic and environmental importance needs careful consideration before even limited development occurs.”

On Saturday Norfolk Southern issued its own statement. It said it “will stop work on the site immediately while we engage in further discussions with the City.” (See the full statements from the city and Norfolk Southern below).

Hallelujah!

We now have an opportunity for a reset.

The 75-acre site is not only historically significant it is also environmentally significant.

It sits at the confluence of Proctor Creek and the Chattahoochee River inside I-285 near Bolton Road. For years community leaders and environmental organizations have wanted the property to be part of a Chattahoochee River Park. The idea gained traction when the city did a master plan on how the river could become a public amenity with multiuse trails running along the river. The city even tried unsuccessfully to buy the Chattahoochee Brick land.

Doug Blackmon author of “Slavery by Another Name” also believes we need to preserve the site as a historical reminder of one of Atlanta’s ugliest past. Blackmon describe the site as a place where “people were starved to death worked to death and whipped to death” while working as free prison labor. The plant originally was built by James English who served as Atlanta’s mayor from 1881 to 1883.

“There’s no doubt a substantial number of people died at Chattahoochee Brick and were buried there” said Blackmon who would like Norfolk Southern to be transparent in any archeological studies that it conducts on the property. “But it doesn’t really matter whether there are bones in the ground. We need to remember places where horrifying things were done by other human beings. We need to remember that even if there are no bones in the ground.”

Jeff DeGraff manager of media relations for Norfolk Southern said the railroad plans to build a memorial to acknowledge the site’s history.

“We were aware of some of the issues with the site” DeGraff said in an interview before the company decided to stop work on the project. “The parcel itself is uniquely situated for us. It’s adjacent to our main line. It is already in an industrial area. It’s sitting vacant. It’s being adjacent to I-285 is ideal.”

Norfolk Southern was planning to develop the property as transfer facility to better serve its customers including Lincoln. It also expected to expand services to other customers who would offload their products such as other commodities on the site.

“We can assure you that this is a Norfolk Southern project to benefit our customers” DeGraff said. “This is an opportunity for us. This is not an end run around.”

But the site is also an opportunity for Atlanta to be reimagined in a new way – much as the Atlanta BeltLine is transforming a circular rail corridor into one of the most successful urban redevelopment initiatives in the country.

The Chattahoochee Brick is a once-in-a-life opportunity to open up the Chattahoochee River as a place that welcomes Atlantans to enjoy the riverfront. If the site is fully redeveloped for industrial purposes that opportunity will be lost.

“From my perspective the historical and environmental issues are real” Blackmon said. “We have an obligation to acknowledge what happened. This should be a time for Atlanta to have an open conversation of what this place means in our history. These ugly things in the past are central to our story of how our city became a great city. This place was central to the creation of modern Atlanta.”

I do not know whether there’s the possibility to find a middle ground between Norfolk Southern’s desire to build a transfer facility and the vision to create a Chattahoochee River Park on land that would also include a significant historical memorial detailing what happened on the site.

But I do know the Chattahoochee Brick property gives Norfolk Southern an opportunity to demonstrate whether it will be a model corporate citizen in Atlanta.



City of Atlanta’s Feb. 12 statement on Chattahoochee Brick Company Property:

City files petition to protect historic site and Chattahoochee River water supply.

ATLANTA—The City of Atlanta filed a Petition for Preliminary Injunction with the Surface Transportation Board seeking to stop development of a fuel terminal on a property that was the former location of the Chattahoochee Brick Company. This property is located on the Chattahoochee River just north and west of Bolton Road.

“Our Administration will do everything it can to protect the sanctity and significance of this property” said Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. “A site of such historic and environmental importance needs careful consideration before even limited development occurs.”

The Chattahoochee Brick Company was owned by former Atlanta Mayor James W. English. The brick company which supplied material for the construction of houses and buildings in Atlanta used leased “convict” labor in its manufacturing processes working primarily African American men under terrible conditions – some even to their death in furtherance of this enterprise. It is widely believed makeshift graves were created on the site – of which likely remain to this day.

Additionally this property is on the Chattahoochee River – Atlanta’s and the larger region’s supply of drinking water for which great success has been achieved improving water quality.

The Surface Transportation Board is an independent federal agency which primarily regulates railroads. The City of Atlanta is challenging the development of the fuel terminal on a variety of regulatory grounds.

Norfolk Southern’s full statement issued on Feb. 13:

We share the Mayor’s view of the historical significance of this site and recognize that any entity seeking to develop it takes on a special responsibility to do so in a socially and environmentally responsible way. That’s why we will stop work on the site immediately while we engage in further discussions with the City. Throughout this process we have worked closely with local officials and held multiple meetings to listen to the concerns of community stakeholders. We have committed to build a memorial to ensure the atrocities committed at the site are never forgotten. We are abiding by all applicable regulations and are conducting extensive clean-up of the site. We support the vision of many in the community for a network of trails along the Chattahoochee. In addition to the environmental reviews associated with cleaning up the site we have engaged experts to perform an archeological and historical survey as well as archaeological excavation in certain areas. There has been no evidence of a cemetery on the site but given the tragic legacy of the site we have continued to exercise great care.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F1dG9zLXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uL3Rlc2xhLXNldC11cC1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXItbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy11bml0LXNvdXRoZXJuLWluZGlhLTIwMjEtMDItMTMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla to set up electric car manufacturing unit in southern India,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-set-up-electric-car-manufacturing-unit-southern-india-2021-02-13/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F1dG9zLXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uL3Rlc2xhLXNldC11cC1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXItbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy11bml0LXNvdXRoZXJuLWluZGlhLTIwMjEtMDItMTMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub2xhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L2xvdWlzaWFuYS1jb2FzdGFsLXdvcmtlci1hbGxlZ2VzLWRyZWRnZS1jb21wYW55LW9yZGVyZWQtY292ZXJ1cC1vZi0yMDE2LW9pbC1zcGlsbC9hcnRpY2xlXzY2YzM4MzcyLTZkNzEtMTFlYi1iMDA3LTQzNTY2MDIwZTg0NC5odG1s0gGtAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vbGEuY29tL25ld3MvZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvbG91aXNpYW5hLWNvYXN0YWwtd29ya2VyLWFsbGVnZXMtZHJlZGdlLWNvbXBhbnktb3JkZXJlZC1jb3ZlcnVwLW9mLTIwMTYtb2lsLXNwaWxsL2FydGljbGVfNjZjMzgzNzItNmQ3MS0xMWViLWIwMDctNDM1NjYwMjBlODQ0LmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Louisiana coastal worker alleges dredge company ordered coverup of 2016 oil spill,"Last month the U.S. attorney's office in New Orleans charged Tassin with violating the Clean Water Act when he “negligently discharged” an estimated 5250 gallons of oil into the south edge of Barataria Bay.

Then he hosted a superspreader event.,"Created by Peter Diamandis—who is also the founder or cofounder of several space companies and Silicon Valley innovation hub Singularity University as well as of covid-19 vaccine developer Covaxx—the conference was a lucrative opportunity to hold court with a group of his “patrons.” These are businessmen (and a small handful of businesswomen) who pay large annual and conference fees for the privilege of gathering to talk about some of Diamandis’s favorite topics: AI longevity exponential growth and “the abundance mindset.” Speakers at the 2021 event some of whom appeared virtually included Silicon Valley luminaries such as Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Jonathan Hofeller the executive in charge of SpaceX's satellite mega-constellation Starlink.

A360 as its organizers call it was being held despite widespread recommendations from public health experts to limit contact with non-family members wear masks and hold any gatherings outdoors to limit the spread of covid-19.

And in California this was more than a recommendation: on December 5 the state had banned all gatherings public and private until regional hospital ICU capacities rose above 15% again. The in-person portion of Diamandis’s gathering was illegal.

And at first it seemed they were in the clear—even though staff and attendees were mostly unmasked. Everyone took daily coronavirus tests. Nobody fell sick during the January 24-26 meetings.

But covid-19 can take time to incubate. The first confirmed positive results came back on January 28 during the conference’s online-only virtual-reality day after most participants had flown home.

Over the next few days the number of positive tests climbed sharply. By the morning of February 3 at least five A360 employees two speakers and one family member who wasn’t at the conference had tested positive while an additional three people showed symptoms according to internal communications I viewed. (I granted anonymity to sources who expressed fears of retaliation for speaking out.)

By the end of the day that number would more than double. Another family member tested positive. Then during a team Zoom meeting Will Weisman A360’s executive director said that a large number of patrons had tested positive including one who infected his wife and child recounted an individual close to Diamandis on the call.

The airline on Valentine’s Day started nonstop flights to Baltimore Dallas Denver Nashville and Phoenix according to the Chicago Department of Aviation. Starting March 13 Southwest will also begin Saturday-only service to Orlando.

In a statement Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the expansion to O’Hare “underscores the strength of Chicago’s aviation market and the key role the city will play in the recovery of an airline industry severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Southwest has operated from Midway International Airport since March 1985 providing about 250 departures a day from Midway during peak seasons to 95 destinations making Chicago the second-largest city in Southwest’s system by capacity according to the CDA.

Despite Southwest dropping 90000 flights across the country during the pandemic some experts have said the expansion was a potentially smart move for the airline that will benefit Chicago.

The expansion to O’Hare will bring more options to Chicago travelers Southwest Vice President Dave Harvey said.

“These additional flights put the flexible policies and world-class hospitality our Midway Airport customers already enjoy on the North Side and further the ease of flying Southwest without a longer commute” Harvey said in a statement.

Southwest first announced the expected expansion in October. The company said it employs more than 4800 people in the city. Midway will remain Southwest’s primary Chicago airport with up to 200 flights a day in the coming months the company said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZHRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL3N0b3J5L2J1c2luZXNzL3RyYXZlbC8yMDIxLzAyLzE0L3NvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1iZWdpbnMtc2VydmljZS1zYXJhc290YS1icmFkZW50b24vNjczNzMzOTAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines begins service at Sarasota-Bradenton,"Glenda and Joe Padgett stood at gate B10 at Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport on Sunday morning wearing face masks and holding up “welcome” signs for Southwest Airlines made for them by a friend’s daughter.

There were a lot of people excitedly waiting for Southwest’s first-ever plane at Sarasota-Bradenton to land which it did at 11:34 a.m. Sunday but the Padgett family’s connection to the first-ever voyage was a little more personal.

Their son Jared is a Southwest employee who has worked as an in-flight scheduler for the airline for about five years. The Padgetts are now a “Southwest family” Glenda said and they have taken their fair share of maiden Southwest voyages.

They were on Southwest’s first flight from Tampa to Havana Cuba and this April they’re going to be on the maiden voyage from Las Vegas to Fresno California – those Fresno tickets were a Christmas present from their son.

But this flight – the first one ever on Southwest to their home base of Sarasota-Bradenton – is particularly exciting especially since Jared was on it with several of his friends.

“Maybe he will come home more often now” Glenda Padgett said of her son while holding a sign that said “thanks for adding Sarasota to your destinations.”

“And now we don’t have to drive to Tampa to catch flights” Joe Padgett said.

Jared Padgett was one of 116 passengers on the flight from Baltimore to Sarasota-Bradenton that arrived on Sunday. The airline launched service at SRQ over the weekend with service to four year-round destinations – Houston Texas; Nashville Tennessee; Chicago Illinois and Baltimore. The same plane that arrived in Sarasota-Bradenton from Baltimore was scheduled to turn around and bring 68 people to Chicago later that day.

All four of those destinations are significant for Sarasota-Bradenton in their own way. Baltimore is the home of the Baltimore Orioles which holds its spring training season at Sarasota’s Ed Smith Stadium. Chicago is a big existing tourism driver market and a source of seasonal residents. And Houston and Nashville have shown promise as potential feeder markets for visitors.

But what’s also a big deal about flying passengers between Sarasota-Bradenton and those four places is that they’re all big hubs for Southwest – meaning they can link people from Sarasota-Bradenton to the Southwest network around the world.

“You could be flying there directly if you have business in Nashville but it also gives the opportunities to go further” Steve Goldberg senior vice president of operations and hospitality for Southwest said. “It gives you the power of the Southwest network instead of having to drive to Tampa or down to Fort Myers.”

Visitors to the Sarasota area are already using that Southwest network Virginia Haley president of Visit Sarasota County said.

“We know that a lot of our visitors arrive here via Southwest into Tampa and yet they would prefer to fly in obviously to SRQ” Haley said. “So having this option with the popularity of Southwest is just very very important for the destination.”

The travel industry has been impacted significantly by COVID-19. International trips are virtually nonexistent and business travel has also suffered a lot.

Sarasota-Bradenton’s status as a leisure destination made it an attractive place to launch service during COVID Goldberg said and Southwest wanted to connect the growing airport to its vast global network.

“It just really is about connecting some dots and knowing that it’s a good market here in Sarasota-Bradenton – really expanding our presence particularly in the leisure market now during COVID” he said. “It also gives us the opportunity to get people from this area into the Southwest network.”

Sarasota-Bradenton airport has fared relatively well during COVID-19. While passenger traffic is still off compared to pre-COVID levels several existing airlines have announced new routes since the pandemic started and obviously having Southwest start here during COVID is a good show of faith in the airport.

Southwest will begin daily flights between Atlanta and Sarasota-Bradenton starting next month as well as seasonal service to Pittsburgh Columbus and Indianapolis.

Pre-COVID the airport had 24 straight months of passenger traffic growth. That dropped once the pandemic started and SRQ ended the year down 37% in passenger traffic compared to 2019.

Still despite COVID SRQ was able to lower its fees to the airlines in 2020 president and CEO Rick Piccolo said. That’s largely because it has no debt $20 million in reserves and received federal CARES Act funding Piccolo said. He said SRQ is currently operating at 63% capacity.

“We’ve been underutilized for a long time but with these airlines adding capacity we’re getting the airport to where it should be and should have been for a long time” Piccolo said.

Now that Southwest is here the Sarasota-Bradenton airport now has all four major U.S. aircraft carriers – American Airlines United Airlines Delta Air Lines and now Southwest. This means that Southwest’s loyal fleet of customers no longer will have to drive to Tampa or Fort Myers.

“[Southwest is] one of the most powerful brands in the aviation industry and with that comes the loyal flyers that will embrace this faster than most new flights” Elliott Falcione executive director of the Bradenton Area Convention and Visitors Bureau said. “I have had so many people reach out to me and say ‘Oh my gosh I no longer have to drive to Tampa. Tell me when tell me where and we’re excited to fly this awesome airline.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9wYWNpZmljLXNvdXRod2VzdC13aGF0LWhhcHBlbmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Happened To Pacific Southwest Airlines?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9wYWNpZmljLXNvdXRod2VzdC13aGF0LWhhcHBlbmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL25ld3Mvc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLWxhdW5jaGVzLXNlcnZpY2UtYXQtb2hhcmUtc3VuZGF5LzI0Mzc4NTMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines Launches Service at O'Hare Sunday,"For the first time ever Southwest Airlines is operating at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport as the company launched service at the airport on Sunday.

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 1.41%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Global Cost Reduction Program Supporting Gross Margin Expansion

The Company continued executing a series of initiatives that are expected to generate $1.5 billion of pre-tax run-rate cost savings by the end of 2024 growing to $2 billion by the end of 2025. Of the $2 billion savings $1.5 billion is expected to be delivered through a supply chain transformation that leverages strategic sourcing drives operational excellence consolidates facilities and optimizes the distribution network and reduces complexity of the product portfolio.

These actions are expected to return adjusted gross margins* to historical 35%+ levels. Additionally the Global Cost Reduction Program is expected to optimize the Company's cost base to fund investments that accelerate growth in core businesses.

The Global Cost Reduction Program generated incremental pre-tax run-rate cost savings in first quarter 2024 of $145 million. Since inception of the program in mid-2022 the Company has generated approximately $1.2 billion in pre-tax run-rate savings and reduced inventory by $1.9 billion.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

As we look forward to the blossoming of the sakura trees in Japan every spring there’s one pre-flower event we look forward to at the same time and that’s the blossoming of limited-edition pink sakura drinks at Starbucks.

These limited-edition beverages pair cherry blossoms with different ingredients every year and today the coffeehouse chain announced their new offerings for 2021: the Sakura Fuwari Berry Frappuccino and the Sakura Fuwari Berry Milk Latte.

The word “fuwari” connotes a gentle lightness which suggests these will be soft on the floral salty-sweet notes often imparted by sakura leaves and blossoms. This is a fitting flavour profile for what’s usually the first of two annual Starbucks sakura releases as it encapsulates the gentle buds as they begin to bloom before the second release appears on the scene representing the flowers in full blossom.

The new “fuwari” beverages are said to combine sakura with “two kinds of sweet and sour berry accents” for a satisfying relaxing taste.

The Sakura Fuwari Berry Frappuccino mixes a sakura strawberry sauce into the classic milk base and combines it with a lightly bittersweet and velvety smooth raspberry panna cotta for a luxurious finish. On top there’ll be a combination of freeze-dried strawberries and sakura-and-vanilla-flavoured sponge crumbs to resemble the blossoms and “help heal the mind while awaiting the arrival of spring”.

The Sakura Fuwari Berry Milk Latte is a hot beverage that “warms your heart” with a soft and gentle flavour created by the combination of warm milk and sakura strawberry sauce which is made with strawberry juice and powdered sakura flowers.

The Frappuccino is said to contain at least five-percent strawberry and raspberry juice while the latte is said to contain at least five-percent strawberry juice. Both drinks will be available at Starbucks branches around Japan from 15 February with the Frappuccino priced at 590 yen (US$5.62) for a tall on the menu until 13 April and the latte priced at 450-570 yen for Short through to Ventii sizes on the menu until 16 March.

And if you’d like even more strawberries with your sakura don’t forget to keep an eye out for the Starbucks sakura chilled cup currently available at convenience stores around Japan for a limited time.

The state's advice? Be 'scrappy',"WEBSTER GROVES — Maria Schroeder was worried and increasingly anxious. It was weeks after coronavirus vaccine distribution had started in Missouri and she still had 11 intellectually disabled residents who required 24-hour support — and no vaccine.

She expected someone to tell her how to get it. Finally in mid-January the state sent her a list.

But Schroeder assistant director for L’Arche St. Louis which runs three group homes in St. Louis County quickly realized the list was cluttered with every brick-and-mortar CVS Walgreens and Costco — locations that while approved to vaccinate often had no doses of vaccine.

Over the next two work days Schroeder made 200 calls.

“We’re a very small agency we don’t have a lot of connections” said Schroeder. “It was very obvious if I didn’t do this we weren’t going to get vaccines.”

The leaders of St. Louis-area group homes that serve intellectually disabled adults have struggled to secure doses of COVID-19 vaccine for their staff and clients. With little help from the state some said the group-home leaders began a dogged and sometimes desperate hunt. They made hundreds of phone calls sent staff driving across the state and cut deals with colleagues health care services and anybody else they could reach.

Most have now gotten at least some doses. But their stories illustrate the intense shortage of communication distribution and vaccine itself especially in the rollout’s early days.

Even for the high-risk.

The Missouri Department of Mental Health did not make staff available for an interview for this story. Agency spokeswoman Debra Walker said in an email that the department understands the challenges group homes face in trying to find vaccine.

“DMH has encouraged providers to take the lead and not wait for a vaccinator to contact them” she said.

Easterseals Midwest is still waiting.

The nonprofit serves approximately 5000 disabled clients in Missouri about 300 of whom reside in group homes in the St. Louis region. Three of its disabled clients and two of its staff members have died from the virus over the course of the pandemic.

The organization devoted three full-time employees solely to trying to track down vaccine said CEO Wendy Sullivan. She said Easterseals’ operations near St. Louis received a round of about 250 shots on Thursday with roughly 50 vaccines going to clients and the rest going to staff members. Now just about every staff member who had wanted a vaccine has received one she said. But “the overwhelming majority” of disabled clients are still missing their shots.

The organization has encountered confusion and conflicting policies in different parts of the state Sullivan said. In Springfield for instance they’ve been able to get vaccinations but other places have questioned their eligibility for doses.

“Everyone is confused about who’s eligible when” she said.

Sullivan said vaccine distribution has tended to be worse around St. Louis.

“It varies greatly by region” she said. “St. Louis has been much slower.”

‘Good luck’

Professional leaders of area group homes — also called “community living” or “supported living” settings — say that their residents are highly vulnerable to diseases like COVID-19. In most circumstances staff members frequently come and go presenting potential routes for transmission. And one infection in the home can quickly transmit to others.

Moreover many clients already have underlying health conditions. And they sometimes lack an understanding of how to keep themselves safe.

“They are high-risk” Sullivan said.

So leaders were surprised when they didn’t see a state system linking specific vaccine vendors to prospective recipients high on the list of eligibility.

Instead on a recent conference call a Department of Mental Health official told group home leaders to be “scrappy.”

It frustrated some on the call. They saw it as just another example of the state ignoring group homes’ needs.

“It’s not the first time that we’ve felt like we’ve got to get ‘scrappy’ to get this done” said Barb Griffith CEO of St. Peters-based Community Living. “I was looking to (the state) to usher this in in a systematic way to help those organizations that they provide funding to. But it didn’t happen that way.”

Schroeder from L’Arche called it “infuriating.”

“It just felt like an abdication of responsibility and a misunderstanding of how grave the situation is” said Schroeder. “We’ve been in a life-and-death situation since March.”

Her boss L’Arche Executive Director Paula Kilcoyne said the call sent the wrong message.

“It just gives the message of ‘Every person for themselves’ you know?” she said “‘Good luck.’”

Some group homes have reported better luck.

About half the staff and nearly all of the 50 residents at Community Living chose to be vaccinated. Griffith said St. Charles County provided some doses. She tracked down “leftover” vaccine at Compass Health Network a nonprofit health care system in the area. And her organization partnered with another home on a vaccination clinic.

Roughly 90% of the clients at Emmaus Homes which runs 65 residences across Warren Franklin St. Charles and St. Louis counties have received doses. It had “first-round access” to the vaccine in late December and ran the clinic attended by many of Community Living’s vaccination recipients.

“That’s about being in the right place at the right time” said Emmaus chief Cindy Clark who also serves as a leader of a statewide trade association focused on assisting people with disabilities.

But Clark said early this month that Emmaus’ success had been an exception. “As I look across the 100 providers in our trade association I know that getting access has not been that easy” Clark said. “We are certainly in the minority.”

She said on Friday that it has since improved.

‘It’s been a mess’

Many leaders echoed a fear that other disabled people who aren’t in group homes or can’t afford their services are likely to face even steeper obstacles to get a vaccine.

“There are thousands of individuals who live with their families” Kilcoyne said. “I don’t have confidence that those families are getting served that they would even have the wherewithal to call dozens of places.”

Schroeder however was ultimately successful for the staff and residents at L’Arche.

Call after call hit a maze of dead ends. Then through a few strokes of good luck the organization snagged vaccine from three different sources near and far.

One chunk of vaccinations were administered on site by United Scripts a local long-term care pharmacy which told Schroeder it had a surplus and had resorted to contacting police stations to find takers when she called. Another round of vaccines was tracked down at a health care system in Columbia requiring that L’Arche send staff two hours west for the shots. That venue also expressed confusion about what to do with its doses on hand Schroeder said.

“They had no direction as to who needed the vaccines” she said.

At L’Arche and elsewhere that has been cited as a consistent problem.

“It’s been a mess” said Schroeder of the vaccine rollout.

“We were basically told to fend for ourselves.”

(AP) — The plight of endangered right whales took another sad turn Saturday when a baby whale possibly two months old washed ashore dead on a Florida beach with telltale signs of being struck by a boat.

There are fewer than 400 north Atlantic right whales remaining and any mortality of the species is a serious setback to rescuing the animals from extinction according to federal biologists who expressed dismay over Saturday’s discovery of the 22-foot (7-meter) male infant at Anastasia State Park near St. Augustine.

“This is a very sad event” said Blair Mase a whale expert with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

“Every mortality that occurs really has a devastating impact on the population as a whole because they are one of our most critically endangered whales in the world” she said. “Every whale counts.”

The infant whale is believed to be the first born of a 19-year-old whale biologists named “Infinity.” Both were sighted off Amelia Island in northern Florida on Jan. 17.

The circumstances surrounding the whale’s death are under investigation. But federal officials said it was clear that a vessel was involved. The whale suffered propeller wounds to the head and back.

Inclement weather kept biologists from immediately launching a search for the calf’s mother to see if she might have also been injured by the collision with a boat.

It was the second calf mortality since the calving season. Another calf was found dead in November on one of North Carolina’s barrier islands.

From November to April right whales swim south from the frigid northern Atlantic to give birth in warmer waters off the northern coast of Florida.

The whales spend those months cruising through waters off the coast sometimes coming within a couple hundred feet from beaches — which make them vulnerable to boaters and fishing vessels going in and out piers.

Mase said some 40 right whales have been sighted off the southeast coast of the United States with 15 pairs of moms and their calves.

Federal laws prohibit people from harming the animals. And people are supposed to remain at least 500 yards (460 meters) away from the whales.

“If you’re in this area please give these animals space” said Allison Garrett a NOAA spokesperson. “The rule is 500 yards — that’s five football fields. That includes people boats drones paddle boards — everything. That’s the law.”

Garrett urged people who come upon one of the rare whales to report the sighting to officials at (877) 942-5343 to help track their numbers.

Ocean vessels and fishing operations — as well as disease — have taken a toll on the whale’s numbers.

Since 2017 the animals have been experiencing what biologists call an “unusual mortality event.” In those years at least 33 dead and 13 seriously injured whales have been found — accounting for more than a tenth of the remaining population.

Last month conservation groups sued the federal government to force it to further accelerate action on proposals meant to protect the whales.

The groups want the government to impose stricter speed limit on ships traveling from Maine to Florida.

Following the violent insurrection that took place at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 investigators have looked into the role hate and extremist groups may have played in the attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

Several prominent members of the far-right group the Proud Boys have been charged with conspiracy after prosecutors said they planned and funded the storming of the Capitol. The organization is one of the newest hate groups in the country as designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center. FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials raised concerns at a 2020 Senate hearing that extremists across the ideological spectrum including white supremacists pose a threat to public order and national security.

The number of hate groups in America peaked in 2018 at 1020 such organizations. In 2020 that number declined to 838 — equivalent to 2.5 hate groups for every million people. In some states the concentration of hate groups is far greater.

24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from the Southern Poverty Law Center a legal advocacy organization with a focus on civil rights to identify the states with the most hate groups per capita.

Though the number of hate groups has decreased in the last few years these groups have become scattered and difficult to track as they communicate online through encrypted platforms. There are many other people who harbor white nationalist anti-Semitic anti-Muslim neo-Nazi anti-LGBTQ and other extremist views and who are not official members of any specific hate group.

States with outsized shares of hate groups tend to have several characteristics in common. Most states on this list are not very racially diverse and are home to higher shares of residents identifying as white alone and to lower shares of foreign-born residents than the comparable national averages. States with high concentrations of hate groups also tend to have low median household incomes and high poverty rates. These are America’s richest and poorest states.

Methodology:

To determine the states with the most hate groups 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from the nonprofit advocacy group Southern Poverty Law Center. We ranked states based on the number of active hate groups in 2020 per million state residents. The SPLC defines a hate group as an organization or collection of individuals that promotes beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people usually on the basis of immutable characteristics of the maligned class.

Hate group tallies were adjusted for population using population estimates for July 1 2020 from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Population and Housing Unit Estimates program. Supplemental data on the percentage of the population that identifies as white the percentage of the population that is foreign-born and median household income came from the Census Bureau’s 2019 American Community Survey.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vbGVhbnRpbWVzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0YXRlLXVuaW9uLWEtbG9vay1hdC10aGUtaG9tZXMtb2YtZS1iLWdyZWVuL2FydGljbGVfMzA4NTIxYTItZWEyYS01MjgxLTkxNjktOTY3YjVhZTQwNThmLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,State & Union: A look at the homes of E.B.

From Iron Man 2 's map marking the location of Wakanda to Stephen Strange's name-drop in Captain America: The Winter Soldier  the smallest details have teased Marvel Studios' big future plans.

ADVERTISEMENT

S.W.O.R.D.'s presence in WandaVision has riddled the sinister sitcom with blink-and-miss names within files. While a number of these names are references to the real-life production crew that has worked on the show some allude to characters that have yet to make the jump from the page to the silver screen.

S.W.O.R.D. FILE TEASES WOLVERINE

WandaVision 's sixth episode saw Kat Dennings's Darcy Lewis attempt to break into Director Tyler Hayward's secret S.W.O.R.D. files. As she hacks her way towards Monica Rambeau's file Lewis passes a noteworthy name: Ray Johnson.

WandaVision

In the comics Ray Johnson is an alias for John Wraith better known as Kestrel a teleporting mutant with an anti-aging factor. Kestrel is most famous for his affiliation with Team X a collection of mercenary mutants that carried out covert missions for William Stryker. Team X consisted of notable names such as Silver Fox Sabretooth and Wolverine.

Marvel

Rapper will.i.am. of the Black Eyed Peas previously portrayed Kestrel in 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine  the character's only appearance in a live-action motion picture. That flick saw Kestrel work with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine throughout the movie both on Team X and on Logan's personal vendetta against William Stryker.

MORE NODS TO WEAPON X

A full on Marvel Studios X-Men movie might still be years away but Kevin Feige and company sure are keen on dropping nods of mutants' existence within the MCU.

Ray Johnson's file being in S.W.O.R.D.'s database indicates the organization has worked with him in the past or he is at least on their radar. John Wraith is known to commit his fair share of crimes in the comics so being on S.W.O.R.D.'s radar would make sense. While Wraith does dip his toes in villainy he is overall considered an anti-hero.

ADVERTISEMENT

S.W.O.R.D.'s status as the good guys is on the hot seat right now  but assuming they are a friendly organization working with someone like Kestrel makes sense. Knowing that he's a team player on the page it would only make sense his existence within the MCU would be alongside Team X.

S.W.O.R.D. may be a relatively infant organization but who's to say they haven't worked with a group of mutant mercenaries before? After all Marvel's original group of suits S.H.I.E.L.D. had their strike force to do the heavy lifting.

The money tie with this Ray Johnson file is obviously Wolverine. Fans are beyond excited for Logan to make his way into the MCU and while his debut may be further down the line this file is the latest in a short trail of bread crumbs Marvel has been dropping that hint towards his existence.

ADVERTISEMENT

The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is still about a month away but promotional material has given fans a peek into what they can expect from the patriotic program. Trailers show Sam and Bucky heading to the nation of Madripoor which in the comics is a crime-ridden island significantly associated with Wolverine.

If that wasn't enough of a Weapon X tease set photos from the star-spangled series have revealed the symbol of Ogun a martial arts master and foe to Wolverine on the page.

Are the seeds being planted for a Phase 4 Wolverine debut? Time will tell.

Here is the basic test configuration that we used:

Motherboard and CPU : Supermicro X11SDV-4C-TLN2F with Intel Xeon D-2123IT

: Supermicro X11SDV-4C-TLN2F with Intel Xeon D-2123IT RAM : 4x 16GB Micron DDR4-2400 RDIMMs

: 4x 16GB Micron DDR4-2400 RDIMMs SSD: Intel DC S3710 400GB

Supermicro has a number of platforms with the Intel Xeon D-2123IT. After this review we will likely have a piece on the Supermicro X11SDV-4C-TP8F which is a larger motherboard but we saw similar numbers to what we have here.

Still this is a great compact platform for those looking towards a lower-cost Xeon D-2100 experience.

Intel Xeon D-2123IT Benchmarks

For this exercise we are using our legacy Linux-Bench scripts which help us see cross-platform “least common denominator” results we have been using for years as well as several results from our updated Linux-Bench2 scripts. At this point our benchmarking sessions take days to run and we are generating well over a thousand data points. We are also running workloads for software companies that want to see how their software works on the latest hardware. As a result this is a small sample of the data we are collecting and can share publicly. Our position is always that we are happy to provide some free data but we also have services to let companies run their own workloads in our lab such as with our DemoEval service. What we do provide is an extremely controlled environment where we know every step is exactly the same and each run is done in a real-world data center not a test bench.

We are going to show off a few results and highlight a number of interesting data points in this article.

Python Linux 4.4.2 Kernel Compile Benchmark

This is one of the most requested benchmarks for STH over the past few years. The task was simple we have a standard configuration file the Linux 4.4.2 kernel from kernel.org and make the standard auto-generated configuration utilizing every thread in the system. We are expressing results in terms of compiles per hour to make the results easier to read:

These charts are a bit busy given how many comparisons we wanted to show. Here we actually wanted to focus on just how big of a gap there is between this CPU and the Intel Xeon D-2183IT in terms of performance. Many systems and motherboard manufacturers design a PCB then place a number of different Xeon D SKUs to create different performance levels. There are segments of the embedded market that want just single SKUs but there are others that want to have this flexibility to minimize design cycles while being able to scale performance.

c-ray 1.1 Performance

We have been using c-ray for our performance testing for years now. It is a ray tracing benchmark that is extremely popular to show differences in processors under multi-threaded workloads. Here is our newer Linux-Bench2 8K render to show differences.

This benchmark is one where AMD does particularly well. This is not one that we would advise our readers to dwell on for too long. Instead we just wanted to call out the fact that there are some cases where the AMD chips perform particularly well.

7-zip Compression Performance

7-zip is a widely used compression/ decompression program that works cross-platform. We started using the program during our early days with Windows testing. It is now part of Linux-Bench.

Here we wanted to highlight performance that was close to and often better than the Intel Atom C3758. The 4 core/ 8 thread configuration with the larger cores means we get more performance than eight smaller cores.

NAMD Performance

NAMD is a molecular modeling benchmark developed by the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group in the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. More information on the benchmark can be found here. With GROMACS we have been working hard to support Intel’s Skylake AVX-512 and AVX2 supporting AMD Zen architecture. Here are the comparison results for the legacy data set:

Here again we can see solid results. AVX-512 is a big feature here so the picture changes quite a bit as we move to GROMACS later. The other interesting aspect here is that the performance is relatively close here to an 85W 6C/12T Intel Xeon E5-2620 V3 that does not have an integrated PCH. We are getting much higher performance per watt and performance per core with the newer SoCs than the older Haswell/Broadwell architectures.

OpenSSL Performance

OpenSSL is widely used to secure communications between servers. This is an important protocol in many server stacks. We first look at our sign tests:

Here are the verify results:

We traditionally sort by the verify results which is why the sign chart looks a bit different. Still we can see that we are a bit ahead of the 4C/ 8T AMD EPYC 3151 here and well ahead of the 4C/ 8T Intel Xeon D-1518.

UnixBench Dhrystone 2 and Whetstone Benchmarks

Some of the longest-running tests at STH are the venerable UnixBench 5.1.3 Dhrystone 2 and Whetstone results. They are certainly aging however we constantly get requests for them and many angry notes when we leave them out. UnixBench is widely used so we are including it in this data set. Here are the Dhrystone 2 results:

Here are the whetstone results:

This is a workload where we have a huge data set on but we are not showing it as much in our more recent reviews. Perhaps the key takeaway here is if we look at the single-threaded results which almost form three groups. High-clock speed parts such as the Xeon E-2244G do very well in that test. There are a number of lower-performance chips such as the Atom CPUs that have lower performance per core but get performance from having more cores. Then the Xeon D-2123IT is in a mid-range group. There are applications that specifically work well on scaling to many lower-speed cores and so that is a popular segment.

GROMACS STH Small AVX2/ AVX-512 Enabled

We have a small GROMACS molecule simulation we previewed in the first AMD EPYC 7601 Linux benchmarks piece. In Linux-Bench2 we are using a “small” test for single and dual-socket capable machines. Our medium test is more appropriate for higher-end dual and quad-socket machines. Our GROMACS test will use the AVX-512 and AVX2 extensions if available.

This is always one of the more interesting results. Intel maintains that the Xeon D-2100 series has a single FMA AVX-512 implementation just like the Intel Xeon Silver 4100/ 4200 series. Consistently we see in applications that are AVX-512 enabled that it performs extremely well significantly better than even the 8 core/ 16 thread Intel Xeon Silver parts. We confirmed this again around the time of the Cascade Lake launch with Intel. This is a great example of where a specific acceleration feature can make a chip leapfrog options that do not have the same feature.

Chess Benchmarking

Chess is an interesting use case since it has almost unlimited complexity. Over the years we have received a number of requests to bring back chess benchmarking. We have been profiling systems and are ready to start sharing results:

The chess benchmarking shows a lot of the same. Some may notice that we use the Intel Xeon Bronze 3206R in many of these charts. In our view this is the lowest-end 2nd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Refresh part so it may be one some segments are tempted to run as the low-end mainstream Xeon server solution which is why we wanted to include it here.

Next we are going to have power consumption market positioning and our final words.

Intel Xeon D-2123IT Power Consumption

We had this chart in the same platform which shows power consumption of various 4 core and 16 core Intel embedded CPU options. We used the same Supermicro motherboard for the Xeon D-2123IT results here:

Hopefully this helps in terms of putting performance power and features into a broader perspective in terms of the embedded CPU lines as well as the lower and higher-end configurations of each.

Intel Xeon D-2123IT Market Positioning

The Intel Xeon D-2123IT is in the market alongside the rest of the Intel Xeon D-2100 family (until Ice Lake-D arrives). Here is what the launch family looks like from our Intel Xeon D-2100 Series Initial SKU List and Value Analysis:

As you can see this is the lowest-end part in the family. We get a cost that is less than half of the Xeon D-2142IT yet we still get higher clock speeds both for memory clocks as well as for base and all core turbo clocks that help to mask some of the performance delta. More importantly the Xeon D-2123IT effectively plays the “light the platform” role in the lineup. In most CPU lines there is a basic SKU that serves mostly for applications that need a specific platform but do not need huge core counts. That is the role of the Xeon Bronze series as an example. This is exactly what the Xeon D-2123IT offers here.

Beyond the Intel D-2100 series the Atom C3000 line can mostly offer the same levels of multi-thread performance with more cores. The Intel Xeon D-1500 and D-1600 series only has dual-channel memory and still uses some legacy PCIe Gen connectivity. The AMD EPYC 3000 line is interesting. The EPYC 3000 is in many ways like an upgraded Xeon D-1500 series with dual-channel memory in the 4-8C segment but more modern PCIe I/O. The larger chips such as the AMD EPYC 3451 have quad-channel memory but one needs to move to more expensive dual-die parts to get to that performance level. While AMD can claim similar 10GbE NIC counts the challenge is that the AMD EPYC 3000 NICs do not support features such as SR-IOV which is why we often do not see them used. In contrast the Xeon D-2100 series is using the IP that is in the Lewisburg PCH which is a higher-end solution.

Another interesting way to look at the Xeon D-2123IT is that it is a $75-100 Intel PCH mated with a 4 core CPU for only $213.

Beyond the x86 ecosystem there are a number of Arm vendors such as NXP that are focusing on this space. In the coming generations this is going to be a bigger story. Intel is positioning this chip slightly differently since it is effectively the same Skylake core run in one’s data center but in an embedded form factor making code portability trivial. Again in future generations this will change and there is a large segment of the embedded market where everything is custom so Arm is competing but the design philosophy of Intel in many ways dictates its competitive set.

Final Words

This is likely a review that we should have had on STH earlier when we first covered the chip. Still embedded lifecycles are long and this is the current-generation Intel part in the space making it highly relevant. The Xeon D-2100 series did not benefit from the 2nd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable refresh pricing and updated “U” series SKUs for single-socket applications. On a raw compute basis this is a better value than most of the rest of Intel’s line. For a simple “light the platform” part it performs well and is a great firewall/ storage appliance SKU.

Higher-end Xeon D-2100 series parts for compute applications are much harder to justify these days. For the embedded market just having BGA mounting and the integrated PCH functionality for a smaller package is extremely important. Still the Xeon D-2123IT brings that packaging benefit alongside performance that is competitive with the Xeon Bronze series that give it overlap in these “light the platform” type scenarios where I/O connectivity is more important than massive amounts of compute power.

At the outset of testing the Xeon D-2123IT this was seen as a lower-end part. These days we look at it as perhaps the best value Xeon D-2100 series part on the market. That just shows there is a lot that can happen over the course of a product cycle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZ2l6bW9kby5jb20uYXUvMjAyMS8wMi90aGUtbW9zdC1pbmZhbW91cy1zdG9yeS1pbi10ZWNoLXJldHVybnMtd2l0aC1uZXctZGV0YWlscy1idXQtbm8taGFyZC1ldmlkZW5jZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Most Infamous Story in Tech Returns With New Details But No Hard Evidence,"More than two years after Bloomberg Businessweek published a widely disputed investigation claiming the Chinese government had secretly installed microchips on server motherboards produced by Supermicro that were used to spy on companies like Amazon and Apple the outlet has published its follow-up which doubles down on the initial report and expands the scope of the alleged espionage to a dizzying degree.

Titled “The Big Hack” the initial Businessweek cover story published in October 2018 and authored by Jordan Robertson and Michael Riley drew widespread criticism from other journalists and commentators and was directly disputed by Apple Amazon and server manufacturer Supermicro. These allegedly compromised servers the report claimed were used by nearly 30 companies — banks government contractors Amazon and Apple among them — giving China’s People’s Liberation Army a backdoor “into any network that included the altered machines.”

It’s a wild report and was summarily panned as questionable at best. Apple which rarely speaks publicly about specific news stories issued a stunning rebuttal soon after the story’s publication refuting many of its most shocking claims directly. Apple CEO Tim Cook later called for Businessweek to retract the story. “There is no truth in their story about Apple” Cook told BuzzFeed News. “They need to do the right thing and retract it.”

Amazon too denied many of the claims the Businessweek story made about the company. “There are so many inaccuracies in ‎this article as it relates to Amazon that they’re hard to count” wrote Steve Schmidt chief information security officer at AWS the company’s cloud business. Two weeks after the story’s publication Supermicro refuted the story’s veracity in a letter to customers. And in December 2018 the company said a third-party audit “found absolutely no evidence of malicious hardware on our motherboards.”

On top of the story’s main subjects denying the report’s accuracy the U.S. Department of Homeland Security then-Director of National Intelligence Dan Coates the NSA and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre publicly cast doubt on the story. Security researchers and journalists picked the story apart with some questioning whether the whole thing was simply made up.

Bloomberg News however stood by the story which became a thing of lore among technology journalists who would periodically ask each other “what the hell happened with that?” Well what happened was Robertson and Riley spent nearly two-and-a-half years since the technology world cast doubt on their report further digging into the story which they claim now is far more wide-reaching than their original bombshell report.

The follow-up story published early Friday morning directly addresses the controversy of the first report and does not walk back any of its claims. Indeed it details “a larger chain of events” around the alleged Chinese spy plot.

Bloomberg Businessweek first reported on China’s meddling with Supermicro products in October 2018 in an article that focused on accounts of added malicious chips found on server motherboards in 2015. That story said Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. had discovered the chips on equipment they’d purchased. Supermicro Apple and Amazon publicly called for a retraction. U.S. government officials also disputed the article. With additional reporting it’s now clear that the Businessweek report captured only part of a larger chain of events in which U.S. officials first suspected then investigated monitored and tried to manage China’s repeated manipulation of Supermicro’s products.

The report — which the authors say is based on interviews with more than 50 individuals most of whom are unnamed and at least 14 of which are identified as “former law enforcement and intelligence officials familiar with the matter” — aims to tie together a series of security breaches that are all allegedly linked to Supermicro.

First the story claims that the FBI has been investigating Supermicro for nearly a decade according to those aforementioned former law enforcement and intelligence officials. Also according to five unnamed sources the FBI has been monitoring Supermicro employees thanks to warrants obtained under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

The report also says that the U.S. military in 2008 discovered that Lenovo laptops used by troops in Iraq had a chip “on the motherboard that would record all the data that was being inputted into that laptop and send it back to China” according to testimony in a 2010 criminal case by Lee Chieffalo who was involved in network operations for the Marines in Fallujah. Businessweek writes that three unnamed officials confirmed Chieffalo’s description. A Lenovo spokesperson said the company wasn’t aware of the security issue despite an “extensive probe into Lenovo’s background and trustworthiness” by U.S. officials ahead of business deals with IBM and Google and that “there have been no reports of any problems.”

Further according to multiple unnamed sources the follow-up story claims Pentagon systems were secretly sending information to China and one unnamed source claimed the malicious “implant” was found on “thousands of servers.” The intrusive instructions in Pentagon servers Businessweek reports consisted in part of code that was “customised by workers associated with Supermicro” according to unnamed government officials. The Pentagon reportedly responded to the intrusion by keeping their knowledge of it a secret and according to two unnamed sources “devised undetectable countermeasures to protect its networks.”

Finally the report says Intel found in 2014 that a breach of its system was the result of a firmware update downloaded from Supermicro’s website. The attack was allegedly linked to a state-sponsored hacker group known as APT 17 which is believed to be based in China. Intel said the breach had “no impact to our network or data” but did not dispute finding a connection to Supermicro.

On top of all this the new Businessweek report cites multiple people most named and on the record who say the U.S. government warned them or companies they consulted for about the presence of secret spy chips added to severs. For example one of the named sources Mukul Kumar who was at the time the chief security officer for chip designer Altera Corp. said he received an unclassified briefing in 2015 where he was told “there was a chip on the board that was not supposed to be there that was calling home — not to Supermicro but to China.” In total Businessweek cited executives from 10 companies and one representing a “large municipal utility” who said they received similar warnings.

Supermicro said in a statement that it has never been contacted by government officials about claims of China tampering with its motherboards and called the story “a mishmash of disparate and inaccurate allegations” that draws “farfetch conclusions.”

“Despite Bloomberg’s allegations about supposed cyber or national security investigations that date back 10 years Supermicro has never been contacted by the U.S. government or by any of our partners or customers about these alleged investigations” the statement reads. “Bloomberg has produced no conclusions from these alleged investigations. Nor could Bloomberg confirm to us if any alleged investigation was even ongoing. To the contrary several of the U.S. government agencies Bloomberg claims had initiated investigations continue to use our products and have done so for years.”

China also denied the report’s accuracy with a spokesperson saying the country’s government “has never and will never require enterprises or individuals to collect or provide data information and intelligence from other countries for the Chinese government by installing ‘back doors.’”

Critics of Businessweek’s reporting were quick to dissect the latest report in an attempt to punch holes in it. The primary complaint is that it lacks hard evidence and is instead based largely on anonymous sources whose claims cannot be fact-checked by third parties — a common complaint against reports based on unnamed sources. The report also weaves together claims of software intrusions with allegations of secret spy chips that are at best confusing.

Ultimately what you think of the two reports comes down to who you trust. That Businessweek relied primarily on anonymous sources and largely lacks documents or other hard evidence of their claims isn’t unusual for a story about a major national security issue — it can be easier to a degree to get government sources to talk than to leak sensitive documents. And the use of anonymous sources alone isn’t necessarily a reason to doubt the reporting. But there’s still the powerful wave of denials following the initial story that make it difficult to put faith in the reporting alone. Then there’s the fact that the original story appeared to include photos of the actual chip which it did not. (You had to read and decipher the fine print to know the chip pictured for the article was a similar-looking component.)

Perhaps if they ever get their mitts on the actual chip — and can prove so with documented evidence — we can stop debating whether to believe these reports and start worrying about what their findings mean.",,,,,,,,,

We are now well into a global smartphone experiment. And many of the consequences of smartphone overuse now have become pretty clear.

So I recently gathered a dozen recovering smartphone addicts for an update on their ongoing struggles. One of them was Jennifer a 39-year-old wife of a pastor and mother of three children who lives near D.C. I asked her about what she’s learning about herself as she looks back on her bad smartphone habits of the past.

“What I have learned is that I was far more needy than I ever imagined” Jennifer said.

“Needy. Needy for what exactly?” I asked.

“Well it seems for everything” she said offering a list. “Personal affirmation. The approval of man. Constant social connection. Fear of missing out. Needy for distraction from life. Needy for constant entertainment. Needy for knowledge to puff me up. It seems like my list of needs is endless.”

So I pressed her to explain further. “What’s at the heart of this struggle? Why are you so needy for these things?”

“I think that at the heart of my social-media struggle” she said “is that I am always seeking after my own glory and that self-glory never is enough. It doesn’t last. Each time I mindlessly scroll through my social-media feed or check to see if my friends have texted me back it all just proves again how much I continue to lack. I can never get enough of something.”

“Now” she said “there’s nothing inherently wrong with social media texting friends taking pictures of your kids or pictures of yourself for that matter or enjoying online video. But technology makes all of this immediately accessible in the palm of your hand. And all of our social-media platforms are designed to deliver us instant gratification. So that’s what I have discovered. I have endless needs that are not satisfied by my phone.”

We Are All Needy

That’s sharp. Do you understand what Jennifer is saying here? She’s saying there are legitimate needs that we have real needs we seek to feed with candy substitutes that will never satisfy us. She’s saying if you send two hundred throwaway selfies today on Snap you’re not simply broadcasting your attempt to be seen and loved by your peers. No. You are more essentially broadcasting the vastness of your inner neediness to the world. And those needs are not satisfied with just a little more Instagram Facebook Snapchat and TikTok — nor with a little more self-affirmation and self-praise. It all exposes a need.

But we still try. We try to feed this cavernous need inside us. And the result is that it’s making us more lonely more depressed and more anxious. We live in an age of increasing anxiety. Rising rates of depression are common now among teen boys and especially teen girls. Not entirely but largely to blame for it are the communications technologies that feed a 24/7 comparison culture they cannot escape. Teens are always within moments of sharing something digitally standing ever ready to act and capture and spread.

“To enter a social-media platform is to enter into a virtual theater of spiritual warfare. Social media is spiritual war.”

Instagram Snapchat and TikTok elicit from them something of a digital beauty pageant a race to impress with wit or confidence or sex appeal or wealth. But under these ambitious impulses to share at any moment of the day or night remains a low-grade insecurity. When teens fail to impress and an image or selfie or video sits out there in the digital ether unliked and unloved and unshared it casts self-doubt. And behind all the digital disillusionment is the false promise that a device will make me more impressive in the eyes of my peers.

And so we all continue to create this unending digital presence before others. We are all needy. And time and time again our phone does not deliver on these promises. In the wake of smartphone addiction we are left with increasing anxiety depression and more loneliness.

Adults feel these same tensions lured to our phones by these same false promises. That something of my wit and creativity and brilliance will impress others.

Art of Spiritual War

What Christians like Jennifer are beginning to realize is that social media is not a toy. Snapchat and Instagram and TikTok are not simple hobbies. To enter a social-media platform is to enter into a virtual theater of spiritual warfare. Social media is spiritual war. The biggest problem facing us is not too much time spent in social media; our problem is that we engage social media with our spiritual guards down. We don’t expect to be met there with war.

So how do we engage in spiritual warfare even when it’s within a virtual platform? That’s the relevance of Ephesians 6 in the digital age. For this session we will look at Ephesians 6:10–20. Turn there. It comes near the end of Paul’s letter. I’ll read the text now from the ESV:

Finally be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the cosmic powers over this present darkness against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand firm. Stand therefore having fastened on the belt of truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness and as shoes for your feet having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace. In all circumstances take up the shield of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one; and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God praying at all times in the Spirit with all prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert with all perseverance making supplication for all the saints and also for me that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel for which I am an ambassador in chains that I may declare it boldly as I ought to speak.

“Finally” Paul says to the believers in the pagan city of Ephesus “finally stand.” The city of Ephesus was enchanted by lies false gods false comforts false securities and all the false promises of happiness that will not deliver in the end. So here at the end of this epistle a letter in which he has said so much the end of the matter is this: Stand. Resist the lies of the age with the truth of God.

My task today is to show you how spiritual warfare extends online and to answer the question How does the armor of God fit us for the spiritual warfare being waged on our pixelated screens? The text has a pretty simple outline in three stages. Paul says

Stand Fast (verses 10–13) Gear Up (verses 14–17) Attack (verses 18–20)

1. Stand Fast (verses 10–13)

First Paul says to stand fast. He gives us an overview of the struggle we face and what it means to succeed in the struggle.

Strength for Battle

Finally be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. (verse 10)

Our strength for this war is not in our power. Our strength is not living off the grid. Our strength is not in deleting all our social-media apps. That may help but it won’t solve the battle Paul talks about here. Our strength is not in extracting ourselves from digital culture for a life in isolation as an offline hermit without a computer or smartphone or Wi-Fi. No we are called to do battle in this age to be strong in the Lord.

The strength of God is nothing less than what Paul suggested earlier in chapter 1. God’s power is beautifully demonstrated in the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead (Ephesians 1:19–20). Our power for withstanding the digital age is resurrection power. We stand in the strength of God because he is strong. He is stronger than the grave. And he is stronger than Satan. If Satan were stronger than God we’d have no chance of standing.

And yet Satan attacks. He attacks “not because he’s unbeaten but because he has been defeated in principle. Therefore he’s venting his spleen. He’s outraged and using whatever energy he has left to pour out all of his venom on us” God’s church. So we take up arms and fight not because the final end of the cosmic war is in any doubt. No. There’s no doubt. We fight because on “this side of the cross the decisive victory has been won and it is our privilege to follow our Master in his ‘mop-up’ campaign as it has been called” (Carson “An Equipped Man”).

So what is victory? What are we called to achieve?

Standing in Faith

Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. (verse 11)

Here’s our action our command and our endgame. Put on the armor of God. Paul is calling us to be outfitted like a contemporary Roman soldier to stand against the schemes of Satan.

Our call is to stand. Paul mixes war and wrestling metaphors here. Outfitted for war standing as in a wrestling match.

In the face of Satan we don’t panic. Christ defeated him (John 12:31). Again “Satan is now a defeated foe a lion on a chain and what he can do against us is sovereignly restricted on a day-to-day basis.” That means for us who are Christ’s that we “should detest Satan but not dread him since God now provides us with all-purpose combat equipment for use against him” (Packer A Passion for Faithfulness 94).

We don’t run from Satan in fear. No. We stand in faith. That’s the victory.

Unseen Forces

In verse 12 Paul tells us more about the war.

For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the cosmic powers over this present darkness against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.

No commands in verse 12 just a heads-up. Unseen enemies are always the scariest. An invisible virus is pretty scary. Unseen threats are the ones that make us lose the most sleep.

So an unseen spiritual war has broken out in ancient Ephesus and the church is being called together for war. That was then. Now in our scientific and technological age Satan gets a pass. He’s ignored written off as a myth. A fiction. A red man in tights with horns and a pitchfork. The punchline of a joke. In the age of science and shiny tech Satan becomes made-up myth from a bygone age. And that’s false.

“We are ready to proclaim the happy tidings of God’s reign over all things and his defeat of sin and death and the devil.”

In reality this war is unseen and cosmic. It’s invisible and it’s everywhere. It’s like a pandemic in a way. Invisible and disrupting everything in our world. Well this type of warfare is the context of our entire Christian life as “a profound spiritual warfare of cosmic proportions” (O’Brien The Letter to the Ephesians 466). The war includes all of our social-media platforms and what we read and say and post.

In the digital age we need for our attention to be reset on the nefarious spiritual forces in this world. Unseen forces. Satan is alive and active and we know that is the case because when the truth is being questioned and where lies are spreading their damage there you see his work. Not to be dismissive and not to be funny but in all honesty the plagues of social media prove the existence and ongoing active work of Satan in the world to spread lies. And yet he is unseen.

So we take this by faith: that “we do not wrestle against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the cosmic powers over this present darkness against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.” That cosmic war includes what happens on our screens.

So in this culture is a swirling chaos of ideologies and attacks on the gospel. The call is to stand fast and remain immovable. We must see past the false promises and the idols of the age. We must stand.

Power Struggle

Again Paul belabors this point. Verse 13:

Therefore take up the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand firm.

The letter to the Ephesians is all about a power struggle. A cosmic power struggle. And we are called to stand. Or with-stand. That’s the victory. That’s our war charter. Stand in the breech. Don’t waiver. Don’t give in don’t give up in the spiritual resistance of the age. Resist. Stand.

And with that we move on to the second section of this text. We can stand only if we are outfitted for the war.

2. Gear Up (verses 14–17)

Every war calls for gear. The war gear of our strongest nations today is advanced to the point we have made warfare clean. Drones fly over hostile cities at 60000 feet in the air and then a drone pilot on the other side of the planet in an air-conditioned military office in Houston shoots a missile at a compound in Afghanistan.

But in our battle our latest physical weapons and guns and missiles are powerless because our enemy is not flesh and blood but spiritual. Therefore we can stand only if we are outfitted with the armor and weapons of God.

Ephesians 6 is hand-to-hand combat; it’s wrestling. So Paul transitions to say: it’s time to gear up! And that’s what we see in this next section. We can stand firm against these unseen enemies because we have the right war gear.

Truth and Righteousness

Stand therefore having fastened on the belt of truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness . . . (verse 14)

The belt of truth seems to be authenticity. The character of Christ is our character. Not perfectly but it reflects him. We stand as authentic people people of the truth. That alone will change your texting. No slander no lies no gossip just text the truth.

The breastplate of righteousness is the perfect righteousness of Christ that we have in our justification. We stand in this war because we are justified in Christ. Try to go to war with Satan with only your own self-righteousness and you’ll get slaughtered.

Gospel Readiness

. . . and as shoes for your feet having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace. (verse 15)

These shoes are fitted to our feet. This is gospel readiness. We are always ready to proclaim the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. We are ready to proclaim the happy tidings of God’s reign over all things and his defeat of sin and death and the devil himself.

You can hear in verse 15 an allusion to Isaiah 52:7. There Isaiah says: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news who publishes peace who brings good news of happiness who publishes salvation who says to Zion ‘Your God reigns.’”

What a beautiful charter for our social-media lives online. “How beautiful upon the web are the thumbs of him who shares good news who publishes the peace of God in Christ who shares the good news of our happiness and joy in him and who publishes in his feeds: ‘God reigns!’”

So gospel-ready social-media engagement should be our norm. Standing firm means standing ever ready with the gospel.

Faith to Extinguish

In all circumstances take up the shield of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one . . . (verse 16)

Satan comes at us with an assortment of fiery weapons. Our faith is like a large shield covered in leather and dipped in water and able to extinguish the flaming arrows of Satan. What’s he doing? He’s eliciting a sinful response from us. So quench the temptation. Let it hit and hiss and fizzle out. This is one of the most important takeaways for social media. When slander is shot your way do you respond with slander? When anger is shot at you will you respond with anger? Or are those temptations extinguished by faith?

Because if you seek to glorify God online you will be shot at. You will be slandered. You will be criticized. The fiery darts will fly. And how you respond will be determined by your faith. Can your faith absorb the slander and extinguish it? Or do you get offended and return slander with slander?

Wielding the Word

. . . and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God . . . (verse 17)

The helmet of salvation is essentially your testimony; it’s your story. So our warfare is not simply a call to say the right things and to quote orthodox theologians or even to simply share Bible verses or to re-post religious memes. No. Critical to standing and thus of stewarding social media well is to speak from this place where your testimony of God’s work in your life is the experience out of which you communicate. Your social media emerges from your authentic engagement with God.

And we certainly stand because of the word of God!

Of all the armor of God we are given to stand against Satan only one piece kills. The sword of the Spirit. The word of God a word made effective by the Spirit. The word’s cutting edge is razor sharp because it is whetted by the Spirit. It’s not just mere words or letters on a page. No. The word is made sharp by the Spirit. It pierces. We stand firm by jabbing at Satan with this sword.

As needy souls “The Word of God cuts through the fog of Satan’s lies and shows me where true and lasting happiness is to be found” (John Piper Future Grace 334). The word exposes the false promises of social media. So by our testimony and wielding the word we stand against the lies of what will satisfy us.

So in the flow of the text Paul has said first “Stand fast.” Second “Gear up.” And finally in the third section of our text Paul says “Attack!” in verses 18–20.

3. Attack! (verses 18–20)

Paul drops the “stand firm” language. He’s now on the attack to claim ground. Again not by instruments of death but by using instruments of life: the instruments of prayer and preaching.

Powerful in Prayer

. . . praying at all times in the Spirit with all prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert with all perseverance making supplication for all the saints . . . (verse 18)

“Social media steals from us the gaps of life we could use to pray. Instead of praying without ceasing we tweet without ceasing.”

We underestimate the power of prayer. We deprioritize prayer. And social media steals from us the gaps of life we could use to pray. Instead of praying without ceasing we tweet without ceasing. There’s competition for the gaps of our life and social media too often wins out over prayer. Or as John Piper once tweeted “One of the great uses of Twitter and Facebook will be to prove at the Last Day that prayerlessness was not from lack of time.”

We can be frivolous online. And we can wage war online too. So pray for your friends. Pray for your church. Pray for your witness online. And pray for teachers online. Speaking of John Piper pray for him. A lot of people think online ministry is safe and comfortable tapping of thumbs on clean glass — when in reality it’s war. Pray for John Piper’s war as he seeks to preach the glorious gospel online. He gets attacked for it openly and privately. Pray for him. Pray for all the teachers you benefit from online.

Virtual Emissary

We see this model in Paul in verses 19–20 where Paul says “Pray for me and for my battle!”

. . . and also for me that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel for which I am an ambassador in chains that I may declare it boldly as I ought to speak.

Paul is on the attack now. Paul says “Pray for me that I would put my thoughts to words that I can boldly proclaim Christ to my culture.” Again this spiritual war is about broadcasting truth. That’s relevant to us all.

Verse 20 is amazing and it makes all of Ephesians 6 especially relevant in the age of virtual media. Virtual media is much of our life especially right now during a global pandemic. So instead of meeting together inside a room at a conference we are linked together by this video. It’s not ideal. But it works. It’s a gift from God that we have this way to connect.

But just listen to what Paul says here. Paul says “I’m attacking the darkness with the preaching of the gospel. I’m on the offensive. I’m an emissary for Christ spanning the globe to represent him.” And Paul is chained by his wrist and bound under order to house arrest. Paul calls himself a global emissary for Christ in chains bound to one spot in Rome. And yet Paul shares the gospel with the people around him yes. Paul’s battle plan for gospel advance has also gone virtual. He’s writing letters. He wrote Ephesians and he wrote Philippians and Colossians and Philemon in chains. So Paul says that being bound to one location does not stop prayer and it does not stop preaching; it does not stop gospel advance in light of the spiritual war.

So to talk about the spiritual war of the virtual realm of social media is not I don’t think foreign to the very logic of Paul in Ephesians 6. It’s naturally related because of verse 20 and Paul’s virtual work as a global emissary for Christ “in chains.”

Declare the Victory

Now when Paul says “finally” in verse 10 he is alluding to the fact that this entire section about spiritual battle is rooted in the epistle as a whole particularly the spiritual war of chapter 1. The war we fight in Ephesians 6 is simply an extension of the war we see in Ephesians 1. For the sake of time I’ll simply summarize Paul’s earlier point in Ephesians 1:3–14.

There Paul tells us that Christ has won the battle over every rogue rebel on earth and has unseated the power of every lie on earth and it’s only a matter of time before his final reign over all things ushers in an eternal inheritance for the church. In Christ we are predestined to be lavishly blessed by God. To that end Christ is uniting all of heaven and earth together. That’s our hope and longing: on earth as it is in heaven cosmic harmony and unity.

Because right now heaven and earth are out of sync. Christ came to restore the sync. That means he must die for sinners he must redeem them and inaugurate the new creation in his resurrection which will become our resurrection and will eventually become the resurrection of the whole material world. That’s to come. We fight the spiritual war with Christ’s return in view.

Ephesians is about blood-bought harmony: blood-bought harmony in marriage blood-bought harmony in local churches. These are the first places where the cosmic victory of Christ is to manifest in this world. Harmony in the home and in the church are to remind the powers and principalities that they lost and the sweeping victory of Christ will one day cover the whole globe. But for now the home and the church are little glimpses of victory in light of a cosmic harmony to come.

On the flip side marriages destroyed and churches fractured are Satan’s attempt to make it seem like Christ lost. Do you see how we’ve been pulled into the cosmic battle? So Paul calls us (especially in the broad sweeping books of Colossians and Ephesians) to manifest Christ’s victory in our lives our homes and our churches. Our ethics — how we live — is all about evidencing Christ’s victory.

“We take every thought captive — every tweet captive every text captive every post captive.”

Ephesians and Colossians are both written to show us that all of our ethical situations — in marriage parenting church unity racial reconciliation — declare the victory of Christ. And every spiritual victory in your life every moment that you stand and resist the lies of Satan is a reminder to the demonic realm that they have lost and their final defeat is coming soon. And so we stand.

We stand in the cosmic victory of Christ. He’s already won the decisive victory and one day he is returning to end the war altogether. Until then the cosmic war between Satan and Christ is being fought in our lives in our marriages in our homes in our churches and on our smartphone screens.

Every Post Captive

So although we live in and through this life of flesh we do not wage a physical war. No Paul says in another place: “For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds. We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God and take every thought captive to obey Christ” (2 Corinthians 10:4–5).

Apart from Christ our vast spiritual appetites will be empty.

Apart from Christ we will get trapped in seeking self-glory.

Apart from Christ we cannot escape online false promises.

Apart from Christ there is no hope that we can stand fast in the truth.

We take every thought captive — every tweet captive every text captive every post captive. Every moment is ground that can be taken captive and subjected to the sovereign reign of King Jesus. That’s the art of spiritual war online. That’s what it means to stand online.

When you look at your social-media feed ask yourself a few diagnostic questions:

Is there a war happening here? Or is my social-media feed at a spiritual ceasefire? Who here gets glorified? Is your feed about your own glory or the glory of someone else? What is the source of my happiness according to what I project on social media? Is it Christ or something else that makes me happy?

Again I am not saying our social media are remedied by posting more Bible verses or religious memes. Our social-media feeds are where we battle. It’s the place where your life testimony the essence of who you are in Christ engages with God’s world and God’s word. And out of this authentic fellowship we speak and we make our stand.

Social media is war. Our worst smartphone habits are a result of letting down our guard. The insatiable appetite for self-glory that drives so much of our time online is a lie from Satan a sham. It won’t satisfy us. Social-media addiction simply exposes the depth of our needy souls for God. But it’s a place we can redeem for eternal purposes too. A place where we can stand for Christ.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lb3dpbi5uZXQvcmV2aWV3cy9sZy12ZWx2ZXQtbWVkaWF0ZWstcmV2aWV3LWxncy1iZXN0LXBob25lLWluLWEtd2hpbGUv0gFPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmVvd2luLm5ldC9hbXAvbGctdmVsdmV0LW1lZGlhdGVrLXJldmlldy1sZ3MtYmVzdC1waG9uZS1pbi1hLXdoaWxlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LG Velvet (MediaTek) review: LG's best phone in a while,"Yes I reviewed this phone already. Way back in July I reviewed the Snapdragon 765G version of the LG Velvet which was meant for international markets. Later LG actually sent me the AT&T model which was the same aside from the cellular bands. But more recently MediaTek reached out and offered the T-Mobile model and I jumped on it because this is a different LG Velvet and it's super-rare that we see a phone that's available with different choices of chipset.

The chipset offered here is a MediaTek Dimensity 1000C. That means that it not only has a different CPU and GPU but it also has a different ISP and more. So what does that all mean to you? To be honest not that much.

What I will say is that the Velvet is a handset that I truly enjoyed the first time and this time was even better since I was able to get proper cellular connectivity. It has a unique design a solid camera and more.

Specs

CPU Octa-core MediaTek Dimensity 1000C single-core 2.4GHz single-core 2.2GHz hexa-core 1.8GHz GPU Mali-G57 Display 6.8 inches P-OLED 2460x1080 395ppi Body 6.58x2.91x0.33in 6.63oz Camera 48MP f/1.8 + 8MP f/2.2 ultra-wide + 5MP f/2.4 depth Front: 16MP f/1.9 Video capture 4K - 30fps 1080p - 60fps Front: 4K - 30fps 1080p - 60fps RAM 6GB Storage 128GB Battery 4000mAh Color Pink White OS Android 10 Price $588



It was actually a bit hard to find full specs for this device. For example while MediaTek and LG cite it as having a Dimensity 1000C the chipset should have four Cortex-A77 and four Cortex-A55 cores rather than the 1-1-6 configuration that's listed.

Day one

Note that this is the unboxing video for the first Velvet that I received the international one. I didn't record a video for the T-Mobile model since it would have been much the same although I never received a Dual Screen accessory for this one. And unfortunately the Dual Screen accessories don't actually work with other variants of the phone.

Design

I'd love to tell you that this MediaTek-powered version of the LG Velvet is just a new chipset in the old chassis but that's not actually the case. You'll notice that this one is a tiny bit thicker at 0.33 inches instead of 0.31 inches and it's also heavier at 6.63oz instead of 6.35oz. This doesn't affect the end user a whole lot; indeed it didn't even feel different to me and I didn't know until I looked at the specs.

But there are some other implications here. For one thing you really can't swap cases between the T-Mobile Velvet and others. Notably the cameras actually aren't in the same place. It uses the same raindrop camera design though which feels unique and stylish to me. The main sensor has a bit of a camera bump but the rest are flush with the Pink White chassis.

It also bothered me that this wouldn't work with other Dual Screen accessories. But no LG makes one for the unlocked model one for the AT&T model and one for the T-Mobile model.

Again this really isn't something that the end user isn't going to notice. It's not like everyone has different versions of the Dual Screen accessory. You do however have to make sure that any accessory you buy is for this particular variant of the device.

All of the ports are located on the bottom and along with the USB Type-C port for charging there's also a 3.5mm audio jack something you won't often find in premium phones. For a long time LG kept using 3.5mm headphone jacks because the company made the best headphone jacks in smartphones thanks to the 32-bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC. But that's not included in the LG Velvet making it the first high-end device from the South Korean firm to not have the 32-bit Hi-fi Quad DAC in years.

On the right side there's a power button as you'd expect.

And on the left side there's a volume rocker and a Google Assistant button. And really I despise that Google Assistant button which would look like a power button to anyone that didn't know it was on the other side. I'm not a fan of using digital assistants in my phone in the first place but surely there are better and easier ways to launch one than having a dedicated button. If you're a fan of virtual assistant buttons you're going to love it.

I really do like the design of the LG Velvet. It's not big and bulky like many premium phones that we're seeing. It's actually a bit reserved while still using pretty colors feeling premium and looking unique.

Display

The LG Velvet packs a 6.8-inch 2460x1080 P-OLED display and it looks quite nice even if it lacks the high refresh rates that we've seen in other devices around this price point. This is one thing that really doesn't change from the Snapdragon version to the Dimensity version.

It's not a particularly large screen as it's measured diagonally and has an exceptionally tall 20.5:9 aspect ratio. It feels very comfortable to hold because not only is the screen curved on the sides but so is the back.

The screen gets to a comfortable brightness for outdoor use and the colors are nice and vibrant as you'd expect from one of LG's P-OLED displays. That also means that the black is true black making it harder to tell where the screen ends and the bezel begins. This makes it perfect for the always-on display feature which shows the time and date and there are additional customization options that let you add a second clock an image and more.

This is the part that I'd love to tell you about the Dual Screen accessory and all of the things you can do with a dual-screen phone but like I said I wasn't able to obtain one for this phone. If you want to learn more about how it should work you can check out my review of the Snapdragon model. I don't want to assume that things work a certain way with this model because if I did I'd have assumed that the previous Dual Screen accessory would work with this.

Camera

The LG Velvet packs a 48MP f/1.8 camera along with an 8MP ultra-wide sensor and a 5MP depth sensor. The sensors are the same as you'd find on the Snapdragon one although obviously this one has a different ISP. I was kind of curious to see if the ISP would result in different-looking images but as it turns out there's no noticeable difference.

LG also has some fun features such as an AR sticker mode in the Camera app. As you can imagine it can apply various effects to your face while you're taking the picture. It's not really my thing but it's fine for people that enjoy it.

As for video recording you can do 4K 30fps or 1080p 60fps and what's pretty cool is that you can do it with both the front and rear cameras. Unfortunately the ultra-wide lens can only do 1080p 30fps. I'd have liked to see 4K 60fps video recording on here. It's something that we've had on the premium end for a few years now and it's time to start bringing it to lower price points.

Gallery: LG Velvet (MediaTek) samples

I had some fun with the unique lighting conditions that are caused by snowstorms both during the day and at night. It handled it well much better than the Motorola phones I was reviewing at the time. It's got a night mode too which is pretty good and it includes a simple slider to make it nice and easy to decide just how bright your photo will be.

Performance and battery life

When I reviewed the Snapdragon model that was actually the first Snapdragon 765G device that I reviewed and I remarked at how surprised I was at how little I missed the flagship Snapdragon 8 series processor. The same goes for the MediaTek 1000C chipset in the T-Mobile version of the Velvet and its 6GB of RAM. Never did I find myself wishing that it was faster than it was.

Indeed I often like to point out that modern flagship processors offer way more power than we actually need. So now that flagship phones are getting really expensive it's worth this new high-end tier existing.

Dimensity is MediaTek's brand for its 5G chipsets so yes it supports T-Mobile's nationwide 5G network. In fact this might be the first 5G phone in the U.S. without a Qualcomm processor. It only supports sub-6GHz 5G which is fine. MediaTek only recently joined the mmWave market but both the unlocked and AT&T variants were also sub6-only. It's just the Verizon version that supports both since Verizon actually had a mmWave-only network for a while.

Honestly 5G really isn't a big deal right now. Companies want you to think it is but it's not. Don't get me wrong; your next phone should absolutely be 5G but right now it's not going to improve your life in any way meaningful or not. Sub6 5G really isn't much of an improvement on 4G LTE and mmWave 5G only works outdoors and in line-of-sight with a base station.

My only real complaint in this department for the Velvet is the battery life. A lot of times I did have to charge it during the day and the 4000mAh battery is smaller than the 4300mAh one in the Snapdragon model even though this one is thicker. I don't really ask much out of phones when it comes to battery life but I do expect them to make it through the day.

For benchmarks I used Geekbench 5 AnTuTu and GFXBench. First up is Geekbench 5 which tests the CPU.

Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765G in the other model benchmarked just a bit better than this one on single-core with 615 but the MediaTek processor blew away the other unit in multi-core where it got 1953. Next up is AnTuTu which tests everything.

The Snapdragon model narrowly came out ahead in the overall test with 321441 where the MediaTek Dimensity 1000C did better in the CPU and memory departments but the Snapdragon 765G did better in the GPU department. UX was almost the same between the two.

Finally GFXBench tests out the GPU.

As you can see there isn't a big performance difference between the Snapdragon 765G and the MediaTek Dimensity 1000C. They're both great chipsets and you won't have any regrets with either one.

Conclusion

The LG Velvet is one of the best LG phones that I've seen in years. It's not filled with annoying software pop-ups and frankly I love the design. The previous device from LG was the V60 ThinQ and while it was nice it was actually really heavy and bulky. That's not the feeling I get from the Velvet. The Velvet is sleek and comfortable.

Obviously it's not perfect and my biggest complaint is the battery life. It's also a real shame to see LG ditch its 32-bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC; honestly if that's not going to be included I'm fine with LG getting rid of the headphone jack entirely. And finally we're seeing 90Hz screens in sub-$500 phones now so that's really something I'd have liked to have seen.

But overall this is just a pleasant device to use. The camera does a great job of taking excellent pictures with minimum effort. Really it just checks the right boxes with a stylish design that comes in sexy colors excellent performance for the price and more.

If you want to check it out you can find the LG Velvet on T-Mobile's store here.

Kyla Ernst-Alper is an aerialist in New York City. She's never had an employer that offered her a 401(k) retirement plan in more than two decades of performing. Giles Clement

Kyla Ernst-Alper a 38-year-old aerial performer in New York City has never had a 401(k) retirement plan. She holds multiple jobs at once to support herself and none of them offer her any retirement options. She socks away what she can in an individual retirement account but those savings are not always consistent. That's due to her line of work which was especially hard hit when live shows were canceled because of the public health crisis. ""Before the pandemic people in my community were barely paying their bills"" Ernst-Alper said. ""You're lucky if you're able to save money."" The 401(k) is framed today as the main way for Americans to save for retirement especially as traditional pensions become less common. However a large share of workers particularly low-income earners women and people of color are left behind by lack of access to the plans. More from Invest in You:

Americans more in debt than ever and 'money disorders' may be to blame

How much money do you need to retire? Start with $1.7 million Overall around half of private sector workers aren't covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan either because their company doesn't have one or because they're not eligible for the one offered according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. In addition a growing number of American workers generally can't access a 401(k) because they're contractors or self-employed. Those who don't have access to an employer-sponsored plan can fall behind without perks such as employers' matching contributions or the auto-enrollment of employees. As a result 1 in 4 American workers don't have even $10000 saved for retirement. ""For many demographic groups the typical working-age household either has no retirement account savings at all or only a trivial amount"" said Monique Morrissey an economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.

They will face a greater risk of poverty in retirement. Catherine Collinson CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies

To be sure experts say that while 401(k) plans have their problems they shouldn't be discontinued. When utilized they can be powerful savings tools — the average 401(k) holding of an investor in their 20s in 2019 was $10500 according to Fidelity. Those in their 30s had an average of $38400 saved while those in their 40s 50s and 60s had averages of $93400 $160000 and $182100 respectively. ""I don't mean to say 'Get rid of 401(k) plans'"" said Steve Vernon a consulting research scholar at the Stanford Center of Longevity. ""I just mean they need to be improved."" That improvement should take the form of more access said Nevin Adams chief content officer at the American Retirement Association. Indeed when people are offered the chance to save in a 401(k) they take it. According to a survey by the Plan Sponsor Council of America nearly 90% of employees who had access to a 401(k) at work in 2019 made contributions to their plan Here's who the plans currently leave behind. (Many people fall into multiple categories.)

Small-business workers

Large companies are far more likely than small companies to offer a 401(k) plan to their workers said Catherine Collinson CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. While 92% of companies with 500 or more employees offered a 401(k) or similar plan in 2019 only 57% of businesses with under 99 workers did according to a Transamerica Center survey. ""Employers that do not offer plans tend to be new small have relatively few employees and/or employ a transient temporary part-time and/or lower-wage workforce"" Angie Chen assistant director of savings research at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College wrote in an email. Many of these workers don't have the time to advocate for change. ""These employees often have pressing financial needs that typically crowd out any demand for employer-provided retirement security"" Chen said.

Low- and middle-income workers

Higher-income individuals are far more likely to be offered a 401(k) at work than those with lower incomes which only exacerbates retirement savings inequality. More than 70% of workers from household incomes over $100000 have access to a 401(k) compared to 50% of those from household incomes below $50000 Transamerica found. ""Disparities in income and access to retirement benefits suggest lower-income workers will inevitably rely on Social Security for a larger proportion of their retirement income"" Collinson said. (The average Social Security check is under $1400.) ""They will face a greater risk of poverty in retirement.""

Gig and part-time workers

Chase Kensrue

401(k) plans are mostly associated with full-time traditional employment. Yet research has found that the share of American workers engaged in temporary or unsteady work is rising rapidly. Many of these workers who make their living on apps or only work for companies on a freelance basis will not have access to a company retirement plan. Indeed only 41% of part-time workers were offered a 401(k) plan by their employer the Transamerica survey found. Though it is possible to establish and contribute to a so-called solo 401(k) without a nudge to join or auto-enroll features from an employer many gig workers forgo these options. Danny Samet from Cincinnati has always worked freelance as a tour manager and merchandiser for bands jumping from one gig to the next. He's never saved in a company-sponsored retirement plan thought he puts away what he can in a few different IRAs. In his industry he said most people don't have any savings for their later years. ""There are lot of people that aren't setting themselves up for retirement"" Samet 28 said.

A shift in US investor flows away from mutual funds towards exchange traded funds is being driven primarily by a tax loophole rather than any inherent advantage of the ETF structure a team of academics has concluded.

In the past decade US investors have pulled $1tn from actively managed US mutual funds with a similar amount flowing into ETFs.

Although the mutual fund sector is still far larger the majority of US mutual fund ranges have seen net outflows every year since 2014 according to the Investment Company Institute even as about three-quarters of ETFs have seen inflows.

The dramatic shift is leading some large asset managers such as Dimensional Fund Advisors Fidelity and T Rowe Price to either convert some of their existing mutual funds into ETFs or launch ETF clones of their existing funds.

However research by Rabih Moussawi Ke Shen and Raisa Velthuis of Villanova University the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and Lehigh University suggests the migration into ETFs is being driven primarily by tax considerations rather than other factors such as ETFs’ typically lower costs and greater liquidity.

“ETFs’ tax advantage is the main catalyst behind the massive flow migration from active mutual funds to ETFs over the last two decades” they wrote.

“This was kind of a surprise to us” said Moussawi. “Everybody speaks of how important fees and underperformance are in driving these outflows [from mutual funds].”

The greater tax efficiency of ETFs at least in the US stems from a quirk in the system for capital gains tax.

When mutual fund investors want to redeem their units the fund sells a slice of its underlying holdings in a “cash” transaction.

If these holdings have appreciated since the fund purchased them a capital gains tax liability is triggered for the fund and all of its investors even those who are not redeeming. This liability can also be triggered whenever the fund manager makes changes to the underlying portfolio.

From a policy point of view I think [the different tax treatment of ETFs and mutual funds] should be addressed head on. It’s not fair and it’s not a level playing field

In contrast when faced with redemption requests ETFs do not usually need to sell their underlying securities. Instead they can deliver baskets of securities “in-kind” to their authorised participants the large banks that create and redeem shares in ETFs.

As a result the trading activity and any resultant capital gain occurs outside the fund so there is no pass-through to the end-investor.

This can make a significant difference. Last year some mutual funds managed by the likes of Columbia Threadneedle Invesco JPMorgan and T Rowe Price made capital gains tax distributions equivalent to double-digit percentages of their net assets with some as high as 30 per cent according to Morningstar.

Previous research has estimated that a group of about 400 ETFs investing in US equities deferred taxes on more than $211bn of gains in 2018 alone.

By avoiding the distribution of realised capital gains the average ETF has had a tax burden 0.92 percentage points lower than that of the typical mutual fund over the past five years Moussawi et al found.

Their research looked at individual mutual funds with relatively high tax burdens and found that they saw more outflows from tax-sensitive investors at the same time as ETFs with similar investment styles enjoyed strong inflows.

Moreover the paper found that take-up of ETFs is most pronounced among registered investment advisers with wealthy clients who are most likely to be liable for capital gains tax. In 2017 ETFs accounted for 21 per cent of the overall portfolio of such advisers compared to 5 per cent for RIAs with clients of lesser means.

This divergence widened sharply after 2012 when President Barack Obama raised capital gains tax rates to 43.4 per cent for short-term gains and 23.8 per cent for longer-term ones (rates subsequently cut by President Donald Trump) the research found.

“The tax change accelerated substitution. People wanted to get out of mutual funds. Tax management is a big benefit of RIAs for wealthy investors” Moussawi said.

Todd Rosenbluth head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research said he was “surprised” by the finding that greater tax efficiency was the primary driver of flows to ETFs given that “investors that are doing so are paying less and their focus is on relative performance”.

Although the tax liability is in theory only deferred not avoided it does allow investors to convert short-term capital gains to long-term gains slashing the tax rate. Even without this benefit Jack Bogle the father of index investing described deferral as an interest-free government loan that is reinvested in the ETF.

Furthermore Moussawi said some wealthy investors were passing on their portfolios to their heirs “so increasingly we are seeing that these investors are not paying any CGT on their ETF investments”.

The findings come at a time when calls to end the disparate tax treatment of mutual funds and ETFs are starting to gain some political traction.

ETFs’ favourable tax treatment “leads to externalities on other investors and taxpayers” the paper said. “Policymakers may want to further study who bears the costs of ETF tax efficiency especially since it presents an unequitable treatment of different investors.”

While “scrapping the exemption would be difficult . . . from a policy point of view I think it should be addressed head on. It’s not fair and it’s not a level playing field” said Moussawi.

If nothing changes “we will have [tax exempt] retirement accounts and then all taxable investments going to ETFs. From a tax policy point of view is this something they want to happen?” he said.

Ben Johnson director of global ETF research at Morningstar said many people had raised this issue which “to some comes across as unfair tax treatment between mutual funds and ETFs and that the ETF treatment is a loophole that needs closing.”

However Johnson said: “what Morningstar has long argued is that if anything the playing field should be levelled by taxing mutual funds in the same way as ETFs are effectively taxed and in the same way mutual fund investors are taxed in our other tax regimes.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMva2luZC1zaGFyZWhvbGRlcnMtb3duLWJ1bmdlLWxpbWl0ZWQtMDcwMzE3NTU0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Kind Of Shareholders Own Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG)?,"A look at the shareholders of Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) can tell us which group is most powerful. Institutions often own shares in more established companies while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership.

With a market capitalization of US$11b Bunge is rather large. We'd expect to see institutional investors on the register. Companies of this size are usually well known to retail investors too. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below) it seems that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups to learn more about Bunge.

Check out our latest analysis for Bunge

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Bunge?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register especially if they are growing.

Bunge already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Bunge's earnings history below. Of course the future is what really matters.

Institutional investors own over 50% of the company so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Bunge. T. Rowe Price Group Inc. is currently the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. In comparison the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.2% and 6.6% of the stock.

After doing some more digging we found that the top 15 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting too.

Insider Ownership Of Bunge

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business but the CEO will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Bunge Limited. As it is a large company we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$88m worth of shares. In this sort of situation it can be more interesting to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public with a 17% stake in the company will not easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Bunge better we need to consider many other factors. To that end you should learn about the 4 warning signs we've spotted with Bunge (including 3 which are significant) .

Roula Khalaf Editor of the FT selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Cannabis stocks are the latest to experience the often shortlived high provided by Reddit exposure.

Social media has proved a powerful driver of retail sentiment so far this year leaving investors and analysts to wonder which company might become the next GameStop.

The focus turned to pot stocks this week: three of the top five most discussed companies on the r/WallStreetBets forum on Wednesday were cannabis companies according to alternative data provider Quiver Quantitative.

Money has followed. Retail investors have poured more than $440m into cannabis stocks since the start of February double the entire previous month according to Vanda Research.

That sent prices spiralling before falling away this week. US-listed Canadian cannabis producer Tilray started the week at about $25 a share then raced to an intraday high of $67 on Wednesday before crashing back to $29 by Friday close. The company was the second most-traded share on Robinhood’s trading app on Thursday.

“A herd of rampant bulls is running amok in the meme stock shop and the cannabis industry is their sector du jour” Ben Johnson director of passive funds research at Morningstar said.

Tilray has been the subject of retail investor attention before. Following its initial public offering in 2018 the price briefly rocketed to $300 a share thanks to a so-called short squeeze — where investors pile into a stock that has been subject to negative bets forcing hedge funds to reverse their positions fuelling the rally.

Canadian cannabis producer Sundial was also among the most traded shares on the Robinhood platform on Thursday. Its share price rose from just above $1 on Monday to with spitting distance of $4 on Thursday before tumbling to $2 by Friday. But it is still about 83 per cent higher for the week.

“You see a certain amount of names gaining traction on Reddit r/WallStreetBets Twitter and StockTwits well in advance of the big move the hype is created and there’s a network effect” said Viraj Patel senior strategist at Vanda Research. “Then you see the flows the money and finally the price action happens.”

This herd behaviour is unusual in the way that investors move into one asset category and out of another extremely quickly Patel said.

Cannabis bulls point to the favourable path of US policy: flows into cannabis shares have grown since the US election when legalisation passed in many state ballots. The top five shares traded on Robinhood the day after the election were all cannabinoid companies.

Canadian cannabis operators are able to list on US exchanges because they operate legally in Canada. However American companies are largely unable to list on US exchanges because cannabis remains illegal at a federal level. Shares trade on Canadian exchanges and off-exchange “pink sheets” instead.

Specialist investors argued that retail investors by driving money into Canadian companies were not picking investments that would benefit from federal legalisation in the US. Some are even taking to social media to try and educate them on ways to invest in American cannabis such as through exchange traded funds that offer more exposure to the US market including via derivatives.

“We are trying to help young investors understand the difference between US and Canadian cannabis” said Todd Harrison of CB1 Capital a manager that specialises in cannabis investment. “Fundamentals matter. Unless these investors find the right vehicle it’s going to be a short exercise” said Harrison.

Assets under management by cannabis-tracking ETFs are at an all-time high of $1.9bn according to data provider TrackInsight. January flows of $527m tripled the previous record set in December 2020.

Sector bulls call potential legalisation “Prohibition 2.0” likening it to the period of time after the Great Depression when the alcohol ban in the US was lifted and moonshine manufacturers became established brand names.

But analysts caution that the fundamentals of US cannabis companies remain unproven and the hurdles to federal legislation are significant.

“Prohibition 2.0 is a fun narrative” said Johnson. But he added “investors in this sector have been pretty disappointed in the past by how it has performed. At the end of the day fundamentals will win out.”",,,,,,

Setting a new record the Dow Jones Industrial Average remained above the psychologically significant 31000-mark but ended Thursday’s session lower. Following a similar pattern the S&P 500 Index made modest gains and reached a new peak mid-week before paring a part of the gains in the following session.

Meanwhile COVID-related filings for unemployment benefit remained elevated last week resulting in first-time claims of about 793000 which was above economists’ prediction.

Elsewhere Israel-based online marketplace Fiverr acquired New York-headquartered creative network Working not Working for an undisclosed amount. Hormel Foods the company behind several popular food brands this week gobbled up Kraft Heinz Company’s snack nut portfolio Planters in a deal worth $3.4 billion. In another major deal gaming giant Electronic Arts agreed to buy Glu Mobile for $2.1 billion.

With the earnings season entering the final phase the coming week will be a lean period for Wall Street in terms of financial releases. Drug store chain CVS Health Co. which is set for a mass COVID vaccination drive is schedule to unveil fourth-quarter numbers on February 16 before the opening bell. The only other major companies reporting in the holiday-shortened week are Analog Devices and Baidu are – February 17. The typically busy Thursday will see muted activity.

Investors’ attention was mostly focused on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo this week amid speculations about their fiscal performance in the final months of 2020 after staying resilient to the pandemic thus far. The soft drink giants published stronger-than-expected earnings mid-week.

In a sign that Canadian cannabis firms have a long way to go before achieving sustainable growth market leader Canopy Growth Tuesday reported a wider loss for the most recent quarter. Aurora Cannabis which unveiled results on Thursday also reported a loss.

The other major firms to have published earnings in the last few days include Cisco and Twitter – Thursday. General Motors reported Wednesday and the next day Walt Disney came out with a surprise profit for the first quarter.

Where did the name Walmart come from? Costco? Best Buy? McDonald’s? Target was given its name by a publicity director at the company which at the time was the retailer’s parent company–Dayton’s Company. The date was May 1 1962.

Dayton later Dayton-Hudson Corporation was founded in 1902 by George Draper Dayton. It was originally based in Minneapolis MN. It remained Minnesota-based for decades. Through a series of several mergers it spread its geographic footprint. By the time it merged with J.L Hudson of Detroit in 1969 it was one of the 15 largest retailers in the country.

Dayton had a problem. Its department stores were not discount stores and therefore did not draw customers based on price. The term “Target” was meant to change that. As the plan emerged to build stores with huge footprints in terms of square footage that focused on “value” Dayton’s publicity chief Stewart K. Widdess thought up the name to differentiate it from the company’s core department store locations. Over the years Target’s size and its number of stores have dwarfed its original parent.

The first Target store opened in Roseville Minnesota. The rapidly growing retailer went public on October 18 1967.

Currently Target has 1897 stores in all 50 states. (It finally added a store in Vermont in 2018). According to the National Retail Federation’s “Top 100 Retailers 2020 List” Target is the 8th largest retailer in America based on revenue of $77 billion. That puts it behind Walmart Amazon Kroger Costco Walgreen’s Home Depot and CVS.

According to Target it has 350000 employees. Seventy-five percent of the American population it claims is within 10 miles of a Target location. Target’s market capitalization is $96 billion.

Since most of the retailers larger than Target are not classic discount stores its real competitors are Costco and Walmart. Since Costco is a “paid membership” retailer Walmart is the only actual competitor. Like every retailer in the country Target faces Amazon’s online dominance.

All large retailers including Target faced revenues that were battered by the drop shopping brought on by the pandemic. Even before that Target’s growth had slowed most likely because of the move of retail consumers online. Since that movement has accelerated in the last year Target faces a challenge harder than it has in years–or perhaps since it was founded.

In Indonesia's framework of ecosystem development and EV battery development SOEs will carry out 7 (seven) essential stages: mining refining precursor plant cathode plant battery cell battery pack and recycling.

Pertamina will work in the four middle fields namely precursor cathode battery cell and battery pack. While at the recycling stage Pertamina will work together with PLN. As for the upstream sector PT Antam and Inalum will work together.

President Director of Pertamina Nicke Widyawati explained that Pertamina would ensure that the stages and steps in developing EV Battery go well. In 2021 Pertamina and three other SOEs will form a joint venture company (Joint Venture) Indonesia Battery Corporation / IBC. Pertamina has also collaborated with two global companies and is exploring cooperation with other companies.

""The development of the battery industry which has great potential in Indonesia is for mobility especially two wheels or motorbikes that are potentially faster than four wheels"" she said.

The second continued Nicke is the Energy Storage System (ESS). According to her the opportunity to develop ESS is quite large in Indonesia because there is a potential to maintain supply reliability from PLTS (Solar Power Plants).

""ESS is a big market. So in the future Pertamina will also enter there"" said Nicke.

Regarding the Solar Power Plants as a pioneer Pertamina has built Solar Power Plant at the Badak Refinery with a capacity of 4 MW then continued with the construction of Solar Power Plants in several other refinery areas such as in Dumai and Cilacap and Sei Mangkei. At the end of last year Pertamina also succeeded in installing Solar Rooftops at 63 petrol stations. This effort will continue into the following years with the target of all petrol stations and other Pertamina operational facilities throughout Indonesia. **",,,

This is a pretty usual conversation regarding these voice activated assistants. Several years ago I automated most of my house including of course almost all the lighting. I remember immediately dispensing with the idea that it was cool to take out your phone and control lights from an app. Sure it was an interesting new-tech demo to show how your home is automated but not very convenient in practice. The useful automation was from scheduled or reactive tasks like turning on the porch light at dusk turn on the kitchen room light when someone comes in after dark turn off most lights when I leave the house but randomize a few for security things like that.The slightly later advent of Echo and Google Home type devices allowed much more ad hoc control of lights fans etc using simple voice requests. It's become my first-choice method over flipping wall switches. You can have typical groups set up (""turn on the evening lights"" or ""turn off all the lights"") and you don't have to interrupt anything youre doing - unless there's so much background noise or other talking that the unit can't isolate your voice (I haven't activated the capability for personalized recognition of my unique voice which might help with that; so far it's not important enough for me to want the deeper relationship with the AI entity).But regarding your very good question about timed events (do an action at a certain time after a certain delay interval and/or for a certain duration):I'd say that this is about the biggest shortcoming I've experienced so far and it's very annoying that Alexa (and I think Google devices also) AFAIK cannot do this in a natural way. I suspect there may be some patent issues from legacy automation makers (eg Control4 Honeywell or the like). It's surprisingly hard to find a good discussion/explanation of why such basic capabilities are not supported. You can easily say ""remind me to turn off the light in ten minutes"" and you'll be correctly prompted but currently you cannot say ""turn off the kitchen light in ten minutes"" or ""turn on the kitchen light for two minutes"" etc.As a work-around you can set up a very specific routine""Turn on the kitchen light for two minutes"" which in use performs that very specific action. But then not a similar action with a different light or a different time interval nor at a specific time of day. An observer might think it understood your time-based request but it's phony - you'd have to create a incredibly huge number of such specific named routines to have it respond to all variants and that’s clearly ridiculous.As yet I have no personal experience with various Tesla app(s) using Alexa but considering the above I'd expect that you could easily pre-program a fewrecurring phrase-routines like ""warm up the car at 8AM"" or ""get the car ready in half an hour"". But again you'd be limited to the exact time value(s) in your pre-programmed library of routines. More practically you could simply bypass the voice request method and create a routine to have it prepare the car every weekday at 8AM with no prompting on your part.I hope they address this serious timed-action deficiency but as I said there must be some good explanation known to the insiders. It's one of those things where you search online for a solution to your problem you quickly find a bunch of other people asking about the same problem but no good answer.Here's an article from 2019 that at least acknowledges the problem and talks about new capabilities to address it (but not really IMO).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvaWRVU0tCTjJBRDBNSS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla to set up electric car manufacturing unit in southern India,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2AD0MI/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvaWRVU0tCTjJBRDBNSS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMS8wMi8xMy90ZXNsYS1pbnRyb2R1Y2VzLW5ldy1jZW50ZXItY29uc29sZS1tb2RlbC15LWVsZWN0cmljLXN1di_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla introduces new center console in Model Y electric SUV,"Tesla has started to introduce its new center console in the Model Y electric SUV after bringing it to the Model 3 last year.

Instead of having a phone charger added to the top section it has now been embedded into the console’s top section which is now wrapped in the faux leather material around on all side.

The center section now slides open instead of with a flipping system in the previous version.

That system has been known to be flimsy at times for some owners while the new sliding system is more robust and less subject to staying open.

The new center console was only integrated into the new Model 3 and not the Model Y despite the fact that the two vehicles were sharing an interior prior to the changes.

Now a few months later TMC member joeinsac found a few brand-new Tesla Model Y at the Tesla center in Rocklin California and they were equipped with the new center console:

One of the vehicles was showing a VIN 122778 and a build date of 02/09/2021 which can give us an indication of around when Tesla made the change in the Model Y.

Although the automaker still shows the old center console on the online configurator for the electric SUV:

Therefore it’s unclear if all new Model Y vehicles are being built with the new center console or if Tesla is still transitioning the interior.

At times Tesla has been known to make hardware changes gradually whenever they are ready and still produce some vehicles with some older hardware.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vdGVzbGEtbGVhc2UtdG8tYnV5LW9wdGlvbnMtZXVyb3BlLWFzaWEv0gFFaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGVzbGFyYXRpLmNvbS90ZXNsYS1sZWFzZS10by1idXktb3B0aW9ucy1ldXJvcGUtYXNpYS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla finally offers lease-to-buy options for Model 3 and Y but it’s not available everywhere,"By

Tesla is starting to offer the option to purchase its all-electric Model 3 and Model Y vehicles at the conclusion of a leasing period in some markets in Europe and Asia.

For some time Tesla has not allowed owners to purchase their cars at the end of a leasing period. The car is to be returned to the automaker with no chance of a leaseholder buying out the car at the conclusion of the period. The car would be added to the company’s used inventory to third-party resalers or reserved for the future use of the Robotaxi fleet.

Tesla’s Leasing Program

Tesla’s leasing policy is one of the few automotive programs that is subjected to a required return policy at the conclusion of a leasing period. In its 2020 10-K filing with the SEC Tesla details its process for receiving leased vehicles when the period is terminated.

The company states:

“Our used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the trade-in of a customer’s existing Tesla or non-Tesla vehicle with the sale of a new or used Tesla vehicle. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins are subsequently remarketed either directly by us or through third parties. We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns.”

In some markets in the U.S. Canada and Europe Tesla did allow Model S and Model X leaseholders with the option to purchase the vehicle at the end of the lease period.

Tesla says:

“At the end of the lease term customers are required to return the vehicles to us or for Model S and Model X leases in certain regions may opt to purchase the vehicles for a pre-determined residual value.”

This program did not apply to the Model 3 or Model Y as anyone who leased either of these cars would be required to relinquish possession of the vehicle with no chance of purchasing it at the end of the lease. However Tesla added a new section to the 10-K in 2020 detailing the possibility of a lease-to-buy option in some markets in Europe and Asia and it applies to the Model 3 and Model Y. The company writes “This is not available with the Model 3 and Model Y” on its website.

Lease-to-Buy Option for Model 3 and Model Y in Europe and Asia

Tesla added new language to the 2020 10-K filing that details its decision to allow lease-to-buy options on its vehicles in Europe and Asia.

The company wrote:

“We have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842 in certain countries in Asia and Europe which we introduced in volume during the third quarter of 2020. Depending on the specific program customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to us during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to return the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for which there is a right to return the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments.”

In summation Tesla is offering the option to buy a vehicle at the end of a lease in some markets. The customer has the option to return the vehicle as well in some cases and Tesla is “reasonably certain” that the leaseholder will take possession of the vehicle title when the lease ends.

Teslarati obtained a list of the countries where this lease-to-buy option is available according to the Online Design Studio. Some countries have explicit language that states the vehicle leaseholder must return the vehicle while others indicate there is an option to purchase the car at the end of a lease. Some do not have any language that indicates what the leaseholder must do which could indicate that the option to purchase the vehicle is available at the conclusion of the leasing period.

The countries where a lease-to-buy option is available are:

Belgium

Croatia

Denmark

France

Italy

the Netherlands

Poland

Taiwan

A few examples show that there is explicit language that indicates a lease can be purchased outright at the end of the period.

France’s Design Studio contains language that indicates the vehicle can be purchased outright at the conclusion of a leasing period. Taiwan’s Design Studio explicitly states the vehicle can be bought outright at the end of a lease period.

Other Design Studio examples show that the vehicle must be returned to Tesla at the end of the leasing period.

Tesla does not give the option to buy the vehicle outright at the end of the lease in Germany. Tesla explicitly tells U.S. leaseholders that they “forgo the option to buy your car at the end of the lease and must return it to Tesla after the lease term.”

Lastly other Design Studios show no language either way which seems to indicate the option to buy the car is available as the lease term expires.

Tesla Poland has no explicit language stating that the car must be returned to Tesla. Tesla Italy also does not indicate specifically if the car should be returned to Tesla at the end of a lease.

Poland is one country where Tesla does not indicate whether the car is required to be returned at the end of a lease period. However the option to buy the car at the end of the lease is available according to one Polish Model 3 leaseholder who spoke to Teslarati. Model 3 leaseholder Szymon Janus said that Tesla does allow lease-to-buy options in his country of Poland and at the end of the lease can be purchased for “around 60% of the new car’s value” he said. However Tesla isn’t offering the lease-purchase option directly it is operated through a bank he says. This could be why Tesla has no explicit language depicting the required return of the vehicle at the lease’s end date.

Tesla has not revealed any further details within its 10-K filing that indicate whether the company will allow leased vehicles to be purchased at the end of a leasing period. However it did detail some specific financial figures.

Tesla said:

“For the year ended December 31 2020 we recognized $120 million of sales-type leasing revenue and $87 million of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.”

One of the foremost automotive manufacturing experts in the country has high hopes for Tesla's long-awaited ""full self-driving"" (FSD) mode.

During a February 2 one-on-one interview with Elon Musk for his YouTube channel Sandy Munro — an industry consultant who has come down hard on Tesla's build quality in the past — lauded the beta version of FSD. This came after he had a chance to experience during a ride-along with one of the few Tesla owners who has access to the new software.

""[I've] never ever seen anything like what you've got in the new self-driving thing"" Munro told Tesla's CEO. ""This is just absolutely brilliant. This should get into the marketplace as fast as possible.""

Munro who is known for his in-depth teardown videos of cars especially Teslas posted a video of the ride-along on Monday in which he praises the system for its accuracy and its ""aggressive"" way of driving.

""Right off the bat I'm very impressed. Actually my best hope was less than what I just saw"" Munro said during the ride. ""I'm an aggressive driver — this drives aggressively.""

In his talk with Musk Munro said he thinks FSD will constitute a massive development in automotive safety when it hits the market claiming it ""will save more lives than airbags seatbelts and anything else"" to which Musk agreed.

But Tesla's automated-driving software — at least in its early stages — doesn't come without potential risks. Transportation experts and politicians have criticized Tesla's Autopilot feature — which can brake accelerate and steer automatically but doesn't make cars fully autonomous — as misleading branding.

The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration maintains that no vehicle on the market can drive itself and has opened investigations into Autopilot's role in several crashes that had inattentive drivers. Tesla for its part says on its website that both Autopilot and FSD currently require full driver attention.

During Munro's video the FSD system only encountered minor hiccups such as stopping for a stop sign in the middle of a block rather than at an intersection. However since Tesla released the beta software last fall numerous clips have surfaced online of owners having to step in at the last minute to avoid collisions.

FSD is currently a $10000 option and Musk said in December that it will be available in early 2021 as a subscription."

The new aircraft will add to their already large fleet of Beechcraft King Air aircraft. Deliveries are expected to begin in 2021 and continue through 2023. The Beechcraft King Air 360 is designed and manufactured by Textron Aviation Inc. a Textron Inc. company.

“By providing a wide range of essential healthcare services to regional rural and remote communities the mission scope of the RFDS requires 24-hours-a-day seven-days-a-week operational availability for the vast territory of the state of Queensland” said Bob Gibbs vice president Special Missions Sales. “We are honored that the RFDS in evaluating its choices for this fleet continues to choose the Beechcraft King Air as the platform of choice for these crucial operations.”

The six Beechcraft King Air turboprops configured for multi-stretcher air ambulance operations will be equipped with a factory installed aft cargo door heavy weight operations package and Pratt and Whitney PT6A-67A engines for additional performance capabilities. With its corporate office located within the Brisbane Airport precinct the RFDS currently operates 20 aircraft across eight operational bases located at Brisbane Cairns Townsville Rockhampton Bundaberg Charleville Mount Isa and Roma.

The King Air the most popular twin-turboprop model in Australia provides unrivaled performance in terms of operational cost speed and runway access throughout Queensland. Textron Aviation supports nearly 200 King Air aircraft in a variety of configurations throughout Australia.

“The King Air is the world leader in twin-turboprop special missions because of the aircraft’s unmatched capabilities and reliability” added Gibbs. “Continuing to be a trusted supplier for emergency services in Australia is a testament to the King Air’s performance when every minute matters.”

RFDS (Queensland Section) Chief Executive Officer Meredith Staib said it was vital that the Service one of the world’s largest and most comprehensive aeromedical organisations remained “future fit” as it neared 100 years of operation. “The Beechcraft King Air 360 aircraft forms a key part of our 10-year aircraft replacement strategy which will ensure we can continue to deliver world-class aeromedical retrievals and healthcare to regional rural and remote Australians” she said.

“Our highly trained and skilled aviation staff are looking forward to experiencing the technology advances offered with the B360 including improved performance and efficiency ultimately improving runway access. I am sure our medical crews and patients will also enjoy the enhanced flying experience.”

Late January 2021 exact date unknown three UH-1H-IIs destined for the Lebanese Air Force (LAF) have been airlifted by an Antonov Airlines An-124 Ruslan to Beirut Air Base (Lebanon).

United States Ambassador Dorothy Shea participated in a small ceremony to commemorate the donation of the three Huey IIs highlighting the importance of ongoing cooperation and coordination between the United States and Lebanon specifically in the defence sector. The trio which will form a critical part of the LAF’s border and land security operations are valued at over USD 32 million.

The Huey II is an upgraded version of Bell UH-1H multi-mission medium-lift helicopter designed and manufactured by Bell Helicopter a subsidiary of Textron at Fort Worth (TX). The upgrade is intended to provide improved performance over the standard version.

The new second-hand Hueys as can be seen did not carry any serials or markings yet. On 29 September 2014 the US State Department announced a possible Foreign Military Sale (FMS) to Lebanon for eighteen Huey IIs and associated equipment parts training and logistical support for an estimated cost of USD 180 million.

In our database we only have serials L-1201 through L-1209 and a few more construction numbers for which we do not have a tie-up with 12 squadron at Beirut . It looks like these three Huey IIs might be the last of the above mentioned FMS contract.

When I traveled to Cappadocia in Turkey a few years ago I really wanted to visit Derinkuyu one of the region’s famous underground cave cities that were built hundreds of years ago to protect inhabitants from foreign invasions. As public transport was inconvenient for me my hotel owner said he could provide his services as a driver.

Even as an experienced international solo traveler I’m still susceptible to anxiety about my safety. So when I noticed on Google Maps we were headed down a quiet country road instead of a larger road nearby I started to worry.

“Is this the scenic route?” I asked nervously taking in the deserted farmlands around us. Perhaps realizing my discomfort he hastily assured me that he was taking a shortcut due to traffic on the main road.

At the site he waited for me at a café where while I wandered around the winding passages for a couple of hours. On the way back he told me about the history of the area and politely asked me if I minded stopping while he prayed for a few minutes.

In hindsight my fears were understandable but probably overblown. The fact that tourism is a major business in Turkey citizens’ great pride in their country (as evidenced by the number of Turkish flags flying everywhere) and a culture of hospitality to guests means that travel there is generally quite safe even for women traveling alone.

During the rest of my stay in Cappadocia I hiked through quiet valleys with only the thrum of honeybees for company and climbed up hillsides to see ancient Christian churches carved out of the rocks. In Istanbul I felt safe strolling solo along the Bosporus as the sun set watching fishermen in silhouette checking their phones in between checking their lines.

However as is the case with visiting anywhere there are potential safety issues to be aware of in Turkey from potential terrorist attacks to wildfires. Being alert and prepared for the risks will help ensure you take adequate steps to avoid them.

While some governments still have warnings in place about traveling to Turkey travelers around the world clearly think it’s a safe destination with an influx of visitors and tourism is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels soon. Informed and responsible travelers can feel confident about exploring a wide range of experiences there from unforgettable sights and delicious food to the warmth and generosity of the Turkish people.

These tips will guide you as you plan your trip to this beautiful diverse and welcoming country.

1. Street crime in Turkey

The inflation rate in Turkey is currently soaring (July 2022) especially for everyday goods such as food and fuel. While there is little evidence that this economic crisis is affecting crime rates it makes even more sense for visitors to be aware of typical scams as well as to be always aware of their surroundings and valuables. Istanbul has a large security camera network which may serve as a crime deterrent in that city.

2. Potential political instability in Turkey

Travelers are generally advised not to travel to areas of the country that border Syria due to a higher risk of armed conflict terrorism and civil unrest. Although there has not been another wave of deadly terrorist attacks like one in 2016 the potential for threats in major tourist areas is still a concern and you may notice heightened police and military presence at some sites.

In addition Turkey is having a general election in 2023 which may spark more political demonstrations and actions. The current government under President Erdogan has a history of cracking down on demonstrators and even criticizing the government verbally or on social media can mean risking arrest. To be safe it’s best to avoid areas with protests and to save voicing any negative opinions about the political situation for in private or when you get home.

3. Adventure travel risks in Turkey

Part of the fun of visiting Turkey is the many options for exciting outdoor activities such as horseback riding scuba diving and more. Hot air ballooning is a particular draw for visitors to Cappadocia for the spectacular views of the unusual landscapes there. While accidents are rare it’s always a good idea to do your due diligence by reading reviews and talking to other travelers to get their recommendations for reliable operators and then obeying all of the applicable safety guidelines for the activity.

4. Wildfires in Turkey

In the last few years Turkey has suffered from some devastating wildfires including in popular seaside areas along the Mediterranean coast. Sadly these are becoming more common in part due to climate change. Beyond the immediate risk to personal safety high levels of particles in the air due to smoke can cause health issues especially among those with asthma or other lung conditions. Check the status of wildfires before your visit and consider scheduling your trip to Turkey during seasons when fires are not as common.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS90c2EtZmVicnVhcnktb25lLW1pbGxpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Presidents' Day & Valentine's Day Push TSA Numbers Past 1m Again,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS90c2EtZmVicnVhcnktb25lLW1pbGxpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdmlldG5hbW5ldC52bi9lbi92aWV0bmFtLXBlb3BsZS1jb21taXQtdG8tc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtdG91cmlzbS1pbi0yMDIxLXN1cnZleS03MTI4MjguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vietnam people commit to sustainable tourism in 2021: Survey,,,,,,,

The Arkansas River provided a transportation route connecting the interior of the state to the Mississippi River and thus to cities such as New Orleans and St. Louis.

On one side of the city were vast pine forests that could fuel a lucrative timber industry.

On the other side were lowlands filled with bottomland hardwoods. Those hardwoods were harvested the land was drained and the rich soil proved ideal for growing cotton.

""In the autumn of 1819 Joseph Bonne making his way upstream from Arkansas Post built a crude cabin for his Quapaw wife and family on a high bluff covered with pine trees on the river's south bank"" Russell Bearden wrote for the Central Arkansas Library System's Encyclopedia of Arkansas. ""A few years later James Scull also from Arkansas Post arrived and set up an encampment on the north bank across from the future site of Pine Bluff. The encampment soon became a tavern and small inn.

""On March 3 1819 President James Monroe named Robert Crittenden territorial secretary. Crittenden quickly set about exploiting the remaining Quapaw in southeast Arkansas to relinquish their last tracts of land.""

With the Quapaw gone and steamboats beginning to ply the Arkansas River the area began attracting settlers such as French-born Antoine Barraque for whom a downtown Pine Bluff street is named. Jefferson County was established in 1829 and Pine Bluff became the county seat in 1832.

The railroad arrived in the 1880s connecting Pine Bluff to Little Rock. The town grew from 460 residents in 1850 to 9952 in 1890 making it the third-largest city in the state. The Cotton Belt located its main engine maintenance shops at Pine Bluff in 1894. The railroad was the largest industrial employer in the county until the Pine Bluff Arsenal was built during World War II.

Between the railroad operations cotton industry timber industry and arsenal (the arsenal alone employed almost 10000 people during World War II) Pine Bluff boomed. The population almost tripled from 21290 in 1940 to 57389 in 1970.

International Paper Co. decided to locate a paper mill at Pine Bluff in 1957. By 1962 that mill employed 1400 people.

Of the Pine Bluff Arsenal Bearden wrote: ""Construction costs were estimated at about $60 million. At the height of the war the plant expanded from making magnesium and thermite incendiary munitions to a chemical warfare manufacturing facility as well producing lethal gases and chemical compounds installed in artillery shells and specifically designed bombs. Fifteen civilian workers died in work-related accidents. The facility grew with its expanded mission.

""More than 900 buildings and production facilities consumed 3.3 million square feet of space 43 miles of roads and 14 miles of track for diesel-electric locomotives pulling boxcars and flat cars of munitions. In February 1942 the arsenal also became one of the nation's storage depots for its expanding chemical stockpile munitions. These binary projectiles (lethal agents mixed after discharge of the projectile) were isolated in igloos near the northwest section of the facility.""

President Richard Nixon banned the production and use of biological weapons in 1969. Part of the complex was renamed the National Center for Toxicological Research and became a branch of the federal Food & Drug Administration. On-site incineration of toxic nerve agents began in 2005 and was completed in 2010. The arsenal's mission changed to making smoke incendiary and pyrotechnic devices.

Despite a consistent decline in population in recent decades (the city has lost about 15000 residents since 1970) Pine Bluff continues to have a relatively strong manufacturing base due to companies such as Evergreen Packaging (in the former IP facility) and Tyson Foods.

In December Highland Pellets announced a strategic alliance with Orion Energy Partners to fund an expansion and upgrade of its Pine Bluff plant. Orion will provide a $163 million capital investment. Highland Pellets supplies wood pellets for export. The fuel is used for renewable energy production at converted coal power plants. Wood used at the Pine Bluff facility often comes from trees that were thinned from crowded forests or from leftover sawmill materials.

In November Good Day Farm Arkansas a medical marijuana cultivator received approval from the state to purchase Natural State Wellness Enterprises of Newport and move the operation to Pine Bluff. The company is constructing a 42000-square-foot growth area. The Pine Bluff facility will employ 200 people with an annual payroll of $9.4 million. Pine Bluff Mayor Shirley Washington said the company's initial investment is $25 million for retrofitting a building in the Jefferson County Industrial Park.

At the arsenal meanwhile ReadyOne Industries began production in August and plans to hire 120 people. The company produces military clothing. A large portion of its workforce consists of disabled employees.

In the story I wrote for the front page of today's section I outlined the beginnings of the Go Forward Pine Bluff initiative in 2015. What no one could have foreseen at the time was that Arkansas voters in November 2018 would approve a constitutional amendment allowing the construction of casinos at Pine Bluff and Russellville along with the expansion of existing gaming operations in Hot Springs and West Memphis. It marked the return of the Quapaw to Pine Bluff.

The main casino at the Quapaw Nation's Saracen Casino Resort opened in October of last year. A nearby annex had opened in October 2019.

""When the project was proposed many people that we have a lot of respect for said it was not going to work in Pine Bluff"" said Saracen's Carlton Saffa. ""And they're eating crow right now. This has been a success. We have proven the naysayers wrong.""

A story last month in the Pine Bluff Commercial noted that the annex in its early days saw ""people standing in line to get to a slot machine. But the grown-up casino with slots and table games and restaurants--the one that will eventually be attached to a multistory hotel--opened amid a pandemic that has kept numbers and expectations down.""

Still Saffa said the casino has made money. There already are more than 800 people employed. That number is expected to grow to 1000 once the hotel and conference center are constructed.

""We don't have all of the amenities yet"" Saffa said. ""And we're still building our brand. So our numbers are something that I'm extremely proud of.""

In addition to providing 1000 jobs one thing the Quapaw Nation's business will do is change the perception of Pine Bluff. With a hotel and conference center state associations will add Pine Bluff to the rotation for annual meetings.

Saracen is already putting a focus on food and beverage offerings hiring Todd Gold away from his job as dean of the Culinary Arts and Hospitality Management Institute in Little Rock. The Quapaw Nation developed its own cattle herd buffalo herd meat-processing facilities coffee roastery and produce farms for its Downstream Casino in northeastern Oklahoma. Those products are now offered in Pine Bluff.

""Food is driving this just as much as gaming and I can think of no better example than hiring Todd Gold from the culinary school"" Saffa said. ""If we have the best restaurant in Pine Bluff we've failed. If we have the best restaurant in southeast Arkansas we've failed. We need to have the best restaurant in the region.""

Gold said he has hired staff with the goal of making Pine Bluff a culinary and hospitality destination. The flagship Red Oak Steakhouse features dry-aged beef displayed in glass aging racks and a wine case with more than 140 varieties.

""Our aim is for Red Oak Steakhouse to be the best restaurant in the state"" Saffa said.

The plan slated to come before the Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) executive committee for a vote on Sunday would allow it to buy private Palestinian land in Area C of the West Bank. Area C comprises parts of the West Bank controlled by Israel.

If approved the change would mark a major policy shift for the century-old organization.

The plan also allows for other projects to develop West Bank settlements potentially involving hundreds of millions of dollars in spending.

In a statement against the proposal the Union for Reform Judaism said “politicizing support for cherished Zionist institutions ill serves the cause of Zionism and the unity of the Jewish people.”

“We love and support the Jewish and democratic State of Israel which is why we will continue to strongly oppose policies that undermine the safety security and moral character of our Jewish homeland” said the organization’s president Rabbi Rick Jacobs.

“Especially at this moment when Israel is looking to forge a strong relationship with the Biden administration this unilateral move could be inflammatory and harmful” he added.

Asked to comment on the proposal at a press briefing earlier this week US State Department Spokesman Ned Price read out a statement that administration officials have recited several times when asked about such matters.

“It is critical to avoid unilateral steps that exacerbate tensions and undercut the efforts to achieve a two-state solution. This includes annexation settlement building demolitions incitement and payments for terrorists” said Price.

KKL (a separate organization from JNF-USA) has until now not officially operated in the West Bank and has worked through other entities there on some limited projects.

The organization’s new global chairman Avraham Duvdevani took over in the fall of 2020 and is acting to change the policy. Duvdevani is part of the right’s gradual growing influence over Zionist organizations like KKL. The move came in response to a push from pro-settlement lobbyists and the organization tried to keep it low-key a Thursday report in the Walla news site said.

Foreign donations will only be used to fund such activity if the transactions are legal in the donating country said the report which was also carried in English on the Axios news site.

KKL said in response to the report referring to the West Bank by its biblical names “Over the years we worked everywhere in Israel including in Judea and Samaria. The meeting on Sunday is intended to approve policy principles based on a legal opinion we obtained. At this stage we have no intention to establish a new area of development in Judea and Samaria.”

KKL expanding activities into the West Bank could further complicate Israel’s ties with US President Joe Biden’s administration which is expected to resume the traditional American stance against settlements. It could also affect the Jewish state’s ties with the rest of the international community which views the settlements as illegal.

KKL established in 1901 to buy and develop land for Jewish settlement and best known for the hundreds of millions of trees it has planted throughout Israel serves as the Jewish people’s custodian for some 15 percent of the land in the country the management of which is carried out by the Israel Lands Authority.

Credit cards are increasingly taking on a vertical orientation.

This comes as apps like TikTok and Instagram acclimate the world toward a vertically scrolling feed and it also reflects how most consumers use their credit cards anyway — by inserting them into chip readers vertically for example.

Here’s something I bet most you didn’t see coming: TikTok and Instagram are such pervasive cultural forces in the world today they’re starting to quietly influence the design of — credit cards of all things.

In recent days PayPal released new debit and credit card vertical designs for its Venmo app which a company executive said was partly inspired by the vertical orientation of those popular social media apps. Daniela Jorge vice president of design at PayPal told Bloomberg in a recent interview that this is just the way the whole world is thinking now. And what people’s expectations are for apps and consumer products like credit cards. “The world around us is becoming more of the portrait mode and the vertical orientation” Jorge said.

Besides PayPal major banks are already moving in this direction. Bank of America the second-biggest provider in the US of debit card products was one of the first to adopt a debit card with a portrait orientation. Likewise Discovery Bank started offering vertical credit cards in 2018. And the reasons we should expect this trend to continue with more banks adopting a vertical style for their card products include the fact that with the advent of chip readers and tap-to-pay functionality this is how most people handle their cards already.

With a chip reader for example the credit card is inserted into the reader vertically. Likewise as digital wallets increase in popularity — with card owners increasingly utilizing a digital version of their credit card that’s stored in their smartphone — the phone becomes the device with which the consumer pays instead of a physical card. And phones of course are used vertically. When Apple released its new credit card product Apple Card I didn’t even bother obtaining a physical version of the card at all. I signed up and was approved for the credit card which I keep in my iPhone’s wallet app and use it vertically since I’m simply waving the phone in front of a card reader.

Think about the last time you handed your card to someone to horizontally swipe through a reader. It’s probably been a while right? Now consider that two years after these smart payment chip-enabled cards were introduced Experian says that US banks have issued more than 855 million of them. They’re called EMV cards by the way which originally stood for Europay Mastercard and Visa — the credit card companies that created this new payment standard.

“Switching our debit cards to a vertical layout is about more than how the cards look” Bank of America head of consumer and small-business products April Schneider told Bloomberg. “The vertical layout differentiates the debit card from other cards clients use and the addition of tap-to-pay makes the card faster and safer to use at in-store checkout.”"

Osinde a fourth-year urban studies and ethics society and law student is passionate about how cities develop and adapt to new situations and stresses. She founded the company to support local businesses in the face of encroaching industry giants by bridging the gap between online and in-store shopping.

The Varsity interviewed Osinde to get the story on Fittedfast’s origins and future.

The Hub for help

Despite being a UTSG student Osinde grew Fittedfast in The Hub UTSC’s entrepreneurship incubator. Aspiring entrepreneurs don’t need a finished product or a business plan to join the program; instead students and recent graduates only need to come with an idea for their business.

An idea is exactly what Osinde had when she approached the incubator. “I had come into the hub with just an idea” she wrote. “A concept of this elaborate network of businesses that people can shop from online with delivery.”

Osinde gave much credit to The Hub’s coordinators — in particular The Hub’s director Gray Gaffam — who she says supported her and her peers with a wide range of resources that were adapted to a virtual setting. “They had many [Zoom] sessions available for students to partake in that provided ample information and resources on how to succeed” Osinde shared.

Through The Hub’s annual pitch competition the Fittedfast team also won $2000 for its idea.

“The Hub has also allowed me to see all the other innovative businesses that [are] pushing through the pandemic storm” she continued. “Its [sic] incredible to see all the talented young people creating things that may very well change the world one day.”

A focus on local business

Much like its inspiration Uber Eats Fittedfast connects users with multiple local clothing stores via a single website. Users shop through the unified online storefront and all deliveries are then handled by Fittedfast. Customers are charged $10 for delivery and Fittedfast receives a five per cent pick-up fee from the businesses.

Fittedfast’s research revealed that customers are accustomed to paying $11–14 for delivery that takes three to five days on average. With its current one- to four-day delivery model at a flat rate of $10 Fittedfast ships local products faster and cheaper Osinde asserted. “We wanted to provide the best value for our service” she wrote.

Fittedfast also addresses sustainability and fast fashion — two big issues in the clothing industry. Osinde shared that the local business model hopes to allow Fittedfast to have greater control over the ethical sourcing of the clothing it delivers. Over 60 per cent of Fittedfast’s merchants have a sustainable approach to manufacturing their products. Brave Soles — a brand that makes its shoes out of recycled tire materials — is one such example.

Pandemic problems

In consideration of COVID-19 safety measures Osinde reported that “Fittedfast adheres to all social distancing rules especially with regard to drop-off.” Customers are able to engage in contactless deliveries by alerting Fittedfast of their preferred drop-off time by email or text. Fittedfast is also in the process of integrating a live view of delivery which will allow customers to track the status of their order.

During Fittedfast’s pre-pandemic development Osinde met with potential merchants in person. With the onset of the pandemic Osinde has found it difficult to receive responses from merchants through cold calls.

Reformulating her approach in the early days of the pandemic Osinde decided to contact local businesses with an offer to feature their stories in Fittedfast’s blog T.O. Local. At that time Fittedfast didn’t have a functioning platform except a blog on an amateur website but it allowed Osinde to connect with merchants and gain exposure.

“This had a significantly better response because I learned the valuable lesson that you can get people to learn a lot about you by literally allowing them to talk about themselves first!” she wrote.

Fittedfuture

When asked for her advice to future generations of U of T businesspeople Osinde advised fellow student entrepreneurs to “start now.”

“Many of us suffer from procrastination and [are] looking for the perfect ‘time’ to do or start something” Osinde wrote. “Truth is there’s never a good time — you create your opportunities and you create your reality… The real difference between those that succeed and those that do not is that the former had the bravery to take action.”

As for what’s next for Fittedfast Osinde is focused on getting 100 businesses signed up on the platform by the end of March.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYXNwP25ld3NJZHg9MzA0MDAz0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly9tLmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3IvcGFnZXMvYXJ0aWNsZS5hbXAuYXNwP25ld3NJZHg9MzA0MDAz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will SKT-Uber joint venture challenge Kakao?,"This file photo shows Uber taxis parked at Banpo Hangang Park in southern Seoul. / Courtesy of Uber



By Kim Bo-eun



A new player in the local mobility market is drawing attention to whether it will be able to challenge Kakao Mobility's dominance.



In December SK Telecom launched its new mobility unit T Map Mobility which is preparing to establish a joint venture with Uber in April.



The Fair Trade Commission approved the launch of the joint venture last week stating it would promote competition and innovation in new business areas.



Uber is investing $100 million to own a 51 percent stake in the joint venture. The new entity will merge Uber's platform technology with T Map's capabilities. T Map is SK Telecom's version of Google Maps and offers an automotive navigation system based on its map data. The new entity will offer ride-hailing services with Uber vehicles.



Attention is growing over the new company's potential given T Map holds a 55 percent market share in mobile navigation services with 13 million monthly active users. Kakao Mobility holds a 20 percent market share but for cab-hailing services it takes up 80 percent to 90 percent of the market.



""We plan on offering differentiated services in the taxi sector via the joint entity with Uber"" Ha Hyung-il SK Telecom's vice president and head of Corporate Center 2 said in a conference call on the company's earnings that took place earlier this month. ""We are also preparing for Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) which will enable access to various forms of transportation via one platform.""



T Map Mobility launched as SK Telecom spun off its mobility business into a subsidiary. SK Telecom CEO Park Jung-ho said at a shareholders' meeting in November that the decision was made based on recognition of mobility as a key pillar of the company's new businesses.



T Map Mobility is set to develop a platform offering car sharing cab hailing and chauffeur services as well as parking information and payment services. It plans on offering in-car information and entertainment services developed by SK Telecom including artificial intelligence-based voice recognition music streaming and mobile payment services.



In the long term the company plans to establish a data system for flying cars starting with creating 3D maps and then to develop a transport control system for smart flying vehicles. Navigation services will be built on AI and 5G technologies. Uber also separately invested $50 million into T Map Mobility.



SK Telecom aims to bring up T Map Mobility's annual sales to 600 billion won by 2025 and boost the company's worth to 4.5 trillion won by then. T Map Mobility is set to go public as early as this year.



SK Telecom is increasingly developing new businesses to transform from a telecom company into a globally competitive ICT firm.

Uber spoke in depth about the current scenario of casters in the Valorant esports scene. He also stated why the entire scenario has actually been caused by the Valorant community itself.

Uber explained that since the Covid-19 pandemic many people have been facing financial trouble. This synchronized perfectly with the release of Valorant as Riot Games' next big esports title.

It led to a bunch of inexperienced and raw talent bursting onto the scene. According to Uber these newcomers were willing to cast tournaments at less than half of the general rates set over the years.

This is one of the main reasons behind casters not being paid as much as they should be. Recognized casters with a ton of experience are now finding it difficult to find casting jobs.

If there's no budget to both pay players and broadcasters in a fair way? Don't run a broadcast. It's that simple. — Andrew Rush (@TempoZP) February 6 2021 Expand Tweet

Uber talks about caster issues in Valorant

Uber explained that the casters coming on to the scene are not entirely to blame for accepting casting contracts for a much lower sum. Given the global pandemic and everything that has ensued since everyone wants to secure themselves financially.

Uber further stated that he has always chosen to share his casting rates with fellow commentators and community members. He believes that they can put it to good use. That doesn't change the fact that Valorant esports has been facing many issues when it comes to broadcasting talents.

Tournament organizers:Stop pitching your services to companies like Riot without including ROBUST broadcast budget in your RFP. And if you do this to try and win the event you'd sure as hell better sell some fucking sponsorships to create a broadcast budget to pay your talent. https://t.co/kCDkatyhsW — Mitch Leslie (@UberShouts) February 7 2021 Expand Tweet

The best way for upcoming talent to learn about the trade is by casting with someone experienced by their side. Due to discrepancies regarding payment experienced and top-tier casters are not comfortable with the entire scenario.

Given that Riot Games is looking to create a bright and shiny future for Valorant esports it is high time that the company steps in and resolves all pertaining issues. It is also up to all the casters and broadcasting talents to find common ground and work together."

“I look forward to formalizing an already existing dialogue and partnership around diversity and inclusion with Mary Dillon and the Ulta Beauty team” said Ross “This work requires commitment and accountability from Ulta Beauty to ensure measurable goals are achieved. I am hopeful and optimistic our work together will create foundational change.”

Ulta Beauty is one more enterprise to upgrade its strategic policies to turn out to be more assorted and comprehensive. The recharged Black Lives Matter development that cleared the U.S. a year ago not just tended to the fundamental brutality against Black Americans yet in addition called for substantial change across establishments — including the excellence business which has truly dismissed non-white individuals and propagated selectiveness in standard makeup.

Other large name brands going from Adidas to Amazon from Nike to Microsoft have promised to improve their recruiting practices and worker pay as activists censured their quietness regardless of benefitting off of Black innovativeness culture and work.

To save its objectives Ulta is following after accordingly and dispatching improved variety and consideration preparing for all partners and representatives and is setting up yearly execution surveys to guarantee their variety objectives are being met.

Over the previous years a lot of companies have struggled to come up with different solutions when it comes to hiring advertising and picking products to display reinforce or fight systemic racism. George Floyd’s murdering and Black Lives Matter fights provoked a wave of corporate responsibilities to accomplish more to address racial disparities.

Other retail stores such as Macy’s and Gap have been struggling with their sales to due to the decrease of customers shopping at their stores because they don’t receive assistance from the employees so most people shop online. However they want to improve on their philanthropy and recruiting and doing so they have signed on to the 15 Percent Pledge which opens more doors for Black-owned products being on store shelves and recognizing their hard work creating a successful business.

Ulta CEO Mary Dillon stated “It’s not only an opportunity but an obligation that we represent everybody to celebrate diversity — if you look at our advertising campaigns if you look at the photography in our [hair] salon if you look at the way we’re training our salon associates to work with every hair type” she said. “Meeting the needs of everybody of any age or race or skin tone or hair type” is core to Ulta’s business.

Variety and incorporation endeavors have gotten to a greater extent a business basic as opposed to an altruism motion as customers focus harder on corporate qualities like manageability and variety to vote with their dollars.

The way it works is that a cyber criminal creates a fake account to all these apps especially dating apps and to court victims online. Next they pick any random profile that pops up on their timeline and they start communicating with each other which increases the relationship to move fast and trust is gained. Lastly the scammer asks the victim for money as a favor and the victim will get a reward. Once the scammer receives it he or she vanishes and deletes their profile.

Study shows that more than 40 percent of single men used several apps or dating sites for the past few months especially the popular ones like Tinder and Happn where 50 million users have explored dating sites. These apps and sites have fooled a lot of these victims because they’re living in a fairytale land where they’ll find their handsome prince charming or princess and they’ll live happily ever after. However they bring a lot of havoc in their lives where the scammers abuse their power on the internet and use it for their own needs. This can cause the victims to go through a terrible heartbreak and put them in a financial debt.

In most cases the criminals who commit romance scams research their victims’ profiles and gather personal details such as their job title their income and their lifestyle since in the digital era the mismanagement of our personal information enables a criminal to construct a reasonably accurate profile of a potential victim.

The scammer who emotionally manipulates the victim to give them money gifts or personal information is one of the most popular techniques. Sextortion which typically starts as a normal relationship between two individuals who begin to know each other before the scammer attempts to take the conversation off the dating site such as WhatsApp for example is another type of common deception.

By doing the following you can defend yourself from these fraudsters:

Just be a tease. There is no need for all your information to be shared online. For example your hometown home addresses employment specifics telephone numbers educational history and your children’s information are withheld. On social media and all other online accounts this is also a smart idea to get the courts involved in order to avoid your personal details from falling into the wrong hands. A little analysis goes a long way. Compare the details that the individual provides with the information that exists about them online during your communications to see if anything contradicts. A person without an online presence is definitely a red flag. You can also search their images on Google to see if it’s actually them or their a different person. Also look at the victim’s profile to see if they have a picture of themselves or if it’s a picture they found on Google you will know. Receive a second opinion. As they are not personally interested in the romance friends and family will always have stronger radar than you will. Introduce a friend to the love interest and request their honest opinion. Hold your checkbook on. Reject all requests for financial loans or assistance of any kind regardless of how needy they are. Trust your instincts. If there’s something fishy or too good to be true it probably is. Trust your intuition and don’t let love control your mind.

Even though Valentine’s season is one of the important days for potential sweetheart scams to be on high alert it is important to note that this is a year-round problem. The Identity Fraud Resource Center (ITRC) states that they receive calls during the year from individuals who have been swindled by sweetheart scammers.

If you’re a victim of a sweetheart scam the most significant thing to do is to completely break off contact with your scammer. And do feel ashamed to ask for help; there is no need to be ashamed of it. You can: If you are worried or believe you were a victim of fraud you can:",,,,,,,,,

The term small cap can be used to define established companies with a small market capitalization ranging anywhere between $300 million and $2 billion. While we define the term healthcare as an organization that provides medical care and attention to an individual. In a recent article we covered the Top 10 Large-Cap Healthcare Stock to Buy Now.

Investing in small-cap stocks can be tricky. Risk and volatility are inevitable. However the fact that these stocks have a smaller size may mean more room for upside potential given the circumstances. For instance the average return for the Russell 2000 is 15% in the year after a presidential election since 1980. Which is around 4% better than the large-cap stocks. Small caps also tend to outperform large caps when coming out of an economic recession and when expectations of economic growth go from bad to less bad and eventually to good the greater economic sensitivity given by small caps can be helpful to a more rapid recovery.

On the other hand investing in healthcare stocks can be very rewarding given the significance it has to the economy. In the US the healthcare sector will account for 19.4% of GDP in 2027. The number is an increase from 17.9% in 2017. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exemplified the importance of the healthcare sector in finding solutions to ending the pandemic. According to an article from the Health System Tracker healthcare workers now account for a larger share of the employed workforce which went from 10.8% in February up to 11.5% in May.

The Biden Administration commits to the Affordable Care Act which will add Medicare-like public options that will allow a greater number of consumers to receive health insurance. We also like small-cap healthcare stocks (like biotech or gene technology stocks) because that's where a large number of cutting edge research is done. Combining small-cap stocks that have the possibility for major growth and health care stocks that provide innovative solutions to the economy today may be one of the solutions to a portfolio with great growth potential.

“Mednax is a business that I have followed for many years. The crown jewel is the pediatric business in which the company provides physician staffing to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and related specialties at various hospitals. It’s a business with a strong competitive advantage given the company’s dominant position very inelastic demand and limited reimbursement risk. The pediatric business has moderate organic growth characteristics which the prior management supplemented with many tuck-in acquisitions over the years. These acquisitions leveraged the back office scale while allowing the local physician groups’ autonomy of operation. Unfortunately the company eventually ran out of meaningful acquisitions to make in this space and the old management was unsatisfied with simply running a very entrenched high ROIC and FCF business and returning capital to shareholders. Instead they took on extra debt to pursue growth through acquisitions in what they considered to be adjacencies: first in anesthesiology and then in radiology. Not surprisingly these adventures outside the company’s area of core competitive advantage didn’t go well. Debt piled up far faster than profits. This led to an activist investor nominating directors to the board and then the board replacing the CEO. The new CEO was previously the CEO of Quality Care Properties. This was a company where he improved performance over this 2-year tenure and which he then sold at an attractive price. His first steps at Mednax were simple: sell off the non-core divisions and reduce debt. I made the investment after the sales were completed leading to a clean balance sheet and the company returning to its roots as a pediatric-centered company. This company doesn’t screen well to many investors since its historical financials are messy and are obscured by the old businesses (now sold) and the seemingly large debt pile (already reduced). This is a perfect set-up: the nature of the business is different than what most investors believe it to be based on a superficial assessment. The new management is now focused on improving efficiencies and running the core business better. I would not be surprised if the ultimate plan were to sell the company in a few years at a nice profit. However I am not banking on that and would be equally happy if management just executes on its low-risk plan of running the business well within its area of competitive advantage. I purchased the stock at less than 10x normalized EPS for a business that I believe is likely to grow mid-single digits long-term. I paid ~ 65% of my base case value with ~ 35% downside to my worst case. I believe the Business Quality to be Excellent (1 out of 5) Management Quality to be Above Average (2 out of 5) and Balance Sheet to be Above Average (2 out of 5). In the short-term birth-rates a key driver of demand are likely to be negative. This may create quarters where the company reports results lower than Wall Street expectations. I am not at all concerned or deterred by that. If anything I would be happy to add to the position if such an event occurs and the market over-reacts given our long-term investment horizon.”

8. Natus Medical Inc (NASDAQ:NTUS)

No of HFs: 24

No of HFs: 24

Total Value of HF Holdings: $246 Million

Michael Doheny’s Freshford Capital Management is one of the top hedge funds having positions in the stock which had $107 million invested at the end of September. An insider recently purchased 1648 shares at around $14 in August 2019. The stock is up 157% since then. Silver Ring Value Partners mentioned CVET in its Q4 2020 investor letter:

“Business Vision in 5 Years: The distribution business continues to grow at a moderate clip. The company’s Vets First Choice SaaS business both adds a substantial number of new vet practices and meaningfully increases the revenue per practice in the U.S. The company develops a growing business in Europe which is several years behind the U.S. in its maturity. These developments lead to an explosion in profits as the relatively high contribution profit margins from the SaaS business make Vets First Choice the more profitable of the two divisions. What Can Prevent It From Getting There:

-Market structure changes so that vets give up on selling drugs to consumers cede that business to others like Chewy’s and increase prices for their services to maintain practice profitability

-Consolidating suppliers squeeze the economics out of the distribution business

-Vets prove more resistant to adopting Vets First Choice software and the majority never reach the revenue potential that it offers.”

Come winter the frozen St. Lawrence River also gives skaters access to natural outdoor skating paths located in local public parks. Before slinging skates over your shoulder and heading to your favorite outdoor spot make sure to check the weather  as rinks may be buried under the snow. Rink conditions can be accessed through the parks' websites beforehand. If all else fails consider Atrium Le 1000 Montreal's indoor rink as an alternative.

Signed in December 2018 the ‘Health Sector Support Programme Project’ is a five-year project that aims to strengthen Belize’s health sector. Firstly through improving the health system and management towards achieving universal health care for all and secondly through developing climate-friendly energy-efficient and disaster-resilient health facilities.

Accompanied by Mr. Nicolaus Hansmann Team Leader of the EU Technical Office in Belize H.E. Van Steen was briefed on the overall progress of the project by the PAHO/WHO team: Dr. Edwin Bolastig Health Systems and Services Advisor Ms. Lealou Reballos Health Emergencies Technical Officer and Ms. Ruby Dominguez Administrator. This also included updating the Ambassador on the 500000 Euros that were reoriented from the project last year to assist with the COVID-19 response in the country.

“We thank the European Union for the reorientation of these funds to support the Ministry of Health and Wellness response to the COVID-19 pandemic” said Dr. Jack. “One of the critical areas supported was the expansion and decentralization of COVID-19 testing to make COVID-19 testing more available in Belize.”

With the goals of enhancing national laboratory network diagnostic capacity for early detection of COVID-19 enhancing infection prevention and control and improving integrated healthcare at the community level through outreach services H.E. Van Steen was grateful to hear that through this partnership the European Union has been able to assist Belize in the fight against this global pandemic.

“I’m very happy to hear part [of the funds from the Health Sector Support Programme Project] has been reoriented towards COVID-19” said H.E. Van Steen. “For me I really think this is a priority.”

With such a strong partnership between PAHO/WHO and the EU one of Belize’s most significant partners both parties are committed to improving the quality of life for all Belizeans living now and in the future particularly Belizeans living in the rural areas of the country.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNlbnRyZWRhaWx5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL2FydGljbGUyNDg3MDUyNTUuaHRtbNIBP2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNlbnRyZWRhaWx5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL2FydGljbGUyNDg3MDUyNTUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here are the top 40 employers in Centre County and what’s changed from last year,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.centredaily.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Months into Trump's presidency dozens of medical experts formed a commission to study the health impacts of his policies for The Lancet a highly-respected British medical journal. The Lancet Commission on Public Policy and Health in the Trump Era found that roughly 40% of coronavirus deaths in the United States could have been prevented if the average death rate matched that of other wealthy nations.

""We became concerned that even within a few weeks of him coming into office he had started to implement policies which we thought would be deadly"" Dr. Steffie Woolhandler a health policy expert at the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College and co-chair of the commission said in an interview with Salon. ""And now that we're in 2021 we have actual data and in fact his policy has been very deadly.""

Instead of galvanizing the public to fight the pandemic the report said Trump ""publicly dismissed its threat (despite privately acknowledging it) discouraged action as infection spread and eschewed international cooperation.""

""His refusal to develop a national strategy worsened shortages of personal protective equipment and diagnostic tests"" the researchers added. ""President Trump politicized mask-wearing and school re-openings and convened indoor events attended by thousands where masks were discouraged and physical distancing was impossible.""

But the commission went further finding that life expectancy in the U.S. has diverged from other major industrial nations since the 1980s despite continuous economic growth. As a result the country sees more unnecessary deaths each year than all the 2020 coronavirus deaths combined.

""In 2018 461000 Americans died who would still be alive if our life expectancy were as long as in other wealthy nations"" Woolhandler said. ""So COVID killed about 400000 people in 2020 which was horrible. But every single year the United States was losing that many people relative to other developed nations because our policymakers had failed to create the conditions for health.""

There's little doubt that the coronavirus pandemic and Trump's mismanagement has significantly worsened that trend particularly in communities of color. The pandemic has increased the life expectancy gap between Black and white people by more than 50% the report said. The average Latino life expectancy in the U.S. has fallen by 3.5 years since the start of the pandemic.

""Overall in the USA Black and Latinx people have incurred more total years of potential life lost than white people because of COVID-19 although the white population is three to four times larger"" the researchers wrote.

""The strong focus on racism in all its forms and its impact on almost every area of public policy is very important"" Richard Gottfried chair of the New York State Assembly's health committee and a member of the commission said in an interview with Salon adding that many Americans ""may not fully understand the all-pervasive nature of the impact of racism.""

Even before the pandemic hit America Trump's policies were linked to an increase in preventable deaths. Despite repeatedly failing to repeal Obamacare Trump undermined the program in various ways and the number of uninsured Americans increased by 2.3 million before the pandemic a number that rose further amid rampant job losses during the health crisis. He used the deficit caused by the 2017 tax cut that primarily benefited the wealthy and corporations to ""justify cutting food subsidies and health care"" the report said. His deregulation agenda worsened pollution ""resulting in more than 22000 extra deaths in 2019 alone.""

Trump's ""disdain for science"" and cuts to global health programs and public health agencies hampered the coronavirus response ""causing tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths"" according to the report and those cuts ""imperil advances against HIV and other diseases.""

But the researchers warned that ""focusing narrowly on Trump's policies and rhetoric while ignoring the failings that precipitated his election risks obscuring the causes and remedies for the longterm downward trajectory of health"" in the United States.

""The disturbing truth is that many of President Trump's policies do not represent a radical break with the past but merely accelerated the decades-long trend of lagging life expectancy that reflects deep and long-standing flaws in US economic health and social policy"" the report said.

In fact Trump's county-level vote share was closely correlated with worsening life expectancy trends. Counties where more than 60% of voters backed Trump had higher life expectancy in 1980 than counties where Clinton won more than 60% of the vote according to a 2017 study. But in 2014 the Trump counties had an average life expectancy two years lower than the average Clinton county.

""People's deteriorating life prospects appeared to be feeding unhappiness and dissatisfaction that Trump was able to adequately cynically mobilize for his own purposes"" Woolhandler said.

Many lower-income white people with ""deteriorating life prospects"" have gravitated toward Republican policies because they believe people of color disproportionately benefit from expansions of public health and social safety nets even though they themselves would greatly benefit from policies that improve public health.

""Ironically the ascendance of right-wing populism and Trump's weakening of the US Government's role in protecting health are likely to exacerbate the income and place-based health disparities that harm many of his voters"" the report said. ""A negative feedback loop — with low-income white people helping to stifle demands for vital public investments — risks inflicting additional and long-lasting damage to their health and wellbeing.""

Trump the researchers argued used this racial animus to ""deflect attention from policies that abet billionaires' accretion of wealth and power"" arguing that his America First narrative ""camouflaged policies that enriched people who were already very wealthy and gave corporations license to degrade the environment for financial gain.""

Meanwhile the report said Trump ""halted progress in almost every domain undermined care for low-income people and the middle class weakened pandemic preparedness; withheld food and shelter from those in need and persecuted those who were vulnerable and oppressed.""

But Trump is obviously not the first president to push the privatization of public services and deregulation aimed at helping corporations maximize profits. Arguably every president since at least Jimmy Carter has played a role in that process.

""Although Trump's actions were singularly damaging many of them represent an aggressive acceleration of neoliberal policies that date back 40 years"" the report said. As a result of policies that chipped away at New Deal and Civil Rights-era progress the ""widening income inequality has widened inequalities in health.""

The deepening inequality began in earnest during the Reagan era as unions were ""stifled"" the tax code and government policies increasingly favored the wealthy and high-paying manufacturing jobs began to disappear the report said. Despite a booming stock market and low unemployment the report added many people have been ""forced into precarious jobs that offered low pay and insufficient benefits.""

After Reagan's election ""we saw U.S. life expectancy begin to lag [and] health care costs begin to soar"" Woolhandler said. In 1980 American life expectancy was around the average for developed nations. By the time the pandemic hit U.S. life expectancy was 3.4 years below the G7 average according to the commission.

The damaging policies were not limited to Republicans. Through Bill Clinton rejected many Reagan-era policies he expanded trade agreements that weakened protections and unions and imposed restrictions on welfare and food benefits. He also signed bills that expanded mass incarceration and worsened wealth and income inequality.

""A major problem with trade policies has been that they made drugs too expensive"" Woolhandler said.

Though Barack Obama expanded health coverage his signature health program funneled money through private profit-seeking companies and exploded out-of-pocket costs.

Between 2002 and 2019 the share of public health spending in the U.S. fell from around 3.1% of the GDP to 2.45% roughly half the proportion in Canada and the U.K.

""Market-oriented health policies shifted medical resources toward high-income people burdened the middle class with unaffordable out-of-pocket costs and deployed public money to stimulate the corporate takeover of vital health resources"" the report said.

Although the Affordable Care Act expanded health coverage to tens of millions more people the program still left between 25 million and 30 million uninsured before Trump took office. Despite the coverage expansion and a booming economy since 2010 ""there's been essentially no improvement in Americans' life expectancy which is all the more shocking"" Woolhandler said.

""That is really historically unprecedented because usually when the economy grows life expectancy grows"" she said. ""It's good for you to have more resources. But in the United States we actually have an uncoupling of life expectancy growth from economic growth.""

The decline in life expectancy has been especially stark in communities of color. Life expectancy for Black Americans is about 3.4 years shorter than for white people. Life expectancy among Native Americans is poorest of all Woolhandler observed saying these statistics ""are related to structural white supremacy.""

The report found that all people of color except Asian Americans receive significantly less medical care than white Americans despite having worse life expectancy and seemingly greater need. Mass incarceration the drug war and police violence are also major factors in the lagging life expectancy of people of color. The report cited estimates that roughly one in every 1000 Black men will be killed by police a rate 250% higher than that of white males. While discourse around the opioid epidemic has largely focused on drug use among white people Black Americans saw the sharpest increase in opioid deaths between 2012 and 2018 a problem that has likely been exacerbated during the pandemic due to economic stress and social isolation.

""We still have an unequal society based on a history of white supremacy with discriminatory treatment continuing to this very day"" Woolhandler said. ""That's something that needs to be changed. We concluded that racism is obviously bad for the health of people of color but also that we think it threatens everyone.

""Racism has been manipulated by cynical politicians like Trump to encourage low-income white people to oppose social services. They're opposing social services in the mistaken belief that they only benefit people of color. So low-income whites are often mobilized against their own self-interest on services that would benefit them personally opposing it just for people of color. So racism harms health directly for people of color but also harms health by poisoning the political climate that we need in order to get our government to act.""

The commission's report included dozens of recommendations for President Biden's administration and lawmakers many of them focused on addressing the racial inequities in public health. But the extent of these policies shows that Congress and Biden need to ""go beyond simply repairing Trump's damage"" the report said.

""Racism has a profound impact on what health care providers are available in communities of color and their access to it"" Gottfried said. ""It denies people full health coverage disproportionately and has an impact on the quality of care that's available in their neighborhoods. And you see the results in shocking data on infant and maternal mortality and life expectancy and almost every measure of health care quality and bad outcomes.""

The researchers called on lawmakers to address structural racism decriminalize drug use and reform policing and criminal justice systems that ""oppress"" communities of color and ""fill prisons."" The recommendations also include addressing policies that suppress voters particularly voters of color and creating a National Center on Anti-Racism and Health within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The commission also called for reparations to African Americans Native Americans and residents of Puerto Rico ""for the wealth and education confiscated from (or denied to) those groups in the past.""

""To repair health deficits in the USA we must redistribute wealth and income through taxation fortify social programmes and regulation remediate the structural racism that afflicts Black Latinx and Indigenous people and heal US democracy by eliminating obstructions to voting"" the report said.

The report also called on lawmakers to address the worsening pollution caused by Trump's deregulation of environmental regulations and to mobilize ""massive resources to avert climate catastrophe.""

Funding for these major reforms could come from redirecting resources from the military raising taxes on the wealthy and ending corporate subsidies and programs that funnel public funds through private companies.

At the heart of the report's recommendations is the need for a universal health care program that does not allow tens of millions of people to be denied coverage while forcing tens of millions of others to pay skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs that lead to bankruptcies and avoidance of medical care.

""Almost every problem we face in health and health care whether as patients or providers or employers or taxpayers is made much worse and much harder to solve because of the way we pay for health care in America"" said Gottfried.

Gottfried has sponsored a single-payer health care bill called the New York Health Act in the state legislature for nearly three full decades.

""Really the only solution to the coverage problem that is effective is a single-payer system"" he said. ""Everything else leaves us with gaps and a fragmented system and all the wasted spending that is caused by a fragmented system dominated by insurance companies. … Getting rid of that waste would generate enough money to provide complete coverage for everyone including long-term care. Until we get rid of that waste it is virtually impossible to achieve high-quality and equitable healthcare.""

A study by Woolhandler and fellow commission co-chair Dr. David Himmelstein last year found that eliminating overhead and administration costs from health care spending by transitioning to a government-run health care program similar to Canada's would save enough money to pay for the entire cost of the program. Woolhandler and Himmelstein are also the co-founders of Physicians for a National Health Program which has long advocated for a single-payer system. Their findings were echoed in another study published last year in The Lancet and a review of 22 studies published in PLOS Medicine.

Biden has made clear that he opposes a Medicare for All-style single-payer system although he has vowed to expand Obamacare. Gottfried said that progress will first likely have to come at the state level if New York and others can pass bills like his single-payer proposal.

""I think the most we can expect from the Biden administration is cooperation with states that want to do single-payer systems"" he said. ""I believe New York can implement single-payer coverage even without federal cooperation. It would be more complicated but we can do it.""

In Canada Gottfried observed single-payer health insurance ""began in one province and then another province joined in and in just a few years it became a provincial-based program but funded largely with federal money."" He suggested that the same could happen in the U.S. ""After one state enacts it you'll see more states doing it. Eventually either there will be a national program or there will be federal funding to help support state single-payer programs.""

The commission's report included numerous immediate reforms the Biden administration could use to improve public health en route to an eventual single-payer system including providing incentives for states to expand Medicaid if they have yet to do so — primarily in the South where half of America's Black population lives. The commission also recommended rolling back all Trump's efforts to undermine Obamacare and undoing his expansion of the public charge immigration rule.

""The public charge rule is a long-standing immigration term that originally just applied to people who receive cash benefits and who resided in long-term care institutions paid for at government expense"" Woolhandler said. ""Trump has expanded that rule so that it can encompass virtually any use of public benefits and that has really frightened many people in immigrant communities. People are afraid to enroll themselves or their children in Medicaid. They're afraid to use nutrition benefits. They're afraid to seek housing benefits and those things are very important for health.""

Biden quickly signed dozens of executive actions to roll back many of Trump's policies related to health care immigration climate and racial equity and plans additional executive orders and legislation to undo Trump's damage. But the commission emphasized that correcting inequity will require much more than rolling back four years of Republican policies.

""Policymakers are going to have to create the conditions that allow my patients to be healthy"" said Woolhandler who is also a practicing primary care physician. ""We need to change the direction of American public policy to make sure that people's needs are met and that the conditions for their health are met.

""If we fail to do that we're going to continue to see people feeling desperate see people feeling angry. Those are the conditions that allow the rise of autocratic leaders like Trump. So Trump may be gone but Trumpism will come back and cause problems for us unless we build a society that actually takes care of people.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9pbnN0ZWFkLW9mLWEtdW5pdmVyc2FsLWJhc2ljLWluY29tZS1nb3Zlcm5tZW50cy1zaG91bGQtZW5yaWNoLWV4aXN0aW5nLXNvY2lhbC1wcm9ncmFtcy0xNTQzNTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Instead of a universal basic income governments should enrich existing social programs,"Amid the COVID-19 pandemic the idea of a universal basic income (UBI) has been touted by those across the political spectrum as a prospective model of social security that would provide guaranteed cash to citizens.

But while UBI is desirable in principle it’s not a magic solution to the intricate and perennial problems of poverty and income inequality. Furthermore its implementation in Canada is not financially administratively politically or constitutionally feasible.

Within emerging literature on the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on employment and earning levels UBI has been elevated to the status of a panacea that could ease all the social and economic ills that societies are encountering during the crisis.

Ardent advocates of UBI have argued that it has the potential to reduce poverty narrow income inequality gaps address automation eradicate the stigma associated with collecting government assistance enhance the social well-being of citizens diminish dependency and streamline existing complex and fragmented social transfer programs and public services.

The appeal of UBI in Canada has become so strong that several Liberal MPs have asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to elevate UBI to the top of his policy agenda.

From CERB to a universal basic income?

Some advocates of UBI contend that the gradual conversion of the CERB (Canada Emergency Relief Benefit) into UBI is a logical progression.

However if UBI is set at a monthly $1000 unconditional benefit for every adult Canadian the total net annual cost would be $364 billion. Obviously that’s not only financially unsustainable it’s also politically suicidal.

On the other hand according to a report released by the Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer in 2020 the estimated cost of a watered-down version of UBI — called a guaranteed basic income — covering only low-income working-age Canadians (estimated at 9.6 million Canadians between the ages of 18 to 64) would be in range of $47.5 billion to $98.1 billion for a six-month period.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Richard Plume

Under this attenuated version of UBI — similar to the Ontario basic income pilot project introduced by the former provincial Liberal government in 2017 and later abandoned by Doug Ford’s government — individuals and couples would receive an annual income of $18329 and $25921 respectively.

The projected cost range depends on how much of the benefit is clawed back from recipients when any other income increases above an established threshold.

Taxes raised?

Even under this trimmed version of UBI however there could be pressure to significantly raise taxes to pay for it which could inflict colossal costs on the economy.

Some UBI advocates argue that part of the cost of maintaining the program could be recovered by eliminating or curtailing almost 55 federal and provincial social programs that have been put in place to assist low-income and vulnerable Canadians.

But a critical point they’re missing is the fact that current federal and provincial social programs have already created their own constituencies. Replacing existing social assistance programs with a guaranteed basic income might not be attractive to recipients of these existing benefits.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes

Under the Ontario Basic Income Pilot project for example people with disabilities were asked to give up other public supports in order to access the program. It was in fact due to the perceived unattractiveness of this trade-off that many people with disabilities refused to enrol in the program.

It’s a formidable task to persuade Canadians who have been attached to these programs to opt for even this attenuated version of UBI.

Government limitations

Finally one of the most challenging procedural constraints in adopting a UBI all but ignored by its proponents in Canada is a constitutional convention that limits the ability of the federal government to introduce a new social program.

The federal government has historically attempted to justify its politically contentious inroads into social policy domain by invoking federal spending power which permits Parliament to make payments to individuals organizations institutions and governments for purposes over which it has no constitutional jurisdiction.

Federal spending power has been the source of longtime contention between federal and provincial governments especially Québec which calls it an affront to provincial autonomy and sovereignty.

Under the ground rules established by the Social Union Framework Agreement (SUFA) of 1999 that Québec did not sign the federal government agreed to refrain from introducing new social programs without the consent of the majority of provinces.

That means establishing UBI as a national program requires tedious and complicated negotiations between federal and provincial governments. Reaching a political consensus on which current social programs should be trimmed or eliminated is a tall order.

Enrich current social programs instead

Rather than sacrificing existing social programs and services in favour of UBI federal and provincial governments should enrich current social programs and invest in Canadians in order to strengthen their capability to fully participate in employment and social life.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes

Adopting UBI requires a fundamental restructuring of the existing social safety net in Canada and would not necessarily culminate in conquering income inequality and poverty as its advocates have claimed.

Even some social justice activists have recently come to the realization that UBI “is not an alternative to neoliberalism but an ideological capitulation to it.” According to this line of reasoning UBI provides a golden opportunity and enormous latitude for governments at all levels to justify further cuts to public services like health care education and social housing and to shift the rising cost of living to individuals.

As Matthew Flisfeder a professor at the University of Winnipeg has aptly pointed out without reducing the cost of living UBI would become nothing more than “a mere prop to markets and a way to serve individual and household debts.”"

Durante un recorrido realizado por elCaribe se pudo observar que los tradicionales centros comerciales contaban con poca afluencia de personas en horas de la mañana.

Dentro de las plazas comerciales como Sambil Ágora Mall Galería 360 y Megacentro se observó un flujo de personas similar a cualquier domingo dentro de la pandemia notándose la mayor concentración de personas en las áreas de venta de comidas.

Avenidas como la San Vicente de Paul Duarte y Mella lucían poco transitadas en horas de la mañana.

El expresidente de la Asociación de Comerciantes de la avenida Duarte Manolito Fernández deploró la situación del comercio tradicional durante la celebración del Día de San Valentín y sostuvo que esos negocios están agonizando debido a la pandemia.

“Este San Valentín es un día muy difícil para los negocios tradicionales que no se enfocan en la venta de los productos solicitados para esta fecha. Las ventas han caído estrepitosamente debido a la pandemia dijo Fernández.

De su lado el gerente general de la tienda La Bomba ubicada en la avenida Duarte expresó que este año las ventas andan por alrededor de un 70% apenas cubriendo las expectativas.

Luna sostuvo que debido a la situación económica que vive el país por la pandemia no se esperaba la cantidad de clientes que acudía en años anteriores.

Manifestó que este año la gente ha estado solicitando artículos económicos como peluches joyería portarretratos y perfumes entre otros.

Sin embargo varios comerciantes consultados indicaron que no les ha ido tan mal en este año. Tal es el caso de Joslin Rivas quien tiene una pequeña surtidora en Villa Consuelo.

Indicó que las galletas en todas las formas y los chocolates fueron de los detalles que más se vendieron en su negocio para este Día del Amor y la Amistad.

Tradicionalmente las rosas y los arreglos florales son los más buscados en este día sin embargo vendedores informales de flores ubicados en los alrededores del Mercado Modelo se quejaron de las bajas en las ventas durante la celebración del día del amor y la amistad.

Rosa Hassaine sostiene que su pequeño negocio ha visto bajar las ventas en un 60% con relación al año pasado cuando no estaba la pandemia.

“No se está vendiendo nada porque la gente no tiene dinero debido a la pandemia. A penas se pica la comida” manifestó Hassaine.

Muchas personas que acudieron al lugar a comprar algún arreglo floral se quejaron por los altos precios de estos productos.

Los precios de los arreglos oscilan entre 450 y 1500 pesos de acuerdo al tamaño. Las rosas sueltas se estaban vendiendo entre 100 y 150 pesos.

Como dato curioso el santero Enmanuel Brioso resaltó que ese sector ha sido muy demandado con motivo del Día de San Valentín.

Señaló que muchos acuden a las santerías por razones espirituales y las situaciones difíciles que están enfrentando por motivo del Covid-19 mientras que otros solicitan conocer “lo que les depara el destino en su vida amorosa”.

Sin embargo contrario a este domingo el pasado sábado los comercios de la avenida Duarte se notaban concurridos observándose un flujo de personas comprando obsequios.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsYmF0LmNvbS9lbGR1Z291dC9NTEItVmVudGEtZGUtdGFyamV0YXMtZGUtYmVpc2JvbC1zZS1kaXNwYXJvLWVuLXBhbmRlbWlhLTIwMjEwMjE0LTAwMTQuaHRtbNIBaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsYmF0LmNvbS9lbGR1Z291dC9NTEItVmVudGEtZGUtdGFyamV0YXMtZGUtYmVpc2JvbC1zZS1kaXNwYXJvLWVuLXBhbmRlbWlhLTIwMjEwMjE0LTAwMTQuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MLB: Venta de tarjetas de béisbol se 'disparó' en pandemia,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.albat.com/eldugout/MLB-Venta-de-tarjetas-de-beisbol-se-disparo-en-pandemia-20210214-0014.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsYmF0LmNvbS9lbGR1Z291dC9NTEItVmVudGEtZGUtdGFyamV0YXMtZGUtYmVpc2JvbC1zZS1kaXNwYXJvLWVuLXBhbmRlbWlhLTIwMjEwMjE0LTAwMTQuaHRtbNIBaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsYmF0LmNvbS9lbGR1Z291dC9NTEItVmVudGEtZGUtdGFyamV0YXMtZGUtYmVpc2JvbC1zZS1kaXNwYXJvLWVuLXBhbmRlbWlhLTIwMjEwMjE0LTAwMTQuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbHNvbGRlbGVvbi5jb20ubXgvbG9jYWwvY29uLXZlbnRhcy1hLWxhLW1pdGFkLXktZW4tbGluZWEtc2Utc29zdGllbmVuLXByb3ZlZWRvcmVzLWRlLWxhLWNhZGVuYS1jdWVyby1jYWx6YWRvLWxlb24tZ3VhbmFqdWF0by1tZXhpY28temFwYXRvcy1jdXJ0aWR1cmlhLTYzNTkwODMuaHRtbNIBsAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbHNvbGRlbGVvbi5jb20ubXgvbG9jYWwvY29uLXZlbnRhcy1hLWxhLW1pdGFkLXktZW4tbGluZWEtc2Utc29zdGllbmVuLXByb3ZlZWRvcmVzLWRlLWxhLWNhZGVuYS1jdWVyby1jYWx6YWRvLWxlb24tZ3VhbmFqdWF0by1tZXhpY28temFwYXRvcy1jdXJ0aWR1cmlhLTYzNTkwODMuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Con ventas a la mitad y en línea se sostienen proveedores de la cadena cuero-calzado,"León Gto.- Con ventas de poco más del 50% en comparación con el año 2002 y sin registrar el cierre de ningún negocio relacionado al sector de la proveeduría de la industria del cuero calzado marroquinería y textil comerciantes del Mercado la República de León se dicen listos para enfrentar los retos que representa este año 2021.

No obstante este mercado no estuvo exento al embate de la pandemia.

El cierre de joyerías tiendas restricciones de movilidad y viajes así como la incertidumbre económica hicieron que las ventas de diamantes para joyería cayeran 15% en 2020 comparado con el año anterior de acuerdo con un estudio elaborado por la consultora Bain & Company.

Pero los ‘mejores amigos de las mujeres’ buscaron caminos digitales para poder llegar a sus joyeros. La venta dio un giro hacia el comercio electrónico y el mercado se vio beneficiado por los consumidores que no gastaron en viajes o en experiencias y prefirieron los diamantes.

En 2020 la industria del diamante en su conjunto se benefició inesperadamente ya que los consumidores que no podían gastar en experiencias o viajes utilizaron esos fondos para artículos como diamantes que se consideran una inversión física tangible

dijo Olya Linde socia de Bain & Company.

Añadió que más del 75% de los consumidores tienen la intención de gastar la misma cantidad o más en joyas de diamantes que antes de la crisis lo que indica una conexión emocional fuerte y continua con la historia de las piedras preciosas.

La demanda de estas se recuperó en el cuarto trimestre del año periodo que culminó con una fuerte temporada navideña en todo el mundo impulsadas principalmente por China y Estados Unidos donde las ventas crecieron de 5% a 10% y de 15% a 20% respectivamente en el cuarto trimestre de 2020 contra el mismo lapso del año anterior.

Los diamantes probaron su dureza en el mercado global pues de acuerdo a la consultora sus ventas cayeron menos que el mercado global de lujo en el mismo año cuando retrocedió 22%.

Así se comportaron todas las categorías de lujo en el año de la pandemia

La producción mundial de diamantes en bruto cayó a 111 millones de quilates en 2020 o un retroceso de 20% contra 2019. En 2017 alcanzó su máximo con 152 millones de quilates en producción.

Ventas en línea ganan terreno

El COVID-19 aceleró la conversión de ventas físicas a canales digitales. En 2020 cerca del 20% de las ventas minoristas de diamantes fueron en línea frente al casi 13% que se vio el año previo.

El 70% de los consumidores utilizan las herramientas digitales para la búsqueda de joyería antes de realizar la compra en tienda.

Aunque esta tendencia es complicada que se revierta totalmente después de la pandemia los retailers deben invertir en sus capacidades digitales para hacer amigable la experiencia de compra en línea e interacciones ominicanales

detalla el estudio.

Pese a lo anterior entre 90 y 95% de los consumidores prefieren comprar los diamantes en las tiendas físicas donde aprecian el ver tocar y ser aconsejados por los expertos en su compra.

Bain & Company estima que el mercado minorista de joyería de diamantes de China se recuperará a inicios de 2021 mientras que en otros países desarrollados alcanzará niveles prepandémicos en 2022 y 2023. La recuperación en países emergentes como México seguirá un año después.

No se espera una recuperación total y un retorno a la trayectoria histórica de crecimiento hasta 2022 y 2024. Tres factores afectarán el ritmo y la forma de la recuperación: la epidemia la respuesta de la política gubernamental y la respuesta de los consumidores

detalla el estudio.

Stephen Daniel DeFiore of Brandon Florida received about $2325 between October 20 2018 and November 9 2018 in exchange for swapping the targeted customers’ SIM cards with ones belonging to a co-conspirator prosecutors in New Orleans said earlier this week. For each SIM swap the co-conspirator sent DeFiore the customer’s phone number a four-digit PIN and a SIM card number to which that phone number was to be swapped prosecutors said.

The charges come eight months after federal prosecutors charged Richard Yuan Li of Hercules California with conspiracy to commit fraud for his alleged role in a SIM swap scam that targeted at least twenty people. Li was in possession of an iPhone 8 which the number of at least one of DeFiore's victims was routed to prosecutors said.

The alleged victim was a New Orleans-area medical doctor with cryptocurrency accounts at exchanges including Binance Bittrex Coinbase Gemini Poloniex ItBit and Neo Wallet. Li and his co-conspirators then allegedly accessed the physician’s email and cryptocurrency accounts and stole a “significant portion” of the victim’s holdings.

Prosecutors went on to allege that even after the doctor recovered the phone account Li or one of his co-conspirators called the doctor to say he had viewed images in the doctor’s Gmail account and balances in the doctor’s cryptocurrency accounts. The caller then demanded 100 bitcoins worth about $640000 at the time in exchange for not publishing the photos or stealing the cryptocurrency.

Prosecutors didn’t identify the phone company DeFiore worked for but this LinkedIn profile lists a Stephen DiFiore who works as a Verizon customer service representative in Brandon Florida. Verizon representatives didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment for this story. Attempts to reach DeFiore weren't successful.

This week’s charges come as so-called SIM swapping crimes continue to proliferate motivated in large part by criminals’ attempts to obtain large amounts of cryptocurrency in online accounts. Once a perpetrator obtains control over victims’ phone accounts the perp typically uses that access to complete account resets for email accounts and from there resets passwords for other accounts.

If convicted DeFiore faces a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250000. Earlier this week European officials announced the arrests of 10 individuals in connection with a series of SIM-swapping attacks that reaped more than $100 million.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3dtdC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC90d28tc3VzcGVjdHMtaW4tY3VzdG9keS1vbmUtbW9yZS1hdC1sYXJnZS1hZnRlci1yb2JiZXJ5LWF0dGVtcHQtYXQtZ3JhbmQtcmFwaWRzLXN0b3Jl0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d210LmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC90d28tc3VzcGVjdHMtaW4tY3VzdG9keS1vbmUtbW9yZS1hdC1sYXJnZS1hZnRlci1yb2JiZXJ5LWF0dGVtcHQtYXQtZ3JhbmQtcmFwaWRzLXN0b3Jl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two suspects in custody 1 more at large after robbery attempt at Grand Rapids cell store,"Two people were arrested after an attempted robbery at a Verizon store in Grand Rapids Sunday Feb. 14 2021.

Veldman tells us the two met at Dordt University in Iowa; ""Basically he saw me around campus and wanted to get to know me but was kind of too shy to talk to me.""

""So he had a friend introduced us and then we started talking and it was history ever since.""

The pair dated for five years then got engaged after college.

The wedding date was set for July 11th 2020.

So we asked Veldman what they call each other now months later in 2021.

She says""We say to each other that we're husband and wife but when we are talking to a third party we have to be 'fiance's.'""

That's right. Turns out as all good love stories do this love story has a twist.

""So we are not legally married"" explains Eekhoff.

""We got married with a pastor in a church because we are religious and wanted to make sure we did that. However because of our K-1 Fiance Visa we can't be legally married until she gets the approval from Canada.""

Due to the pandemic and borders being closed Veldman and Eekhoff were never able to get married in 2020.

Today they are still not legally married and they are still forced to live in different countries four plane rides apart.

""We just want to be together"" says Veldman.

""And that couldn't happen"" echos Eekhoff.

The couple's K-1 Fiance Visa has reached approval from the United States but they are still waiting for approval from Canada.

Eekhoff tells us ""It's been a long process.""

""Before covid-19 our lawyer said someone had this done in five to six months... we've been doing it for a year now.""

Veldman adds; ""Unfortunately I'm kind of just stuck here until we hear about our visa. We don't know if we'll hear in a week a month or three months.""

So this Valentine's Day Hannah from Canada and Devin living in Iowa's love story continues.

Temporarily separated by some 2000 miles these two say say they'll make it work.

""It's not about how you feel it's about how you can best support your significant other"" says Eekhoff.

They hope you'll take their love story as encouragement to appreciate the little everyday moments you have with your loved ones in person this year.

""People say it's a make it or break it thing and it really is"" reflects Veldman.

""Because if you are so in love with this person it doesn't matter if you're in different countries it doesn't matter where you are you're going to make it work.""

Hannah and Devin say they do hope to have another wedding celebration in Canada when their K-1 Fiance Visa finally received approval.

Around Ashland that was Berkleytown.

The small Black community in Hanover County was just outside the Ashland limits where the town’s segregation ordinance didn’t apply. Passed in 1911 the measure prohibited anyone from moving onto a block where a different race was in the majority.

The pattern was common in Virginia said Blake McDonald an architectural historian at the state Department of Historic Resources.

“Ashland did something that a lot of towns and cities in Virginia were doing at the time – introducing housing policies that made it almost impossible for Blacks to own property in the white part of town” McDonald said.

“What makes Berkleytown special is that it is an intact early- to mid-20th-century African American community that was developed in direct relation to segregationist housing policy in the town of Ashland.”

Though long overlooked such communities are now getting consideration for landmark status in recognition of their importance to Virginia history. Ashland has received a state grant to start the process for Berkleytown which is now within the town limits north of Randolph-Macon College.

***

The 60-acre area called Berkleytown began to develop after the estate of Edward Berkeley subdivided seven lots on a country road just north of Ashland in 1894. The earliest homes on Berkley Street were constructed by white residents but by the 1920s the area was predominantly Black.

Coleman was a Black entrepreneur who would make his mark in Berkleytown but first he tried in Ashland.

Shortly after the town's segregation ordinance passed he bought a rental property near relatives in Ashland. When Coleman decided to live there a year later he was fined $20 for violating the ordinance. He sued the town took the case to the Virginia Court of Appeals and lost in 1915. (Two years later the U.S. Supreme Court declared such ordinances unconstitutional in a case from Louisville Ky.)

By that time Coleman apparently had decided to return to Berkleytown according to Meriwether Gilmore whose 2019 master's thesis at the University of Richmond explored the segregation ordinance.

Around 1918 Coleman built a simplified Queen Anne-style Sears Roebuck house on Berkley Street – a home where later resident Virginia Shelton would live to be 108 years old. In the 1920s Coleman built a hotel on Henry Street for Black customers among other business interests he developed.

The house and former hotel are two of the anchoring buildings for the potential Berkleytown historic district. So is the former John M. Gandy High School built in 1950 and now home to the Hanover school administration offices.

Dovetail Cultural Resource Group in Fredericksburg is preparing a preliminary information form for the historic district application process using a $3500 grant awarded to Ashland by the state DHR.

Berkleytown is eligible as a historic district because it is tied to important trends in community planning and design according to a DHR architectural survey form completed in October 2020.

""This community emerged in the 1910s and 1920s as an acceptable area for African American residents” the form says. Barred from living in Ashland's downtown core they built a community on land immediately adjacent to town – ""thus ironically allowing them to continue to work in the same area where they were barred from living.”

The more detailed nomination for the National Register of Historical Places could follow the initial research phase.

***

Carolyn Hemphill founder of the Hanover County Black Heritage Society grew up in Ashland during segregation and remembers going to Berkleytown for school.

“The irony with me” she said is that “I grew up on Hanover Avenue two blocks from Henry Clay Elementary School. I had to pass the white school to get to Gandy. ... That was the beginning of my awareness of segregation.""

Hemphill vividly remembers the secondhand books – some torn – that came from the white school and were used by Gandy students. Still Gandy was part of the Black community's beating heart in Berkleytown and beyond.

“That school covered all of Hanover County"" she said. ""Everybody who was Black had a mother father brother sister aunt uncle who went to that school. It was a focal point.”

If the books were sometimes in tatters so was the predecessor to Gandy.

Before the school was built in 1950 – with central heat and indoor plumbing – Black students came to the site to attend the Hanover Training School. Its collection of buildings included a hand-me-down elementary school that was rebuilt at the Berkleytown location when white students got a new brick building.

“One of the buildings I had classes in the boys would have to go to the basement and get coal for the stove"" said NaChay Grimes 80. “When you’re not used to anything else you don’t realize how different things could be.

""Then you start to hearing things"" Grimes said. ""Some people in the neighborhood started a movement to get us to have the same books and facilities that other schools did. It took quite awhile.”

***

Beyond education Berkleytown was a business center for Black residents. It had a funeral home a bakery a barbershop and a beautician. John Coleman's hotel building became an Elks Lodge and remained a place for social gatherings. A Masonic lodge met nearby.

“It was the community for middle-class blacks business owners teachers people who worked for the railroad” Tonia Burruss said.

Burruss 57 an adult education instructor said she started school in the first officially integrated classes at Gandy. Her worldview was broadened because her father did business with people all over Hanover but her home community was still close-knit.

Burruss’ sister built a house in Berkleytown when her first child was born.

“She raised all her girls there” Burruss said. “She said ‘I want to be close to Granny’s house. … I want my daughters to have the same upbringing I had.' Everybody would watch your kids and it was safe.”

Grimes still lives on Henry Street a block from the home where her family moved when she was 5 years old.

“We had a core of families that were closely knit” Grimes said. “Everybody looked out for each other. I didn’t necessarily appreciate that as a child. ... You knew that the neighbors’ eyes were on you ... It felt very safe. I could go to just about any of the houses and ask for what I needed.”

In high school Grimes got a job at Lightfoot bakery.

“I would go there at 6 a.m. and pack pastries for deliveries to the drug store the truck stop. I would work there until 7:30 and then run across the street to get ready for school"" Grimes said.

“The first month I was there I would nearly eat myself to death. After a while you see it so much that you don’t even want it. I liked the eclairs – and unfortunately I still like them!”

Ashley Ricks grew up on Henry and B streets in Berkleytown and still lives in Ashland. He said his childhood was like “Leave It to Beaver” a popular sitcom in the late 1950s.

“It was a small town not anything that I thought of as being so remarkable"" he said.

Ricks a retired educator from public schools and Reynolds Community College said almost all of the households in Berkleytown were two-parent homes of working-class families.

“It was just life as it was"" he said with segregation being part of it.

For the most part Ricks said “people lived in harmony with each other. There was very little other than work things where Blacks and whites intermingled with each other.

""I did see what I would look at now as police brutality. Then it was just normal. Like when they arrested somebody on the street a Black guy had too much to drink and they beat him like a Rodney King thing. You lived in that kind of fear.

“I learned a lot from the negative things"" Ricks said ""but I don’t like to dwell on them. ... There were a lot of positive things in my life.""

His cousin Roslyn de Cordova 74 remembers one such tradition from living across the street from her great-grandmother: walking the unpaved roads to Easter egg hunts at a neighbor’s house.

A retired teacher she also recalls her parents stressing education. ""In the summer we had a schedule to read and to play"" said de Cordova who now lives in Henrico County.

“It was all family here” recalled Emily Lee 74 who grew up and still lives on a family tract at the corner of Berkley and School streets. Her ranch house has a view of the lot where her grandparents once lived.

“It started changing after I was in high school” she said.

***

Over the years the early Berkleytown owners added rooms and further modernized homes that may have started out with simple cinderblock construction. Exteriors may have been covered with siding or stucco. New homes sprung up where land was available.

In 1977 Berkleytown formally became part of Ashland in an annexation that expanded the town from about 1 square mile to about 4. Dirt roads on A and B streets were paved. Water and sewer services were added.

As opportunities opened elsewhere children of longtime Berkleytown residents dispersed. Descendants of the older generation often sold or rented out the homes they inherited. Apartments began to cater to Randolph-Macon students.

But enough original fabric remains to tell the story of a community that offered support and opportunity in spite of oppression.

Ajena Rogers supervisory park ranger at the Maggie L. Walker National Historic Site in downtown Richmond lives in Ashland. She sees parallels to the Black neighborhood where she grew up in Roanoke and the historically Black neighborhood of Jackson Ward where she works.

“There are unintended consequences with integration” she said. “You as a community gained the right to be treated with dignity as you should have been all along. What happens is the tightness of the community erodes.

“It’s a consequence of being able to spread out to go where you want to go to take your business wherever you want it"" Rogers said. ""You still have that pride in the neighbors who brought you up the businesses they established. By now 40 to 50 years later it’s a remnant of what it was a memory of what used to be.”

No one would advocate for returning to the restrictions that created Berkleytown and similar communities she said but “there’s sort of a sadness for the good things that were there that were lost. That’s why it’s really important to preserve what was there so it doesn’t get lost completely.”

Burruss the adult education instructor agrees. The potential designation as a historic district would honor the perseverance and legacy of those who built and nurtured Berkleytown.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vb2FrbGFuZGNvdW50eTExNS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8xMy9mcm96ZW4td2VkZGluZy1kcmVzc2VzLWJ1aWxkLW9uLWludGVybmV0LXRyZW5kLWF0LXRoZS13ZWRkaW5nLXNob3BwZS1pbi1iZXJrbGV5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Frozen Wedding Dresses Build on Internet Trend...,"

Frozen Wedding Dresses Build on Internet Trend at The Wedding Shoppe in Berkley

(Crystal A. Proxmire Feb. 13 2021)

Berkley MI – “I bet that would be fun.” or “I should try that.”

Those are the words typed by thousands of people on social media in response to photos showing frozen jeans held upright by the ice serving as wintertime art installations.

But unlike most of those people the women at The Wedding Shoppe in Downtown Berkley actually got out their buckets and gave it a try.

Except they didn’t stick with the typical blues. They froze three wedding dresses which now seem to float in their places along the side of Coolidge Hwy.

Shawn Vilk saw the idea and brought it up to the owner of The Wedding Shoppe Michelle McFarland. For 21 years The Wedding Shoppe has been sharing love and beauty with their dresses jewelry and other accessories for brides and bridesmaids. They’ve been in their current location for 3 1/2 years and are already a destination spot for the beautiful floral mural added to the side of their shop in 2019 as part of the Downtown Berkley Mural program.

“Brides and bridesmaids come all the time to take selfies and videos there. Brides stop by on their wedding day” McFarland told Oakland County Times. “One woman came with her white convertible and took the best picture.”

Now people are starting to do that with the three frozen wedding dresses in front of the shop they put up Friday.

“We like doing things that make people smile” she said. “We’re in the business of making people happy.”

This bit of happiness took several tries to get right giving the ladies plenty to giggle about as they went through the trials and errors. “It was fun trying to figure it out.”

Eventually the solution was to disassemble a mannequin and reassemble it in a way that made it easy to take apart later. The mannequin held up a dress while the women dumped buckets of water on it and when it was strong enough to stand on it’s own the mannequin was removed leaving only a a base to add some stability and weight in the bottom. The tops of the dress and the long skirts will soften and crumple when the temperature tops 32 degrees.

She hopes the dresses will remain frozen in place for a while but “it depends on the weather” McFarland said.

“We’re already thinking of what to do next year. We hope to make this a tradition.”

The Wedding Shoppe is located at 2186 Cooldige Hwy north of 11 Mile Road. The boutique is open by appointment only. Learn more at www.TheWeddingShoppe.net.

At a meeting of Cookstown Rural Council with Mr J P Duff JP presiding a resolution protesting against the proposed closure of the railway line was unanimously passed.

Mr A Berkley JP speaking in favour of the resolution declared: “Transport in Northern Ireland is now in a more chaotic condition than ever before. The only things we are promised are the closing of the railways increased freight charges and the borrowing of additional millions of pounds to experiment with during the next three years and thus increase the debit balance.”

Snow in Cookstown. At a meeting of Cookstown Rural Council in February 1950 with Mr J P Duff JP presiding a resolution protesting against the proposed closure of the railway line was unanimously passed reported the News Letter. Picture: Mid Ulster Mail archive

The resolution that was agreed on read: “That this council views with grave concern the proposal by the Ulster Transport Authority to close that railway to passenger traffic between Cookstown and Cookstown Junction and the Derry Central line between Magherafelt and Macfin. Any action in this direction would be nothing short of a disaster both for this area as well as Northern Ireland generally where the indicated policy appears to be the closing of the railways by suitable stages. What is proposed could not possibly solve the present economic difficulties.”"

Food giants Walmart Costco and Kroger – which together last year totalled sales worth more than half a trillion dollars – are selling Brazilian beef products imported by JBS the world’s largest meat company which has been embroiled in a string of deforestation allegations in recent years.

Food giants Walmart Costco and Kroger – which together totalled net sales worth more than half a trillion dollars last year – are selling Brazilian beef products imported from JBS the world’s largest meat company which has been linked to deforestation.

Brazilian beef has been identified as a key driver of deforestation in the Amazon where swathes of forest are cleared for pasture used for cattle farming. The Amazon is a crucial buffer in stabilising the regional and global climate. Experts say preserving the world’s rainforests is essential if further intensification of the climate emergency is to be averted.

Research by the Guardian the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the nonprofit data analysis agency C4ADS established that in recent years the JBS subsidiary Sampco Inc has imported thousands of tonnes of Brazilian beef destined for grocery chains and other food companies into the US.



The products include shredded and canned (corned) beef as well as frozen meat and steaks. In December Sampco-branded shredded beef produced in a JBS factory in São Paulo was being sold online by both Walmart and Costco and shipping data pinpoints JBS exports of Brazilian corned beef being supplied for sale in Kroger stores.

Between July 2017 and November 2019 Sampco imported more than 5000 consignments of Brazilian beef products totalling 7884 tonnes records obtained by C4ADS show.

Responding to these findings campaigners called on the grocery chains to take swift action to rid supply chains of deforestation-linked products.



“Supermarkets need to go beyond their sustainability rhetoric by setting strict requirements for their suppliers banning deforestation monitoring their suppliers for compliance and dropping contracts with the worst offenders like JBS” said Lucia von Reusner senior campaign director of international campaign organisation Mighty Earth.



Costco declined to answer questions but pointed to its sustainability policies which state: “Our intent is not to source beef from high-risk deforestation regions until comprehensive traceability and monitoring systems are in place.”

A Walmart spokesperson said: “Walmart takes these allegations seriously and will review the claims made. We believe healthy forests sustain biodiversity support livelihoods and play an important role in mitigating climate change. Walmart is working with suppliers on certification monitoring supporting sustainable sourcing regions promoting collaborative action and advocating for effective policy.”

A spokesperson for Kroger said: “We take deforestation seriously as demonstrated by our no-deforestation commitment and continue to engage our suppliers in pursuit of this commitment and to ensure no deforestation is happening in our relevant supply chains.”



JBS beef exports have been linked to farms involved in up to 115 sq miles (300 sq km) of deforestation a year. The company slaughters almost 35000 cattle a day in Brazil.



A JBS spokesperson said: “The spurious allegation that JBS exports are linked to deforestation is irresponsible and based on flawed superficial analysis of the correlation between the concentration of deforestation at municipality level and the location of our plants. Correlation is not causation.”

Campaigners said the latest revelations highlighted the urgent need for US laws that combat deforestation. To date there has not been any significant proposal in the US for federal legislation outlawing agricultural imports linked to tropical deforestation unlike in Britain and the EU where momentum for new rules has recently gathered pace.

“The US is complicit in driving global deforestation through its sales of beef products from Brazil” said Sarah Lake Mighty Earth’s vice-president and director for Latin America. “The Biden administration has an opportunity to advance legislation to restrict the import of products linked to deforestation just as the EU the UK and France are already doing.”

Brian Schatz Democratic senator for Hawaii said before the Covid pandemic that he planned to introduce such legislation. And last week a bill was introduced to the California state assembly that would require contractors supplying products to the state to ensure they are not linked to deforestation overseas.

RUSSELLVILLE Ky. – A man shot by law enforcement Thursday night in the Russellville Walmart parking lot died Friday at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

Brian D. Ellis 44 of Hopkinsville died as a result of gunshot wounds sustained in this incident according Kentucky State Police.

Kentucky State Police were called Thursday night to investigate an officer-involved shooting at the Russellville Walmart.

State police said the initial investigation indicates that the Logan County Sheriff’s Office responded to the area of 120 Sam Walton Drive in Russellville in an attempt to locate Ellis who had active felony warrants on attempted murder according to a release from KSP.

Ellis was driving a 2020 Kia and when depuites made contact with Ellis deputies said he drove his car toward them at which time shots were fired according to the release.

Ellis was struck according to the release.

Ellis was taken to a local hospital and transferred to another hospital KSP Sgt. Brandon Brooks said.

No other official details were released.

Brittany Biro who said she recorded a video of a portion of the incident in the Walmart parking lot captured video of a person in a white vehicle who appeared to be boxed in by what looked like police vehicles. The driver of the white vehicle backed into what appears to be an unmarked police vehicle in what looked like an attempt to drive away.

Someone emerged from near the unmarked vehicle and fired four shots. It is not clear if the person firing the shots had been inside that vehicle or outside of it.

Brio said the incident was frightening.

Kentucky State Police declined to comment on the video.

The incident remains under investigation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc3JlY29yZG5ld3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMS8wMi8xMy9jb3BzLWNpdHktbWFuYWdlci1hbW9uZy12aWN0aW1zLXdhbG1hcnQtYmFzZS10aGVmdC1pZC1zY2hlbWUvNDQ3MzA3NDAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cops: City manager among victims of theft ID scheme,"Police say Wichita Falls’ city manager was one of several victims of ID theft that resulted from a scheme involving a contractor working out of the Walmart store on Lawrence Road.

Details of the alleged scheme emerged from an arrest affidavit for one suspected participant Darrell Damont Petty Jr.

The affidavit says the scheme came to light when City Manager Darron Leiker and another man notified authorities in early November their personal identifying information had been compromised.

Investigators came to believe the identifying information had been used by an employee of Premium Retail Phone Sales a company that contracts with Walmart to sell phones and phone service. They believe the stolen information was used to buy Apple iPhones and open iPhone accounts.

Police spoke with a clerk for Premium Retail Sales. The affidavit says the clerk admitted his involvement in a scheme to commit retail theft though the use of stolen identification. The clerk also identified a woman involved in the scheme who used stolen ID for a transaction.

Store security video led investigators to believe a fourth person a man was also involved in the scheme.

Police arrested Petty Friday and charged him with Engaging in Organized Criminal Activity/Fraudulent Use or Possession of Identifying Information. His bond was recommended at $5000 and he remained in the Wichita County Jail Saturday.

Bau was a painter filmmaker writer poet and “a very secret man” who survived the Holocaust by talent luck and love presenting his interpretation of the history of the Jewish people and the tekumah (the rise) of Israel through his art and writings.

Joseph Bau was born in Krakow in 1920. By his teen years he was a published cartoonist who throughout his life used his talents to save hundreds of Jewish lives and for the benefit of the Jewish state. He was a quintessential part of Israel’s early film and animation industry becoming known as “the Israeli Walt Disney.”

Bau authored 10 books including his Holocaust memoir Shnot Tarzach (The Murder Years) titled Dear God Have You Ever Gone Hungry? in English. The book written in Hebrew has been translated into English Arabic Chinese Dutch Polish Spanish and soon into Russian. It chronicles survival in the midst of death; it is a story of seeking life.

I spoke with Hadasa Bau and Clila Bau Cohen co-directors of the museum housed in their multi-talented father’s graphics studio. The two rooms overflow with paintings photographs books and posters he created for mid-century Israeli movies. Bau designed several internationally recognized Hebrew fonts that characterized Israel’s early animations movies and commercials.

There is a special focus on Bau’s studies of the Hebrew language. “Coming to Israel was his lifelong dream” says Clila. “He saw Hebrew as an essential bond.” The space has been transformed into a place of memory and laughter a gallery of art and invention.

When the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939 Bau was a student at the Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow now part of Jagiellonian University in Krakow. His knowledge of Gothic lettering became his initial ticket to survival both in Ghetto Krakow and Plaszow Concentration Camp. “It was another one of the many miracles of his life” says daughter Clila. “The Germans needed his skills.”

From Ghetto Krakow Bau was sent to the Plaszow Concentration Camp built on the grounds of Krakow’s Jewish cemetery. It was completely obliterated by the Nazis as they retreated. Other than survivors’ testimony Bau’s maps are the only tangible proof of its existence. The camp maps he created were the blueprint for the settings of Steven Spielberg’s Schindler’s List.

Bau fell in love with Rebecca Tennenbaum in Plasazow. Despite their situation they were determined to marry. Bau traded several days of his bread ration for a tiny silver spoon and several additional days’ rations to have it fashioned into two rings. On February 13 1944 disguised as a woman he snuck into Rebecca’s bunk.

His mother pronounced the sheva brachot (seven blessings) of the Jewish wedding ceremony immortalized and embellished in Steven Spielberg’s Oscar award-winning film Schindler’s List. Bau called it “complete nonsense” that the couple had a huppa (wedding canopy). “Who ever heard of sheets in a camp?” he said.

Clila recalls about her mother “She was a woman who had no fear. She had access to the office of the camp commandant the brutal Amon Goeth because she was his manicurist. She asked Goeth’s secretary a Jew whose mother she had saved to place her husband’s name on the list instead of hers. “I’m not afraid” she said. “I will survive.”

Bau’s name was then listed for transfer to Schindler’s factory; Rebecca was soon sent to Auschwitz. She never told her husband she had saved him until their 50th anniversary – and then only when a journalist interviewed the couple prior to the release of Spielberg’s film.

“My father was flabbergasted shocked” her daughter says. “And so were we.” Asked why she had not told her husband the story Rebecca always in character said “I didn’t want you to feel that you owed me because I did it from love. You would have known one day when my diary will be found.” Clila Bau Cohen and Hadasa Bau wearing shirts with their father’s signature a cipher of mystery.

The diary remained a secret until after her death.

OSKAR SCHINDLER considered cooperating with the Nazis as “good for business.” He made a deal with Goeth enabling him to establish a factory in Brunlitz Czechoslovakia staffed with a slave labor force of 800 Jews from the Plaszow camp all expected to die from the difficult work or from starvation. They became Schinlerjuden – Schindler’s Jews – people for whom he considered himself responsible. He demanded an additional 400 workers including children of those on his original list and partially through Bau’s ability to “create” needed documentation – ration cards permits etc. – managed to save the lives of every one. Schindler sabotaged his project by making defective or wrong caliber bullet cartridges. “Our father always said that had the war not ended when it did the Nazis would have discovered Schindler’s subterfuge and murdered everyone.”

The friendship between Schindler and Bau remained strong until Schindler’s death in 1974. On one of his visits to Israel Schindler told the then-five-year-old Clila.“I am your grandfather.” She did not understand knowing all her grandparents had died.

Schindler explained: “I saved your father’s life therefore I am your grandfather.”

In 1962 Schindler was designate a Righteous Gentile by Yad Vashem. In his later years he was largely supported by the Jewish community and Schindler List survivors. He is buried in the Catholic section of the Mount Zion Cemetery in Jerusalem.

Schindler’s List premiered in Israel in 1994. Clila and Hadasa say they were concerned about the traumatic effect viewing the film might have on their parents. Joseph and Rebecca Bau are among the survivors shown in the film’s closing scene who one by one place memorial stones on Schindler’s grave.

“We didn’t want our parents to see the movie but they believed it to be their duty to honor the Jewish martyrs” Clila says. “We sat on either side of them to hold them close. When it was over we asked our father ‘Was it so terrible?’

‘No’ he said. ‘It was 10 times worse. If Spielberg had shown the full horror of the reality no one would have been unable to watch the movie.’”

Finding Rebecca

Like thousands who survived the horrors of the Holocaust Joseph Bau returned to the once familiar Krakow. There he sought the aid of the reemerging Jewish community and asked for information about his family. He had witnessed his father’s murder; his hope was to find his mother his wife or his younger lder brother.

Rumors swirled about his wife. She had been sent to Auschwitz with Bau’s mother Cila who died shortly after liberation. Rebecca survived. She and several others traveling by horse and wagon suffered a tragic accident near Freudental Czechoslovakia. Bau still in his concentration camp uniform was permitted to board a train. Exhausted he fell asleep missed his station. When he awoke he panicked and jumped off. He did not catch the already departed train. The train Bau missed derailed and fell off a high bridge. All on board died.

“Another miracle” says Clila.

Waiting at the station still in camp uniform Bau was accused of being an escaped Nazi arrested and taken to police headquarters. He finally proved he was a survivor not a Nazi and told of his search for Rebecca a sympathetic policeman recalled hearing the story of a wagon carrying women survivors of Auschwitz that had over turned. In a farmer’s cart and by foot Bau quickly made his way to the hospital.

Years later Rebecca wrote: “Lying in the ward I heard that whistle – our whistle. I think I am in heaven – I hear my husband. But no. Everyone said ‘We hear it too.’”

“How I desired this meeting” Bau wrote. “I didn’t have the words to explain the miracle the collection of memories of that happy day. I tried to look for the right expression to describe this meeting – the miracle of missing the train the miracle of the Czech woman who accused me and forced me to the police; the miracle that he knew of the accident.”

The couple returned to Krakow where they married again this time with in a proper Jewish ceremony on February 14 Valentine’s Day – a day after their second Plaszow anniversary. Bau finished his university degree and became a political cartoonist for several Polish newspapers.

Throughout he was secretly working for Aliyah Bet – a post war immigration movement and provided “documents” required by the British Mandate. Rebecca opened a cosmetology clinic. Their first daughter Hadasa was born in Krakow.

Bau achieved significant postwar fame and the Polish government was unwilling to let him emigrate. The little family was carefully watched. One night a neighbor hid them until the police surveillance ended. They escaped to Israel in 1950 initially living in ma’abarah Sha’ar Aliyah (Gateway for Immigration camp) near Haifa. They soon moved to Tel Aviv where he eventually established his art and graphics studio.

Bau began working in Tel Aviv at the Kiryah – City Hall – then the seat of Israel’s government. His office was next to the office of the prime pinister David Ben-Gurion.

The artist’s great humor hid the nature of the complex network of which he was the hub. “Many days” recalls his younger daughter “he complained that Ben-Gurion did not laugh at his jokes. Finally came the day when he could at last tell my mom ‘Today he laughed!’”

“Our father always wanted to make people happy” says Hadasa. “There was plenty of merriment at home. ‘Learn to tell a story to sing to tell jokes’ he told us. He taught me to write songs always with humor and taught Clila how to tell jokes. He always said ‘If your mother and I were happy in the darkest of times everyone can learn the meaning of happiness and love from us.’”

Bau dreamed of making animated films but in those years there was little awareness of cartooning in Israel. He built Israel’s first animation studio and created the world’s smallest 35 millimeter movie theater. “We’re told it’s eligible for listing in the Guinness Book of Records” Clila says. With a chuckle she adds “All we need is to find $9000 to pay the fee!”

Bau might have chosen an easier life in the United States notes Hadasa. “His brother wanted him to come to New York to work as an animator but my father opted to stay in Israel.”

Writing in 1955 Bau had written that “life in Israel is very difficult; everyone needs to borrow money.” Still remembers Clila “he found a way to give gifts to everyone – often with boxes full of Israeli oranges.”

Joseph Bau died in Tel Aviv at the age of 81. In 2004 an exhibition honoring his works on the Hebrew language was mounted in the halls of the Knesset Israel’s parliament building.

Shimon Peres Reuven Rivlin a contingent of members of Knesset and many others attended. “We were surprised by the presence of some many of Israel’s leaders and famous personalities” his daughter recalls. “We wondered why ‘everyone’ was there. How did they know our father?”

“We want to say something” announced a speaker. “Even his daughters don’t know: Joseph Bau was the prime graphic artist of the Mossad (Israel’s spy agency) – its chief forger.”

“We were puzzled” Hadasa says. “It took a few years to believe – until we had confirmation from a number of former spies.”

The daughters have been told Bau was in continuous danger because “he knew all the secrets.” Based on knowledge shared after Bau’s death Bau worked for the Shin Bet (Israel’s internal intelligence agency) for decades.

He remained so deeply under cover in order to protect his family. Until after his death his daughters did not know that Bau worked for the Mossad. We always thought of him as a quiet simple man. “We’ve learned that his work included forging documents for spies” says Clila. “including the paperwork Eli Cohen used to establish his position in Syria and the passports and papers needed for the team that captured Eichmann in Argentina.”

“He described himself as ‘just a draftsman’” says Clila. “We now understand that the studio in Tel Aviv may have served as a cover for his essential work for the security of Israel.

“Perhaps this was the reason that when a proposal was made to open a world class animation studio to be called Bau Geva the plan was stopped. Greater fame would have brought greater attention. Instead his expertise in animation was put to good use by the IDF and the Mossad. They are still not willing to show them to us.”

“He was never fearful and never limited” says his daughter. “He had lived through so much little could frighten him. My father was a bit of a Peter Pan – always full of laughter able to find the positive in virtually every situation. Financial rewards were never his priority.”

The works of Joseph Bau have been exhibited throughout the world including in America Canada Britain Poland Russia and China. In 2007 he was the first Israeli artist to have his works displayed in the halls of the United Nations.

On January 12 2021 an exhibition featuring his studies of the Hebrew language and his Holocaust paintings opened at the Museo do la Cuidad in Madrid where Bau’s work shares space with the papers of Albert Einstein. Both men are characterized by the museum director as “two of the most important Jewish thinkers in world history.”

The B’nai B’rith World Center in Jerusalem has officially recognized the extraordinary contributions of both Rebecca and Joseph Bau citing them as “Jews who saved Jews.” Each has been awarded the “Jewish Rescuers Citation “acknowledging their “devotion courage and heroism” to help save Jewish lives.

“He was asked why he didn’t make ‘papers’ for himself and escape” recalls Hadasa. “‘If I left’ he answered ‘who would save the others?’”

Joseph Bau was a man of small physical stature yet his robust presence filled a room (including my living room during a mid-1990s visit to Manhattan). With a full head of Ben-Gurion-esque white hair a proverbial twinkle in his eye and a humorous comment always on the ready Bau lived a life that could have been scripted by Ian Fleming. Only after his death have some of the secrets of his life and work revealed. There is his daughters believe more to come.

Postscript

Maintaining a small museum is always a challenge especially difficult during the pandemic.

“When there are no visitors there is no income yet expenses continue.” say Hadasa and Clila Bau. A 2020 head-start drive raised 100000 shekels – about $30000 – which covered only a few months of operating expenses. The museum desperately short of funds is facing possible closure and is in dire need of financial support.

The Bau sisters hope to keep the memory of their parents’ amazing life preserving their father’s invaluable work for future generations.

Prior to the pandemic dozens of groups – schools IDF recruits senior citizens tourists and Israeli and foreign visitors – came to the studio museum to enjoy a program of theatrical enactments and a very personalized lecture based on Bau’s experiences.

“Dad said we should turn the studio into a theater. Today it is both a museum and a stage. We tell the story of our parents extraordinary wonderful life explaining the meaning of our father’s paintings drawings and illustrations of the Hebrew language” his two daughters say. “He was an inspiration. That is the legacy we carry forward.”

To ensure continuity of this Israeli treasure Joseph Bau House is actively seeking donors. Designated contributions made through P.E.F. Israel Endowment Fund are fully tax deductible. The museum also offers “named sponsorships for special projects.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vcmxhbmRvc2VudGluZWwuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMTQvZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkLWF0LTUwLW1lZXQtdGhlLWdlbmVyYWwteW91dmUtbmV2ZXItaGVhcmQtb2Ytd2hvLW1hcHBlZC1vdXQtdGhlLW1hZ2ljLWtpbmdkb20v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney World at 50: Meet the general you've never heard of who mapped out the Magic Kingdom,"Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel

I’m not 100% sure exactly why but maybe it’s that the treats in Kringla’s glass cases aren’t covered in over-the-top icing in a variety of fluorescent shades like so many other treats on Disney property are or perhaps it’s just that I wasn’t familiar with the snacks that were being offered. That stops now.

Back in December I wrote about trying the iconic School Bread for the first time. If you’d like to read my review of the School Bread click here to check it out.

Earlier this week I made stop at the Norway pavilion and tried the latest treat to arrive at the counter service location: Kransekake. In Norwegian “kranse” means wreath and “kake” means cake. When you purchase Kransekake at the bakery you’ll get two large cookies for $3.49 which is a good deal in my book.

The Kransekake which is a baked good traditionally consumed during a Norwegian New Year’s celebration completely surprised me. This snack is simply delightful.

The interior of the Kransekake has a softer cake-like texture while the exterior is chewy. The cookies are covered in slivered almonds and if the light and warm flavor of almonds is a favorite of yours you’re going to want to add this to your must-eat list.

As I mentioned earlier the cookies are large which makes them perfect for sharing. Or perfect for eating all by yourself with a nice cup of tea.







A word of warning: the Kransekake cookies are covered in finely milled confectioners’ sugar. And when you’re done eating the cookies you’ll be covered in it too. I had confectioners’ sugar everywhere. But I considered it a small price to pay for such a yummy treat.

While Kringla normally offers sandwiches and salads at this time they’re focusing their efforts on snacks. There are sweets and savories of all sorts currently the menu and it looks like there’s a little something for everyone.







Is a stop at Kringla Bakeri Og Kafe a regular part of your EPCOT day? What other offerings should I try? If you have suggestions please let me know below.

During her jaw-dropping Super Bowl halftime performance in 2016 Beyoncé didn’t just promote her then-new track “Formation” rife with references to her roots in Alabama and Louisiana. She also paid homage to the Black Panthers from her military-style jacket to the accompanying phalanx of black beret-wearing women with Afros.

In evoking the Panthers – and to no one’s surprise rankling conservatives – Beyoncé illustrated that the group’s hold on the culture at large was as potent as ever even half a century after Black Power politics became a force to be reckoned with.

In 2021 that grip shows no signs of weakening.

Shaka King’s moving new film “Judas and the Black Messiah” paints a compelling biographical portrait of Fred Hampton (played by Daniel Kaluuya) the chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party who in 1969 created the first Rainbow Coalition. Chicago police killed Hampton in a predawn raid later that year.

But the film offers a twist on the biopic genre chronicling the chairman’s tenure largely through the eyes of William O’Neal (Lakeith Stanfield) whom the FBI dragooned into obtaining intel that resulted in Hampton’s death.

(“Judas and the Black Messiah” is being released by Warner Bros. which is a unit of CNN’s parent company WarnerMedia.)

To examine the Panthers’ enduring legacy I spoke with Jane Rhodes a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the author of the 2007 book “Framing the Black Panthers: The Spectacular Rise of a Black Power Icon.” We discussed why the group still resonates with Americans how the dynamic of crushing Black dissent continues to play out and what misconceptions about the Panthers people have.

The following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

From fashion to cinema to politics the Black Panthers still loom large in the public imagination. Could you sketch out why that is?

A key reason why the Panthers survive in the public imaginary 50 years after they were very active has a lot to do with their work in their time in the 1960s and ’70s. They wanted to make themselves visible. They wanted to resonate. They wanted to send a message.

They conveyed their message through different cultural practices – everything from their dress to their speech and rhetoric to their artwork to the chants they created for their demonstrations to the performances they used whenever they were conducting rallies. They just had an extraordinary range of cultural politics that most other organizations didn’t have.

The Panthers resonated so much in the middle of the 20th century that they became – both rightly and wrongly – a sort of stand-in for Black nationalism and Black activism. And this association stuck. Even as we moved into the ’80s and ‘90s and activism took different forms everybody still looked back to the Panthers. In early hip-hop in film in poetry in literature – whenever people wanted to evoke the feeling that the Panthers generated they used the group’s cultural imaginary.

All that is why I think that they have so much staying power. In literally every decade and every generation the Panthers have had some kind of meaning even though that meaning has changed over time. The Panthers had a knack for understanding and anticipating mass culture. They also had a political platform that resonated with all kinds of people regardless of their political predilections.

Shaka King the director of “Judas and the Black Messiah” said something during a virtual summit that struck me: He hopes that the film presents an opportunity for audiences to “explore the US’s past and present of crushing voices of dissent.”

Immediately I thought of how last year law enforcement violently cleared peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square so that then-President Donald Trump could pose for a photo op and how in 2017 the FBI made up the now-abandoned classification of “Black Identity Extremism” to describe the Black Lives Matter movement. What are your thoughts on how the Panthers fit into a much bigger history of state-backed suppression of voices of dissent specifically Black dissent?

It’s absolutely the case that the Panthers fit into that history. The Panthers weren’t the first Black activists to be suppressed by the state – by the US government and law enforcement – and they won’t be the last. But they do fit into a history of efforts to control Black voices and to contain Black resistance. These efforts were on display during slavery and Reconstruction during the early 20th century and during the civil rights movement.

The Panthers were a target precisely because they were so effective in their strategy of making themselves visible. There were other Black radical organizations operating during the same time that had a very different tactic. They stayed underground and kept to themselves. They also were policed and surveilled by the state but not to the degree that the Panthers were.

Whenever I tell my students about how J. Edgar Hoover labeled the Panthers the “greatest threat” to national security I highlight how absurd that was but how that was a strategy by the state to rationalize silencing the Panthers and dismantling what was perceived to be the threat.

And this is American history. The tactics of suppression have everything to do with a deep national anxiety about Black people’s dissent whether we’re talking about slave insurrections or the Panthers or Black Lives Matter. There’s a deep thread that runs through the American fabric that fears that Black people are going to rise up en masse and seek retribution for the wrongs done to Black people over the centuries. That fear is built into the American psychology.

I think that it goes without saying that we see a stark distinction now. White people can bear arms and express threatening commentary and storm the sites of power but they’re not seen as a threat in the same way that a group of Black people doing that would be seen as a threat. I don’t think that it’s farfetched to say that some of the White supremacist groups today are picking up the tactics of groups like the Panthers. But the big distinction is that they know that they’re protected by their Whiteness in a manner that Black activists are not.

Do you see any parallels between the Black Power movement and contemporary racial justice activism?

Black Power activism in the ’60s was made up of a multiplicity of ideologies and tactics. There were Marxists. There were cultural nationalists. There were all different kinds of folks who were unified in the goal of Black liberation. But they took very different routes in that fight. I think that’s the same today.

Another similarity between the Panthers and many of the liberation movements today is the focus on policing by the state. What we saw come out of the Trayvon Martin case and Ferguson and all the uprisings was a focus on how the state disproportionately harasses and brutalizes and incarcerates Black people. That was a key theme for the Panthers too – getting control over and protesting against policing in Black communities.

The other similarity is the importance of service to the community. Like the Panthers many of the organizations under the umbrella of the Movement for Black Lives focus on serving local and aggrieved communities and on building alliances among various groups.

The thing that made Hampton and the Panthers and other groups seem so threatening was the fact that they weren’t only protesting and resisting the power of the state. They were attempting to build alliances across race and class. They were attempting to say that poor White people and communities of color and queer folks and the elderly all have common grievances and should band together and find ways to fight a common struggle.

That attitude is certainly a fundamental feature of Black Lives Matter. The movement is about protesting police violence committed against Black people. But it’s also very much about standing in solidarity with other communities that are suffering injustice.

There’s a scene in “Judas and the Black Messiah” that feels like the thesis of the movie. The mother of a slain Panther says to Daniel Kaluuya’s Fred Hampton: “They try to paint my Jake as some cold-blooded killer. He did that. He did that. But that ain’t all he did. Tell ‘em about my Jake chairman. Please. It don’t seem fair that that’s his legacy.”

She’s talking about her son but the idea of reclaiming a legacy could apply to the Panthers more generally. Do you think that in the decades since the group’s formation we as a society have granted the Panthers more nuance and rigor?

I think that we’re beginning to. There’s an enormous amount of scholarship that’s emerged that I think is very committed to looking at nuances and distinctions. There are many studies that for example compare different Panther groups in different communities at different times because there were vastly different projects depending on where you were in the US. Quite frankly in academia we see a real emphasis on trying to get away from a kind of homogeneity of ideas about the Panthers.

I’m not sure if that’s occurred yet in popular culture. Maybe the new film will take us there. I think that the Panthers are still seen as an image without a lot of differentiation. Correcting that image takes educating people. If you’re a novelist or a director or a musician you have to do close study to develop a project that gets at the nuances.

One thing I talk about in my book is that even in the ’60s and ‘70s there was this wild popularization of the Panthers in the media but they tended to flatten the Panthers not open them up. The Panthers were all the same because they fit the needs and tropes that people wanted to fit the Panthers into.

The Panthers weren’t always heroic. They weren’t always charismatic. They were human and they had failures. But it’s important to see the whole picture.

What are some of the mistakes that people tend to make in conversations about the Panthers? And why is it important to get this history right?

There are so many distortions. The classic one which resonated during the ’60s is that the Panthers advocated violence and were violent. I teach a course on the Black freedom struggle and whenever I ask my students to do a word association about the Panthers they immediately say: Well the Panthers advocated violence.

The Panthers didn’t advocate violence any more than a range of other activist groups – not only Black activist groups but also other kinds of social justice movements.

What the Panthers did was borrow the rhetoric of radical movements around the world. They used the language of Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution. They used the language of Che Guevara. They used the language of Frantz Fanon. They used the language of Malcolm X.

All those movements and political figures argued that there could be no compromises to freedom and liberation.

Again you see parallels with the current moment. The Panthers because they carried guns initially and argued for self-defense were labeled as advocating violence. But today’s White supremacists who march around with guns and other weapons aren’t necessarily seen as advocating violence. They’re seen as standing up for their rights. So it’s very racialized. Whenever Black people carry guns they’re automatically seen as a threat to society. Whenever White people carry guns they’re seen as patriots. It’s as blunt as that.

So the image of violence has lasted. And it obscures all the substantive work that the Panthers did in Black communities and it obscures how their political ideology evolved. Again they weren’t perfect. But I think that we need to see them clearly because whenever there’s a mobilization of Black rage it’s seen as enacting a certain kind of violence.

I want to put in a plug for Black studies because one thing that strikes me is how little even extremely well-educated people know about the history we’re talking about. I think that a lot of that is because colleges and universities often marginalize Black studies. Whenever the discipline is seen as a threat or as political or as not intellectually grounded our understanding of Black life loses nuance. And so people need to do it all: They need to read. They need to take classes. They need to go to films. They need to listen. They need to inform themselves in any way they possibly can.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMTQvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVkaWEvbmV3LXlvcmstdGltZXMtZG9uYWxkLW1jbmVpbC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Postcard From Peru: Why the Morality Plays Inside The Times Won't Stop (Published 2021),"In 2012 when The New York Times was panicked about its financial future this newspaper went into the travel business.

In the United States that’s led to a glut in supply and drop in the value of plastic glass and cardboard.

These changes have led San Antonio’s Solid Waste Management Department to shift its messaging when it comes to what people should put in their blue recycling bins according to David Newman the department’s director. The department has revamped its webpage and launched a phone app in the hopes of getting people to focus on disposing only of core products: paper plastic containers aluminum and glass containers.

“Ten years ago we were really pushing people to recycle: ‘Give us as much as you can give us.’” Newman said in a phone interview this month. “Today we’re pushing quality. We’re saying ‘We want your recyclables but we want you to do it correctly.’ We can only take these things that are acceptable in our program and that’s how we sustain the recycling business.”

Bigger changes lie ahead as the City considers what to do about a recycling processing contract that expires in 2024. Local solid waste entrepreneurs say it could be an opportunity to think more broadly about what they call the circular economy where materials formerly seen as waste can be reborn as useful products.

“We can’t recycle our way out of the problem” said Kate Gruy Jaceldo whose Compost Queens business offers organic disposal options for homes and businesses and provides compost in return.

Before 2017 the sales of recyclable material fully offset the cost of processing bottles cans containers cardboard and paper Newman told the City Council’s Committee Health and Equity Committee in October. Now recycling costs the City $13 per ton Newman said.



Fortunately that’s still cheaper than the disposing of waste in a local landfill which costs the City $25 per ton he said. But that could change when the current contract expires in 2024.



Newman said Solid Waste has enough time to carefully weigh three options to process San Antonio’s recycling tonnage:

It could extend its current contract with Republic Services which along with Waste Management is one of the two main players in the North American solid waste industry.

It could put out a request for proposals for a new contractor. Waste Management also owns a processing facility in the San Antonio area and smaller competitors could also see an opportunity to step into a new market.

A third option would be for the City to build its own processing center and either staff it with City employees or contractors Newman said.

“If we were to go with new contractor or build a facility there’s a lot of lead time ahead a couple of years and then we have to go through a whole contracting process” Newman said. “That’s why we’re starting early and at this point that’s three years out.”

Solid Waste officials plan to bring more details to the Community Health and Equity Committee in late March he said.

Asked whether San Antonio residents could see their waste fees go up because of higher recycling costs Newman didn’t rule it out though he said it’s not the main expense in the department’s $150 million budget.

“It’s just a little too early to tell at this point but it is not a dominant factor of our expenses” Newman said.

‘Getting really creative about uses’

Owning its own processing center could offer the City some intriguing opportunities that might be harder to achieve when contracting the work to a third party according to Christopher Moken a former solid waste coordinator with the Alamo Area Council of Governments (AACOG). Working for AACOG which covers a 13-county region Moken got a wide-ranging view of the recycling crisis in the San Antonio region.

“If the City does go the route of doing their own facility that could be very interesting from the point of view of being able to utilize some of the newer technologies out there as far as source-separating materials” Moken said.

Moken described a system in Eskilstuna Sweden where residents separate their waste into seven different color-coded bags and rely on a machine to sort them by sight. The city has been called the “world capital of recycling” and boasts some of the lowest landfill rates on the planet.

The U.S. “really shot itself in the foot” by moving toward commingling its recycling Moken said. Commingling is when all recycled products are collected in one container with the job of separating them shifted to the processing center. The system is more convenient for residents but causes problems with contamination when people mix recyclables and non-recyclable waste.

Ultimately the focus needs to be on the corporations that manufacture the materials in the first place Moken said.

“We really need to be having a conversation about forcing the manufacturers to at least take on some sort of standardization whether it’s the same colors or the same kind of materials and just make it easier for the downstream recyclers and easier for consumers” Moken said.

Moken is the founder of Re-Mat a nonprofit focused on keeping used mattresses out of the landfill. Re-Mat launched two and a half years ago and Moken has struggled to find $100000 in funding and an affordable lease agreement on a 10000-square-foot facility needed to begin recycling up to 20000 mattresses in his first year.

In California Connecticut and Rhode Island legislatures have required mattress manufacturers to pool their resources and create statewide recycling programs. Residents can visit ByeByeMattress.com and find disposal sites near them.

“That unfortunately normally has to happen at a state level” Moken said. “I don’t see that happening anytime soon in Texas which is kind of a shame.”

On a local level Jaceldo said that there’s still “potential for a lot of products to become something else.” City officials could look to the local startup talent base for help she said.

“With all these City tech programs that are building entrepreneurs put them on the waste stream” she said. “We either have to incentivize keeping the materials away [from the waste stream] to begin with or getting really creative about uses.”

Quality over quantity

One sign of changes in recycling is how Solid Waste officials are thinking about the City’s recycling goals.

In October Newman told council members that San Antonio appears to be well short of its 2010 goal of diverting 60 percent of its waste from local landfills by 2025. In the City’s 2020 fiscal year the rate of recycled composted and mulched waste was 36 percent Newman said.



Still that’s far above a former rate of only 7 percent in 2010. Diversion rate might not even be the best way to measure success anymore.

“We know that the 60 percent goal is a good goal it is technically achievable but it would have to be done in a very perfect scenario” Newman said.

For now Solid Waste has shifted emphasis from quantity to quality something that experts say is essential to reduce contamination when the wrong items end up in the recycling stream.

But it’s proven difficult for even the most recycling-savvy to keep track of what’s acceptable. Even Jaceldo whose business involves keeping waste out of landfills admitted she struggles to keep up with exactly what’s recyclable and what’s not.

“I do think whatever they do there needs to be a real information campaign about it” Jaceldo said.

For example Solid Waste’s webpage used to state that residents could put plastic film bags inside other plastic film bags and dispose of them in their blue bins. Another formerly accepted product was clamshell-shaped take-out containers made of white polystyrene foam.

In its new education campaigns and on its webpage of recycled items Solid Waste no longer lists those as accepted items even though Newman said the City’s contract requires Republic to receive them at its processing center.

“It’s technically in our contract for them to accept it and for them to do the best they can to recycle them” Newman said. “But we’re no longer pushing those so you don’t see them advertised.”

There’s also the problem of manufacturers relying on materials that are inherently less recyclable. Speaking to council members Newman used coffee as an example saying its packaging has shifted from highly recyclable aluminum tins to less recyclable plastic cylinders and more recently to foil bags that can only end up in the landfill.

Another example is newspapers driven to near-extinction in the waste stream by the rise of digital media and decline of print journalism.

“It used to be 10 years ago that newspapers which are very heavy made up a big chunk of our recycling” Newman said. “Today you can’t find any newspapers. There are very few there.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8va2lvbjU0Ni5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAyLzE0L25ldy13YXN0ZS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LXBvbGljeS1mcnVzdHJhdGluZy1jdXN0b21lcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Waste Management policy frustrating customers – KION546,"SALINAS Calif. (KION) -- A new Waste Management policy has some locals pretty upset. Not only is the service more expensive there's also a higher risk of being fined.

""They want a rate increase and they want to fine us"" says Prunedale-area resident Randy Hall.

Hall has Waste Management where he lives and the new policy has him frustrated. It includes a rate increase and fine for improper use of the trash and recycling bins.

""No styrofoam no plastic bags no number 6 recycling i mean there's a whole bunch of different rules"" says Hall.

The timing of the new policy -- during a pandemic -- is another concern to residents.

""we're just trying to do the right thing but the timing of all this is really bad people are unemployed"" William Becerra of Prunedale.

For Becerra he received a warning because a trash bag was accidentally put in the recycling bin.

""I don't think it's fair. There's no one to contest or compete with them here so it seems they can implement whatever they want"" says Becerra.

Garbage trucks have been fitted with cameras which send out warnings and fines to residents.

""My thought is we want to encourage recycling we don't want people to throw stuff in the garbage when they can recycle it. so they should make it easier for us to try to recycle"" says Hall.

Waste management launched a public education campaign for this policy last year to help customers recycle properly and avoid overfilled carts.

The company says there was no time to delay the program because of SB1383 regarding climate pollutants.

In a statement to KION Paul Rosynsky a spokesperson for Waste Management stated: ""In Monterey County only 4% of Waste Management customers have been issued a surcharge. the total number of incidents have decreased since the beginning of the program and we believe people are making a noticeable effort in keeping their carts in better shape.""

Waste Management also say they've been working with residents who feel they've been warned or fined by mistake and will continue to do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpY2tzYnVyZ3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMTQvd2FzdGUtbWFuYWdlbWVudC1wbGFucy1vbi1waWNraW5nLXVwLXJlc2lkZW50aWFsLWdhcmJhZ2UtbW9uZGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Waste Management plans on picking up residential garbage Monday - The Vicksburg Post,"Waste Management plans on picking up residential garbage Monday Published 6:13 pm Sunday February 14 2021

Saudi-perpetrated war crimes famine outbreaks of infectious disease terrorism and intractable ethnic and religious conflict have all played their part in the wholesale destruction of Yemen. Amid the erosion of governance shattering of Yemen’s political system and extreme violence waged by several different sides in the conflict so too has its waste management system collapsed. Though prior to the outbreak of conflict Yemen had struggled considerably with waste management the war has totally decimated garbage collection (Weir 2019). Outside of Yemen’s capital Sana’a a huge hill of garbage leaches unseparated toxic waste and sewage into the city’s rapidly drying water supply (Browning 2016). Garbage rots in the streets and entire families pick among it for edible food (Trew 2019). Even so the garbage crisis has frequently taken a backseat to Yemen’s host of other issues even as it has worsened them owing to the relative lack of attention given to waste management in humanitarian assistance (Weir 2019). Where previous analyses of the war have focused on the dynamics between human actors few have analysed the crisis in terms of the effects of waste on the trajectory of Yemen’s continuing agony. None have attempted a critical analysis of the role of waste. The overriding preoccupation with a strictly human agency has led to a paucity of analysis as far as non-human actants are concerned particularly in terms of their impact on the trajectory of conflicts.

Given this lack of attention this paper offers a critical examination of the Yemeni Civil War through its current garbage crisis. New materialism — and in particular the work of Jane Bennett — offers an effective lens through which to analyse the political contours of Yemen’s garbage crisis given its understanding of the political roles played by non-human bodies. Like all mere “things” waste is alive with a “vital materiality” that can never be disposed of (Bennett 2010: 6). With an understanding of the power of forces like waste in mind what is the role of non-human waste actants in shaping the humanitarian crisis of the Yemeni Civil War? Borrowing from this new materialist thinking I argue that Yemen’s garbage crisis has shaped the trajectory of the conflict by generating powerful and constitutive assemblages of garbage toxic waste and the “lively streams” of chemicals and disease that seep from them. Among the host of effects emergent from Yemen’s assemblages of garbage actants is an environment of “slow violence” inflicted on the Yemeni people — the gradual and incremental violence of a long-term poisoning rather than immediate kinetic force (Nixon 2013). Substantial ecological and humanitarian effects ranging from cholera outbreaks to environmental pollution to chemical exposure have all resulted from the ongoing garbage crisis further indicating the thing-power of waste and its agentic trajectories in generating substantial political effects.

A Framework for Waste

In Vibrant Matter Jane Bennett (2010) calls for a broader understanding of agency one that acknowledges the active and substantial participation of non-human actants in events and politics. She argues there is a “vital materiality” imbued in both human and non-human bodies the ability of these objects to “act as quasi agents or forces with trajectories propensities or tendencies of their own” (Bennett 2010: viii). What at first glance appear to be mere “things” like garbage are imbued with a “vibrant” materiality of “thing-power: the curious ability of inanimate things to animate to act to produce effects dramatic and subtle” extant alongside human agency (Bennett 2010: 6 viii). These non-human actants take on agentic properties when arranged as “assemblages” — that is “ad hoc groupings of diverse elements…living throbbing confederations…not governed by any central head…an open-ended collective” generating “emergent properties” able to cause an event only by acting in concert with other bodies (Bennett 2010: 23-24). Agency thus emerges as the provenance of distributive agentic assemblages of both human and non-human actants (Bennett 2010: 21).

Among the vibrant matter that Bennett discusses is garbage — indeed Bennett (2010: viii) rhetorically asks how we might view consumption if humanity thought of waste not as dead rubbish but as a growing pile of vital material. Like all other bodies waste objects have a vital materiality that runs across bodies and takes on agentic properties when acting in concert with each other. She cites work on the “garbage hills” of New Jersey as indicative of the assembled thing-power of non-human waste actants as waste “continues its activities even as a discarded or unwanted commodity” (Bennett 2010: 6). Waste takes on substantial agentic properties when it joins broader assemblages of other non-human bodies. Contrary to its seeming deadness assemblages of non-human actants like waste is “vibrant” alongside human actors by affecting the broader course of events in a wide variety of ways (Bennett 2010).

Following Bennett’s claims “new materialist” thinkers have analysed the agentic and “vibrant” properties of garbage in a number of different political and geographic scenarios. Fredericks (2014) examines garbage dumps in Senegal and how the vital materiality present in assemblages of garbage structures complex relationships of citizenship and economic exchange. Acuto (2014: 345) argues that while garbage may seem a mundane subject “the mundane cosmopolitics of everyday life” are largely structured by international politics’ relationship to waste disposal. Cherrier et al. (2018) propose a new understanding of waste actants explicitly following Bennett: that the category of “waste” must be reconsidered as having a vital materiality to better develop an anti-consumerist “circular” economy of repairing and repurposing. But none of these studies analyse the agentic properties of garbage in a warzone let alone the case of Yemen where assemblages of waste wreak havoc on vulnerable populations.

The Agency of Yemen’s Garbage

On the outskirts of Sana’a sits a 10-million-ton hill of waste that existed before the war a massive dump for the city of three million people (Browning 2016). A recycling facility was largely able to treat or remove toxic and medical waste before its disposal but after the site was destroyed in a bombing campaign by Saudi-backed forces against Houthi rebels in 2015 all waste that ends up in the Sana’a city dumps goes untreated and mingles with other waste items in a great medley of filth (Browning 2016). In Taez garbage lines the streets and livestock feeds off any edible material before it is burned in massive fires (Borbon 2019). In the besieged port city of Hodeidah poor families are reduced to picking through increasingly scarce trash piles for food (Trew 2019). All across rural and urban Yemen great uncollected masses of garbage choke city streets emanate toxic chemicals and are makeshift sources of food for an increasingly food insecure population (Weir 2019).

Following Bennett’s (2010) description of the power of non-human actants Yemen’s dumps are a series of massive assemblages made up of a wide variety of materials and concepts. The disparate parts of a wartime Yemeni garbage dump run the gamut from material to idealised: plain garbage raw sewage medical waste livestock volatile organic chemicals fires disease pathogens discarded food destroyed buildings failures of municipal waste policy and the competing ideologies amid protracted civil conflict that engendered the worsening of the garbage crisis. It includes objects which have been cast from the social body as “waste” as well as the ideological forces which structure social life (Edensor 2005). Like all assemblages the ad hoc diversity of parts in these collections of garbage do not have a singular leading force behind them but are “alive” with the power of non-human actants arranged in an “open-ended collective” (Bennett 2010: 24). It is with the power of these assemblages in mind that I intend to analyse the power of Yemen’s ongoing waste management crisis.

In September 2016 a massive cholera outbreak struck Yemen and quickly became the single largest documented epidemic of that disease in modern times (Camacho et al. 2018). Amid the collapse of waste management infrastructure massive buildups of garbage in the streets of urban centers found their way into municipal water supplies and quickly spread the disease to nearly a million people within six months (Lyons 2017). The garbage actants found in Yemen’s dumps through an agentic trajectory found in assemblages of non-human actants found their way into the water system of Yemeni cities and produced a dangerous series of emergent effects on their populations. Amid a looming famine many Yemenis turned to sifting through garbage to scavenge for food further accelerating the risk of cholera contraction (Zeyad 2018 Trew 2019). Imbued with a vibrancy of thing-power that runs across bodies Yemeni garbage assemblages have a collective agency the “impetus issuing from material assemblages whose elements include an ontological variety of actants” (Bennett 2005: 458).

It is amid the context of the war that garbage assemblages have emerged as a cause of dramatic and deadly events given the wholesale destruction of Yemen’s already limited waste governance. Diverse ontological varieties of waste have resulted in a blooming of emergent effects impossible without the agency of assemblage. It is when waste actants conglomerate in massive assemblages like uncollected garbage that “effects dramatic and subtle” emerge in a shockingly diverse variety of ways (Bennett 2010: 6). But it is only through the agency of the assemblage that the dramatic effect of the cholera outbreak occurred given that untreated sewage and medical waste spread through the Yemeni populace through its collective power as an assemblage. Whether it washed into the water supply or was contracted during food scavenging by a hungry population cholera pathogens spread through the assembled confederative power of varied ontological categories of garbage assembled en masse. The ontological array of bodies found in Yemeni trash ranging from solid waste to sewage to toxic medical efflux issued forth an impetus of pathogens into the bodies of urban residents producing an effect as dramatic as the largest cholera outbreak in modern history (Camacho et al. 2018). The singular parts in Yemen’s assemblages of garbage do not necessarily have the power to produce major effects on their own though its individual parts like raw sewage and untreated medical waste may be individually dangerous. The “living…confederation” of garbage actants has an agentic trajectory possible in the aggregation of so much waste and it is only through its collectivity that it has obtained this agency in its non-humanity (Bennett 2010: 23).

Further “dramatic effects” have and will likely continue to emerge from Yemen’s vast assemblages of garbage particularly in terms of its environmental consequences. Like the threat of cholera further environmental-humanitarian crises have emerged from the collective agency of garbage assemblages. In addition to a steady stream of cholera pathogens the 10 million ton garbage hill outside of Sana’a frequently leaches out hazardous chemicals which gather in vast pools at the base of the pile (Browning 2016). By October 2015 at least one million tons of recently-generated debris from destroyed buildings had joined the garbage mixture all across Yemen releasing clouds of dangerous household products chemicals from unexploded ordnance and asbestos (Weir 2019). Yemenis have increasingly taken to burning garbage given its steady buildup which releases toxic chemicals like mercury nitrogen dioxide sulphur dioxide and volatile organics into the air (Weir 2019).

To borrow Bennett’s (2010) language “lively” streams of chemicals seep out of the assemblage of waste finding their way into groundwater and air and into human bodies with a diverse and often dramatic series of effects ranging from respiratory disorders to birth defects to kidney disease to cancer (Weir 2019 Browning 2016). Such lively streams have already entered into agricultural facilities and ambient air (Weir 2019). Like cholera outbreaks food insecurity and water pollution the environmental risk of hazardous chemicals is yet another emergent effect of the agentic properties of garbage assemblages. A diverse panoply of human and non-human actants ranging from unseparated and diverse collections of toxic waste building debris fire and the chemicals that emerge from them all give rise to substantial consequences. But it is only in the confederation of diverse ontologies in an assemblage that these effects can take place and that the agency of non-human waste actants can be fully realised.

Slow Violence and the Ecologies of Disaster

The lasting effects of war often produce “open-ended uncertain ecologies of the aftermath” with substantial consequences for the victims in any given conflict (Nixon 2011: 200). War has always produced substantial ecological as well as political effects as catastrophes caused by the material effects of war take shape over long periods of time. The Yemeni Civil War’s acceleration of a massive garbage crisis into a series of powerful and deadly agentic assemblages has engendered an environment of “slow violence” in Yemen “…a violence that occurs gradually and out of sight a violence of delayed destruction that is dispersed across time and space an attritional violence that is typically not viewed as violence at all” (Nixon 2011: 2). This gradual yet powerful form of violence is the frequent humanitarian result of warfare the effects of which are often wrongly considered to be the exclusive domain of kinetic short-term individual violent acts. This final section will analyse the agentic power of garbage assemblages in producing delayed catastrophes emergent in a series of long-term humanitarian crises.

The agentic power of garbage assemblages like the Sana’a garbage hill and other such uncontrolled dumps in Yemen are not strictly limited to the present cholera outbreak nor the pollution of water. Rather long-term exposure to the slurry of lively chemicals leaching into groundwater from liquid waste or entering the air from garbage burns will invariably have health effects well into the future. A United Nations report (2015: 30) on Yemen’s waste infrastructure put the long-term effects of toxic chemical exposure from garbage into perspective with such diverse health effects as respiratory disease skin irritation immune disorders gastroenteric problems various cancers and endocrine disruption. Underground fires deep in the heart of Yemeni dumps may continue to burn even as surface flames go out possibly causing landslides and other environmental dangers in the long-term (2015: 30). Extensive evidence exists that natal and childhood exposure to heavy metals like mercury found in Yemeni garbage smoke can cause neurological and nephritic damage ranging from immune disorders to long-term kidney disease (Bose-O’Reilly et. al 2011). Leachate composed of chemicals found in the vast septic pools at the base of Yemeni garbage dumps has already seeped into deep reserves of groundwater and irrigation networks (Weir 2019). Lively and vibrant chemical chains will continue to emerge from Yemen’s assemblages of garbage even as the war inevitably draws to a formal close slowly poisoning its population and inflicting attritional violence years after the war ends.

Bennett (2005: 461) describes the agentic effects of assemblages as not only ever-shifting but also frequently gradual contributing to emergent effects and spurring events as the assemblage shifts in “internal alteration.” These effects and events frequently stretch out temporally with the agentic power of assemblages contributing to gradual slow occurrences. Following Nixon (2011) the future casualties of Yemen’s civil war may not be limited to those who died in Saudi bombing raids or internecine religious conflict but those who suffer from health problems engendered by toxic chemicals introduced into the environment by the total collapse of waste management infrastructure. Thus the agentic power of Yemen’s garbage crisis is not strictly limited to recent events like its cholera outbreak. Rather the full agentic power of Yemen’s garbage assemblages may be seen in the long term as its ontological medley of varied types of waste engenders a subtle and slow form of violence inflicted on the Yemeni people.

But the slowly violent effects of Yemen’s garbage are not limited to biochemical effects on human health. The political ramifications of Yemen’s ongoing garbage crisis are also quite substantial and risk shattering an already broken nation. Waste management is an essential aspect of public health and state services and the destruction of Yemen’s infrastructure has demonstrated significant risks to both environmental policy and overall governance (Weir 2019). The agentic effects of garbage assemblages ranging from disease outbreaks to chemical exposure to pollution have exposed thousands of Yemenis to significant and long-term health problems. Of the 3.6 million Yemenis internally displaced over the course of the conflict hundreds of thousands have likely been exposed to waste and its associated host of health effects owing to the total collapse of management infrastructure (IDPC 2019; UNOCHA 2015). The long-term effects of disease exposure coupled with the collapse of health and waste infrastructure and massive humanitarian crises engendered by the civil war will likely beget continued public health crises that put significant strain on Yemen’s government for years to come (Weir 2019; Lyons 2017). The vibrant power of garbage assemblages not only threatens the health of Yemenis but also to slowly erode the ability of their government to manage its multitude of crises and the environment of slow violence created in Yemen’s garbage crisis threatens its ability to recover from its brutal war.

Conclusion: The Power of Waste

As the war in Yemen reaches a quagmire Saudi Arabia is desperate to leave the conflict following its long-term failure to defeat Houthi rebels and its own accelerating COVID-19 crisis (Riedel 2019). But even as its protracted conflict begins to gradually wind down Yemen remains a nation in anguish not just owing to the human actors in its conflict. Vast and powerful effects have emerged from the collapse of its waste infrastructure a melange of waste actants capable of producing dramatic effects like cholera outbreaks and environmental pollution. The significant power of trash assemblages has engendered an environment of “slow violence” in Yemen which its population will suffer from in the long term both in terms of its chemical and political effects. The “worst humanitarian crisis in the world” is partly so because of the power and agency of garbage assemblages in affecting the course of events. The deadly effects emergent from Yemen’s vast assemblages of wartime garbage are sadly only just beginning.

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 biggest water companies in the world.

No one can argue that water is one of the most essential elements that nature has to offer. It is even more important than food! Scientists have determined that the human body can survive without solid food for three weeks but can’t go one without water for even 3 days! The body will get dehydrated and even if it somehow manages to stay alive it’ll go in a state of shock and go into a vegetative state. The necessity of water is second only to our need for oxygen. Did you know that the daily required amount of water needed for a human being is 20 to 50 liters of clean safe water? This includes drinking cooking cleaning and other basic everyday activities. Water provides nourishment prevents disease helps in flushing out toxins is necessary for agriculture and food production and last but not least is very important for sanitation.

There are many sources where we can get water from. Abundant even. According to Disney’s (NYSE: DIS) National Geographic about 71 percent of the earth is covered by water but only 3 percent of that is fresh water. And of that only 1.2 percent can be used for drinking purposes while the rest is locked in glaciers permafrost ice caps or buried in the ground. But some of the main sources are Surface Water River and Lakes Spring Water Rock catchment areas and rock holes Excavated dams Rainwater tanks Bores and wells and Artesian bores.

Sadly clean safe water is still a luxury in many parts of the world. Polluted water doesn’t only pollute the environment around it it also causes a myriad of diseases in its wake. One of the most common diseases caused by polluted water is diseases. So much so that every year around 1.8 million people suffer and die from diarrheal diseases like cholera. It is up to the ones in power to help save people from the lack of safe water. Most of the water issues stem from a weak government and an unstable economy as you’ll find that most of the countries that are plagued by this are either developing or third world countries.

There are a lot of non-governmental organizations who are trying their best to eradicate this problem such as Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP) and Centre for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology. There are also companies dedicated to help the world by working to minimize water pollution. Some of these are: American Water Works Co. (NYSE: AWK) Nalco Water (NYSE: ECL) and Xylem Inc. (NYSE: XYL). Some businesses are doing their part by funding government and non-government projects that are making water and sanitation available to the world but all of this effort is still not enough as the world is still plunging deeper and deeper into a water crisis. One way that safe drinking water is being made available to the world is through water companies. These companies make it their business and goal to extract and provide safe drinking and usable water to its consumers. The industry has grown so much that there are almost as many options as soft drinks for drinking water. Some brands customize their selections by flavors and essence as well as on the basis of the type of water. Some of the most favored types of water aside from still water are spring water sparkling water fizzy water and bubbling water. As the years go by the water industry is becoming more and more competitive.

Cael Kael Cale and Gable (and other great names in this year’s tournament)

One unique thing about the state wrestling tournament every year is seeing all the kids named Gable and Cael that have qualified. We’ve compiled a list here as well as other cool names to listen for if you're lucky enough to be inside Wells Fargo Arena this week.

There is one Gable — Gable Porter from Underwood. The sophomore is 10-0 this year and 45-0 for his career. The actual Gable himself would be both proud of Porter's accomplishments but perhaps irritated that he's the only Gable in this year's field.

There are many more Caels. In 2002 when Cael Sanderson won his fourth NCAA title to cap an undefeated college career 76 newborns in Iowa were named Cael. Those kids will turn 19 this year. There are 17 with the same spelling in this year’s state tournament as well as six Kales three Kaels and one Cale plus two Caelens a Kalen and a Carl.

That's a lot. Let's break this down. There are eight Caels in Class 3A and six more in 1A. Two Caels are from Ankeny (one from Ankeny one from Centennial) and two more are from Don Bosco (Rahnavardi Frost). One bracket 106 pounds in 3A has two Caels (Long Nelson) a Kale (DiMarco) and a Kael (Kurtz).

There are more different spellings of the same names like Aiden (Riggins and Grimes) and Ayden (Kingery and Nicklaus); Riley (Radke Rankin Hoven) Ryley (Barnett) and Rylie (Anderson); Kody (Cook Huisman) and Cody (Hay); Tanner (Wink) and Taner (Harvey); two Griffins (Gammel and Liddle) and one Grifen (Molle).

You can do it with last names too: Petersen (Kale A.J. Joey) and Peterson (Braydon Brett); Kristensen (Ezra) and Christensen (Koufax Thurman Gabriel); Dane Johnson and Rex Johnsen. Five kids have the last name Hanson (Cooper Remington Landon Donavon Casey). That's not counting the two named Ben Hansen (both freshman too).

Some sound similar like Tegan Slaybaugh and Easton Schlabaugh or Gavin Wiseman and Cooper Wiemann. Some just go together like Greyson Gardner and Jace Rose; Derrick Bass Victor Bird Nick Fox and Alex Beaver; Cael Winter and Trevor Summers; Jaiden Moore and Carson Less. Some just stick out like Boden Pickle.

Some are hard to say like Caleb Rathjen (rah-chee) Ben Kueter (kee-ter) and Cam Phetxoumphone (pet-sum-pawn). There's also a Greenfield (Brent) and a Greenlee (Gabe) a Castle (Theron) and a Barncastle (Triston) an Appleseth (Wyatt) and an Applegate (Mason) a Griffith (Mickey) and a Griffiths (Braylon).

There's Grant O'Dell Brandon O'Brien Tate O'Shea and Ben O'Neill. There are seven Garretts (and another Garret) six Gavins (one Garvin) two Mayberrys (one Mooberry) and three Peytons. There's six Moores six Andersons two Chances and seven Hunters — but at this stage everybody would rather be the hunter than the hunted.

Action begins at 6 p.m. Thursday Feb. 18 at Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines.

Goodell 31-2 won a district title in Humboldt on Saturday Feb. 13. Goodell blanked Kellen Moore of Forest City 9-0 in the district championship match. Goodell's first round opponent at state will be Independence sophomore Carter Straw 31-10.

Gargano 27-8 finished runner-up at his weight after falling to Algona's Jacob Zabka in the finals. Gargano's first round opponent at state will be Williamsburg sophomore Gavin Jensen 42-4.

But their coach wasn't surprised.

'I kind of expected it out of these guys honestly' Dan Stout said. 'I don't think I expected us going 18-2 but I was counting on us having a pretty good season.'

That was despite the graduation of Stout's son J.D. an all-state guard and one of the more prolific players in the South Iowa Cedar League in recent years. J.D. Stout was second in the state in scoring last season his 29-point average helping Keota to a 20-4 record.

You usually don't take a kid like that out of your lineup and improve but this team did at least from a win-loss standpoint. The postseason gets ratcheted up big time Monday with Class 1A and 2A district action around the state.

'I don't know if it was surprising' Coach Stout said. 'When I looked down at our schedule I thought we could be pretty decent if we found some scoring. I think Luke Hammen and Carson Sprouse have done a great job of scoring this year. Brady Duwa has just been able to use his athletic ability to do things. Sam Sieren has come on lately shooting the ball so that has helped us out a lot. Teams haven't been guarding him and he's knocked down some 3s for us.'

Guards Hammen and Sprouse have produced virtually identical numbers with Hammen averaging 16.6 points per game and Sprouse 16.4. They both average 2.3 assists per game and Hammen is tied with Duwa for the team lead in rebounding.

The trio are part of an all-senior starting lineup for Keota. There are nine seniors on the 13-person roster.

'It was just a great year' said Stout who recently won his 300th game in his 19th year as head coach at the school. 'I had a bunch of seniors back have got nine seniors on the team. Five seniors start so there is a lot of experience. All of those guys have played with J.D. since they were sophomores and learned a lot with him. They've just kind of continued that tradition on this year which has been awesome.'

Keota ranked 10th in 1A ended up winning the SICL East Division championship and tied with seventh-ranked Montezuma for the overall league title. Monte handed the Eagles one of their two losses with the other coming in the regular-season finale Friday night to Cardinal.

District 11 contains top-seeded Montezuma second-seeded Keota and a 15-4 North Mahaska team that Keota edged by a point in the regular season. Keota was paired with Twin Cedars in the district opener Monday night though Stout said that game will be canceled because Twin Cedars is on a COVID-19 pause.

That's unless the extremely cold weather forces a postponement. Twin Cedars would be eligible to play Tuesday.

'You try to win the first one then hopefully we get another shot at North Mahaska on Thursday' Stout said. 'Then hopefully we get to play Monte again after that. It is kind of a conference tournament. We'll take them one game at a time and see what happens.'

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .

WD’s My Passport SSD is the company’s latest portable SSD to hit the market and it aims to bring a new level of performance to the lineup with peak performance of 1050/1000 MBps of read/write throughput.

Last year we took a look at WD’s My Passport a portable HDD that’s well suited for backup tasks but we wouldn’t quite recommend it for a production workflow. But if you’re looking to speed up your workflow portable SSDs are all the rage. Of course the tradeoff for a fancy new portable SSD is that it comes at a higher price-per-GB but the experience just can’t be beaten.

Like Samsung’s T7 WD’s My Passport SSD is a DRAM-less portable NVMe SSD and comes in various color options including gold silver grey blue and red. With a USB 3.2 Gen2 controller and the company’s Blue SN550E NVMe SSD under the hood this portable SSD is built to deliver blistering performance that leaves portable HDDs in the dust. Additionally the drive comes with hardware-based AES 256-bit encryption for the security conscious.

Ranging from 500GB up to a beefy 4TB WD’s My Passport SSD comes in a variety of capacities and all are rated to deliver up to 1050/1000 MBps of read/write performance under sequential workloads. Pricing is a bit higher than your standard SATA or M.2 SSD though. However at roughly $0.14-$018 per gigabyte the My Passport SSD falls in line with competitors such as Samsung’s T7 Crucial’s X8 and the SanDisk Extreme v2.

As per the norm for most portable SSDs the My Passport lacks an endurance rating but it’s rational to expect that it should have a similar life expectancy to the WD Blue SN550 that powers the device (300 and 600TB for the 500GB and 2TB models respectively). Oddly the lack of an official endurance rating is actually a plus though – WD backs the drive with a five-year warranty so if you have problems you can RMA the drive during the duration of the warranty regardless of the amount of data you’ve written.

WD rates the My Passport SSD to handle falls up to 6.5ft but unlike SanDisk’s or LaCie’s portables it lacks a formal Ingress Protection rating against the elements. The device comes formatted as exFAT for compatibility with both macOS and Windows-based computers and supports S.M.A.R.T. data reporting. When formatted as NTFS the device supports TRIM.

WD includes a relatively short six-inch USB Type-C cable and a one-inch Type-C to Type-A adaptor with the drive. WD provides the company’s Discovery software to manage the device and enables downloading a few other apps. WD Security and WD Backup software manage the device’s password protection and configure backup tasks on both macOS and Windows-based computers.

A Closer Look

Measuring 100 x 55 x 9 mm and weighing in at under 54 grams WD’s My Passport SSD is sleek slim and easily slips into a pocket. However the build quality isn't as solid as the company’s WD Black P50 or SanDisk’s Extreme Pro. With a little pressure the casing flexes to your will and the case doesn’t have an activity light.

WD My Passport SSD is constructed out of both plastic and metal: the topside is metal while the bottom is plastic. Prying the casing open reveals the company took thermals well into consideration as there are multiple thermal pads and points of contact for the chips to dissipate heat into the top metal cover to function as a heat spreader.

An ASMedia ASM2362 USB 3.2-to-PCIe 3.0 x2 NVMe SSD chip bridges the link between the internal NVMe SSD and the host. It interfaces with WD’s Blue SN550E over a PCIe 3.0 x2 connection. It translates the NVMe protocol (1.3c) into USB Attached SCSI Protocol for faster than transitional bulk-only transport performance though it supports both for compatibility. The drive manages power consumption via USB and PCI Express link power management along with chip power management.

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

WD’s Blue SN550E is a DRAM-less M.2 2280 PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe SSD that leverages a quad-channel controller and WD’s 512Gb 96-Layer TLC flash.

Sixteen flash dies are stuffed within our 1TB sample each featuring a dual-plane design that doubles interleaving performance compared to single-plane flash. The controller features hardware-based AES 256-bit encryption support enabling secure password protection. It also has a multi-gear ECC scheme and other flash management routines to ensure data reliability.

I was curious about the contents of the helium-filled HDD so I actually disassembled it into pieces.





Hard disk drives (HDDs) play an important role in 'storing data' in the modern society where a large amount of data is exchanged due to the spread of the Internet. HDDs are still

undergoing cutting-edge research such as 'helium filling' '' and '' but there are not many opportunities to actually see their contents. In addition as thecaused by selling the HDD as it is shows understanding the structure of the HDD also leads to the preservation of confidential information. So I actually disassembled the HDD into pieces and checked what was inside.This is the HDD that will be disassembled into pieces this time. It is WD's helium-filled model '' that I bought as a used operating product for 15000 yen.





The old model of the '

The pin has appeared. The structure is such that the helium inside can be removed by pulling out this pin.

The Australian-listed company announced today it had entered into a Letter of Understanding to form a long-term partnership with Google which includes providing news content to its Showcase product.

Kerry Stokes chairman of Seven West Media which publishes The West Australian as well as 19 regional papers and PerthNow said the agreement was a great outcome for Seven West Media and Google.

“Our new partnership recognises the value credibility and trust of our leading news brands and entertainment content across Seven and West Australian Newspapers” he said.

The deal comes after a Senate Committee last week endorsed the Federal Government’s proposed media bargaining laws which could force Google and Facebook to pay Australian media organisations for the news they use on their platforms.

The new laws which have been pitched as a way to “safeguard public interest journalism” will be among the first in the world to demand that multi-billion-dollar tech firms share revenue with news outlets.

The laws first drafted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will establish rules for negotiations between digital platforms and registered Australian news businesses over sharing revenue from the use of their content.

TREASURER DISCUSSES CODE WITH MEDIA CHIEFS

INQUIRY BACKS WORLD-FIRST NEWS MEDIA CODE

PM SHRUGS OFF CONCERN OVER GOOGLE'S THREAT

Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the motivation behind the new bargaining code was to encourage commercial deals to be struck.

“The main development we have seen with the Seven West Media and Google deal is that the parties can reach a mutually beneficial outcome” he said.

“They have reached that outcome because the code is there and it is about to be brought into law. My discussions with (Facebook’s) Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai from Google have been very constructive.”

Mr Frydenberg said Google agreeing to a deal with Seven West Media was testament to their commitment to the Australian market.

“That has been a clear message in discussions with the Prime Minister (Communications) Minister (Paul) Fletcher and myself that he (Sundar) is committed to the Australian market. It’s an important market for them it’s a profitable market for them and they want to remain here.”

Mr Stokes thanked Prime Minister Scott Morrison the Chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Rod Sims and Mr Frydenberg who he said had been instrumental in the outcome of the “ground-breaking” agreement.

He said the leadership shown by them in their push for the proposed News Media Bargaining Code meant Seven West Media could conclude negotiations that resulted in fair payment and ensure the company’s digital future.

“The negotiations with Google recognise the value of quality and original journalism throughout the country and in particular in regional areas” Mr Stokes said.

He said he believed that Google was committed to the spirit of the proposed code.

Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said the purpose of the mandatory code was to address the bargaining power imbalance between digital platforms and news media businesses in order to support a diverse and sustainable Australian news media sector.

“The agreement announced today between Seven West Media and Google is evidence the code is having its intended effect” he said.

“The code creates a framework for the parties to reach commercial arrangements so that news media business are fairly remunerated for the content they generate and which digital platforms benefit from.

“The Government expects all parties to continue to work constructively towards reaching commercial agreements in the spirit of collaboration and good faith encouraged by the code.”

Mel Silva managing director for Google Australia and New Zealand said the partnership with Seven West Media meant the tech giant would make a substantial investment in the future of journalism not just across the metropolitan areas but importantly in regional areas too where titles like the Kalgoorlie Miner and the Harvey-Waroona Reporter were at the heart of the local community.

“Seven West Media is one of Australia’s leading integrated media companies across broadcast print and digital news and joins with 21 publications across a variety of titles as diverse as The West Australian 7NEWS PerthNow the Albany Advertiser the Geraldton Guardian and the Broome Advertiser” she said.

Ms Silva said Showcase had been well received since it launched in Australia just over a week ago. She said Google’s publisher partners had received one million views of their content in just eight days.

James Warburton chief executive of Seven West Media said the deal was a “huge load of confidence” in terms of the credibility and the trust of Seven West Media’s brands not just in metro markets but in regional areas.

“More importantly it really underpins those offerings and Google has recognised that and fairly ruminated us on our spend and commitment to news” he said.

“We have a good relationship with Google and had a proactive relationship and certainly a lot less animosity than other major media players and we have been able to get that first mover advantage and negotiate a fantastic outcome that we are both happy with.”

Mr Warburton said reports that the deal included a clause that Google could rip up the contract if it wasn’t happy with the final details of the bargaining code were “complete rubbish”.

He also said Seven West Media remained committed to the new code being debated in Parliament.

“Every company has been negotiating with Google and Facebook … we have been able to get to a commercial point quicker” Mr Warburton said.

“It’s up to them if they want to negotiate or arbitrate.”

The LOU is subject to executing a long form agreement in the next 30 days.

Seven West Media said it would advise more details once the long form agreement was finalised.

Labor’s shadow communications minister Michelle Rowland said the deal between Google and Seven West Media was positive but that more needed to be done to protect Australian media.

“Labor welcomes reports that commercial agreements are being signed between news media businesses and Google” she told The West Australian.

“All along Labor has said that Australian media companies must get a decent return for their investment in public interest journalism from digital platforms.

“However as recommended by the ACCC more needs to be done to support the media”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx5bm5uZXdzLmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvd2VzdC1ub3Jmb2xrLWhpc3Rvcmlhbi1wZW5zLW5ldy13b3JrLW9uLXRoZS10ZWFjaGVycy13aG8td2VudC10by13YXItOTE1NjQ3Ni_SAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5seW5ubmV3cy5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FtcC93ZXN0LW5vcmZvbGstaGlzdG9yaWFuLXBlbnMtbmV3LXdvcmstb24tdGhlLXRlYWNoZXJzLXdoby13ZW50LXRvLXdhci05MTU2NDc2Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,West Norfolk historian pens new work on the teachers who went to war,"West Norfolk author and local historian Dr Barry Blades has just released a book which looks at how teachers left their classrooms to respond to the outbreak of war in 1914.

Teachers at the Front 1914-1919 tells stories of commitment heroism and sacrifices made by thousands of schoolmasters and trainee teachers who donned khaki uniforms to fight for their country.

It follows these teacher-soldiers as they landed on the beaches of Gallipoli headed across no-man’s land in Flanders and on the Somme - and other conflicts across the globe - on the way to victory.

Author Dr Barry Blades (44351385)

And it examines the decisions taken by men who were united by their training occupation and imperial connections but were divided in many other ways including their personal beliefs.

Many failed to return from the conflict and for those that did who were proud to call themselves Tommies Anzacs Enzeds and Canucks there were further challenges and adjustments to be faced.

The book also goes beyond Britain to describe and contrast the experience of teachers and wartime ancillaries in the British Empire Europe the Americas and beyond.

For some users when they go to open Messenger they get as far as a quick second (or less) of the splash screen before Messenger simply closes. Nothing in task manager as it completely crashes in an instant leaving no trace of the app.

This is something that has been affecting a large number of users in recent weeks (or even months). In some cases the app randomly begins working again just to run right back until it the next time the user reboots their system. We have even experienced it on some of our machines as well and can confirm the stories going around.

No word has been given yet by Facebook as to why this has been occurring. Various user communities have sought to take on the challenge to find out what could be causing it. So far there hasn’t been any success.

It could possibly be a driver conflict since it does work with using your webcam and microphone in the background within settings in case you create a video or voice call with someone. It also has access to screen sharing so video drivers come into question as well. However due to the sheer number of individuals experiencing this anomaly the verdict might be leaning toward poor coding on Facebook’s part.

A quick trip to the comments on the app within the store (with comments set to “most recent”) will yield you many cases of this issue. This doesn’t include here Reddit forums and other sources where users have sought help in fixing this.

If you have been experiencing this fear not as you are not alone. This is a widespread issue affecting many users. This means that Facebook is (hopefully) hard at work looking for a cure. It’s always good to be hopeful.

Of course where is the solution? We promised a solution! Well there is a solution although a temporary one. Simply open a browser and point it to “https://www.messenger.com“. Let it hang out where your Messenger app window would normally be and walla you have a replacement until they fix whatever the heck is going on with the app. You may not have even known there was a separate web-based version of the app. So maybe you learned something new today as well. This is a solution FB keeps alive for operating systems that don’t have access to a fancy app (and it doesn’t close on you every time you open it)."

FEDERAL WAY Wash. (Feb. 11 2021) – Woodbridge Corporate Park announced today a package of measures to preserve and protect the historical aspects of the former Weyerhaeuser headquarters building and industrial campus. The measures are proposed in connection with an extensive permit process that began in 2016 and are consistent with the development plans and public announcements Woodbridge Corporate Park has conveyed at many public meetings and open house forums with the community over the past few years.

A summary of the company’s commitment to preserve and protect the historical aspects of various buildings and property at Woodbridge Corporate Park include:

● Establishing a view-conservation easement on the meadows so no development could occur there that would block views thus allowing the former Weyerhaeuser headquarters building to always be seen from I-5 and State Hwy. 18

● Establishing a historic-preservation easement on the exterior façade of the headquarters building to maintain its world-renowned architectural significance and to preserve the building

● Providing a forested buffer on development sites and reviving the tradition of putting industrial and generic buildings behind trees so the buildings are hidden from roadways a practice on the campus that was abandoned during the past two decades

“The revenue generated from the development of the property pays for the preservation of the campus” said Dana Ostenson who oversees Woodbridge. “We are working to memorialize the plans we’ve conveyed at numerous public meetings since 2018 which are consistent with the vision and values of a community-oriented developer and private property owner.”

Ostenson added “Similar to other corporate-campus redevelopment projects that we’ve led around the country we are recreating at Woodbridge the critical jobs and tax base lost after an exit by a large company. And we are doing this in a way that is consistent with the needs and values of the community as a whole and in this case the beauty of the Woodbridge campus.”

To that end construction of the proposed Woodbridge Corporate Park will create 780 temporary jobs and generate $13 million in tax revenue to the City of Federal Way over a three-year period. Once the campus is completed and operational Woodbridge will generate an additional 3100 new permanent jobs and generate $6.8 million in annual tax revenue for the City of Federal Way to support and enhance important community services and programs.

Woodbridge has made this proposal as part of the final phase of the Section 106 review process under the National Historic Preservation Act which is led by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in consultation with the Washington State Department of Archeology and Historic Preservation. Section 106 directs federal agencies to consider the effects of projects they approve on historic properties following approval of the development plans by the City of Federal Way and the Washington State Courts.

The vision for Woodbridge Corporate Park remains the same as it was when the property was purchased from Weyerhaeuser Co. in 2016: restoring the jobs and revenue lost when Weyerhaeuser left preserving the unique historical elements of the property and creating a new paradigm for a vibrant commercial center consistent with placing new development behind tree buffers. Development applications are for only approximately 63 acres — about 16% of the 400-acre campus.

Woodbridge Corporate Park intends to manage access to the trails road networks and open space on the same voluntary terms as Weyerhaeuser and consistent with agreements with the City of Federal Way. The road network and trails at Woodbridge will continue to be owned and managed in such a way that ensures the long-term viability of the campus.

“We are proud of what we are doing in collaboration with the federal government state agencies and other permitting jurisdictions especially considering the fact that none of our plans for historic preservation are required by the development agreement Weyerhaeuser established before they sold the property” explained Ostenson. “We are excited to soon be able to implement the comprehensive vision we’ve established with the greater Federal Way community to provide much needed jobs tax revenue and historical preservation on this incredible private property.”

To date an estimated 3880 jobs — in addition to approximately $19.8 million in tax revenue and impact fees — have been lost to Federal Way due to the delay of three years of construction and a year of full-campus operations. This includes construction jobs and the employment and revenue opportunities from interested parties from a variety of global companies including several in the biotech industry.

Ostenson added that Woodbridge appreciates the local and state Chamber of Commerce and community leaders who continue to support this important regional project as the company strives to develop the property consistent with Federal Way land-use requirements and the development agreement negotiated by Weyerhaeuser — both of which have been upheld in the Washington Superior Court without appeal. “We also appreciate the work of the Army Corps of Engineers and expertise of the staff at the Washington State Department of Archeology and Historic Preservation who have provided tremendous guidance and are focused on the preservation of the important parts of this campus” said Ostenson.

Oge then-director of the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Transportation and Air Quality during the 10-hour-long 2010 Petit Le Mans Series race at Road Atlanta Porsche's experimental 911 GT3 R Hybrid race car held down a top-20 position in the 45-car field.

The broadcast crew took every opportunity to call attention to the presence of the new Porsche. Hybrid street cars were becoming mainstream and ""road relevance"" was repeatedly cited by Oge along with energy independence and low carbon emissions as EPA imperatives.

But like its similarly new Formula One hybrid race car cousins this special 911 GT3 R was not a street-going hybrid. This was a ""flywheel hybrid."" Instead of parallel gasoline engine/electric motor drive systems combined with a battery the 911 racer paired an internal combustion flat-six cylinder with an electro-mechanical flywheel energy storage system.

Porsche motorsports engineers began researching hybrid systems for racing in 2007. Around the same time F1 decided to integrate hybrid tech. Starting with the 2009 season F1 allowed its teams to use mild hybrid systems called kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS).

Most F1 teams developed KERS that used batteries but the Williams F1 team created an electromechanical flywheel system. Williams ultimately did not race that system owing to Formula One technical regulations. (Interestingly Chrysler attempted to build a natural gas/flywheel hybrid race car for Le Mans 15 years earlier but that program never made it to a race either.)

However Porsche eventually licensed the concept from Williams Hybrid Power and set about adapting it to endurance racing in the 911 GT3 R Hybrid. Audi too had a go with a flywheel in its all-conquering R18 e-tron Quattro diesel-electric prototype. The Audi prototype used a system further developed by UK automotive/aerospace supplier GKN which acquired Williams Hybrid Power in 2014. This flywheel hybrid racer won dozens of races including the 24 Hours of Le Mans outright in 2012 2013 and 2014.

Given these high-profile racing factory programs nestled in F1 and sports car racing many if not most casual observers expected flywheel hybrid technology to migrate to production vehicles within a few years.

That never happened. How come?

A high-RPM booster

In simple terms an automotive flywheel hybrid system leverages power from a mechanical flywheel motor to augment power from an internal combustion engine for short periods. Electric motor/generators located at a vehicle's wheels or axles produce electricity harvested from the kinetic energy which is otherwise wasted as heat when friction brakes decelerate the vehicle.

But instead of sending the energy to a chemical battery for storage and redeployment the electricity is used to drive a flywheel motor. Electrical energy is transferred to rotating kinetic energy by a novel magnetic material (sometimes a magnetic powder) embedded within the flywheel. The more energy applied the faster it spins. (NB: this is different to the mechanical flywheel hybrid system that Nissan attempted unsuccessfully to develop for its 2015 Le Mans racer.)

The mass of the flywheel and the velocity at which it spins—typically from 25000rpm up to 55000rpm or more—determine the availability of energy it can release. To transfer the kinetic energy stored in the flywheel back into electrical energy the rotating magnetic field generates a current in the reverse direction (by inverting the polarity of the applied voltage) and power is delivered to the same motor/generators that harvested energy during the original braking event.

As noted the motor generators may be located at the wheels. Alternately a flywheel motor may be connected to the engine driveshaft via a continuously variable transmission (CVT) or other coupler. When called for it couples with the driveshaft taking the potential energy from the flywheel and translating it to kinetic energy propelling the driveshaft and drive wheels.

Flywheel motors have often been compared to capacitors capable of quickly storing and releasing energy. Proponents cite weight cost and environmental advantages over traditional chemical-battery hybrids.

In the 911 GT3 R the flywheel motor used a carbon-fiber composite flywheel with a 16-inch (406mm) diameter. Mounted in a carbon fiber box where the passenger seat would be in a road-going 911 the flywheel motor received power from and sent power to an 80hp (60kW) electric motor/generator at each front wheel. The configuration allowed Porsche to incorporate torque vectoring to improve handling/traction when accelerating from corner apex out.

The flywheel motor in Porsche's racer had a capacity of 0.2kWh. It could deliver 163hp (122kW) for up to six seconds offering boost for acceleration—out of corners or for passing depending on how/when the driver decided to apply the extra power via a steering wheel-mounted button.

The car had a total system output of about 670hp (500kW) and weighed approximately 2866lbs (1300kg). The flywheel and support structure reportedly weighed around 103lbs (47kg) considerably lighter than a battery-electric hybrid setup. In all the car weighed 230lbs (104kg) more than the conventional Porsche GT3 cars it shared the track with. Advertisement

Porsche viewed flywheel storage as more durable than lithium-ion batteries in the extreme power charge/discharge cycles of racing. Unlike a battery the flywheel motor was capable of being fully charged (accelerated to its maximum speed) and discharged (decelerated to a near stop) multiple times a minute without adverse effects.

Thanks to its relative fuel efficiency—if not outright speed—the 911 GT3 R Hybrid actually led the 2010 Nürburgring 24 Hour race for eight hours before dropping out. At the 2010 Petit Le Mans the car ultimately finished 18th though attrition helped.

It raced again in 2011 but was put aside thereafter as Porsche concentrated on its 919 Hybrid World Endurance Championship prototype racer.

Slow not fast energy recovery & storage

The shift in Porsche's racing commitment to the Le Mans-bound 919 Hybrid was partly connected to its contemporary road-going supercar project according to Daniel Armbruster president and CEO of Porsche Motorsport North America.

""It was around that time that work was also already underway on the 918 Spyder plug-in hybrid super sports car"" he remembers. ""In both instances [919/918] it was found that lithium-ion batteries offered the best balance of energy retention and power delivery for their respective purposes.""

Despite its routine stop-start nature—and thus opportunities to harvest regenerative braking energy—street driving is not characterized by the need to sprint from corner apex to corner apex braking and accelerating at maximum possible rates as in racing. The demand for quick intensive energy recovery and subsequent deployment is replaced by a mandate for slower-paced electrical energy generation and deployment shifting the emphasis to energy storage. Advertisement

""The flywheel hybrid technology in the 911 GT3 R Hybrid offered fuel savings and therefore a reduced need for pit time versus the cars it competed against"" Armbruster explains. ""In racing applications it's possible to make more effective use of a flywheel because of the frequent hard braking and acceleration that are both good matches for the short-term energy storage ability and high output capacity of that technology.

""But the technology wasn't without challenges. In general the flywheel does not store much energy just the braking energy"" he says. ""A battery is able to achieve highly stable long-term energy storage in a way that a flywheel simply cannot match. For road uses where the ability to drive on demand without local emissions is important as is becoming increasingly the case in parts of Europe a battery-based solution is the best hybrid powertrain option.""

While the limited storage capacity of the flywheel hybrid sidelined the technology for Porsche Armbruster adds that ""there is no denying that the 911 GT3 R Hybrid played a pivotal role in proving that hybrid technology had a home in high-performance sports car applications.""

Looking back to that time from the present day Glen Pascoe principal design engineer with Williams Advanced Engineering (WAE) says that the quick capture and release of energy by flywheel motor systems is better suited to peak cycle applications.

""Besides city-center use the duty cycle for a typical passenger car does not suit the repeated 'start-stop' nature that best suits flywheel technology"" says Pascoe. ""The stored energy in a flywheel is always depleting unlike a chemical battery which can hold its state of charge over a very long period of time.""

On the buses

Williams' basic flywheel hybrid concept did reach city centers in 2015 when GKN modified the system for London buses. GKN's Gyrodrive flywheel hybrid system included a traction motor driven from the vehicle's drive axle an electric flywheel an inverter for the motor/flywheel unit and an electronic control system.

The system and subsequent variations have seen use in buses from UK manufacturer Alexander Dennis in both single and double-decker bus models. However the Gyrodrive flywheel system was considered too large and expensive for urban-use cars (taxis) which adopted various battery strategies.

Glen Pascoe says WAE is not specifically refining any flywheel systems at the present but adds that ""as we work across a wide range of industries and examine the requirements of our clients in detail this technology may be appropriate for certain applications in the future.""

That could include racing if racing series/sanctioning bodies allowed such devices though current interest appears to lie more in hybrid battery and fast-charging development. WAE is currently engaged in hydrogen fuel cell development for large mining trucks using regenerative braking in much the same way as with flywheel systems.

Porsche Motorsport North America's president says the company ""is always evaluating which technologies offer the best solution for the current situation"" not ruling out any single approach.

Armbruster explains that Porsche's strategy ""includes internal combustion powertrains sporty plug-in hybrids and fully electric vehicles... We are also investigating the development of synthetic fuels that offer an environmentally sound approach to internal combustion vehicles that are already on the road.""

Ironically the flywheel hybrids that most of us now encounter lie in vehicles we ride in (buses trains ships) rather than drive. And static flywheel systems are also under development; in Germany a company called Chakratec has just installed a flywheel storage system at a Premier Inn in Leipzig designed to manage peak loads for EV chargers.

But about a decade ago flywheel-motor-augmented race cars led the Nürburgring 24 and competed credibly against lighter GT3 cars. Further investment could both lighten and potentially improve the energy storage capacity of such systems again pairing drivers and flywheels in a sport that rarely throws everything away.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9yb2FkLXRvLXJlY292ZXJ5LzIwMjEvMDIvMTQvYmFsbGV0LWJsYWNrLWRhbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black dancers struggle to make their way through pandemic,After more than 10 years performing in traveling shows and in local theaters NaTonia Monét fulfilled a lifelong dream last year when she made her Broadway debut in “Tina: The Tina Turner Musical.” For months she sang danced and acted in eight shows a week in the role of Alline Tina Turner’s older sister who introduced the young Anna Mae Bullock to Ike Turner.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmNhLmNvbS9lbi9tb3JlLXNwb3J0cy8yMDIxLzAyLzEzLzYwMjdiOGJlMjI2MDFkYWIzZThiNDU4Yy5odG1s0gFNaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAubWFyY2EuY29tL2VuL21vcmUtc3BvcnRzLzIwMjEvMDIvMTMvNjAyN2I4YmUyMjYwMWRhYjNlOGI0NThjLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Naomi Osaka: The marketing queen,"She has been labeled the 'Queen of Marketing' and if there is any tennis player who could be seen as the successor to Serena Williams it's Naomi Osaka who is set to play Garbine Muguruza in the Australian Open quarter-finals.

That career has been littered with a number of firsts and she has turned those firsts into stories of success since that.

It seems wherever she goes success has followed beginning with her school life.

Hailing from St Catherine Williams is the seventh of nine children for parents James and Myrtle Johnston the education minister boarded with another family so she could attend Ferncourt High School well away from the comforts of home but blanched those challenges to achieve academic success.

Williams tertiary education had to wait after she ended high school and landed a job at the Bank of Nova Scotia where she worked as a teller for three years. Higher education was still on her mind though and she travelled to the United States where a Masters in Business Administration with a focus on finance and her accreditation as a Chartered Financial Analyst from the Wharton Business School inside the University of Pennsylvania were waiting. Before that her Bachelor of Arts (cum laude) came in Economics from the prestigious Harvard University in Cambridge Massachusetts.

The would-be politician then earned a place as an Information Systems Analyst for Morgan Stanley before going to work for Putnam Investments Wellington Management Company and Northwestern Mutual Life in the United States.

Returning to Jamaica Williams served as executive director of Kingston Properties as a senior manager at the Jamaica Money Market Brokers and consulted for the Financial Services Commission.

It wouldn’t be long before her influence as a change maker and her knowledge of finance on a macro level would put her in touch with politics becoming caretaker of the St Andrew Eastern constituency back in 2015.

Almost a year to the date she became caretaker Williams was sworn in as a Member of Parliament for the same constituency.

Her rise through the ranks of the Jamaica Labour Party since that time has been noticeable but more than that understandable.

Her first call of duty when she was appointed State Minister in the Ministry of Finance to work alongside Audley Shaw and Rudyard Spencer was to rid the government of the policy of drawing from the National Housing Trust to help budget financing.

It was a notable change.

She also made noteworthy contributions to the Pensions (Public Service) Act where a contributory scheme was made for the public sector.

She was also the person behind the first murmurings of a need for Jamaica to implement a national identification system.

And elicited help from the government for members of the Small Business Association on the event that the organisation created an implementation team to work alongside the government in coming up with strategies for growth and development.

Having achieved all that as the first woman to be appointed to represent a finance ministry in Jamaica it is no wonder she has drawn accolades and her resounding victory at the polls in 2020 came as no surprise.

Williams also sat on the Public Administration and Appropriations Committee and piloted three bills that allowed for tax exemption for listed companies using the share buyback option. Those bills the Transfer Tax (Amendment) Act the Income Tax (amendment) Act and the Stamp Duty (Amendment) Act were credited with driving more persons to the Jamaica Stock Exchange.

It is also no wonder that in 2017 Businesssuite Magazine named Williams the number one CEO in the Caribbean for the previous year.

Such a busy woman has Williams been that she has even had a stint as chairman of popular media house Nationwide News Network and is co-founder of film animation Company ReelRock GSW.

Lately having seen the impact on her life education has had Williams has charged headlong into an education ministry significantly hamstrung by the attempts to slow the impact of COVID-19.

But with the track record she has boasted to date there is nobody betting against her coming out at the other end of these massive challenges smelling like roses.",,,

For the first time in its 150-year history in the United Kingdom KPMG has installed two women at the company’s helm following the resignation of former chairman and senior partner Bill Michael.

Last week KPMG company veteran Bill Michael fell from his throne after a number of his comments to the firm’s 1500-strong financial services consulting team leaked out. His comments included telling staff to “stop moaning” about long working hours during the pandemic and rubbishing the notion of unconscious bias within the firm’s performance management system as “complete crap”.

While he was quick to apologise for the matter it came too little too late and on Wednesday morning KPMG asked him to step aside. Two days on Michael announced his resignation.

KPMG been quick to fill the void appointing a duo of female partners to run the firm on a temporary basis. Mary O’Connor who is head of clients and markets will take over Michael’s responsibilities as senior partner while Bina Mehta a UK board member will assume the role of chairman.

The move marks a special milestone for KPMG. Since founding in 1870 in the UK the Big Four accounting and consulting giant has never been led by a woman. With many company members shocked disappointed or upset by last week’s events O’Connor and Mehta will initially focus on bringing KPMG and its 19000-strong workforce in the country back into calm waters.

According to reports from the Financial Times KPMG insiders believe that it is not likely that Michael who has run KPMG UK since 2017 as chairman and senior partner would return as chairman. The newspaper suggests that the next chairman will “most likely be female” with Mary O’Connor Michelle Hinchcliffe (Chair of Audit) and Lisa Heneghan (Chief Digital Officer) tipped as the candidates with the best papers.

Meanwhile a formal ethical investigation into Michael’s comments is being conducted by magic circle law firm Linklaters.

Prem Premsrirut’s dissertation was a must-see.

Her brother Rutt a real estate investor admits he had no idea what she was talking about in her presentation the capstone of her doctorate in cancer genetics from Stony Brook University in New York.

Once a little girl from Las Vegas who was a straight-A student and good at everything she tried from gymnastics to the saxophone Premsrirut had refined a process for genetically engineering mice for cancer research. She whittled it from two years to a matter of weeks.

“All her classmates were running over to her to watch her presentation and they were excited” Rutt Premsrirut said. “Just seeing the reaction of all her classmates I knew she was at a different level.”

The efficiency with which his sister engineered mice showed itself last year when Prem Premsrirut’s biotech startup Mirimus Labs — it’s been in business since 2010 but all biotech firms are startups until they make it big she joked — entered uncharted territory in the United States’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mirimus from its economical 2000-square-foot headquarters in Brooklyn is positioning itself to be a leader in pool testing for COVID-19 using saliva samples a method that Premsrirut wants to use to reopen schools and by extension all of normal society.

She’s setting up partnerships in Atlanta Boston the San Diego area and the Wynn resort on the Strip in her hometown.

“I definitely want to give back to a community that’s given me a lot as well as my family” Premsrirut said.

Schools and economies nationwide will benefit from the inexpensive mass testing model that Premsrirut and her team in collaboration with colleagues around the world set out to make in the pandemic’s early days — when nasal swab tests cost $150 each were hard to find and required components then in short supply and human capital that throttled the process so much as to render the results nearly useless.

The pool tests combine polymerase chain reaction testing — the gold standard for detecting genetic material such as in a virus — but of saliva self-collected painlessly and intuitively not of the cells scraped from the nasopharyngeal passage. That’s the uncomfortable deep-nasal swab that people still line up to get done and the standby for testing for respiratory infections but which Premsrirut said would be a hard sell as a repetitive testing method especially for children too young to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

“Pretty much everybody can spit in a tube” she said.

And as central to her goal each test costs less than $15.

Pool testing goes on the idea that most results will be negative and works like this: Samples from several specimens say 10 saliva tubes are combined into one tube that is tested as any individual specimen would be.

If the batch tests negative that’s 10 results for the price and time of one.

If it hits positive all 10 of the samples are run individually to find the infected specimen.

Pool testing is common in testing for HIV hepatitis and genetic diseases in blood. Scientists applied the principle to saliva as COVID-19 raged last year: Rutgers and Yale universities received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for their saliva-based tests and Japanese researchers released the results of a study last fall that showed mass screening of saliva was as effective as using the uncomfortable time-consuming nasal swabs.

THE BLUEPRINT

Premsrirut 40 is a first-generation American who saw firsthand the value of advanced education power of medicine and opportunity through her Thai immigrant parents. Her father was an economics professor who taught at UNLV and her mother a pediatrician and lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force; Premsrirut the youngest of four was born at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. The family came to Las Vegas in 1984 when her mother was stationed at Nellis Air Force Base and Clark County had fewer than half a million people. They stayed.

“We’ve definitely grown with Vegas” Premsrirut said.

Premsrirut is the only member of her immediate family not living in Las Vegas having left after graduating from Green Valley High School but she considers the area home.

Doris French Elementary. Cannon Junior High School. Green Valley High. Then UC Berkeley for undergrad and Stony Brook University for the Ph.D. and a medical degree.

When New York went into lockdown last spring her youngest child Ivan suffered under distance learning. He threw his laptop around in frustration and Premsrirut couldn’t give him the help he needed because she was working.

Knowing that even a hybrid model wouldn’t work for her two children she and the children’s father agreed to relocate Ivan now 7 and Anya 9 to live with her parents in Las Vegas where they can attend in-person classes at a private school.

“There’s no way I could do any of this had my family not stepped up and said ‘We’ll take care of the children. You go do what needs to be done” Premsrirut said.

Premsrirut said she didn’t know she wanted to work in research instead of direct patient care until she entered a laboratory after her undergraduate studies. She knows this will still impact people and their livelihoods.

Mirimus’ genetic editing and engineering work put it on the map in studying human disease. The company which went from about 25 employees pre-COVID to about 100 now still does this along with the COVID-19 pool testing.

Without much room in their headquarters Mirimus decided to rather than give their partners a fish teach them how to fish. Mirimus provides the blueprint and training for other labs established or built new to pool test saliva as regularly as once or twice a week to keep schools open.

Schools are the focus. Premsrirut figures the corporations will come along and subsidize the costs for schools.

The process is always being refined. In the early days they designed a gadget to help with automation by clustering specimen tubes together like a six-pack of soda to insert into testing racks.

“When you’re faced with problems and you’ve got to overcome them quickly and every little bit of time and money and everything matters you will persevere when you can find solutions.”

Brother Rutt who keeps his niece and nephew a few days a week said his sister’s solution is “innovative transformative and logical. It’s common sense.”

“That’s why it’s important because it’s common sense” he said. “It’s mass testing repetitive testing. It has proven to work in other countries other states.”

As when she unveiled her cutting-edge mouse engineering he said he didn’t initially understand her pool testing breakthrough.

“But I knew she knew what she was doing” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvdmlyYWwtdmVnYXMtZGVhdGhzLWp1bXAtdG91cmlzbS1zbHVtcHMtYW1pZC1sb25nLXBhbmRlbWlj0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS92aXJhbC12ZWdhcy1kZWF0aHMtanVtcC10b3VyaXNtLXNsdW1wcy1hbWlkLWxvbmctcGFuZGVtaWMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Viral Vegas: Deaths jump tourism slumps amid long pandemic,"LAS VEGAS — Six weeks ago thousands of New Year’s revelers gathered beneath the neon-lit marquees on the Las Vegas Strip — even though the big annual fireworks show was called off due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The sight of the big crowd including many people without masks spurred fears that COVID-19 infections would skyrocket followed by hospitalizations and then deaths. That's exactly what happened. January was Nevada's deadliest month since the pandemic began with 1132 deaths. December was second.

Now the virus is reshaping a tourist destination built for excess and known for bright lights big crowds indulgent meals and headline shows. Visitors arrive to find some freedoms curtailed and some familiar attractions closed but parking and bargain prices are abundant. Big performances and conventions are still on hold.

“We have an industry that invites people from all over the world to come here and unfortunately when they come here they can bring disease with them” said Brian Labus a longtime epidemiologist at the regional Southern Nevada Health District who now teaches public health at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. “The concern is that it spreads within our local population.”

HOUSE COMMITTEE APPROVES ANOTHER $14B FOR PANDEMIC-HIT AIRLINES

In mid-January more than half of the hospitals in and around Las Vegas reported being at least 90% full. One suburban medical center declared a capacity crisis with more patients than beds. Nearly half of its 147 beds were occupied by coronavirus patients.

Deaths in Nevada hit a single-day record of 71 on Jan. 21. On Thursday the statewide death total from COVID-19 was 4637 since the pandemic began.

As in other cities some overwhelmed funeral homes have used refrigerated trailers to hold the dead interim Coroner Michael Murphy said.

“It’s nothing like I ever experienced in my nursing career” said Dina Armstrong a nurse at MountainView Hospital in northwest Las Vegas. “Dealing with this disease is mind-blowing — the stress and the environment.”

On the streets the result is many fewer tourists and ""a very different experience” said Marilinda Sepulveda a repeat visitor as she and her husband waited to snap photos next to the “Welcome to Las Vegas” sign.

COVID-19 TRAVEL SLUMP HANDS EXPEDIA BIGGER FINANCIAL LOSS THAN EXPECTED

The couple from Mission Texas spent two nights at the Cosmopolitan hotel in the heart of the Strip. “The nightlife is: You gamble you walk you go to your room” Sepulveda said.

Speaking through a cloth face mask her husband Ozzy Benavidez said they would have gone to magic shows and restaurants. Instead the pair bought take-out meals and ate in their room.

Some marquee properties have been idled including the Mirage casino and its iconic man-made volcano eruptions on the Strip.

Others like the Wynn Resorts property Encore are closed during the week but open on weekends. Unused convention space in the sleek curved 2700-room tower was repurposed as a vaccination center operated by the region’s public hospital. Nearly 11500 people have gotten shots there.

At the Las Vegas Convention Center where a huge new wing was expected to open in time for the big Consumer Electronics gadget show in early January officials opened a facility for people receiving their second dose of vaccine. CES was held virtually.

Up and down the Strip from the renovated Sahara to the gleaming gold-windowed Mandalay Bay visitors have found quiet gambling floors shuttered showrooms and inexpensive rates.

AROUND THE GLOBE VIRUS CANCELS SPRING TRAVEL FOR MILLIONS

Daniel Pangau pastor of an Indonesian Christian church in Brea California figured a three-day stay at the Delano hotel for his family of six cost less than half the price before the pandemic.

Tourists find plentiful parking and signs everywhere reminding them to wear masks. They don’t see the thousands of workers still without jobs.

When casinos closed in mid-March 98% of the 60000 members of the local culinary and bartenders’ unions were furloughed. Union spokeswoman Bethany Khan said only about half are back to work now.

At least 115 union members and immediate family members have died from COVID-19 and almost 2000 have been hospitalized with the virus since March Khan said.

Unemployment in Nevada shot up from an all-time low of 3.6% in February 2020 to a worst-in-the-nation record 30.1% in April. The figure was down to 9.2% in December.

From mid-March to Jan. 30 more than 834000 people filed first-time claims for jobless benefits according to the state jobless office. That figure is especially startling when weighed against the size of the entire statewide workforce a year ago — 1.4 million people.

Visitor numbers were down by more than half in 2020 — just 19 million — compared with 42.5 million in 2019 according to data compiled by tourism airport and gambling regulators.

Casino tax revenues a key source of funds in a state with no personal income tax were down 40% during the calendar year gambling regulators reported.

Big conventions stopped completely in March and have not resumed. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak let casinos reopen in June with pandemic crowd restrictions. In November he instituted what he termed a “pause” in reopenings.

Citing progress against the virus the governor on Thursday announced that restrictions on businesses and gatherings could be loosened over the next three months.

Casinos gyms bars and restaurants will increase from 25% to 35% capacity beginning Monday with seating limits mask mandates and social distancing required. Casinos could go to 50% capacity next month. Clubs and nightclubs remain closed.

By the time shows resume some veteran performers may be gone said Alan Feldman a longtime casino executive who is now a fellow at the International Gaming Institute at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.

“One toll yet to be measured is the loss of talent” Feldman said. “To what extent have people moved on to other careers or back to school or out of the state? That’s yet to be determined.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhc2luby5vcmcvbmV3cy9maXJlLWF0LWNvc21vcG9saXRhbi1pbi1sYXMtdmVnYXMtaG9zcGl0YWxpemVzLW11bHRpcGxlLXBlb3BsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casino.org Fire at Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas Hospitalizes Multiple People,"Fire at Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas Hospitalizes Multiple People

Several people were hospitalized with minor injuries Saturday night in a fire at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas authorities said. The cause of the fire remained under investigation on Sunday.

Firefighters responded just before 8 pm Saturday to a report of smoke at the resort on the Las Vegas Strip. At the hotel-casino firefighters discovered smoke in the hallway of the 51st floor and found a fire on a balcony in one of the rooms. The fire was extinguished.

Everyone on the 51st floor was evacuated. The Clark County Fire Department reported that “multiple patients” were taken to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center.

Eyewitness Angelique Juarez told KLAS-TV the incident looked serious because of the number of fire trucks ambulances and police vehicles that “kept coming.”

“We noticed that they were going in through the side entrance so we knew it was something bigger than just a standard emergency” she said.

According to news reports 10 fire engines and other emergency vehicles responded to the incident.

The Cosmopolitan is on the west side of the Strip just south of the Bellagio. The Cosmopolitan’s hotel towers rise above the older Jockey Club at that site.

In 2015 a fire at the Cosmopolitan’s Bamboo Pool deck five stories above ground left two people with smoke inhalation injuries according to NBC News. One person was hospitalized. Fire investigators said a fake palm tree was the source of the fire. The blaze was extinguished in about 30 minutes.

Also on the west side of the Strip a fire last spring at the Excalibur led to an arson arrest.

Deadly Fires

Fires on the Las Vegas Strip call to mind previous incidents including two deadly blazes in the 1980s that led to improved safety codes.

Earlier this month KSNV-TV veteran reporter Tom Hawley noted that Feb. 10 marked the 40-year anniversary of a fire at the Las Vegas Hilton that killed eight people. His report aired in a “Video Vault” segment.

At the time the resort just east of the Strip was the largest hotel in the world. The property now is the Westgate.

Singer Andy Williams and dancer Juliet Prowse had been performing in the showroom the night of the fire.

The thing that really terrified me was looking out the back door and seeing that whole east wing elevator shaft on fire and people waving electric lamps out the window” Williams said that night.

A $39-a-day busboy named Philip Bruce Cline later was found guilty of first-degree arson in case. Now 63 Cline is imprisoned at Southern Nevada Correctional Center serving eight life terms without parole Hawley reported.

Strict Fire Codes

The Hilton fire came only three months after a fire that killed 87 people and injured hundreds more at the MGM Grand on Nov. 21 1980. That resort on the east side of the Strip is now named Bally’s Las Vegas. A new MGM Grand opened in 1993 farther south on the Strip near McCarran International Airport.

The 1980 fire at the MGM Grand started in a kitchen and spread into the casino area.

The two deadly fires in the early 1980s led to improved sprinkler systems and other safety measures in hotels. State Sen. Joe Neal (D) who died late last year was instrumental in passing legislation to safeguard hotels from deadly fires.

Hawley said there has not been another fire death in a Nevada high-rise hotel since February 1981 because of the “toughest codes in the nation.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbWguY29tLmF1L2J1c2luZXNzL2NvbXBhbmllcy90aGUtY2hpcHMtYXJlLWRvd24tYXMtY3Jvd24tY2hhaXItaGVsZW4tY29vbmFuLWZpZ2h0cy10by1zYXZlLXN5ZG5leS1jYXNpbm8tMjAyMTAyMTItcDU3MXpsLmh0bWzSAYoBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc21oLmNvbS5hdS9idXNpbmVzcy9jb21wYW5pZXMvdGhlLWNoaXBzLWFyZS1kb3duLWFzLWNyb3duLWNoYWlyLWhlbGVuLWNvb25hbi1maWdodHMtdG8tc2F2ZS1zeWRuZXktY2FzaW5vLTIwMjEwMjEyLXA1NzF6bC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The chips are down as Crown chair Helen Coonan fights to save Sydney casino,"Save Log in  register or subscribe to save articles for later.

The inquiry led by former Supreme Court judge Patricia Bergin handed down an excoriating report on Tuesday that lifted the curtain on the dysfunction within Crown’s boardroom and management and how its largest shareholder billionaire James Packer wielded “real power” and influence on Crown’s operations across its casinos in Melbourne Perth and Sydney with “disastrous consequences for the company”. The report has already claimed the scalp of three directors who stepped down from Crown’s board this week with calls now coming from within the business community for Coonan who has been on the board for a decade to also consider her position. Philip Crawford chair of the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority said at some point Coonan should “probably” step down. Crown chairman Helen Coonan has been challenged about retaining her position on the gambling company’s board following the revelations of its corporate failings in the Bergin review. The Bergin report said an examination of a 2019 investigation by The Sydney Morning Herald The Age and 60 Minutes into Crown confirmed the company had “facilitated money laundering” through its bank accounts; “disregarded the welfare” of its staff in China before 19 were arrested there in 2016 and went into business with high-roller junket tour groups linked to Triads and other organised crime groups. This made Crown unsuitable to hold a casino licence with its core problem being “poor corporate governance deficient risk-management structures and processes and a poor corporate culture”. One of the report’s recommendations is to ban junket tour operators. However the revenues of those junket operators and high-rollers underpin the business model of Crown’s $2.2 billion Sydney casino and are key for Crown’s Melbourne and Perth casinos and indirectly generate tax revenue for state governments.

“Governments everywhere are crying out for revenue. If you start taking the gambling revenue out it’s another thing they have got to make up” says Peter Morgan a former head of equities at fund manager Perpetual. Crawford said the regulator would ban junket operators operating in NSW based on Bergin’s findings. This will affect not only Crown but also The Star casino whose management he will meet next week. Before Bergin’s report there had already been a decline in junket operators and high-rollers visiting Australia because of an anti-corruption drive out of China deteriorating political relations between the two countries and the global pandemic which shut Australia’s international borders to visitors. Coonan has promised “root and branch” reform of Crown as it addresses the findings of Bergin’s report which said Crown needed a management and boardroom overhaul if it ever wanted to hold a casino licence. “We do not underestimate the scale of the problem” Coonan said in a statement. She has declined interview requests. The Bergin report also said the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority should reconsider Packer’s involvement. The report recommended an ownership cap be put in place for Crown Sydney so any investor will need the NSW regulator’s approval to buy or own more than 10 per cent of a casino operator opening up the possibility of it ordering Packer to sell down his 36.8 per cent stake in the company. While Bergin found that Crown was not suitable to hold a casino licence the report outlined steps that could make the group suitable again and avoid its licence being revoked. Under the deal signed by the NSW government and Crown to open Sydney’s second casino the regulator was contractually bound to work with Crown to try and make it suitable. However Crawford has warned Crown there’s no guarantee it will get that approval. It will be up to Coonan to make that happen and fast. “I’ve told her to get cracking and so far things are starting to move pretty quickly” he says.

The demands on Coonan will be enormous as the company faces reviews by Victoria’s gaming regulator and possibly also its counterpart in Western Australia. “All of the behaviour that’s been referred to in Bergin has pretty much been conducted in other states. To that extent we’re lucky. We got to it in time before they came in here and had similar problems” says Crawford. He declined to comment on whether the regulators in other states had failed to address the problems at Crown. The Bergin report also recommended the establishment of a dedicated casino regulator in NSW and a full forensic audit of Crown’s accounts. Crawford described the bad behaviour within Crown as “breathtaking”: “It’s a lot worse than we thought it would be.” The NSW and Victorian regulators this week called for the removal of Crown’s chief executive Ken Barton and some board directors. Barton remains at the company as does director Harold Mitchell. Director and former AFL boss Andrew Demetriou quit on Thursday. Directors Michael Johnston and Guy Jalland who were appointed to the board by Packer also stood down this week.

Crawford said at some point Coonan should “probably” step down from the board. “That’s something that [Crown] needs to consider in their corporate governance and as a board resolve. We need a couple of people there at the moment to deal with. Bergin certainly said [Coonan’s] somebody who has integrity after being examined pretty thoroughly by counsel at the inquiry. So that’s given me an enormous amount of comfort in going forward.”

Bergin wrote in her report that on reviewing Coonan’s evidence to the inquiry it had demonstrated “that her character honesty and integrity had not been and could not be called into question”. But this hasn’t stopped debate about whether Coonan is the best person to drive Crown’s reform. Businessman and company director Geoff Cousins who has served on blue-chip boards including Telstra’s says a new chair is needed. “I’m delighted to see that for once the board was held responsible. Because normally in these things directors see this game out they fire the CEO or something but the board doesn’t get any criticism when boards are responsible for these matters. I find it remarkable that the chairman however got a clean bill of health. She’s been there a long time.” Coonan joined Crown in 2011 after resigning from federal politics where she had served for 15 years including as a communications minister a role in which she would have come to know James Packer. After her appointment to Crown she gave an interview to The Australian where she spoke about him. “I have a lot of respect for James and so I was honoured when he interviewed me to see if I would be interested in this [role].” In the same interview Coonan said she joined Crown based on the strength of its board. “That’s part of your insurance that the people around you are good” she said. Packer was equally enthusiastic about Coonan: “Helen is someone I’ve known for a very long time and she is an outstanding individual who was a first-class parliamentarian and minister. I have immense respect for her.” Cousins questioned how Crown’s chairman could be considered independent if she was appointed with the blessing of Crown’s biggest shareholder. “She is effectively Packer-appointed and was well known to the Packers. That she will be a completely independent and brave and courageous chairman in changing all this if James is still a shareholder that’s a fragile assumption indeed.” Businessman and board director Geoff Cousins has questioned how Helen Coonan can be an independent chair of Crown while James Packer remains its majority shareholder.

Dean Paatsch co-founder of corporate governance adviser Ownership Matters says Packer’s shareholding remains a problem for board renewal. “The regulator can decide who it doesn’t want on the board but it’s for shareholders to decide who the best and most competent people are. It makes it very difficult for the optimal composition of the board to be transacted without the Packer influence whilst he remains a shareholder.” The Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority’s board met on Friday and will meet again next Wednesday as it reviews the Bergin recommendations. One of the matters it will be considering is whether Packer should be forced to reduce his shareholding in Crown. Crawford stated that Packer’s influence has diminished with the removal of two directors this week. The regulator will also review if director John Poynton should continue on the board after the director terminated a consultancy agreement with Packer’s private company Consolidated Press Holdings. The focus on Packer’s influence has raised several options for the regulator to consider including his shareholding. Crawford says it’s possible that Packer might be able to retain his current shareholding but have his voting rights limited to 10 per cent. “Another possibility is that someone will want to buy those shares. And if that person stacked up on our probity basis I wouldn’t want to put any obstacles into a sale.” Paatsch said a structure limiting Packer’s voting rights on board appointments would be an elegant solution. “It would be Packer agreeing for his own benefit not to vote on the election of directors except for 10 per cent. And that would reallocate the influence to other shareholders. I don’t see any downside so long as he still retains his 37 per cent as he should to vote on all other matters including a [potential] takeover. It’s still his property.” The risk of Packer being found unsuitable to be involved in the Sydney casino has generated speculation he could finally sell his $2.4 billion stake in Crown following several failed attempts to sell part of his holding in recent years.

Monday morning the company issued an Energy Alert and asked people around the area to turn off appliances and lights that were not essential.

They said demand for power has been very high and said if demand on the grid is not lessened it could exceed the capacity of the Southwest Power Pool which serves multiple states and areas including the Panhandle.

A statement from Xcel said there are already deficiencies due to the increased demand and cautioned that they could become greater as historic lows continue across the area.

Ways customers can help prevent power emergencies include:



Turn down thermostats to 68 degrees.

Close shades and blinds to reduce the amount of heat lost through windows.

Turn off and unplug non-essential lights and appliances.

Avoid using large appliances (ovens washing machines etc.).

Businesses should minimize the use of electric lighting and electricity-consuming equipment as much as possible.

Large consumers of electricity should consider shutting down or reducing non-essential production processes.

“All the central U.S. is experiencing historically low temperatures and every available power plant is being called into service” said David Hudson president Xcel Energy – New Mexico Texas. “If we work together to reduce demand we’ll improve our chances of keeping the power flowing through the worst of this weather. We are seeing similar notices across Texas as record-breaking energy usage is occurring.”

Xcel Energy anticipates strong demand throughout the early part of this week and will communicate any further needs to conserve electricity later on Monday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8va2R2ci5jb20vbmV3cy9wcm9ibGVtLXNvbHZlcnMveGNlbC1lbmVyZ3ktbm90LWxpYWJsZS1mb3ItZGFtYWdlcy10by1wcm9wZXJ0eS1kdWUtdG8tc3RhdGUtZ3VpZGVsaW5lL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8va2R2ci5jb20vbmV3cy9wcm9ibGVtLXNvbHZlcnMveGNlbC1lbmVyZ3ktbm90LWxpYWJsZS1mb3ItZGFtYWdlcy10by1wcm9wZXJ0eS1kdWUtdG8tc3RhdGUtZ3VpZGVsaW5lL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xcel Energy not liable for damages to property due to state guideline,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://kdvr.com/news/problem-solvers/xcel-energy-not-liable-for-damages-to-property-due-to-state-guideline/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8va2R2ci5jb20vbmV3cy9wcm9ibGVtLXNvbHZlcnMveGNlbC1lbmVyZ3ktbm90LWxpYWJsZS1mb3ItZGFtYWdlcy10by1wcm9wZXJ0eS1kdWUtdG8tc3RhdGUtZ3VpZGVsaW5lL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8va2R2ci5jb20vbmV3cy9wcm9ibGVtLXNvbHZlcnMveGNlbC1lbmVyZ3ktbm90LWxpYWJsZS1mb3ItZGFtYWdlcy10by1wcm9wZXJ0eS1kdWUtdG8tc3RhdGUtZ3VpZGVsaW5lL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWFyaWxsby5jb20vc3RvcnkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8wMi8xMy94Y2VsLWVuZXJneS1vbmUtZmlyc3QtdS1zLWVuZXJneS1wcm92aWRlcnMtcmVhY2gtMTAtMDAwLW1lZ2F3YXR0LXdpbmQtcG93ZXItbWlsZXN0b25lLzY3MzIyNzUwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xcel Energy one of first U.S. energy providers to reach 10000-megawatt wind power milestone,"AGN Media

At the end of 2020 Xcel Energy became one of the first energy providers in the United States to reach 10000 megawatts of wind energy capacity online for customers in the states it serves according to a news release from the energy provider.

The milestone is powered by the company’s 10 new wind projects in the Upper Midwest Colorado Texas and New Mexico.

While many projects are already completed all the projects will be online by year’s end completing the largest multi-state wind investment in the country. As new projects continue to come online in 2021 the company estimates more than 31% of its nameplate energy capacity will come from wind by the end of the year. Additionally Xcel Energy owns and operates much of the new wind increasing its owned projects from 850 megawatts to 4469 megawatts by the end of the year.

“We launched an ambitious wind energy expansion in 2017 as part of our ongoing commitment to reduce carbon emissions while continuing to provide safe reliable and affordable service for our customers” said Ben Fowke chairman and CEO Xcel Energy. “The new wind projects we’ve added will save customers money in the coming decades are among the most cost-effective energy sources on our grid and are integral to our groundbreaking vision to deliver 100% carbon-free electricity to our customers by 2050.”

Xcel Energy is the first major U.S. power provider to announce a commitment to reducing carbon emissions by 80% (from 2005 levels) by 2030 with a vision of delivering 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. The company is more than halfway to that interim goal. The projects enabled the creation of thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of permanent operations and maintenance jobs while also supporting local governments and landowners who receive benefits through lease payments and taxes that help support local infrastructure.

Texas and New Mexico wind expansion saves customers money

In 2017 Xcel Energy announced a 1230-megawatt expansion of wind energy resources on its TexasNew Mexico system that included two new wind facilities to be built and owned by the company. The Hale Wind Project came online in Texas in June 2019 followed by the Sagamore Wind Project in New Mexico in December 2020. Both facilities have led to significant reductions in fuel costs paid by Texas and New Mexico customers. The company estimates at the end of 2021 more than 31% of its nameplate energy capacity will come from wind.

“These new wind facilities have allowed us to produce wind energy at a cost lower than energy produced at our older coal and natural gas-fueled plants and they’re paying for themselves with the savings they generate” said David Hudson president Xcel Energy – New Mexico Texas. “These investments have also created significant tax base in communities where the facilities are located along with new jobs and long-term economic growth.”

The projects enabled the creation of thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of permanent operations and maintenance jobs while also supporting local governments and landowners who receive benefits through lease payments and taxes that help support local infrastructure.

New wind projects powering communities throughout Xcel Energy’s service territories

Xcel Energy has built new wind farms repowered other projects and secured new power purchase agreements (PPAs) for projects throughout its service territories since 2016 totaling more than 3000 megawatts (MW) including:

Lubbock Power & Light says for the first time one outage was intentional.

Heading into Tuesday electric providers across the state continue asking users to conserve electricity as Texas faces high demand and some reduced capacity caused by nearly half of the state's wind power production being taken offline due to the icy conditions.

“This is an ongoing record weather event bringing some of the coldest temperatures we’ve seen in 40 years” said David McCalla executive director for LP&L. “This has put a strain on grids across the state including our region and today we’re asking our customers to please do what they can to reduce their electric use for the stability of the overall grid.”

LP&L offered these suggestions:

Set thermostats to 68 degrees or lower.

Suspend use of electrical appliances (dishwashers washing machines clothes dryers vacuum cleaners etc.)

Put off tasks at work if possible that would demand electricity (power tools maintenance equipment etc.).

Turn off televisions and electronic equipment unless they are necessary to conduct business or to ensure your health and safety.

Turn off unnecessary lighting leaving on only enough to move about safely indoors.

At 10 a.m. on Monday the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) upgraded their emergency alert status to level 3 meaning rotating outages were possible in the area.

Matt Rose spokesman for LP&L says one intentional outage occurred Monday to relieve pressure on the system. Rose said the intentional blackout lasted about 20 minutes and he said about 1000 residents were affected. As of Monday evening Rose did not believe any more intentional outages would occur in the Lubbock area.

But if there are outages could last anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour Rose said.

Rose said crews will continue working on accidental outages. Because most of the city's electrical infrastructure is above ground Rose said extreme cold temperatures impact the system.

""We will probably have outages this evening and into tomorrow"" Rose said Monday afternoon. ""Customers throughout the system because of the weather could experience a loss of power where our crew has to come out and repair equipment. That's been the steady pace throughout this storm. We anticipate that until this ends here and there a small number of customers could lose power.""

He said thankfully Lubbock isn't experiencing the number of power outages seen elsewhere across the state. He said Lubbock isn't experiencing issues with ice like some areas across the state.

Rose said Monday was the first time LP&L was told to intentionally blackout an area. Rose said Lubbock's usage on Monday broke records for peak demand during a winter month although it didn't come close to the peak demand Lubbock experiences in the summer. Most of Lubbock's heaters are powered by gas.

Lubbock Power & Light is connected to the Southwest Power Pool's regional transmission grid. LP&L receives wholesale energy from Xcel Energy through the Southwest Power Pool's grid. Most of Texas is on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas grid where rotating outages have been occurring more frequently due to weather and high demand.

SPP has directed its member utilities which includes Lubbock Power & Light to be prepared to implement controlled interruptions of service if necessary according to a news release.

The entire region is being urged to conserve power as the utility grid it's on faces demands similar to what has prompted power failures in other parts of Texas during the Arctic winter storm. According to a news release from Xcel Energy extreme cold has slowed the flow of natural gas fuel to power plants in the central U.S. including Xcel Energy power plants in Texas and New Mexico limiting output at a time of record energy demand.

“Controlled service interruptions are a last resort and a step we take only when necessary to safeguard continued reliability of the regional grid” said SPP’s executive vice president and chief operating officer Lanny Nickell.

Xcel Energy and the electric cooperatives in the Texas South Plains Texas Panhandle and eastern and southeastern New Mexico regions have declared a higher Energy Alert level and are urging customers to cut back on their use of electricity according to a news release from Xcel.

Additionally Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has requested the conservation of electric and natural gas energy.

“We appreciate the patience and understanding of our customers at this time” said David Hudson president of Xcel Energy in New Mexico and Texas. “We can see real-time at our control center that customers are conserving energy and we are encouraged by the regional spirit in helping each other out in this emergency situation.”

Xcel Energy says it declared the Energy Alert only after all other efforts to reduce electricity demand or to increase supply were implemented. Those include:

Bringing online as many power plant generating units as possible and buying as much electricity as possible from other utilities.

Reducing electricity use as much as possible at Xcel Energy power plants and office buildings.

Interrupting power to industrial and agricultural customers who signed up for lower interruptible rates.

Asking other commercial and industrial customers to curtail their energy use.

On Sunday the Austin American-Statesman reported nearly half of Texas' installed wind power generation capacity has been offline because of frozen wind turbines in West Texas according to Texas grid operators.

Wind farms across the state generate up to a combined 25100 megawatts of energy. But unusually moist winter conditions in West Texas brought on by the weekend's freezing rain and historically low temperatures have iced many of those wind turbines to a halt.

As of Sunday morning those iced turbines comprise 12000 megawatts of Texas' installed wind generation capacity although those West Texas turbines don't typically spin to their full generation capacity this time of year.

Fortunately for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas which manages the state's electric grid the storm's gusty winds are spinning the state's unfrozen coastal turbines at a higher rate than expected helping to offset some of the power generation losses because of the icy conditions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS93aWxkLW5lZWRzLWpvcmRhbi1ncmVlbndheS1zLWdyb3d0aC1pbnRvLWFuLW5obC1mb3JjZS10by1jb250aW51ZS82MDAwMjMyNjgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wild needs Jordan Greenway's growth into an NHL force to continue,"Jordan Greenway was still playing games while the Wild was on hiatus after a COVID-19 outbreak stopped the season — just of the Xbox variety.

""Madden. Call of Duty"" he said. ""Anything really.""

But soon the action won't be virtual.

The Wild will relaunch its season Tuesday at Los Angeles two weeks after the team last suited up for a game and with a portion of its roster still sidelined because of the NHL's COVID protocols.

What could help the Wild make a smooth return is if Greenway the team's leading scorer rediscovers the rhythm he had before the pause when he was making the most impact of his NHL career.

""He's taken a big step forward not only with his game on the ice but off the ice as well becoming an everyday pro hockey player"" coach Dean Evason said Sunday after the Wild's third practice at Xcel Energy Center since the NHL reopened the team's facilities. ""It's a good challenge for him and for everybody clearly after the break to recharge and get the motor going again obviously for Tuesday. But what he's shown us so far up to this point has been mature off the ice a real sound game on the ice and he's been rewarded for it.

""We expect him to continue Tuesday night when the puck's dropped.""

Leading up to the stoppage Greenway was on the best run since his debut with the Wild in 2018.

He was contributing at a near point-per-game pace with a team-high 10 in 11 games and no one on the Wild has more assists than his eight.

Before a rare game without a point in the 2-1 loss at Colorado on Feb. 2 the Wild's final game before getting shut down by the league Greenway pushed career-high assist and point streaks to four games. The 23-year-old has had three multipoint efforts; he had seven in his career coming into the season.

Greenway also entered that last appearance third in the NHL in even-strength points with 10.

Not only is the production a key development for Greenway a 2015 second-round pick the Wild re-signed in the offseason to a two-year prove-it contract worth $4.2 million but it's how he's creating offense that is showcasing his growth.

After flashes in the past Greenway has finally leveraged his 6-6 241-pound frame regularly to become a handful for opposing defenses. And in the process he's emerged as one of the Wild's most consistent players a title he shared with center Joel Eriksson Ek through the first 11 games.

""Once a big body like that — once anybody gets to the net — it's hard to move them in today's game because there's no cross-checks that physically that used to be there"" Evason explained. ""So if you have a willingness to get there and especially for him with his size it's very difficult to move him. He's got very good hands tipping. He's made a commitment to get there.""

And the opportunity to continue to be a force in the offensive zone isn't going away with Greenway a possibility for the woeful power play and skating at even strength next to rookie Kirill Kaprizov.

Since the Wild resumed practice Greenway has been working with Kaprizov and Marcus Johansson who will center the trio after suffering an upper-body injury and then going on the COVID list.

""First few days I was pretty sick maybe three days or so"" Johansson said of his time in the protocols. ""But then it's been better and better and slowly getting back. It's basically been like a flu but you kind of have a little more respect for it. But just being sick with fever and all that it's never fun. But it wasn't too bad.""

Although the Wild didn't have any more players released from the protocols on Sunday Evason said he expected Nick Bonino to be activated soon. Jonas Brodin Ian Cole Brad Hunt Victor Rask Carson Soucy Nico Sturm and Cam Talbot also remain unavailable.

Captain Jared Spurgeon who is dealing with an upper-body injury has been skating on his own and will travel to California. Winger Mats Zuccarello will make his season debut Tuesday following offseason arm surgery and Alex Stalock has been skating with goaltending coach Frederic Chabot. Stalock is out indefinitely with an upper-body injury.

Still the Wild has some work to do to get back to full strength but the steady presence of Greenway could bolster the team. It already has.

""The game maybe does slow down a little bit and I have more time maybe with the puck just because of how much I do use my size and how physical I am"" Greenway said. ""There's a lot of positives for me in using my body and being physical."""

The offering available to all Taco Bell digital customers members allows them to choose 4 menu options (specialties starters sides and a drink) for a total of up to 18 potential variations.

In a press release Taco Bell explained that it wants to ""put fans in the driver's seat and allow them to eat how they want to eat."" The fast food chain took a subtle dig at competitor McDonald's (MCD) whose celebrity-driven menu campaign helped bolster sales last year.

“As we see it there aren’t a lot of choices out there when it comes to value forcing customers to play by others’ rules. But when your fans have different favorites on the menu why not celebrate that?” the company added.

The YUM! Brands (YUM)-owned company is among several to redouble its emphasis on giving consumers more bang for their buck. McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski has also signaled the Golden Arches is poised to double-down on its commitment to cheap eating.

In the company's latest earnings report Kempczinski said it would be ""a trend that continues all through 2021. Our expectation is that you're absolutely going to need to remain competitive on value.""

Fast food giants like McDonald's and Burger King (QSR) are also doubling down on their digital value offerings with the jobs market still struggling and COVID-19 placing restrictions on indoor dining options. Back in December Burger King debuted its “$1 Your Way Menu"" that features four items: A bacon cheeseburger Chicken Jr. sandwich fries and a soft drink.

""I think the value offerings will last longer than a year and maybe more consistent throughout the year"" Wall Street Analyst Peter Saleh of BTIG told Yahoo Finance this week ""only because I do think we have a relatively high unemployment rate...I think that is feeding into the fact that obviously there's a lot less people out there that have the ability to spend.""

TGI Fridays CEO Ray Blanchette told Insider raising the tipped minimum wage would be ""just optics.""

Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 would end up helping tipped workers he said.

Following President Joe Biden's calls during the campaign to end the tipped subminimum wage top Democrats proposed a bill after his inauguration last month that would gradually phase out the $2.13 baseline wage for tipped workers.

But TGI Fridays CEO Ray Blanchette said tipped wages allow servers to make more than the minimum wage while people in the kitchen working non-customer facing jobs do not. Without tipped wages all restaurant workers would split gratuity evenly which he said goes against ""the spirit of what the guest intended.""

Don worked as a research assistant in the Mathematical Laboratory in Cambridge from 1949 until 1952. There he was involved in pioneering work on the electronic delay storage automatic calculator (Edsac 1) computer. In 1955 he took up a research post at the Standard Telecommunication Laboratories (STL) in Harlow Essex where he was part of the design team for a computer called Step 1.

Later in a collaboration between STL and a Dutch subsidiary he was involved in the development of Zebra another early computer. During this time Don worked in Paris New York and Italy; he spoke fluent French and Italian. His two sons found it exciting that during his time at STL their dad had designed software to stress test Concorde’s wings at Farnborough.

In 1962 Don and the computer programmer Alex d’Agapeyeff founded the Computer Analysts and Programmers Group (Cap) which would become one of the foremost IT companies in the UK. He then helped to set up Cap Scientific in 1979 where he worked on Elliott data-processing computers until the early 1980s. After another stint with STL he worked on the Daily Mail’s computers and founded his own company Planned Software Maintenance in 1986; he also did consultancy work including for Oracle retiring very gradually around 2003.

Don Hunter in the early 2000s

Don was born in China to Joseph Walter a missionary and Margaret (nee Brownlea) a Canadian who taught English in China and Chinese in England. In 1931 the family moved to Pevensey Bay near Hastings where Joseph became a curate. Don attended St John’s school in Leatherhead Surrey then went to Selwyn College Cambridge in 1946 where he read physics and natural science and was a cox for the college’s rowing team.

Don and I met in 1957 when we were neighbours in Harlow and became good friends. I eventually introduced him to my sister Patricia Rothery a potter and calligrapher who taught ceramics and industrial design at Birkenhead Art School and they married in 1965.

In his spare time Don was a glider pilot and a serious mountaineer climbing challenging peaks in the Dolomites and the Alps. For many years he ran one of the few surviving Elliott 903 mainframe computers at home; it was collected by Bletchley Park in the early 2000s.

Don retained his independence until the last six months and was able to remain in the Old Vicarage at Elmdon near Saffron Walden Essex where he had lived for 40 years.

Patricia died in 2009. Don is survived by their sons Bernard and Alex their grandsons James and Jasper and his sister Alwyn. His three brothers predeceased him.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The genomic test CLARIFIDE ® Plus from Zoetis includes a range of 14 cow and calf wellness traits as well as the Dairy Wellness Profit Index (DWP).

The DWP Index allows farmers to better select heifers that will be more productive whilst staying healthy and getting in calf sooner.

David Irwin who runs the 170-cow Redhouse Holstein herd in partnership with his father Alan explained that these leading heifers include Redhouse 2212 Crimson Isa 2 which is No 1 for milk production in the UK with a figure of 2143 and Redhouse 2181 Free Billy Ada the top Red Carrier heifer for TPI Index in Europe with an official figure of 2877. She is also the top RC heifer for NM$ Index with a figure of 809.

“We have also bred the No 2 DWP heifer in the UK Redhouse 2235 Cabot Dee and aim in the future to breed the No 1"" said David.

""These animals will all be flushed so we hope to breed some more future No 1s from them. DWP Index information will be taken into account when selecting sires for flushes.”

The herd was founded in 1977 with bought in animals and initially relied on milk production figures to make breeding decisions. David then started utilising health traits with emphasis on fertility when selecting sires.

“The herd has been genomic testing females since the introduction of genomic testing into the UK around eight years ago. More recently we introduced CLARIFIDE Plus which allowed us to use the genetic profile of the female lines to more accurately effect improvements.

""The system has given us a real boost for breeding decisions as it includes wellness traits which can have a huge influence on herd health and profitability.

“We are all familiar with the success of genomic testing for early identification of high performing young bulls but the introduction of genomic testing of the females in the herd has proved invaluable.

""Previously we were dependent on parent averages in order to make breeding decisions but they cannot indicate what genetic material is actually inherited.""

He added that genomic testing the supply this information and enable the farmer to effect breeding and management improvements quicker and more accurately.

Josh Batterham ruminant veterinary consultant with Zoetis explained: “The addition of the Dairy Wellness Profit Index allows farmers through a simple tissue sample to select heifers based on their risk for developing a range of diseases including mastitis lameness and metritis. It will also indicate the likelihood of their calves developing scours and respiratory disease.

“It is essential that we don’t keep investing in our bottom end heifers that have poor figures for production health and fertility. Ideally we would be removing these from the herd as young calves but where numbers don’t allow this they should be bred to beef or used as embryo recipients. Genetic selection along with good herd management will help farms to reach their herd health and profitability goals”

He added that CLARIFIDE Plus allows David to make breeding decisions as early as six weeks old and to decide which animals to retain as replacements. Each year they sell 60 to 70 surplus heifers at this stage after rearing on ad lib automatic milk feeders. As virtually all the calves are in the top 1% of the Holsteins in the UK based on £PLI and their management is first class he has many repeat purchasers who value the high health status and the detailed genetic information which comes with them.

David added “We operate a closed herd with strict biosecurity and rely on social media and word of mouth rather than shows and sales to promote our stock” he said pointing out that the increased health and productivity that can be selected for more than outweighs the initial cost of the system.

The herd is milked three times per day through a 20-point herringbone parlour. Milk production figures for the Redhouse herd in 2020 were 13229 litres per cow at 4.25%BF and 3.33%P. The combined fat and protein figure was 1003kg per cow.

In the December proofs Redhouse Holsteins was the No 14 herd for £PLI Index in the UK and an analysis of the current figures suggests that they will make the top 10 and possibly the top five in the April proof run.",,,,,,,,,,,,
