Newly-published accounts show the Donald Trump’s golf and leisure businesses in Scotland claimed more than £3 million through the UK Government’s furlough scheme.

Golf Recreation Scotland Ltd which owns the former US president’s Turnberry golf course and resort received a total of £2.3m in grants under the furlough scheme last year according to accounts filed with Companies House.

Meanwhile SLC Turnberry Ltd – a subsidiary of the company – made further furlough claims of between £435000 and £1.1m from January to August 2021 according to government data not included in the published accounts a BBC report has revealed.

It comes as the accounts also show Covid restrictions caused significant losses at Trump resorts in Ayrshire and Aberdeenshire resulting in both companies reducing staff.

The accounts claim the average number of employees fell from 84 in 2019 to 63 last year.

Trump Turnberry recorded a loss of more than £3m in 2020 and the other Trump-owned course and resort in Balmedie reported a loss of £1.3m.

The controlling parties of both companies are the trustees of the Donald J Trump Revocable Trust according to the accounts.

Accounts signed by Eric Trump son of Donald Trump state: ""Government support was helpful to retain as many jobs as possible. However uncertainty of the duration of support and the pandemic's sustained impact meant that redundancies were required to prepare the business for the long-term effects to the hospitality industry.

""The UK Government furlough scheme was helpful to retain as many jobs as possible and the majority of employees were reinstated over the course of the year.""

BURNLEY are ready to test the water with a bid for Sunderland’s midfield dynamo Dan Neil.

Clarets’ chief scout Martin Hodge watched the 20-year-old in action at Arsenal in the League Cup and the home-grown youngster impressed.

The Turf Moor outfit’s American owners are willing to invest in some rising stars with future value and Neil is in their sights as an ideal target.

League One Black Cats may sell if the price is right and Burnley have done rigorous background tests in the last few days ahead of an opening offer.

Burnley may try their luck at around £3million for the England Under-20 cap — and possibly even do a deal to buy him and return him to Wearside on loan for the promotion campaign.

Meanwhile Thomas Frank's Brentford could go to £14million in their bid to land Nottingham Forest wideman Brennan Johnson.

However that might still not be enough to do a deal.

The Bees have been buzzing round Johnson 20 for months.

His form has tempted the Prem new boys to reignite their interest and come up with a better offer.

Arsenal Tottenham and newly-rich Newcastle have all been linked with the Wales international.

But Forest are keen to get promotion this season from the Championship.

They are happy to risk it even if it means Johnson running down his contract and entering the final year.

And sources close to the deal also reveal Johnson would rather wait to see if an even bigger team came in for him amid reported interest from Arsenal and Tottenham.

The Fortress) in Dalworthington Gardens Texas. Check out the one-and-a-half-minute video below.

Back in February 2015 as part of Guitar World's coverage of the tenth anniversary of the guitarist's tragic death the magazine was invited into Dimebag's home and recording studio — and they got to bring their cameras. Guitar World's exclusive video tour which can also be found below offered a private look at Dimebag's impressive guitar collection not to mention his home memorabilia kitchen bathrooms and a lot more.

Abbott one of the most beloved and respected musicians in hard rock was shot onstage during a DAMAGEPLAN concert on December 8 2004 at the Alrosa Villa club in Columbus Ohio by a 25-year-old ex-Marine named Nathan Gale. Gale murdered a total of four people and wounded three others before being killed himself by police officer James D. Niggemeyer who arrived on the scene minutes after Gale began his rampage.

According to The Pulse Of Radio Gale seemed to deliberately target Abbott leading to speculation that the young man who had a history of mental illness held a grudge against Abbott and his brother drummer Vinnie Paul for the break-up of PANTERA in 2002. Columbus police closed their investigation in October of 2005 without establishing a motive for the shootings.

Abbott and Paul formed PANTERA in the mid-Eighties in Texas. The band recorded four independent albums before their 1990 major label debut ""Cowboys From Hell"" introduced a heavier sound and made them a favorite with metal fans. 1994's ""Far Beyond Driven"" debuted at No. 1 on The Billboard 200 without benefit of a commercial hit single.

The group splintered in 2002 following the departure of volatile lead singer Philip Anselmo. Dime and Vinnie as they were known to their fans regrouped with DAMAGEPLAN releasing the band's debut album ""New Found Power"" in February of 2004. The group was touring in support of the record at the time of the shootings.

Abbott's death was a devastating blow to the close-knit hard rock and metal community. He was known to his fellow musicians for his hospitality friendship and partying spirit and was a legend among fans and peers for his powerful innovative and unmistakable playing style.

Vinnie Paul died in June 2018 at the age of 54 in his sleep at his home in Las Vegas. The official cause of death was dilated cardiomyopathy an enlarged heart as well as severe coronary artery disease. He was buried next to his brother and their mother Carolyn at Moore Memorial Gardens cemetery in Arlington Texas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvYW1lcmljYXMvdXMtcG9saXRpY3MvdGV4YXMtZ3JlZy1hYmJvdHQtYm9yZGVyLXdhbGwtaW1taWdyYXRpb24tYjE5ODIzNjIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas governor using millions in taxpayer funds for Trump-like border wall project,"Sign up for the daily Inside Washington email for exclusive US coverage and analysis sent to your inbox Get our free Inside Washington email Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers events and updates from The Independent.

The governor of Texas is directing nearly $40m in additional public funds for projects related to his desire to finish former president Donald Trump’s aborted wall along the US-Mexico border.

Governor Greg Abbott on Friday said the Lone Star State has begun construction on roughly $38m worth of state-funded sections of border barriers built on state-owned land. The barriers which are built by the same materials and methods as Mr Trump’s border barrier using the same contractor purportedly fill in gaps in the barriers constructed on federal land during the Trump administration.

In September Mr Abbott signed legislation allocating nearly $2bn towards various purported border security projects with $750m going to barrier construction in addition to a quarter-billion approved last summer as part of another $1.05bn border appropriations bill.

Mr Abbott and other Republicans frequently claim President Joe Biden has enacted an “open border” policy because he stopped construction of the border barrier — a pet project of Mr Trump and his hardline immigration adviser Stephen Miller — and has tried to reverse Trump-era policies meant to make it more difficult for nonwhite migrants from South and Central America to claim asylum in the United States a right guaranteed under both US and international law.

On Friday Mr Abbott retweeted a Fox News reporter’s tweet sharing photos of the state-funded barrier along with the comment: “Biden allows open border policies and refuses to enforce laws passed by Congress to secure the border and enforce immigration laws”.

“Texas is stepping up to do the federal government’s job” he added.

In reality neither Mr Biden nor his administration advocate for an “open borders” policy but the term has long been used by Republicans to describe any immigration policy under which nonwhite immigrants are permitted to claim asylum after reaching American territory.

Mr Abbott has also enacted other policies which purport to enforce federal immigration law —something he as a state official has no jurisdiction over — including using state law enforcement to arrest asylum seekers for trespassing so they can be jailed.

In July the Department of Justice sued Mr Abbott and the state of Texas after he signed an order directing the Texas Department of Public Safety to stop vehicles suspected of carrying migrants and turn them back towards the US-Mexico border.

Earlier this month more than 100 immigrant and civil rights groups filed a 50-page complaint asking Attorney General Merrick Garland to intervene to end Mr Abbott’s migrant trespassing arrest policy by cutting off a significant portion of Texas’ federal funds.

Led by the American Civil Liberties Union the groups have accused Texas of creating “what is in reality a system of state immigration enforcement that targets Black and Brown– primarily Latinx– individuals for prosecution and enhanced punishment”.

“Texas has created a separate criminal prosecution and detention system for these individuals with separate criminal dockets separate public defender assignments separate jails (converted state prisons) and even a separate “criminal migrant processing facility” for booking. This separate system is riddled with civil rights violations including failure to appoint counsel failure to timely file charges and even the unilateral replacement of judges” they wrote.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9maW5hbmNlL25ld3MvZ2xvYmFsZm91bmRyaWVzLWdhaW5zLWFtZC1leHBhbmRzLW9yZGVyLTA1MzAzOTA5OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GlobalFoundries Gains as AMD Expands Order for Silicon Wafers,"By Dhirendra Tripathi

Investing.com – Globalfoundries stock (NASDAQ:GFS) traded about 1% higher in Monday’s premarket after Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) its former parent and still a key client expanded the size of a previous order to buy more silicon wafers from the company and for a longer period.

AMD whose own share price was up 0.6% in premarket trading will now buy about $2.1 billion of silicon wafers from GlobalFoundries through 2025 under an amended agreement according to a regulatory filing Thursday.

The enhanced order comes as shortage of chips refuses to go away – largely owing to shift to a digital ecosystem accelerated by Covid-19. With existing supplies stretched as the pandemic rages and new capacities taking time it’s a seller’s market that AMD is trying to capitalize on.

AMD was previously going to buy $1.6 billion worth of wafers between 2022 and 2024 meaning a 30% expeansion. Wafers are the large discs of silicon on which computer chips are made.

GlobalFoundries which was spun off from AMD in 2009 also counts Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) as major customers. It re-listed on the Nasdaq in October.

Last month Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) picked AMD chips to go into its data centers. AMD having proven itself as a worthy competition to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is now taking on larger rivals such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in supercomputing markets.

The Mount Hermon area resident said the frequency of outages has become worse the last year or so and she has had to purchase a generator.

“What really bothers me is how often these are happening” Abbott said Tuesday. “It almost never happened in the past unless there was a big storm or something. Now it’s happening on pleasant days with nothing that might be causing it due to weather.”

When she was contacted Tuesday morning by the Danville Register & Bee Abbott’s power had just come back on after being out for 45 minutes.

“I was at my mailbox and heard a crackle in the line over my head...” she said of the moment when her power went out. “This was the third time in about a month.”

Abbott’s outage that morning came just three days after another that occurred while American Electric Power was performing maintenance on its system. Danville Utilities stopped receiving power from one of its delivery points from AEP and several substations went offline for nearly 30 minutes as a result.

“It certainly did affect a lot of people” said Danville Utilities Director Jason Grey.

The city’s West Fork delivery point project will help prevent situations like the one that arose Dec. 18 Grey said. Danville Utilities’ fourth Appalachian Power delivery point will be constructed in Brosville and should be complete in 2023.

“That delivery point has been in conceptual design” Grey said. “We’re looking at buying property for it. If we had that project up and running we would have had another delivery point that would have prevented what happened [Dec. 18].”

Danville City Council voted in July to buy 42.85 acres next to the West Fork electric substation for $180000 to expand the substation’s footprint in Brosville and add a fourth Appalachian Power delivery point.

The purchase would allow a new Appalachian Power transmission line and substation at the property.

The West Fork substation sits on about five acres on Long Circle off U.S. 58.

Danville Utilities’ existing delivery points for Appalachian Power are off Kentuck Road at Riverside Drive and Arnett Boulevard and at the Danville Utilities location at Monument Street.

Danville Utilities distributes electricity to about 42000 customer locations in a 500-square-mile service territory covering Danville the southern third of Pittsylvania County and small portions of Henry and Halifax counties. It also provides natural gas water wastewater and telecommunications services in Danville.

Appalachian Power’s transmission line would be a 138-kilovolt line and the substation would include a control building several breakers and metering equipment.

Danville Utilities operates 17 substations.

The recent delivery point issue occurred at the Riverside substation at Riverside Drive and Arnett Boulevard.

Riverside substation is a vital part of Danville Utilities that serves about a quarter of the city’s customers.

One of the current three delivery points for the city’s system it provides power to almost 10000 customers on both sides of the Dan River.

The Riverside substation sends power to customers in neighborhoods bounded by Guilford Street to the north the Old West End neighborhood to the south Piney Forest Road to the west and the King Memorial Bridge to the east.

It also feeds substations areas of the county including those in Brosville Whitmell and Mount Hermon.

The substation was upgraded in the summer of 2020. The project cost about $6 million and involved the replacement of all of the substation’s three transformers switches circuit breakers and other aging equipment. Before the improvements a lot of the equipment dated back to substation’s construction in the 1960s.

The outages

As for power outages Westover Drive area resident Cindi Fisher has experienced power outages at her Fox Hollow home five times recently.

“Power outages seem to have increased over the time I have lived in this part of the city” Fisher said adding that she has resided in Fox Hollow for more than 10 years.

Some of her neighbors have bought standby generators she said.

In addition to the loss of electricity that occurred Dec. 18 three short outages happened at Fisher’s home on the morning of Dec. 12 she said.

“In total it was not out that long but it caused a power surge in my house that killed my modem” Fisher said.

She called her internet provider and had her modem replaced at the city’s expense she said.

Fisher also lost electricity the first week of this month while she was at work.

“Power outages are not new to the Westover area but there are no weather-related events that caused any of the outages at my house this month” she said.

Before the outages became more common for Fisher’s neighborhood she felt like she and her neighbors were lucky to be spared when most of the Westover area was without power. But that has changed.

“Now I find it more of a nuisance” she said.

Isolated problems

Grey said the city has had more isolated outages because of fallen trees or animals such as squirrels or birds making contact with power lines.

“Not all outages are caused by us” Grey said. “They’re caused by Mother Nature. We’re here to react to that and do what we can to prevent them going forward.”

The city has performed a lot of right-of-way maintenance — such as tree-trimming — over the past several years to reduce incidents but birds and squirrels can still climb and fly onto poles and lines Grey said.

Car wrecks also have caused outages when poles are struck including one that occurred Wednesday morning and shut down power in part of Danville Utilities’ service area Grey said.

“That seems to happen a lot more than I think it should” he said. “A lot of customers don’t realize how many vehicle accidents we have.”

Substations

As for new substations projects were completed at Kentuck in October and at Whitmell last week Grey said.

Crews have now moved on to building new substations at Westover off Woodlawn Drive and at Southside near Danville Community College Grey said.

Westover and Southside serve about 5600 and 3400 customers respectively.

The Westover substation serves a vast area including Dry Fork the Berry Hill Road area and parts of Danville.

Southside covers the area from West Main Street and at Averett University in Danville heading south in the Grove Park area Southwyck Druid Hills and Stratford Place to the North Carolina line.

The Westover substation was built in 1975 and Southside’s substation was built in 1972.

Those projects are expected to be complete by next summer Grey said.

Newer equipment and increasing redundancy having dual transformers at a substation improves reliability he said. Dual transformers will be at Westover and Southside substations as part of their projects enabling the electrical load to be evenly split among the transformers and moved from one transformer to another whenever there is an issue."

Diversity equity and inclusion principles remain an important part of marcomms hiring and staff management worldwide so it’s only natural that many of the key hires from agencies involved leaders who can help bring about more change.

Globally we continued to see more diversity officers and DEI heads appointed such as Nancy Lengthorn at MediaCom Natasha O’Dell Archer at Golin and Vanessa Vining at VaynerX.

And this year we began to see some networks invest in regional roles. Dentsu International appointed Rashmi Vikram formerly group diversity and inclusivity practice lead at Microsoft as its chief equity officer in APAC.

Mediabrands meanwhile brought in global inclusion and diversity (I&D) specialist Dharesheni Nedumaran from Swire to a newly-created role as head of diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) across Asia-Pacific.

In Asia-Pacific both Facebook and Google were on the hunt to fill their regional Singapore-based head of agency positions as Neil Stewart and Joanna Flint both left their roles within Facebook and Google respectively. Flint later resurfaced as the new chief commercial officer at Mandarin Oriental with Google hiring former Singapore Press Holdings executive Linda Lim as its new APAC agency business lead. Stewart’s replacement at Facebook meanwhile was the surprise hiring of former Wunderman Thompson and Digitas APAC CEO Annette Male.

So when it was announced in January that Mohan was stepping down after 25 years with Havas it was decided that India would report directly to global HQ while Southeast Asia and North Asia remits have been handed over to Havas Group’s growth markets leader Alberto Canteli Suarez based in Dubai. Already in charge of markets in the Nordics Central Europe and Eastern Europe including Russia and the Middle East Canteli is now cramming even more diverse markets into his remit such as Singapore Japan Korea Malaysia Philippines Indochina Indonesia and Vietnam. Mohan has since set up his own holding company invested in a Philippines-based agency and recently announced he would lead APAC expansion for Amsterdam-based agency Dept.

In another significant shift this year Karl Wu co-chairman and CEO of Havas Group Greater China is to take over the management of the region after current chairman Mason Lin announced his plan to retire at the end of 2021 after 30 years with the company.



5. APAC CMO power lost

Out: YoeGin Chang Lynette Pang David Porter Mary Zhou Freddie Covington Jaskaran Singh Kapany Wonhong Cho Sukhleen Aneja

Promoted: Eugene Lee Danielle Jin

L to R: YoeGin Chang; Lynette Pang David Porter Mary Zhou



2021 was also a big year for CMO changes notably affecting the composition of Campaign Asia's Power List of the 50 most influential marketers. This year several CMOs from the class of 2020 switched jobs and therefore did not make it into this year's list: Wonhong Cho was replaced at Hyundai Motor; Jaskaran Singh Kapany quit as Paytm's CMO to join Xiaomi as head of marketing in India; and Frederique Covington Corbett was promoted to a global at Visa allowing Danielle Jin Visa's VP and head of marketing for Greater China to replace her on the list in 2021.

Meanwhile our 2021 Power List has lost some heavyweights as well. Unilever media chief David Porter is set to retire in 2022 Chang Chee Pey is replacing Lynette Pang as STB's marketing head NTUC Income's Marcus Chew is replacing Mary Zhou as Lazada CMO and YoeGin Chang has left SK-II for a global role at La Mer. Meanwhile Eugene Lee at McDonald's has bolstered his standing with a promotion to Asia CMO.



4. A PAC of leadership changes

Out: Stephen Li Luke Nathans Ben Poole Annette Male

Promoted: Adrian Farouk

Reassigned: Alex Lubar Avery Akkineni

Clockwise from top left: Luke Nathans Stephen Li Avery Akkineni Alex Lubar Annette Male Adrian Farouk



At the APAC leadership level this year we saw several notable reshuffles. One of the major ones was at McCann where APAC chief Alex Lubar was moved to lead North America passing APAC oversight on to Ghassan Harfouche's MENA/Turkey remit. In a similar vein Wunderman Thompson also saw APAC oversight passed outside the region to EMEA's Ewen Sturgeon following Annette Male's departure.

On the media side the most signicant departure this year saw veteran regional leader Stephen Li step down as the APAC chief of OMD. Mediabrands also made a couple of changes including hiring James Smyllie as APAC president of Initiative and replacing Ben Poole at Reprise (who later joined You&Mr Jones' Fifty-five). Meanwhile at VaynerMedia Tim Lindley was promoted to the APAC MD role as Avery Akkineni returned to the US after launching the agency in APAC two years ago.

Other regional changes saw Iris APAC chief Luke Nathans leave after 12 years and Digitas' Adrian Farouk promoted to APAC CEO.



3. Out of Sight out of Mindshare

Out and about: Amrita Randhawa

In: Helen McRae

L to R: Amrita Randhawa Helen McRae



One of the year's most impactful moves saw long-serving Mindshare chief Amrita Randhawa jump ship to join Publicis Groupe as CEO for Southeast Asia. Randhawa had been Mindshare's APAC CEO and its executive chair for Greater China since early 2018 prior to which she was the agency's Greater China CEO.

With the move Publicis Groupe became home to arguably two of the most respected female leaders to emerge in the region in recent years with Randhawa's SEA role mirroring Jane Lin-Baden's position as North Asia CEO (Lin-Baden is also managing partner APAC).

Just prior to Randhawa's announced move Mindshare appointed a dedicated China CEO Benjamin Condit and Greater China executive chair Linda Lin two roles Randhawa had managed since she was promoted to APAC CEO in 2018.

By late July the GroupM agency announced its APAC CEO replacement in Australian Helen McRae who had been serving as Mindshare's EMEA and Worldwide Team CEO.



2. Dentsu done soon?

Promoted: Hiroshi Igarashi Jean Lin

Out: Toshihiro Yamamoto Ashish Bhasin Anand Bhadkamkar

Clockwise from top left: Hiroshi Igarashi Toshihiro Yamamoto Anand Bhadkamkar Ashish Bhasin



In recent years Dentsu has come to feature prominently in these annual annals mostly notably in 2019 when it earned the unwelcome moniker of 'Dentsu Aexit Network' due to a veritable purge of regional network leadership. But with Dentsu Aegis Network now relegated to the pages of history and Dentsu's corporate restructuring seemingly wrapped up one might have thought the endless management restructuring at Dentsu might finally be done.

But alas not to be outdone Dentsu once again came through this year with a fresh surge of purge starting in the summer when Dentsu India CEO Anand Bhadkamkar became the latest in a slew of exits in India including Gautam Mehra APAC chief data and product officer; Rubeena Singh CEO of iProspect India; Vivek Bhargava head of Dentsu Performance Group; and Agnello Dias Dentsu India's creative chairman.

In August Jean Lin was appointed an executive officer of Dentsu Group but even bigger changes were afoot. In November another shoe dropped as Dentsu Group announced that after five years as CEO Toshihiro Yamamoto would retire from the role effective January 1 to be succeeded by Hiroshi Igarashi current president and CEO of Dentsu Inc. the company responsible for Dentsu's domestic operations in Japan. In other changes Tim Andree is now slated to retire from an executive role to become non-executive chairman of the board following Dentsu's annual general meeting in this coming March. Another notable change saw Norihiro Kuretani step into the role of president and CEO of Dentsu Japan Network from the position of director executive vice president of Dentsu Inc.

Meanwhile the moves coincided with the retirement of Ashish Bhasin as Dentsu APAC CEO and India chairman. The Indian operations of the agency will be handled by Peter Huijboom global CEO media and global clients. The APAC business will be handled by Simon Jones APAC CFO and Belli Mathanda APAC COO.



1. The great resignation

Out: Those wanting more freedom and flexibility in work-life balance



While employee attrition has always been an industry bugbear Covid not only 'forced' people to work from home but also to re-examine their lives and workplace values. And in the process many came to the conclusion that grinding out late office hours was not what they wanted in life so they sought more control over their careers. The result was 'The Great Resignation' a raft of departures from marketing jobs at agencies and brands in favour of freelance opportunities and more flexible arrangements.

This phenomenon is undoubtedly the year's biggest and most significant exit for not only leaders but talent throughout the marketing industry.

If you don't have Publisher you can use LibraOffice Draw CorelDraw or other programs that support the .pub format.

It may also be possible to use Zamzar to convert the .pub file you want to open to another more user-friendly file format.

The easiest way to open a .pub file is with Microsoft Publisher the program it was created in. If you don't have MS Publisher there are a few others ways you can open a .pub file.

Ways to View PUB Files Without Microsoft Publisher

When you have a Microsoft Publisher document but don't have access to Publisher there are tools viewers and shortcuts that open .pub files created by Microsoft Publisher. LibreOffice Draw part of the open-source LibreOffice suite is a good tool that can open Publisher files.

Most of the time it's better to convert a Publisher file to another more universal format. There are several methods you can use to create a shareable Publisher file. PDF is always a great choice but prior to Publisher 2010 there is no built-in PDF export feature n Microsoft Publisher.

When the content rather than the layout is of primary importance (and no graphics are needed) the best way to exchange information is as plain ASCII text. But when you want to include graphics and wish to preserve your layout plain text won't do.

Use Microsoft Publisher to Create a File to Share

To share Publisher 2000 (or above) files with users of Publisher 98 save the file in Pub 98 format.

Create Printable Files From Publisher Documents

Send the recipient a file that they can print to their desktop printer. They won't be able to view it onscreen but they can get a fairly accurate printout. Several methods are available although each method may have drawbacks.

Save the File in PostScript Format

To create a .ps file go to the File menu select Save As then select the Save as type drop-down arrow and choose PostScript. This method is usually used to prepare files for commercial printing. If the recipient has a PostScript capable printer they can print the file.

Save the Publisher Document as an EPS File

Normally used for commercial printing an EPS file can be opened in many graphics programs. An EPS file must be opened in another program (such as PageMaker or QuarkXPress) to be printed. A separate EPS file is made for each page in the publication.

To create an EPS file in Publisher go to File > Print then in the Print dialog box select Print Setup > Properties. Choose Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) as the PostScript output format. To print each page one at a time select Print to file.

Print a Publisher Document to a PRN File

When printing the publication select the Print to file check box. Instead of printing to the printer Publisher creates a PRN file. The recipient uses the DOS Copy command to send the file to their desktop printer (from the DOS PROMPT type copy filename.prn lpt1 or lpt2 depending on where the printer is located).

If your printer doesn't match that of the recipient the PRN file may not print exactly as you envisioned. If you exchange files regularly with a recipient obtain a copy of the print driver for their printer and use it to create the PRN file from Publisher.

Create HTML Files (Web Pages) From Publisher Files

Convert your Publisher document to an HTML file then either post the file on the web and send recipients the address to view the files or send the HTML file to the recipient for them to view offline in a web browser.

If you send the files include all the graphics as well and set up the file so that all HTML and graphics reside in the same directory. This way the recipient can place the files anywhere on their hard drive.

Or take the HTML code that Publisher creates and send an HTML-format email. The procedure to send an HTML email depends on your email client. How the HTML email is received by the recipient depends on what email client they use (and if they accept HTML-formatted email).

Create PDF Files From Publisher Documents

Convert your Publisher document to the Adobe PDF format. Publisher versions before Publisher 2007 don't have a PDF export option. Instead use a program such as Adobe Acrobat Distiller.

To create the PDF file create a PostScript file then use Adobe Acrobat to create the PDF file. The recipient will be able to view the document on-screen or print it. However the recipient must have the Adobe Acrobat Reader (it's free) installed. There are also some printer drivers and software available that create PDF files from most Windows applications.

Pixabay

In Publisher 2007 and 2010 save the Publisher file as a PDF from the program to send it to anyone who has software (including the free Acrobat Reader) that can open or view PDF files.

How to Use a PUB File If You Don't Have Publisher

When you have a file in the natural Publisher format (.pub) but don't have access to Microsoft Publisher you have a couple of options.

Get a Trial Version of Publisher

You'll get the entire Office Suite along with a free trial version of the latest Publisher. Use it to open and view your file.

Convert Publisher Files to Other Software Formats

It may be possible to convert a PUB file into the natural format of another desktop publishing software. Check the import options in the software of your choice to see if it accepts PUB files (and which version of PUB file). PDF2DTP is a plugin that converts Publisher files to InDesign.

When using an application such as PDF2DTP some elements of the file may not convert as expected.

Another option is to use an online conversion site such as Zamzar to convert PUB files to PDF and other formats. Currently Zamzar converts PUB files to these formats:

DOC : Microsoft Word document

: Microsoft Word document HTML : Hypertext Markup Language

: Hypertext Markup Language MP3 : Compressed audio file

: Compressed audio file ODT : OpenDocument spreadsheet

: OpenDocument spreadsheet PCX : Paintbrush bitmap image

: Paintbrush bitmap image PDF : Portable document format

: Portable document format PNG : Portable network graphic

: Portable network graphic PS : PostScript

: PostScript RTF : Rich text format

: Rich text format TXT: Text document

Another online PDF conversion tool Office/Word to PDF also converts PUB files. Upload up to a 5 MB file for conversion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzYXQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMS8xMi8yNS9nZW9yZ2Utc3RyYWl0cy1leGNsdXNpdmUtZG9taW5pb24tZXN0YXRlLWhhcy1vZmZpY2lhbGx5LWJlZW4tc29sZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After four years George Strait's exclusive Dominion estate has officially been sold,"SAN ANTONIO – George Strait’s Dominion compound has officially been sold after being on the market for four years according to the listing on Realtor.com.

The property located in a guard-gated neighborhood at 10 Davenport Lane was previously listed at $7.5 million but has gone through several price changes since it was listed.

It’s unclear how much the home actually sold for; however according to Mansion Global it was purchased by Shannon Ralston the founder and CEO of Angel Staffing -- a company that services medical facilities statewide.

The home sits on 12.2 acres and is built in the Santa Fe style with imported adobe and 14 hand-sculpted fireplaces.

Despite being almost 8000 square feet it has just three bedrooms but a detached casita offers a fourth bedroom.

According to the listing there are 6 and a half bathrooms and custom-designed features from artist Bill Tull throughout the property.

A Highly-Gendered Crime

That makes sex trafficking a highly gendered crime. Much of its prevalence can be laid at the door of gender inequality says Yasmeen Hassan founder of Equality Now. It’s women and girls who are more vulnerable economically and socially and it’s men who have increasingly normalized the buying of female bodies for sex.

In Hassan’s experience efforts to combat sex trafficking need to be combined with efforts to combat gender inequality. Since its founding in 1992 Equality Now has been using the law to end gender-based violence and discrimination including sex trafficking.

The organization has had its share of success. Equality Now has played an important role in changing more than 50 sex discriminatory laws – including those allowing rape child marriage and so-called “honor” killings.

A Highly Lucrative Crime

In addition to being highly gendered sex trafficking is immensely lucrative – involving an estimated $99 billion a year. In the words of one trafficker: “Why would you traffic in drugs or guns that you can sell only one time when in women and girls you have a commodity that can be sold again and again!”

Hassan has a list of ways in which women and girls end up in the sex trade. A constant in all the situations is the exploitation of women that comes about from their unequal status. These include:

● Sold into prostitution because of poverty

● Deceived into signing contracts for jobs and ending up in sex trade

● Tricked by “boyfriends” and trapped in prostitution

● Trafficked into temporary marriages for sex

● Sold into child marriages or trafficked as sex slaves during times of conflicts or natural disasters

● Advertised and sold on the internet

● Trafficked in organized virginity sales.

Criminalization versus Decriminalization

Hassan notes that traffickers look for opportunities in places where the sex trade is legal. In these cases it’s much easier for the market to flourish.

Sweden Norway Iceland France Canada Northern Ireland and Ireland have decriminalized women and criminalized traffickers. The result? Sex trafficking has been reduced says Hassan.

On the other hand in countries that have legalized commercial sex such as the Netherlands and Germany sex trafficking has increased. The result? There’s also an increase in international sex tourism and local demand.

Hassan notes that in addition to criminalizing traffickers pimps and brothel owners it is essential to address the underlying misogyny and sexism of the “johns” who normalize the purchase of women’s bodies.

Equality Now is working with a diverse range of advocacy groups focusing on poverty addiction homelessness foster care LGBTQI youth to take this agenda forward.

Equality Now is also calling for urgent and collective action to address new threats posed by the misuse of the internet and digital technology. Hassan contends that governments must regulate the digital space to protect against abuse.

The experiences of women who have survived sex trafficking are instructive. Hassan cites the words of a survivor of sex trafficking from India:

“When people tell me that women choose this life I can’t help but laugh. Do they know how many women like me have tried to escape but have been beaten black and blue when they are caught? To the men who buy us we are like meat. To everybody else in society we simply do not exist.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h3b3JtLm5ldC8yMDIxLzExL2ZyZWUtcGhvdG8tZWRpdGluZy1zb2Z0d2FyZS13aW5kb3dzLTExLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Best Free Photo Editing Software For Windows 11 PC & Laptops,"If you are looking for a free photo editing software that can help enhance your photos then you have landed on the right webpage.

How To Do So Is Still Up in the Air,"Governments are taking steps to rein in plastic waste.

But none of what’s been done so far has been up to the challenge of a growing plastics industry fed by consumer demand for more plastic products resulting in a deepening global plastic waste crisis.

As a result there is now an intensifying focus on the possibility of a global treaty to control plastic pollution.

The next milestone in a diplomatic process that began in 2014 could come in February in Nairobi Kenya when the U.N. Environmental Assembly meets to decide if it will endorse the beginning of official negotiations over a plastics treaty.

Those efforts may have received a boost in late November when Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the Biden administration would join the talks. Blinken reversing a position from the Trump administration said the U.S. goal is to “create a tool that we can use to protect our oceans and all of the life that they sustain from growing global harms of plastic pollution.”

The chemical industry and environmental groups alike have welcomed U.S. engagement in formal treaty talks with environmental groups like Greenpeace citing the need for global solutions to a global problem and the chemical industry expressing hope that a treaty could help advance its vision of eliminating plastic waste. Separately the industry has opposed suggestions that there be a cap placed on plastic production.

In backing the treaty process Erin Simon head of plastic waste and business for World Wildlife Fund a conservation group that operates in 100 countries cited a 2020 Pew Charitable Trusts report that said without “immediate ambitious and concerted actions” the world by 2040 would see the annual flow of plastic into the ocean triple to about 29 million metric tons per year the equivalent of 2500 single-use plastic bottles for every meter of ocean beach.

“That would continue to obviously create huge impacts on species through entanglement ingestion and just messing up the ecosystems” Simon said. “It would continue to create issues for coastal communities and local fisheries” placing a significant toll on “public health and vulnerable communities in general who are already disproportionately impacted.”

Devil in the Details

Cities states and entire countries have banned single use plastics like grocery bags and straws. Some 187 nations though not the United States have agreed to restrict international trade in plastic scrap and waste. And Congress in November authorized $350 million for recycling and management of plastic waste including the first funding for the 2020 Save Our Seas 2.0 Act to boost research international cooperation ocean cleanup and waste management.

With a treaty the devil will be in the details and the hard work of getting enough countries to agree on the scope and provisions. Observers say the process could take years.

Conceptually the countries supporting a new plastic treaty seem to be dividing into two schools of thought said Björn Beeler the international coordinator for the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) comprised of more than 600 public interest nongovernmental organizations in 128 countries working to eliminate toxic pollutants.

One school of thought focuses on a “lifecycle” approach that would take into account the impacts of plastics from production to their use and disposal or recycling. It’s led by Rwanda and Peru with support from the European Union and could limit virgin plastic production and control the use of toxic chemicals that are added into plastic products Beeler said.

The other takes a “waste management” approach and would focus more narrowly on strategies to control plastic waste. This orientation has been defined under a draft resolution from Japan he said.

Environmentalists are pushing for restrictions on single use plastics like bags cutlery and straws making plastic producers responsible for plastic waste and enforceable national limits on the flow of plastics into the ocean.

Representatives of the pollutants elimination network said that to be effective any treaty also needs to ban toxic chemical additives in plastics. On Dec. 14 IPEN and another environmental organization seeking to fight plastics pollution International Pellet Watch released two reports that detailed the presence of chemicals found in plastic pellets spilled on beaches and recycled plastic pellets purchased from recycling facilities globally. The groups are working with partner organizations in 35 countries.

Health effects associated with the chemicals include cancer and hormonal effects that can lead to reproductive growth and cognitive impairment according to the reports.

“When you add chemicals to plastics they are not strongly attached” said Sara Brosché an IPEN science advisor and lead author of one of the reports. “So they can leach out. They will slowly move into the household dust” she said. When children put toys in their mouths she added “these chemicals can move out of plastic material” and dissolve in their saliva.

‘Bound up in the Health of Our Oceans’

It’s unclear what specifically the Biden administration wants out of a plastics treaty. But in making his announcement in November Blinken said countries will need to “develop and enforce strong national action plans to address this problem at its source. We recognize that different actors will have different capacities to act but every nation every community and indeed every individual has a role to play.”

He also said “the private sector in particular will need to do more.”

Human health and survival is “bound up in the health of our oceans” Blinken said adding that plastic is sickening and killing ocean animals. “And because plastics absorb toxins when we eat seafood we’re not only consuming microplastics but toxins as well” he said.

IPEN however is concerned that the United States one of the leading plastic producing nations in the world will side with an industry that emphasizes waste management and so-called “advanced” or “chemical” recycling. A National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine report in November concluded that so far chemical or advanced recycling is limited to energy intensive processes used to make fuel or other chemical products rather than new plastics.

“If a treaty promotes waste management and subsidizes chemical recycling which is basically plastic fuels waste-to-energy or building up waste management facilities then you begin to subsidize with public funds the responsibility of the private sector that’s making this product” Beeler said.

Industry’s Nod

In the United States the plastics and chemical industries have fought state local and Congressional efforts to ban plastics or cap plastic production. But the American Chemistry Council a major lobbying arm of the chemical industry and one that Beeler described as a “powerful actor in this whole conversation” has given a nod to Blinken’s announcement that the United States would back efforts to work on a global treaty.

“We are supportive of a global agreement among nations that will accelerate a transition to a more circular economy by expanding systems and infrastructure to collect and repurpose plastic resources” said Joshua Baca the American Chemistry Council’s vice president of plastics in a written statement.

Baca said U.S. plastic makers the International Council of Chemical Associations and the World Plastics Council support a treaty framework with principles that include having all nations agree to eliminating plastic waste while providing flexibility to meet the needs of individual nations. They also want widespread access to waste collection along with “recognizing the role plastics play in a lower-carbon future.”

The industry argues that plastics actually reduce emissions blamed for causing global warming for example by making products lighter and easier to transport and because plastic packaging better keeps food fresh longer reducing food waste and methane emissions. For a more sustainable future the Plastics Industry Association says “we need more plastic not less”

The industry’s position on plastics and global warming however runs counter to recent studies that show plastics production and disposal from production to disposal are adding to global greenhouse gas emissions and will only get worse.

The Center for International Environmental Law working with the Environmental Integrity Project FracTracker Alliance and others in 2019 concluded that the plastics’ and petrochemical industries’ worldwide growth plans could make it impossible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius the most challenging benchmark established under the 2015 Paris climate agreement.

The industry’s lifecycle emissions from natural gas extraction to plastics production and disposal was projected to rise to 1.34 billion metric tons per year by 2030 equivalent to the emissions from nearly 300 coal-fired power plants sized at 500-megawatts each the study found.

In October the group Beyond Plastics led by former regional EPA administrator Judith Enck published “The New Coal Plastics and Climate Change” which found that as coal plants close and petrochemical infrastructure expands in the United States the plastics industry’s contribution to climate change will exceed that of coal by 2030.

When the diplomats get together in February those from the United States may also find backing for strong action in the National Academies report which concluded that the United States the largest producer of plastic waste needs a comprehensive strategy by the end of 2022 to curb its devastating impacts on ocean health and marine wildlife. It offered several overarching recommendations including a national cap on the production of virgin plastic.

A Call for the Treaty

A mix of businesses some of which have been under withering pressure because of their use of single-use plastic packaging or bottles are joining the call for a treaty.

The World Wildlife Fund with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and Boston Consulting Group in 2020 published a “Business Case for a UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution.” The report observed that “many companies are facing increased reputational risks” from their use of plastics threatening their customer bases as well as their ability to attract employees. The report also noted that it was “no longer a question of whether regulation is coming but what regulation is coming.”

Regulations already on the books vary so much from jurisdiction to jurisdiction—including bans against plastic bans—that it has become “increasingly difficult for businesses to navigate the maze of heterogeneous regulations at global national and even subnational levels” according to the report.

The three organizations have a “manifesto” now backed by dozens of businesses acknowledging that plastic “plays an important role in our lives and brings many benefits” but that “mounting evidence shows this problem will continue to grow unless we fundamentally rethink the way we produce use reuse and dispose of plastic.” So far about 90 companies have signed on including financial institutions producers retailers and brand owners such as Fidelity International Sodexo Coca Cola and Procter & Gamble.

There has also been a series of summits this year about a plastics treaty between activists and industry representatives organized by The Ocean Plastics Leadership Network a 90-member group assisted by World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace that is working “not to achieve consensus but understanding and hopefully new ideas and collaborations” according to its website.

While a treaty could be years away Simon with the World Wildlife Fund said she expects there could be progress along the way in part because the process will further reveal the problems with plastic waste and potential solutions.

Because urgent action is needed she said “I’m going to be less caught up in how long it’s going to take and more about if the right topics are being discussed to signal the actions I need to see.”

ORLANDO Fla. — If you’re planning to rent a home in central Florida over New Year’s Eve you may be out of luck.

Airbnb says potential guests without a history of positive reviews will be unable to make one-night reservations in Orlando and Kissimmee over New Year’s Eve in an effort to crackdown on disruptive parties.

Some people also will be unable to make last-minute two-or-three-night reservations over the New Year’s holiday in central Florida if they don’t have any positive reviews as determined by the company’s algorithms.

Users with a history of positive reviews don’t have to worry about those restrictions.

These restrictions for New Year's Eve are part of a larger worldwide effort by the vacation rental company to ""crackdown on disruptive parties held at the short-term rental homes"" The Associated Press reports.

During the Halloween weekend Airbnb put a party ban in place to prevent ""unauthorized and large parties.""

Last year was the first time the company tried this initiative AP explains. 1200 rentals in Orlando and 750 rentals in Kissimmee were blocked.

On a larger scale 243000 rentals were reportedly blocked around the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL25ldy15b3JrLzIwMjEvMTIvMjUvd2Fja2llc3QtYWlyYm5iLWxpc3RpbmdzLW9mLXRoZS15ZWFyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wackiest Airbnb Listings of the Year,"Airbnbs are not only a convenient place for lodging when taking a trip–some can also be an experience in themselves.

The publication Confused.com recently came out with a roll call of the wackiest and weirdest listings on the site as rounded up by the New York Post. The collection spans the United States and beyond and emphasizes one-of-a-kind offerings.

“There’s a lot more interest from holidaymakers in finding a unique stay” Confused.com’s Jessica Willock told the Post.

Topping the publication’s rankings is the Campera Hotel in Mexico also known as the Bubble Suite. Travelers can stay in the bubble-like shelters for $215 per night enjoying a semi-outdoor experience akin to glamping–each of the dozen bubbles has a private bathroom and full-sized bed.

The runner-up position belongs to the Dreamy Tropical Tree House in Hawaii. The treehouse has a 360-degree view of the surrounding tropical jungle and won’t break the bank at $300 per night. Unfortunately only the most thorough planners will be able to stay at the treehouse as there are no bookings available until January … 2023.

Another treehouse cracks the list as the most expensive property included. The Treehouse Blue Mountains in Australia can set guests back as much as $1685 per night (though bookings are currently going for half that). For the price guests will be surrounded by 600 acres of private wilderness including the Blue Mountains rainforest.

On the opposite end of the pricing spectrum is Cabana Floripa in Brazil. The unique listing has walls built from recycled bottles and guests can rest on repurposed furniture. The eco-friendly listing can be booked for as little as $21 per night.

As travelers try to escape from their own homes the rise of unique listings on Airbnb is only likely to grow.

“Weird is the word for holiday hunters in 2021 with demand increasing across many of the biggest countries” Confused.com wrote in its report. “After seeing the same four walls for much of 2020 it looks like people are keener than ever to say somewhere strange.”

Welcome to our WrestlingINC.com Live WWE SmackDown Viewing Party. Tonight's show comes from the Allstate Arena near Chicago IL.

- The Christmas Eve edition of WWE SmackDown on FOX opens up with a look back at how WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns fired Paul Heyman last week and was then attacked by Brock Lesnar.

- A somewhat disheveled Paul Heyman is backstage with Kayla Braxton now in an interview that is billed as recorded earlier today. Kayla says it's been one week since Heyman was fired publicly by WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns She asks him what happened.

Heyman says what happened was he told the truth to Reigns a truth Reigns didn't want to hear publicly. He was fired publicly because he told the truth. Smashed in the face publicly. Heyman goes on and says he paid a price for telling the truth. Kayla asks if he regrets telling the truth. Heyman thinks about it and says no because his role as special counsel was to tell Reigns these uncomfortable truths to not just protect Reigns as a personality or IP but as champion.

Heyman says when he came back from the ring he had to explain this to Reigns but all his suits bags and belongings were tossed from Reigns' locker room suite into the hallway like he's some rookie. Heyman says his role was to protect the title and make no mistake about it Reigns is the greatest Universal Champion of all-time but he needs to be protected from Brock Lesnar.

Kayla asks Heyman what's next. He takes a sip of water and says he doesn't know. What does he do now? Go to WWE NXT scout a top talent and start all over again? Not at this stage. He put every bit of his heart soul and spirit into being Reigns' special counsel because he believes in Reigns and without that maybe it's time for Heyman to acknowledge that his career is most likely over.

- We're live on tape from the Allstate Arena in Rosemont IL as Michael Cole welcomes us to the Christmas Eve edition of SmackDown. He's joined at ringside by Pat McAfee. Cole thanks everyone for tuning in on Christmas Eve and says it wouldn't be Christmas without the traditional Miracle on 34th Street Fight. The New Day and Drew McIntyre will face SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Usos and Madcap Moss. They also plug tonight's 12 Days of Christmas Gauntlet to determine the new #1 contender to WWE Intercontinental Champion Shinsuke Nakamura.

Google is burying the little smart speaker and it looks like it's finally ending the Google Home era. We look back at the development of Google's smart home division.



With the Google Home product line the search engine provider brought smart speakers into the homes of its customers for the first time in 2017. The Google Assistant became a household helper and controlled the entire smart home on demand. With the Google Home Mini the last home speaker is now disappearing from the virtual store shelves. Time for a little look back at Google's smart home brand.

Google Home: The answer to Alexa

Four years ago Google introduced Google Assistant with its Google Home smart WiFi speakers at its in-house I/O trade show. The smart speaker was the answer to Amazon's voice assistant Alexa (Guide) which launched a year earlier on the first Echo smart speaker.

In addition to playing music the Google Home could be used to control smart gadgets connected via Wi-Fi thermostats robotic vacuum cleaners or the lights in the house. Since then Google Assistant answers all kinds of questions sets timers makes calls or reminds of important appointments.

Google Assistant: Eternal runner-up in the Smart Home

Two built-in microphones should hear voice commands from all over the home - as long as they are preceded by the activation words ""Ok Google"" and later ""Hey Google"". According to Google only the last second is recorded. If the microphones of the Google Home hear the activation word in this time span the voice assistant reacts and saves the following voice interaction on the Google servers.

Even then the recording of ambient noise alarmed data protectionists and users alike. The skepticism has probably not really prevailed because the market for voice assistance is growing: According to a study 52 percent of German online users now use a voice assistant at least once a week.

In the battle between Alexa vs. Siri vs. Google Assistant Amazon is ahead at least in the smart speaker segment. Google Assistant is preferably used on mobile devices.

Amazon has always taken more risks when developing new smart speakers and smart displays offering a wide range of different devices and also likes to experiment occasionally. The Echo Show 10s display automatically rotates and tracks users during video calls. A few weeks ago Amazon unveiled its first Alexa robot.

Nest Labs incorporation ushers in end of Google Home brand

Google seemed to be more focused on the basics in the beginning. At the launch of Google Home there was a medium a large and a small smart speaker. However Google Home and Google Home Max disappeared relatively soon after smart home specialist Nest Labs Inc. was incorporated into Google's hardware division in 2018.

With the Nest incorporation more smart-home products should follow. It kicked off with the Nest Smart Thermostat. It was with this class of devices that Nest Labs made its name in the first place in 2011. Nest thermostats learn and adjust the room temperature to the preferences of its users.

Google invested in the company back then and would eventually acquire it outright in early 2014. 3.2 billion US dollars were due. Until its incorporation in 2018 Nest Labs was an independent subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.

Google Nest: new product line replaces Google Home

A year later Google announced a new smart home brand Google Nest and released the new Nest Audio and Nest Mini smart speakers shortly after. 2019 saw the launch of Google's first smart home which received a successor with sleep analytics in the form of the Google Nest Hub 2 this spring.

The Google Home name would gradually disappear. The devices have since been given away on and off as freebies for YouTube Premium subscriptions flogged off in discount promotions or offered in a two-pack for the price of one. Today there are only remnants. With the Google Home Mini the last smart speaker from Google's US web store is now disappearing and with it the brand name that brought Google Assistant into our living rooms.

The chain has made significant updates to its menu as well as customer-facing technology. But perhaps most importantly the fast-food giant has also achieved several major milestones by becoming America's second-largest burger chain by sales as well as a top-three destination for fast-food breakfast.

Here are some of the biggest changes taking place at Wendy's in 2021. And for more on Wendy's check out We Tried Every Burger at Wendy's & This Is the Best.

Became America's #2 burger chain

Thanks to the strong sales Wendy's posted in 2020 the chain has dethroned Burger King from the #2 spot taking its place as the second-largest burger chain in America in terms of sales according to Forbes. Wendy's success seems even more staggering when you consider that it operates thousands of locations fewer than BK.

Banned harmful chemicals from its products

Wendy's announced a huge upgrade to its food packaging this year. The chain's 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report included a commitment to rid its food packaging of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) a class of man-made substances that have been shown to have a harmful effect on human health. The company said it will ""fully eliminate"" PFAS in the U.S. and Canada by the end of 2021.

Announced major expansion plans

The chain made the huge announcement that it will be opening a whopping 1200 new locations by 2025. Interestingly not all of those locations will be regular Wendy's restaurants. In fact 700 of them are going to be opening in the form of ghost kitchens according to executives. These locations will grow Wendy's global footprint by a third and especially help to serve the urban communities without the expense of opening additional restaurants.

Made an important upgrade to fries

Every fast-food fan knows that fries are an essential side so making sure they are as good as they can be should be of the utmost importance. Wendy's took itself to task on this by launching new and improved Hot & Crispy Fries this summer. The new spuds are engineered to keep their crunch and heat for up to 30 minutes after purchase which means no more cold or soggy fries from Wendy's—it's an actual guarantee.

Discontinued the Pub line menu items

The chain began to phase out its Pub line items—the Pretzel Bacon Pub Cheeseburger Pretzel Bacon Pub chicken sandwiches and the Pub fries—sometime this year. The Pub menu was first introduced in September of 2020 as part of the chain's premium Made to Crave offering. And while the Pretzel Bun will be missed the chain promptly replaced the Pub line with the Big Bacon Cheddar cheeseburger and chicken sandwich.

Discontinued the Spicy Sriracha sauce

This discontinuation was definitely upsetting to many Wendy's lovers. Over the summer the burger chain debuted the Ghost Pepper Ranch Sauce and unfortunately that didn't come without consequences. Adding this new spicy sauce to their list of signature sauces meant the retirement of the beloved Spicy Sriracha sauce.

Partnered with Google on big tech upgrades

This fall Wendy's announced a new partnership with tech giant Google. The move will allow the chain to speed up its service while also making the customer experience more personalized. Wendy's will begin using Alphabet Inc.'s Google Cloud to utilize a vast pool of customer data it collected during the pandemic via its mobile app. On top of that it will onboard new AI capabilities to predict customers' tastes and order preferences.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Opened its 1000th international restaurant

Wendy's made its debut in the United Kingdom in June and its 1000th location happens to also be the fourth restaurant it is opening in that market—located in Croydon a town south of London. But it was mostly its major expansion in Canada where it recently opened its 400th restaurant and the APMEA region (Asia Pacific Middle East and Africa) where it has as many as 300 locations that has gotten it to this important milestone.

But it was mostly its major expansion in Canada where it recently opened its 400th restaurant and the APMEA region (Asia Pacific Middle East and Africa) where it has as many as 300 locations that has gotten it to this important milestone.

The new service targets developers who have technical questions about AWS services debating design or deployment issues or preparing for AWS certifications. Users can post questions answers perform full text search while community experts can moderate and validate the content. Users can collect reputation points in different ways for example providing accepted answers and reviewing feedback from other users or obtaining AWS certifications.

Source: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-repost-a-reimagined-qa-experience-for-the-aws-community/

Steve Roberts developer advocate at AWS explains how the service was born:

Over the last four years AWS re:Post has been used internally by AWS employees helping customers with their cloud journeys. Today that same trusted technical guidance becomes available to the entire AWS community.

All active users from the previous AWS Forums have been migrated to the new service as well as the most-viewed content. Anton Babenko AWS community hero and CEO at Betajob would like to have APIs:

How do you ask questions in AWS re:Post if there is no API or Terraform support but you prefer to have ""everything as code""?

Threads from customers who have premium support and do not receive a valid response from the community are escalated to AWS support engineers triggering a support case and making the conversation private. Robin Ford senior delivery manager at Accenture UK writes:

re:Post (Stack Overflow for AWS) will improve the answers side of AWS. Hopefully it will mean information and solutions are shared more widely and also troubleshooting steps easily available rather than logging a support ticket every time.

Niklas Bergius system architect at Panagora questions the similarities with Stack Overflow:

AWS re:Post is obviously a clone of the Stack Overflow Q&A system. Has there been any collaboration or is it just a blatant reimplementation?

The new service is part of the AWS Free Tier and requires an AWS account. Maurice Borgmeier cloud consultant & trainer at tecRacer suggests:

Allow users to sign up independent from AWS accounts. Many contributors have multiple AWS accounts and would like to have an identity they can take with them if they choose to switch employers at some point.

The call came from KBC Advisors. Bergstein was thrilled — and didn't even need to ask who the tenant was.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

KBC a Seattle-based real-estate services company that is little known outside of industry circles is in charge of dealmaking for the nearly $2 trillion tech giant Amazon. The small firm has become synonymous with the goliath retailer which inspires awe in the warehouse business.

""I don't think I'd be very good at my job if I didn't understand who KBC was"" Bergstein said.

In June KBC arranged for Amazon to take all of Bergstein's 360000-square-foot warehouse project Highland Cross which is now under construction. The property is expected to be finished by the end of 2022.

""For us"" Bergstein said ""it was a home run to land a tenant like Amazon.""

Facilities like Highland Cross are the backbone behind Amazon's business serving as the spaces where it stores sorts and ships billions of products to consumers around the country every year. That logistics network became even more essential during the pandemic when much of America turned to online shopping for everything from rapid COVID-19 test kits and laundry detergent to television sets and groceries.

Now the nation's largest online retailer Amazon occupies a portfolio of about 340 million square feet of warehouses across the US according to the logistics-data provider MWPVL International. That's the equivalent of about 6000 football fields. MWPVL calculates the company is in the process of establishing an additional 130 million square feet. That space will make Amazon almost as large as the warehouse portfolios of its retail and logistics rivals Walmart Target UPS and FedEx combined according to MWPVL.

KBC which was founded by the longtime warehouse-leasing executives John Hanson and Todd Meldahl has helped Amazon find and negotiate the lease terms for nearly all of it. It's a role that has given the firm an unseen hand in the prosperity of regions of the country where Amazon facilities and the jobs they bring can either spell growth or infuriate locals who find the company's presence disruptive. By association it has made KBC one of the most powerful — and least known — real-estate firms in the nation.

KBC's rise from an obscure player into Amazon's dealmaker is a story of one of the most lucrative and productive relationships in the commercial real-estate industry. It also reflects how once-lowly warehouses have become ultrahot in an economy that is increasingly driven by e-commerce and consumed with the on-shoring of storage in the aftermath of historic disruptions to global supply chains brought by the pandemic.

KBC Advisors declined to comment for this story.

Alfredo Gutierrez the chief executive of the real-estate investment firm SparrowHawk recently negotiated with KBC to have Amazon lease about 200000 square feet in a warehouse that SparrowHawk owns in St. Louis.

""I call it the Amazon effect"" said Gutierrez whose firm owns more than 5 million square feet of industrial space. ""If Amazon picks a location everyone else will come in because they know Amazon must have studied it and knows what it's doing.""

The misunderstood origins of KBC Advisors

In the absence of information KBC's origins have become lore in the real-estate industry. Some assume that in order to have consolidated business with such a large and lucrative tenant for so long Hanson must know Amazon's founder Jeff Bezos personally.

""They must have been fraternity brothers"" one real-estate executive speculated incorrectly.

Advertisement

In reality Hanson was in the right place at the right time. In the late 1990s he was a broker at CBRE the largest real-estate services company in the world. A colleague of his at CBRE Rick Diedrich went to work for Amazon in 1999 when the company was focused mainly on the business of selling books and CDs and had just two warehouses instead of the thousands it has now — a 300000-square-foot space in Seattle and another warehouse in Delaware according to a former executive who worked in its real-estate department.

Diedrich sought out Hanson to help rapidly scale the company's footprint according to that executive and another broker who was a colleague of Hanson's earlier in his career and got to know him well.

As startups transition into corporate behemoths their operations and business relationships often become increasingly complex. As Amazon grew though it eschewed building out a heavily staffed real-estate department as is common among major retailers according to the former Amazon real-estate executive. That decision left the firm reliant on outside help — and especially on Hanson.

""If you look at Home Depot and other big users they're doing the deals themselves"" the person who used to work for Amazon's real-estate team said. ""Walmart and Dollar Store they have robust real-estate teams.""

How KBC became indispensable to Amazon

Part of Hanson's pitch was that by consolidating its warehouse procurement under him and his team Amazon wouldn't be missing out on the talent and capabilities of the broader real-estate services industry but rather sampling the very best it had to offer. Hanson would enlist brokers from various major real-estate companies across the country to provide local expertise when finding and arranging Amazon deals.

""Amazon gets CBRE and Cushman and JLL or a boutique broker in various markets"" said a Seattle broker who knows Hanson. ""And John would say to Amazon 'I'm choosing the best brokers for you and you're getting all the best information that the market has to offer.'""

Hanson also granted Amazon generous rebates on the commissions he and his team earned from representing the company a practice that continues at KBC today and is common among brokers who represent major corporate users who take large amounts of space. An email between a pair of KBC brokers and Amazon from 2020 that was reviewed by Insider showed that they returned 30% of the commissions they earned from representing Amazon in about a dozen deals over a two year span to the company — a rebate that totaled about $2 million.

Through the 2000s Hanson hopped from CBRE to Trammell Crow and then Cushman & Wakefield another powerhouse commercial real-estate firm. His business was so intertwined with Amazon's at that point that he operated almost as an extension of the company itself using an Amazon email address and an office in its headquarters in downtown Seattle. That close-knit relationship continues today. Several KBC employees have access to Amazon offices and use Amazon email addresses according to a former Amazon real-estate division employee who spoke with Insider.

Both Amazon and the warehouse business are booming — KBC is too

Hanson and Meldahl who Hanson met at Trammell founded KBC in 2016 naming the firm after the initials of their children. The group has expanded from about a dozen employees to around 160 today according to a person with knowledge of the company. Many of the brokers it has added come from established rival real-estate services firms like CBRE Cushman and JLL.

The firm has done it quietly eschewing press releases and refusing interviews — much like its famously secretive client Amazon.

The timing has been fortuitous. While other segments of the commercial real-estate market such as office and retail leasing were battered during the pandemic the once-sleepy industrial real-estate market is one of its hottest segments. Demand has been driven by e-commerce companies that have grabbed a growing slice of consumer spending and logistics tenants that make fast home deliveries possible.

In the past two years Amazon has embarked on a rapid expansion striking recent deals to open warehouses across the country in places like Daytona Beach Florida; New Castle Delaware; and Moorpark California.

""When we saw emergency-room personnel outfitted with Glad bags and ski goggles and grocery-store shelves were emptied of toilet paper it was a serious awakening that we need more domestic storage"" said Jeff Starkovich an executive at Cushman & Wakefield in San Francisco who handles warehouse leasing in the Bay Area.

Roughly 902 million square feet of warehouse space was leased across the country from January through November 2021 32% more than the same period in 2020 according to data compiled by CBRE. The firm also reported that the average rent per square foot of warehouse space was $8.92 at the end of the third quarter a 10.4% increase from the year prior. While that amount may sound paltry it adds up when warehouses span hundreds of thousands of square feet. And rents can be quadruple that sum or higher in competitive markets like the New York metropolitan area.

Developers have reacted to the demand and the lucrative economics. Nearly 450 million square feet of new warehouse space is now under construction — a record amount according to CBRE.

Some of the hires that KBC has made are the very same brokers Hanson tapped as third-party local market experts to help him secure space for Amazon in various markets around the country several people familiar with the firm said. It brought on a pair of veteran Cushman warehouse executives Jason Goldman and Marc Petrella who focus on the northern New Jersey market at the beginning of the year. Tony Creme a top Texas warehouse broker joined in 2020. And Adam Mullen a high-ranking CBRE warehouse executive was named KBC's president in July.

It is common for top brokers to switch firms in the real-estate services industry. Joining a nascent platform like KBC can allow a leasing executive to compete for business they might have been precluded from pursuing at a larger firm where internal conflicts are common over who lays claim to a client relationship.

KBC's future is bigger than Amazon

Several observers said that KBC has additional unspoken leverage: Join or risk missing out on the chance to do deals with Amazon — the warehouse market's most prolific tenant.

Bringing on top brokers from rival firms also helps KBC land other big-name clients.

""Whenever you pick up brokerage teams they're going to bring their book of business with other tenants and landlords with them"" SparrowHawk's Gutierrez said.

Take USAA Real Estate for instance which is developing a 1.2-million-square-foot warehouse in Forney Texas just outside of Dallas. USAA hired KBC's Tony Creme to lease it burnishing KBC's credentials as a firm that represents not just Amazon but now major landlords as well.

""KBC has amassed some of the best brokerage teams in the country and specifically Dallas"" Lange Allen a managing director with USAA Real Estate who helps oversee USAA's warehouse investments said. ""Why wouldn't I hire them?""

On your smart TV or Fire TV navigate to the Bluetooth settings to find the Echo speaker you're wanting to connect. When you're ready to disconnect just say ""Alexa unpair.""

2. Create a playlist on the fly

Creating a new playlist can take time -- you have to think of the songs you want to add search for the titles and manually add them to the playlist you just created. So instead of trying to quickly tap as many songs as possible just ask your Echo to add them for you.

While you're busy doing other things like household chores or playing video games  just say ""Alexa create a new playlist."" You'll need to come up with a name for the playlist like ""Favorite Rock Songs of the '90s."" If you want to add a song to the playlist it'll need to be playing on your smart speaker. So if you want to add Weezer's Say It Ain't So to your playlist you'll need to request Alexa to play it first and then say ""Alexa add this song to my playlist.""

Once your playlist is complete and you're ready to listen to it just say ""Alexa play [name of playlist].""

3. Get the traffic details for your morning commute

Knowing which route to take to work in the morning is important especially if you've got a daily commute that involves driving through the busiest part of town. Fortunately before you head out the door in the morning you can ask Alexa what the traffic looks like.

You'll need to add your work location in the Alexa app so Alexa can give you the best route advice. Open the Alexa app menu and select Settings. Then scroll down and tap Traffic and enter the address you'll be leaving from (like your house or favorite coffee shop) to head to your destination (work address).

Now when you're ready to leave the house just say ""Alexa what's my traffic?"" and Alexa will give you the fastest route and the estimated time it will take to get to work.

4. Whisper to Alexa

If everyone in your house is sleeping or you just don't want to hear your speaker's loud replies try whispering to Alexa. For example if you want to know what time it is when you wake up without looking at a bright screen just whisper ""Alexa what time is it?"" That's all you have to do to get Alexa to whisper back.

You can communicate with Alexa without saying a word. Chris Monroe/CNET

5. Set location-based routines

Whether you need to send an important email when you get home or need a reminder to feed the dog you can set a routine to remind you as soon as you get to your destination.

To set up a routine open the Alexa app menu and tap Routines. Select the plus sign icon in the top right corner and enter the routine name (for example Send email). Next select When This Happens and tap Location. From here select Arrives or Leaves and choose either your work or home address. Tap Next and then select Add action. If you're setting a reminder select Alexa says and create a customized response.

Note that you can also create routines that start with your voice activation an alarm a specific time or other triggers. You can also set actions to do things like start your Alexa-supported robot vacuum or turn the thermostat temperature down when you leave the house.

6. Tap your command instead of saying it



If you ever have trouble getting Alexa to understand what you're saying just turn on the Type to Alexa feature. It lets you type out a command rather than speaking it and it lets you easily access shortcuts with one tap on the screen.

For example instead of saying ""Alexa what's the weather today?"" you can just text in the app to quickly get the forecast. This can be helpful if you want to get info at a glance rather than waiting for Alexa to go through its entire spiel about the weather.

To use Tap to Alexa on your Echo Show open the settings and select Accessibility. Then scroll down and toggle the Tap to Alexa switch on and tap Continue. You can move the Tap to Alexa icon around until you find the best spot.

To use it in the Alexa app select the keyboard icon in the top left corner and type your command.

Useful features exclusive to the Amazon Echo Show

Amazon's Echo Show (starting at $45 on Amazon) has its own set of cool features that aren't available on the other Echo devices due to its touchscreen.

7. Show and tell



If you've got an Amazon Echo Show it can recognize your household pantry items like a can of soup. This feature was developed to help blind and visually impaired people identify a specific object. Alexa can name items using advanced computer vision and machine-learning technologies for object recognition.

To get started make sure your camera is on and ask ""Alexa what am I holding?"" The voice assistant will then give you instructions on where to hold the item how close it needs to be to the camera and when to show different sides of the product.

I tried this with two items a packet of oatmeal and a tube of lip balm. When I showed it the oatmeal Alexa was able to tell me ""cinnamon roll"" ""measuring"" and ""pouch"" but was unable to identify the brand. When I showed it the lip balm Alexa was able to identify that it was Blistex Medicated Lip Balm.

8. Turn off the screen

Your Echo Show's screen will stay on constantly if it's plugged in which can be frustrating when you're trying to fall asleep at night or need to stay focused while working. And while you can dim your device it doesn't always help. Fortunately you can turn your screen off without shutting down the device by saying ""Alexa turn off the screen."" To turn the screen back on you can either tap the screen or use your speaker's wake word.

Now that you've mastered these Amazon Echo tips here are six more things you haven't tried with your Echo speaker seven shocking things you still can't do on your Amazon Echo and four places to never put your Echo in your home."

Here's how employers workers can succeed,"To understand how Wisconsin’s labor shortage has transformed the jobs market look no further than an Oct. 14 job fair to hire workers for expansions of Pierce Manufacturing’s production plants in Neenah and Fox Crossing.

The fire truck manufacturer aimed to hire 200 assemblers welders electricians and painters.

Pierce touted competitive pay health and well-being services and matching retirement contributions as most major employers do now and it highlighted another incentive: $10000 in educational reimbursement per year for employees working toward a college degree.

The company conducted interviews and drug tests on the spot and it welcomed candidates with little experience. Becky Bartoszek president and CEO of the Fox Cities Chamber of Commerce said the company hired 100 people at the fair — an example of how aggressive employers must be to find talent.

The fierce competition for talent won’t end soon and employers across industries must adapt to survive the statewide worker shortage northeastern Wisconsin workforce experts said. Until then residents must continue to live with the impacts of a tight labor market: Store and restaurant closures supply shortages and longer wait times.

Thousands of jobs are going unfilled due to longstanding demographic trends and workers’ changing expectations about benefits pay hours and workplace culture.

That means employers must rethink recruitment. It won’t be easy but the stakes could not be higher said Eric Vanden Heuvel vice president of talent and education with the Greater Green Bay Chamber during a recent workforce panel discussion at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay convened by the USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin.

“Evolve or die” he said. “If your business takes the approach ‘This is how we do things’ you won’t survive.”

Here are the key questions and answers for employees employers and communities as they navigate a tight labor market in Wisconsin according to experts who participated in the discussion.

Is this a temporary thing?

No it’s the acceleration of a trend that precedes the pandemic.

Birth rates have steadily declined since the births of 76 million Baby Boomers between 1946 and 1964 leaving fewer workers to replace retirees. Additionally the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated retirements. Vanden Heuvel expects such challenges to continue for at least a decade.

“It just results in more jobs than there are people” he said.

What does that mean for business?

Companies must keep their benefits and salary packages competitive seek out employee input and collaborate regionally to meet workforce needs especially in business sectors such as paper and other manufacturing transportation health care and hospitality.

Vanden Heuvel said competing businesses must cooperate in areas like recruiting talent to the region. He cited school districts as an example.

“(O)rganizations are starting to come together to say ‘How can we recruit more teachers to the area?’ Not ‘How can I hire the teachers that I need?’” he said.

Employers must recognize the modern workforce’s concept of a job and work-life balance differs from the Boomers’ post-Great Depression mentality that you find a job feel fortunate and stay put until retirement Vanden Heuvel said.

Bartoszek said successful companies will be those where workers want to work not have to work.

What does that evolution look like?

Experts say that successful employers will focus on cultivating a good work culture and being flexible with employees.

For example manufacturers should look at hiring part-time workers something many employers have been hesitant to do in the past said Ann Franz executive director of the NEW Manufacturing Alliance.

A manufacturing alliance study of 200-plus people between the ages of 56 and 65 found that flexible hours keep people in the workforce longer Franz said. Similarly younger workers often cite work-life balance as an important factor when picking a job.

Chambers regional economic development agencies and some employers also have seen success traveling to talent rather than waiting for it to come to them.

Bartoszek cited a recent recruiting trip to Michigan Technological University. Rather than the standard spongy footballs or pens to hand out the Fox Cities Chamber and employers parked a Pierce fire engine and other equipment on the campus grilled burgers and gave away T-shirts to anyone who talked to an employer about jobs.

Graduating students have repeatedly told chamber officials and recruiters on such trips that the specific job didn’t matter as much as a community’s amenities and quality of life. This trip was no different.

The event drew 600 students eclipsing the university’s goal of 150.

What does that mean for employees?

Employees have more options and greater bargaining power when it comes to finding a job. This is the first time in decades that employees “have the upper hand” said Allen Huffcutt an associate professor of management at UW-Green Bay’s Cofrin School of Business.

“They feel empowered like they’re not helpless” he said. “They can be proactive and change things.”

In September a record-breaking 4.4 million people quit their jobs according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the United States is seeing an uptick in workers going on strike.

“Employees are in a position where you don’t have to stay in a job you’re not happy in” Bartoszek said.

She recommends people looking for a new position seek out companies that offer the benefits that are most important to them such as tuition reimbursement remote work opportunities or paid time off for example.

“Tear down your preconceived barriers about what you can and cannot do especially around job requirements” Vanden Heuvel said. “The concept that this job wants five years experience and you need to have this degree and this background those are oftentimes self-limiting beliefs.”

Are sign-on bonuses/incentives making a difference?

No.

Experts say they only encourage employee churn at a time of low unemployment and workforce engagement at levels near its pre-pandemic high.

Wisconsin’s September labor force participation rate was 66.6 percent higher than the national rate of 61.6 percent and up from 66.5 percent in August. The workforce participation rate measures how many people ages 16 or older are working or actively seeking work.

Wisconsin’s unemployment rate in September was 3.9 percent while the national unemployment rate was 4.8 percent according to the Department of Workforce Development.

The Fox Cities Chamber of Commerce does not advise businesses to offer sign-on bonuses in that environment because it “led to a new generation of job jumping” Bartoszek said. Some workers will try out a job for six months and then jump to the next one for the bonus she said.

Instead experts suggested focusing on incentives like tuition assistance for immediate family members flexible schedules opportunities to advance and assistance with basic needs like child care.

What would bring more people into the workforce?

Employers and communities must address issues like access to child care affordable housing and transportation to bolster the pool of workers.

Ariens Co.’s partnership with KinderCare to open a child care facility in August for workers in Brillion is a great example of how larger manufacturers are answering workers’ needs Franz said. However not every business can undertake such an expense.

Bartoszek said employers have partnered with chambers of commerce or other businesses interested in expanding access to child care.

Additionally employers must connect with historically underemployed populations that can fill the demand for jobs: people with disabilities people with criminal records retirees people for whom English is a second language and people of color.

Christina Thor 9to5 Women Wisconsin’s state director said a lack of access to affordable child care is among the biggest barriers to work faced by women with children particularly women of color according to a survey by members of the grassroots advocacy group for working women.

“If you want women here take a look at family structure first. Take a look at their priorities first and they will come to you” Thor said.

Thor who became state director in October said parents working second or third shift jobs have little or no access to child care services. She said there also is a major need in northeastern Wisconsin for child care services that are sensitive to the needs of the region’s diverse communities of color.

“Make sure (child care) is culturally competent and linguistically competent” Thor said. “If I want my child to speak my native tongue and to know my culture and know what happens at home that’s a better trusting relationship and it improves overall child development.”

Franz noted there are 482000 people in Wisconsin with disabilities “a huge labor market we’re missing out on” and another 9000 people exit the correctional system each year.

Craig Coleman a Green Bay-based job developer and transition coach with Forward Service Corp. said most people leaving the corrections system want to work. The Madison-based nonprofit provides training and support service to people exiting the corrections system in 46 of the state’s 72 counties but Coleman said communities should better support people as they return to the workforce.

He said his grant-funded job is to help returning workers get help with resumes car repairs training courses child care assistance or anything else that may stand in the way of landing a well-paying job.

“If we can provide them with a family supporting wage that’s one thing off their back that can increase their chance of being successful” Coleman said. “Ninety-nine percent of the justice involved population are good employees. They’ve figured out what went wrong with their lives and they do not want to go back. That alone makes them good employees.”

The Bay Area Workforce Development Board a training and job search agency that serves an 11-county region is launching a new initiative to actively connect with historically underemployed populations said executive director Matt Valiquette.

Valiquette recalled his own frustration looking for work after retiring from the Marine Corps a decade ago. He sent out resumes with no response. After a visit to a job center Valiquette tweaked his resume and soon his phone was ringing with offers.

“It was a bad feeling being 40 feeling like a failure and not knowing where to turn. How many others give up in those circumstances?” he said. “We can’t afford for them to give up.”

As of Saturday afternoon Delta Airlines United Airlines JetBlue Airways and American Airlines had canceled a combined 950 Saturday flights.

Delta Air Lines canceled 308 flights on Christmas Day and has already canceled 69 flights scheduled for Sunday.

Saturday's cancellations come after United Delta and JetBlue canceled 454 Christmas Eve flights.

Delta Air Lines canceled 173 flights for Christmas Eve. The airline says the ""flight cancellations are due to a combination of issues including but not limited to potential inclement weather in some areas and the impact of the omicron variant.""

""Delta teams have exhausted all options and resources -- including rerouting and substitutions of aircraft and crews to cover scheduled flying -- before canceling around 90 flights for Friday"" Delta said in a Friday statement to ABC News. ""We apologize to our customers for the delay in their holiday travel plans. Delta people are working hard to get them to where they need to be as quickly and as safely as possible on the next available flight.""

And it's not just Delta that's feeling the impact of the variant on crews.

As of Saturday afternoon United had canceled 240 Christmas Day flights and 85 flights scheduled for Sunday. It had canceled 201 flights on Christmas Eve.

""The nationwide spike in omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation"" United said in a statement on Friday. ""As a result we've unfortunately had to cancel some flights and are notifying impacted customers in advance of them coming to the airport.""

""We're sorry for the disruption and are working hard to rebook as many people as possible and get them on their way for the holidays"" the airline added.

JetBlue has canceled 123 Christmas Day flights due to COVID issues. It had canceled 80 flights Christmas Eve.

""Like many businesses and organizations we have seen an increasing number of sick calls from Omicron"" JetBlue said in a statement Friday. ""We entered the holiday season with the highest staffing levels we've had since the pandemic began and are using all resources available to us to cover our staffing needs. Despite our best efforts we've had to cancel a number of flights and additional flight cancellations and other delays remain a possibility as we see more Omicron community spread.""

Alaska Airlines has resorted to offering extra pay to their healthy employees who can work added shifts into this upcoming Christmas weekend.

The airline says they have had to cancel 10 Christmas Eve flights due to some of their employees quarantining after reporting that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

American Airlines canceled 88 flights on Christmas Day.

""Our operation has been running smoothly and unfortunately a number of COVID-related sick calls led us to make the difficult decision to precancel some flights scheduled for today"" a representative for American Airlines said in a statement to ABC News on Saturday. ""We proactively notified affected customers yesterday and are working hard to rebook them quickly. We never want to disappoint our customers and apologize for any disruptions to their holiday travel plans.""

Airlines for America the group that lobbies on behalf of all major U.S. airlines is calling on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to shorten the quarantine time for fully vaccinated individuals saying the omicron surge may create ""significant"" disruptions.

""The omicron surge may exacerbate personnel shortages and create significant disruptions to our workforce and operations"" Nick Calio A4A's CEO said in a letter on Thursday to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky.

Calio proposed the isolation period to be shortened to five days from symptom onset for breakthrough infections.

""In turn those individuals would be able to end isolation with an appropriate testing protocol"" Calio wrote.

The letter comes after Delta Air Lines and JetBlue Airways both A4A members also asked for isolation periods for fully vaccinated individuals to be shortened.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMjYvYnVzaW5lc3MvZmxpZ2h0cy1jYW5jZWxlZC11cy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airlines Cancel Hundreds More Flights as Virus Scrambles Air Travel,"Over 1000 flights in the United States and thousands more globally were canceled Sunday as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus sidelined crews during one of the year’s busiest weekends for travel.

As of Sunday evening more than 1300 flights with at least one stop in the United States and over two times as many around the world had been canceled according to FlightAware which provides aviation data.

Sunday’s bleak track record followed thousands of global flight cancellations on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The cancellations threatened to disrupt travel plans at a time when many fly to spend the Christmas holiday with their families. In the United States the tradition appeared to rebound this year: Roughly two million people passed through screening checkpoints each day last week according to the Transportation Security Administration and the numbers on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day were nearly double the equivalent figures last year.

Twelve percent of JetBlue flights 6 percent of Delta Air Lines flights five percent of United Airlines flights and 2 percent of American Airlines flights on Sunday had been canceled by midday according to FlightAware.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMTIvMjYvYWlybGluZXMtY2FuY2VsLWZsaWdodHMtaG9saWRheS1tZWx0ZG93bi01MjYxNTjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Some airlines continue to cancel flights following holiday meltdown,"More than 7000 flights were canceled globally starting Dec. 23 and through the Christmas holiday weekend. A spokesperson for American for example said its operations saw setbacks over “a number of Covid-related sick calls led us to make the difficult decision to precancel some flights.”

“We proactively notified affected customers yesterday and are working hard to rebook them quickly” the spokesperson said.

Over the course of the pandemic airlines ⁠— for a variety of reasons ⁠— had reduced the number of crews or backup crews leading to disruptions. Ahead of Thanksgiving however major airlines began accelerating efforts to get schedule and staffing right to avoid gaps in the system including making sure they had enough staff to crew the scheduled flights. The airlines created bonus and pay incentives for overtime work.

“A lot of this has been the inability to connect a pilot to the airplane” said Dennis Tajer an American Airlines pilot and a spokesperson for the Allied Pilots Association a pilot union. Tajer said the massive uncertainty may have made crews reluctant to pick up extra work for fear of what will follow.

Flight attendants and pilots “have a normal time schedule but then have these available [slots] to pick up extra time” he said Sunday. “But when the schedule is falling apart [you may] get exposed to a reassignment; it’s not forced overtime it’s forced stay of work” he said of recent challenges seen during the busy holiday season.

“Crews may see that and hesitate or opt not to take that shift because they don’t know what the end result will be.”

Additionally there may be a gap between schedules as crews need to get their minimum rest time between shifts he said.

Meanwhile the airlines are in the midst of lobbying the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reexamine its 10-day isolation policy for fully vaccinated individuals who contract Covid-19. While the CDC shortened the Covid isolation rules for health workers last week frontline airline workers have not yet been granted the same reprieve.

Airlines for America which represents major U.S.-based carriers including United American JetBlue and others said the current mandate is likely to “exacerbate personnel shortages and create significant disruptions to our workforce and operations.” The CDC did immediately respond to a request for comment.

Both United and American Airlines said in the wake of cancellations customers have the ability to choose if they’d like a refund or to rebook to another flight.

We “apologize for any disruptions to their holiday travel plans” the spokesperson for American said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvb2Rtb3JuaW5nYW1lcmljYS5jb20vbmV3cy9zdG9yeS9haXJsaW5lcy1jYW5jZWwtaG9saWRheS1mbGlnaHRzLWR1ZS1vbWljcm9uLWltcGFjdHMtY3Jld3MtODE5MjM1NDfSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb29kbW9ybmluZ2FtZXJpY2EuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL3N0b3J5L2FpcmxpbmVzLWNhbmNlbC1ob2xpZGF5LWZsaWdodHMtZHVlLW9taWNyb24taW1wYWN0cy1jcmV3cy04MTkyMzU0Nw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airlines cancel hundreds of holiday flights as omicron cases hit crews,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhZGRsZXlvdXJvd25rYW5vby5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNi8xMC1vZi10aGUtYmVzdC1zcGVjaWFsLWFpcmxpbmUtbGl2ZXJpZXMtb2YtMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 of the Best Special Airline Liveries of 2021,"Qatar Airways – FIFA World Cup 2022

Qatar Airways actually unveiled its special FIFA World Cup livery on one of its Boeing 777-300 aircraft in November 2020 – so why does this special livery make the list for 2021 as well? Well an A350-1000 aircraft was sent to the paint workshop earlier this year to have the same livery applied and it was then that engineers discovered a paint degradation issue that has since resulted in 21 of Qatar’s A350 fleet being grounded. The issue recently took a new turn when Qatar Airways initiated legal proceedings against aircraft manufacturer Airbus in London’s High Court. Airbus says it plans to “vigorously” defend itself against the lawsuit.

Saudia – 75th Anniversary Retro Livery

Earlier this year Saudi Arabian Airlines unveiled a livery retrojet to celebrate the carrier’s 75th anniversary. The livery stands out because Saudi Arabia is embarking on a charm offensive with the West reopening the country to foreign tourists. The only problem is whether Saudia will be the airline that actually welcomes the huge influx of tourists expected over the coming years. Rumours abound that Saudi’s leaders might create a new liberal airline similar to Emirates or Etihad while Saudia will retain its no-alcohol policy onboard prayer areas and ban on ‘revealing’ clothing so as to continue serving religious conservatives.

ITA Airways – Born in 2021

When the Italian flag carrier Alitalia finally folded earlier this year it did so only because another government-owned airline was waiting in the wings. ITA Airways (Italia Transport Aereo) took on some of Alitalia’s fleet and decided to quickly repaint one of the old airline’s Airbus A320’s. The first flight was operated by an A320 with a special ‘Born in 2021’ livery. The entire fleet will eventually be repainted in a bright blue livery which is a striking nod to the colours worn by Italian athletes and sports teams when playing abroad. The colour harks back to Italy’s pre-republic era when blue was the official colour of the Italian Royal family the House of Savoy.

Air Canada – Trans-Canada Air Lines Retrojet

Air Canada continues to pay tribute to its predecessor airline with this special Trans-Canada Air Lines retrojet. The Montreal-based airline previously had an Airbus A319 sporting this retro livery but that aircraft was retired in January 2020. TCA was permanently rebranded as Air Canada in 1964 as part of the airline’s efforts to better serve its French-speaking passengers.

Alaska Airlines – Oneworld

Airlines that form part of the Oneworld alliance are required to paint some of their aircraft in special liveries to promote the alliance. So when Alaska Airlines officially joined Oneworld in March it was fitting that it did so by unveiling its special Oneworld alliance livery. Alaska Airlines is now the 14th member of Oneworld and membership has already helped strengthen its business relationships with American Airlines British Airways and Qatar Airways. Alaska is no stranger from a special livery and in the last year has unveiled a whole host of special liveries including a Starbucks Holiday-themed decal and a new Russell Wilson livery.

Envoy – American Eagle Heritage Livery

Envoy Air is a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Airlines which operates American Eagle branded regional flights. In August it unveiled a heritage retrojet livery on an Embraer E170. American Airlines has a number of retrojet liveries that hark back to days gone by and remember some of the other airlines that were merged into AA through the years.

Southwest Airlines – Freedom One

Southwest Airlines marked its 50th anniversary in June by unveiling a Boeing 737-800 emblazoned with a stylized flag of the United States of America. The plane has been called ‘Freedom One’. The carrier has a number of special liveries in its fleet including 12 liveries that commemorate various U.S. states including Arizona One and Nevada One. Freedom One features 50 stars and 13 stripes and s described by Southwest as a “symbol of unwavering pride for our Nation and its heroes”.

Delta Air Lines – Team USA

Delta Air Lines has taken over the job of being Team USA’s official airline after United decided not to renew its sponsorship deal. Delta commemorated the occasion by unveiling a special Team USA livery on one of its A330-900 aircraft during an event held earlier this month. Delta will be Team USA’s official airline for the next eight years and will help transport athletes to Beijing 2022 Paris 2024 Milano Cortina 2026 and LA28.

British Airways – Better World

British Airways unveiled its ‘BA Better World’ livery in September as part of a new sustainability programme. The new livery was painted on one of BA’s newer and more fuel-efficient A320neo aircraft.

According to a study published by Nature Communications that answer is - yes. This article by Utilities Monitor Worldwide reviews the study's interesting findings. Thinking about powering your home with the sun? Get all your questions answered with a free quote from your local Panasonic installer.

The United States has enough usable rooftop space to deploy an amount of solar equal to its current nationwide generation levels according to recent research on global photovoltaic potential. Researchers at Ireland’s University of Cork leveraged big data machine learning and geospatial analysis to reach their findings which were published in Nature Communications.

In the report about 77000 square miles of rooftop area worldwide was demarcated as usable PV surface area (for context the state of Florida is roughly 65000 square miles). The researchers said this area could result in the production of 27 petawatt-hours or 27 million GWh if completely covered by conventional photovoltaics.

This level of potential energy would exceed 2018 total global electricity consumption a year in which 6 petawatt-hours (PWh) of electricity was consumed by homes alone and over 23 PWh was consumed globally per Statista.com.

The report further said that rooftops in the United States could host enough capacity to produce an annual 4.2 PWh per year effectively matching the nation’s current total energy output of about 4 PWh per year.

In 2020 about 60% of U.S. electric generation came from fossil fuels and roughly 20% each from nuclear and renewable energy sources according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). EIA estimated that the U.S. additionally produced 42 billion kWh of electricity from distributed small-scale solar about 1% of total generation. Large-scale solar accounted for 2.2% of total generation that year.

The authors of the paper in Nature Communications said there are mitigating factors in this potential PV outlook including constraints around transmission and the need for storage due to the intermittent generation cycles of solar energy.

This high potential for rooftop solar may come as good news for American ratepayers as it may put some savings back in their pockets. Recently it was estimated by Local Solar for All that collectively $109 billion in utility bill payments could be avoided by 2030 if rooftop solar were to scale up 2-4 times faster vs. an all-utility-scale solar deployment scenario.

The report is an important talisman to wield for those who are concerned about energy sprawl or the development of land for energy generation. A study by Clemson University showed that in the U.S. including spacing and zoning requirements roughly 500000 square miles of land would need to be dedicated to new energy development by 2040 an area larger than Texas. Rooftops represent an alternative to using up otherwise useful lands.

“The open data generated in this research helps to quantify locate and prioritize investment in zero-carbon electricity systems” said study co-author James Glynn senior researcher at Columbia University.

Potential costs for rooftop solar across the globe were also evaluated in the Nature Communications paper and it was found that costs range depending on location. The lowest per-megawatt-hour costs were in China ($68) and India ($66) and the highest costs were in the U.K. ($251) and the U.S. ($238).

The Mount Hermon area resident said the frequency of outages has become worse the last year or so and she has had to purchase a generator.

“What really bothers me is how often these are happening” Abbott said Tuesday. “It almost never happened in the past unless there was a big storm or something. Now it’s happening on pleasant days with nothing that might be causing it due to weather.”

When she was contacted Tuesday morning by the Danville Register & Bee Abbott’s power had just come back on after being out for 45 minutes.

“I was at my mailbox and heard a crackle in the line over my head...” she said of the moment when her power went out. “This was the third time in about a month.”

Abbott’s outage that morning came just three days after another that occurred while American Electric Power was performing maintenance on its system. Danville Utilities stopped receiving power from one of its delivery points from AEP and several substations went offline for nearly 30 minutes as a result.

“It certainly did affect a lot of people” said Danville Utilities Director Jason Grey.

The city’s West Fork delivery point project will help prevent situations like the one that arose Dec. 18 Grey said. Danville Utilities’ fourth Appalachian Power delivery point will be constructed in Brosville and should be complete in 2023.

“That delivery point has been in conceptual design” Grey said. “We’re looking at buying property for it. If we had that project up and running we would have had another delivery point that would have prevented what happened [Dec. 18].”

Danville City Council voted in July to buy 42.85 acres next to the West Fork electric substation for $180000 to expand the substation’s footprint in Brosville and add a fourth Appalachian Power delivery point.

The purchase would allow a new Appalachian Power transmission line and substation at the property.

The West Fork substation sits on about five acres on Long Circle off U.S. 58.

Danville Utilities’ existing delivery points for Appalachian Power are off Kentuck Road at Riverside Drive and Arnett Boulevard and at the Danville Utilities location at Monument Street.

Danville Utilities distributes electricity to about 42000 customer locations in a 500-square-mile service territory covering Danville the southern third of Pittsylvania County and small portions of Henry and Halifax counties. It also provides natural gas water wastewater and telecommunications services in Danville.

Appalachian Power’s transmission line would be a 138-kilovolt line and the substation would include a control building several breakers and metering equipment.

Danville Utilities operates 17 substations.

The recent delivery point issue occurred at the Riverside substation at Riverside Drive and Arnett Boulevard.

Riverside substation is a vital part of Danville Utilities that serves about a quarter of the city’s customers.

One of the current three delivery points for the city’s system it provides power to almost 10000 customers on both sides of the Dan River.

The Riverside substation sends power to customers in neighborhoods bounded by Guilford Street to the north the Old West End neighborhood to the south Piney Forest Road to the west and the King Memorial Bridge to the east.

It also feeds substations areas of the county including those in Brosville Whitmell and Mount Hermon.

The substation was upgraded in the summer of 2020. The project cost about $6 million and involved the replacement of all of the substation’s three transformers switches circuit breakers and other aging equipment. Before the improvements a lot of the equipment dated back to substation’s construction in the 1960s.

The outages

As for power outages Westover Drive area resident Cindi Fisher has experienced power outages at her Fox Hollow home five times recently.

“Power outages seem to have increased over the time I have lived in this part of the city” Fisher said adding that she has resided in Fox Hollow for more than 10 years.

Some of her neighbors have bought standby generators she said.

In addition to the loss of electricity that occurred Dec. 18 three short outages happened at Fisher’s home on the morning of Dec. 12 she said.

“In total it was not out that long but it caused a power surge in my house that killed my modem” Fisher said.

She called her internet provider and had her modem replaced at the city’s expense she said.

Fisher also lost electricity the first week of this month while she was at work.

“Power outages are not new to the Westover area but there are no weather-related events that caused any of the outages at my house this month” she said.

Before the outages became more common for Fisher’s neighborhood she felt like she and her neighbors were lucky to be spared when most of the Westover area was without power. But that has changed.

“Now I find it more of a nuisance” she said.

Isolated problems

Grey said the city has had more isolated outages because of fallen trees or animals such as squirrels or birds making contact with power lines.

“Not all outages are caused by us” Grey said. “They’re caused by Mother Nature. We’re here to react to that and do what we can to prevent them going forward.”

The city has performed a lot of right-of-way maintenance — such as tree-trimming — over the past several years to reduce incidents but birds and squirrels can still climb and fly onto poles and lines Grey said.

Car wrecks also have caused outages when poles are struck including one that occurred Wednesday morning and shut down power in part of Danville Utilities’ service area Grey said.

“That seems to happen a lot more than I think it should” he said. “A lot of customers don’t realize how many vehicle accidents we have.”

Substations

As for new substations projects were completed at Kentuck in October and at Whitmell last week Grey said.

Crews have now moved on to building new substations at Westover off Woodlawn Drive and at Southside near Danville Community College Grey said.

Westover and Southside serve about 5600 and 3400 customers respectively.

The Westover substation serves a vast area including Dry Fork the Berry Hill Road area and parts of Danville.

Southside covers the area from West Main Street and at Averett University in Danville heading south in the Grove Park area Southwyck Druid Hills and Stratford Place to the North Carolina line.

The Westover substation was built in 1975 and Southside’s substation was built in 1972.

Those projects are expected to be complete by next summer Grey said.

Newer equipment and increasing redundancy having dual transformers at a substation improves reliability he said. Dual transformers will be at Westover and Southside substations as part of their projects enabling the electrical load to be evenly split among the transformers and moved from one transformer to another whenever there is an issue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vY2hhbmdpbmctYW1lcmljYS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC81ODcxNTItbHVtYmVyLWNvbXBhbnktcmV0dXJucy13YXRlcmZyb250LXByb3BlcnR5LXRvL9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vY2hhbmdpbmctYW1lcmljYS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC81ODcxNTItbHVtYmVyLWNvbXBhbnktcmV0dXJucy13YXRlcmZyb250LXByb3BlcnR5LXRvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lumber company returns waterfront property to Native American tribe in Washington state at no cost,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/changing-america/sustainability/environment/587152-lumber-company-returns-waterfront-property-to/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vY2hhbmdpbmctYW1lcmljYS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC81ODcxNTItbHVtYmVyLWNvbXBhbnktcmV0dXJucy13YXRlcmZyb250LXByb3BlcnR5LXRvL9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vY2hhbmdpbmctYW1lcmljYS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC81ODcxNTItbHVtYmVyLWNvbXBhbnktcmV0dXJucy13YXRlcmZyb250LXByb3BlcnR5LXRvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL3ZpZGVvLzIwMjEvMTIvMjYvcm9ib3QtZG9ncy1mcm9tLWJvc3Rvbi1keW5hbWljcy1hbnlib3RpY3MtZ2hvc3Qtcm9ib3RpY3Mtc3RhcnQtd29yay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robot dogs from Boston Dynamics Anybotics Ghost Robotics start work,"Competition in the four-legged robot market is heating up.

Ghost Robotics in Philadelphia is making robots geared toward military applications while abroad Swiss-based Anybotics is making a four-legged robot it calls Anymal for industrial customers. And Chinese companies like Deep Robotics Weilan and Unitree Robotics are all building their own versions though these last two companies seem to be at least partially focusing on the personal robotics market.

Then some of the credits began getting clawed back (“revoked”). At this point it looks like this is just a mistake and the rest of the credits will probably get clawed back soon. Bummer!

Happy Holidays from American Express! Many (or all?) Amex Gold cardholders received an extra $10 in Uber Cash last night.

I received a notification from Uber Eats just after 6pm on Christmas Day advising that I’d received my $10 monthly Amex award and that it’ll expire on January 1. I ignored it at first as I assumed it was simply a delayed notification as I knew I’d already received our $10 credits for December on the night of November 30.

Nick subsequently messaged asking if anyone else had received this additional $10 credit. That prompted me to check my Uber Eats app and to my surprise I saw that I had indeed received a $10 bonus amount. It seemed strange that we only received one credit though because we have two Amex Gold cards registered on my Uber Eats account and so receive two $10 credits each month. Sure enough 1.5 hours later another $10 appeared.

Considering the day that Amex Gold cardholders received these $10 bonus credits I’m assuming that these were unexpected Christmas gifts rather than it being some kind of glitch. Personal Amex Platinum cardholders already receive a bonus $20 Uber Eats credit in December on top of the $15 they receive as standard so it’ll be interesting to see if this $10 bonus for Amex Gold cardholders is a one-off gift or a permanent enhancement. Having said that perhaps there was some kind of Amex intern working on Christmas Day who was worried that the bonus Uber Eats credits for December hadn’t gone out not realizing those are only meant to be for Platinum cardholders rather than Gold cardholders. Whatever the reason getting an extra $10 per Amex Gold card is a nice little bonus to end Christmas Day with.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc2hlbGxleWtvaGFuLzIwMjEvMTIvMjYvdGhlLTUtYmlnZ2VzdC1zaG9wcGluZy10cmVuZHMtZm9yLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 5 Biggest Shopping Trends For 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelleykohan/2021/12/26/the-5-biggest-shopping-trends-for-2022/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc2hlbGxleWtvaGFuLzIwMjEvMTIvMjYvdGhlLTUtYmlnZ2VzdC1zaG9wcGluZy10cmVuZHMtZm9yLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEtc3RhdHVzLTIwMjItcGxhbi1oZW5kZXJzb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I'm ending 2021 with top-tier Alaska and Hyatt status: Here's my plan for 2022,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available.

Considering it was in the midst of a pandemic I flew quite a bit — more than 115000 butt-in-seat miles.

My goal for the past decade was to see at least six to seven new countries a year. Obviously COVID-19 wrecked that plan but I did manage to check French Polynesia and Belize off my to-do list in 2021.

I also visited Alaska four times in 2021 including a fun visit with my ""work wife"" Benét Wilson and a trip on the Alaska Railroad with my dad for Father's Day.

Thanks to lucrative earning bonuses and elite qualification shortcuts I managed to earn Alaska's new top-tier Gold 100K MVP. I also managed to hold on to Delta Air Lines SkyMiles Platinum status for the third year.

My elite ride with American Airlines is coming to a rather anticlimatic end (though I did manage to squeeze out an extra few years of Platinum Pro with pandemic extensions).

Here's how it's shaking out — and what I'm striving for with each program next year.

Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan

Alaska 100K MVP benefits email. (Screenshot courtesy Alaska)

The airline I flew the most in 2021 was Alaska. They offer three to five daily flights to their hub in Seattle from my temporary home airport in Bozeman Montana which gave me access to their many flights from the West Coast.

I parlayed a status challenge in 2019 into multiple years of top-tier status with Alaska Mileage Plan. At the time I couldn't have even anticipated I'd soon be living near their largest hub. But since I moved from New York City to wait out the pandemic at my father's ranch in Montana it's worked out great.

Despite my travel picking up in 2021 I still didn't fly nearly as much as I had prior to the pandemic.

Related: How and why I went for Alaska's new top-tier MVP Gold 100K status

I flew less than 50000 miles but that was enough with rollover miles and promotions to get me over the top for the new Alaska MVP Gold 100K status level.

Alaska had the ""fast track to status"" promotion this year plus for every $2500 I spent on my Alaska Airlines Visa® credit card (or the Alaska Airlines Visa® Business card) until Nov. 16 I got 2500 EQMs toward Alaska Airlines elite status. You were able to earn up to 20000 EQMs without ever getting on a plane this way.

With this promotion I ended up earning an additional 7500 elite-qualifying miles via credit card spend.

I'm looking forward to exploring more of Alaska's route map including doing a few of their flights to Costa Rica and Hawaii.

After all I got to see a new country in 2021 (Belize) because Alaska launched service to the gorgeous Central American destination.

American Airlines AAdvantage

My long love affair with American Airlines is finally coming to a close. I held AAdvantage Executive Platinum status for many years but in 2018 American started making it more difficult (and expensive) to achieve top-tier status.

That's when I decided to try a few other airlines. I did a status challenge for both Delta and Alaska and I cut back on my flights with American. Still I managed to hit Platinum Pro in 2019 and that status has been extended for the past couple of years due to the pandemic. It will finally expire at the end of January 2022 though and I won't even make it to Gold.

That said now that Alaska and American Airlines are Oneworld partners I'll still end up with status when flying American. However I'll be using my Mileage Plan number for reservations on American instead of my AAdvantage number.

When I realized I wouldn't get to Executive Platinum on American back in 2019 I did a status challenge to get Delta Platinum. I decided if I was only going to achieve mid-tier status it might as well be with an airline that seemed more customer-friendly and reliable. You can sign up for a Delta Air Lines status challenge here.

I've managed to hold on to that status level since Delta made it easier to qualify both this year and last. I ended up getting more than 40000 Delta rollover MQMs and ended the year with 134550 MQMs. That would have been enough to get me Delta Diamond status before they added an onerous spend requirement of $15000. My measly $3262 in MQDs wasn't even in the ballpark.

I will however keep Platinum status since I spent more than $30000 on my Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card which gives a spend waiver up to Platinum status if you spend more than $25000 on the card in a calendar year.

The $550 annual fee is steep (see rates and fees) but let's hope they throw in some bonuses again next year.

All my extra MQMs will also roll over to 2022 giving me a giant head start on earning Platinum status again next year. Now I just need to figure out if it's worth putting all my spending on that Delta credit card.

World of Hyatt

I was a Hyatt Diamond member under the old program and I loved it but when the brand launched the new World of Hyatt program in 2017 they also raised the stay requirements.

That had me giving up on Hyatt — until 2020 at least when they launched several incredible promotions that put me on the fast track toward status. The series of fantastic offers gave me top-tier status until 2023.

I even opened a Chase World of Hyatt Credit Card again.

I've been treated well by Hyatt this year including a fabulous stay at the Grand Hyatt in Bogotá Colombia. In fact I've stayed a total of 53 nights in 2021 — and I plan to book most of my stays with Hyatt in 2022. I've already booked the Grand Hyatt in Seoul South Korea and I've got my eye on several more iconic Hyatt hotels.

If Cambodia opens up I'd like to try the Park Hyatt Siem Reap. I've also wanted to stay at the gorgeous Park Hyatt St. Kitts since it opened and the Park Hyatt Maldives seems like a once-in-a-lifetime destination.

Thank goodness for The Platinum Card® from American Express which gives me status in several hotel programs including Marriott.

I have Gold status with Marriott Bonvoy courtesy of my Amex Platinum card though I did end up with enough nights to requalify for Gold (25 nights) either way.

I earned 37 nights in 2021 including 13 given out as promotional nights. That's not enough to get me to Platinum with Marriott Bonvoy (50 nights) and since I'm not that impressed with Marriott's program as a whole I'm content to remain at gold for 2022.

I won't go out of my way to stay at Marriott properties though I do like to have status with the brand since I occasionally stay at Bonvoy hotels for work.

I ended up with 33 nights at Hilton properties in 2021 including one of my best-ever hotel stays at the stunning Conrad Bora Bora.

As I mentioned above simply holding the American Express Platinum card gives you automatic Gold status in several elite programs including Hilton. That's how I got Gold status with Hilton back in 2019.

But in 2020 I also picked up The Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card. It comes with Hilton Diamond status for as long as you have the card. While the card has a hefty annual fee of $450 (see rates and fees) there are other valuable inclusions such as a $250 annual Hilton resort credit a $250 airline credit every year and a free weekend night when you open the account and each year on your card anniversary.

I've now had Hilton Diamond status for the past couple of years. While I certainly have had some nice stays at Hilton properties a few have been not-so-great. I have however been able to use the resort and airline fee credits and while I haven't gotten many upgrades at Hilton properties and it's not as rewarding as Hyatt Globalist I will keep the Aspire card and my diamond status for 2022.

IHG Rewards Club

I ended up with just 16 nights at Intercontinental properties in 2021 but one of them was one of my favorites stays this year: the Intercontinental Los Angeles Downtown.

I have Platinum status with IHG Rewards Club simply by virtue of holding the IHG Rewards Club Select card (no longer open to new applicants). It includes a handful of nice perks (such as a fourth night free on award stays and better bonus categories) but best of all it gives you Platinum status and a free night award to use at lower category properties.

I used mine the first year I had the card in Singapore. Since then my reward nights have been much more pedestrian including a stay at a Holiday Inn in Butte Montana in 2020. I did have an incredible stay at the Kimpton Armory Hotel in Bozeman Montana this year.

The new version of the card is the IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card which also gets you Platinum status but keep in mind the annual free night award is capped at properties costing 40000 points or less a night. The annual fee is $99. I'll keep my IHG card for status (and a free night) in 2021.

Looking ahead to 2022

I'm excited for what's ahead next year. Despite the rapidly spreading omicron variant I expect I'll be able to travel more and I already have trips booked to Bangor Maine; Detroit Michigan; Miami Florida; Santiago Chile; and Seoul in South Korea.

I'm eager to put my status to the test again this year. I'm most interested in seeing how American Airlines recognizes my Alaska Gold 100K MVP and Oneworld status on American-operated flights. If nothing else it should make for a good story in 2022.

“Our guys stuck together and grinded out a tough game” said head coach Nate Leaman (East Greenwich R.I.). “It’s a good first step for our group. We need to keep working hard and improving before we play Switzerland on Tuesday.”

The U.S. penalty kill and defense needed to be sharp right off the draw as Drew Commesso (Norwell Mass.) turned aside the Slovakian rush. Commesso led the penalty kill in the first period thwarting two Slovakian man advantages. Team USA used momentum from the penalty kill to push possession toward the Slovak end of the ice.

Slovakia committed back-to-back penalties to put Team USA on a 5-on-3 power play for 21 seconds an opportunity they would take advantage of. Off an offensive zone faceoff Jack Peart (Grand Rapids Minn.) skated along the blue line and dished the puck to Logan Cooley (Pittsburgh Pa.) in the slot. Cooley found the tape of Matt Knies (Phoenix Ariz.) with a no-look pass who beat Slovakian netminder Simon Latkoczy to give the U.S. a 1-0 lead with less than 10 minutes to go. The U.S. struck again while on the extended power play as Matt Coronato (New York N.Y.) sent a cross-ice pass to Mackie Samoskevich (Newton Conn.) who wound up for a wrist shot to the top of the net.

Slovakia was held shotless in the middle frame for the opening 19 minutes. The U.S. increased its lead thanks to Landon Slaggert (South Bend Ind.) cleaning up a loose puck in front of the net. Defenseman Wyatt Kaiser (Ham Lake Minn.) skated hard into the zone and created a rebound opportunity for Slaggert who tapped in the puck sitting loose in the crease.

Martin Chromiak put Slovakia on the board early in the third off a power play goal. Commesso continued to stand tall in his net to keep it a two-goal game after he stopped a flurry of shots with 16:10 to go in the period. Coronato looked to widen the lead back to three off a breakaway opportunity but Latkoczy blocked it aside. Slovakia responded pulling within one as the team emptied its net for an extra attacker with 2:33 to go.

Slovakia gave one final push in the final minute but Team USA held true to secure the win.

Commesso stopped 23 shots in the victory

Team USA continues preliminary round play in the 2022 IIHF World Junior Championship Tuesday (Dec. 28) against Switzerland in Red Deer Alberta at 4:30 p.m. ET. All games can be streamed on NHL Network.

NOTES: Drew Commesso (Norwell Mass.) was named U.S. Player of the Game… The U.S. outshot Slovakia 42-25… Team USA was 2-for-3 on the power play while Slovakia was 1-for-4… For more information about the 2022 IIHF World Junior Championship click here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzL21hZ2F6aW5lLzIwMjEvMTIvMjYvYmxhY2stYWN0aXZpc3RzLWNoYXJnZS1nZW5vY2lkZS11bml0ZWQtc3RhdGVzLXN5c3RlbWljLXJhY2lzbS01MjYwNDXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | 70 Years Ago Black Activists Accused the U.S. of Genocide.

Huff. Gamble a composer lyricist and vocalist was born on August 11 1943 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Huff a pianist composer vocalist and percussionist was born in the neighboring city of Camden New Jersey on April 8 1942. The two met in the 1950s when they both performed in Philadelphia R&B group called the Romeos.

Gamble and Huff wrote their first top 5 hit “Expressway to Your Heart” in 1967. The song was performed by the Soul Survivors. A year later 1968 Gamble founded the Gamble Records label which produced “Cowboys to Girls” by the Intruders. The song peaked at no. 1 on the Billboard R&B chart and no. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In 1971 however Gamble and Huff formed a partnership that established the Philadelphia International Records label which in turn created what would be known as the Philadelphia Sound.

Over their 17-year career this duo has composed more than 3500 songs including 50 top R&B hit singles. Their compositions received 75 gold (500000 copies sold) platinum (one million copies sold) and multi-platinum (two million or more) certifications. They worked with numerous artists including Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes the Intruders McFadden & Whitehead Jerry Butler Phyllis Hyman Archie Bell and The Drells Dusty Springfield Billy Paul Wilson Pickett Joe Simon Labelle the Spinners and the Jacksons (after Michael Jackson left the Jackson 5). Their work included Jerry Butler’s “Only the Strong Survive” (1969) which peaked at no. 33 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and “For the Love Of Money” performed by the O’Jays which peaked at no. 3 on the U.S. Billboard R&B chart in 1973.

In 1973 Gamble and Huff were commissioned by Soul Train host Don Cornelius to compose a new theme song for the show. Working with the label’s 30-member house band called MFSB (Mother Father Sister Brother) they created T.S.O.P. (The Sound of Philadelphia)” which sold over a million records. The following year (1974) that theme song won “Best R&B Instrumental Performance” at the 17th Annual Grammy Award. In 1975 Don’t Leave Me This Way” performed by Thelma Houston peaked at no. 3 on the Billboard Disco charts and then returned to the charts in 1979 where it became an international hit rising to no. 5 on the UK chart and no. 13 in Sweden. Their last album was Keep it Coming by the Jones Girls in 1984.

In 1990 at the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards Gamble and Huff won a Grammy Award for “Best Rhythm & Blues Song” for Simply Red’s cover of the single “If You Don’t Know Me By Now” which they originally wrote for Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes in 1971. In 1999 they received the Grammy Trustees Award for their overall contribution to the music industry and in 2005 they were inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame for their outstanding achievements as producers. In 2008 Kenneth Gamble and Leon A. Huff were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the non-performer category. Two years later in 2010 the duo gave the commencement address at Berklee College of Music in Boston Massachusetts and afterward both received Honorary Doctor of Music Degrees from that institution.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRyYWRlbWFnLmNvbS90b3AtMjAtdS1zLWNpdGllcy1mb3ItZ2xvYmFsLXRyYWRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TOP 20 U.S. CITIES FOR GLOBAL TRADE,"Tom Wadlow

[shareaholic app=""share_buttons"" id=""13106399""]

The year 2020 was like no other for global trade. Even when news of the coronavirus outbreak in China began to be picked up on U.S. airwaves few could have imagined quite how far-reaching and devastating the pandemic’s impact would become. And we are still feeling the effects both in public health and economic terms today.

This certainly adds an extra dynamic to the latest list of top exporting cities in the USA. Despite the economic standstill caused by lockdowns and restrictions on movement of goods and people there are a handful of cities that actually managed to increase their year-on-year value of goods exported in 2020–take Corpus Christi and Portland both able to sneak into the top 10 as a result.

They join the usual suspects such as Houston New York and Los Angeles which despite suffering substantial losses in global trade because of the pandemic still comfortably make the top three.

Indeed 2020 was still a big year for the 392 metropolitan areas of the United States which in total exported $1.3 trillion in goods. Although this is a $194 billion drop on 2019 almost one-in-four metro areas grew their export trade demonstrating a healthy sign of resilience as the U.S. economy seeks to bounce back from a difficult period.

Read on to find out which other cities complete the list of America’s most valuable exporting hubs which is comprised using metropolitan area export trading data from the International Trade Administration.

1 – Houston TX

Total value of goods exported in 2020: $104.538 billion

The Houston metropolitan area was by far the largest exporter last year amassing well over $100 billion of goods sales to markets abroad. Almost $18 billion of this went to Mexico with Canada Brazil China and Japan the other key destinations. Oil and gas chemicals and petroleum and coal products dominate Houston’s exports between them accounting for around 80% of export revenue. Whether by land air or sea Houston offers an impressive array of logistical and distribution channels to move goods to other countries around the world including the No. 1 foreign trading port in the United States. Its location which is equidistant from East and West coasts also provides strategic advantages.

2 – New York NY

Total value of goods exported in 2020: $75.745 billion

Although exporting activity dropped by more than 13% in value last year due to the pandemic New York is still comfortably the second biggest generator of global trade in the country. Canada is comfortably its largest trading partner with more than $11.6 billion of exports heading across the border in 2020. Other key export destinations for New York include Switzerland Mexico Hong Kong and China. In terms of sectors chemicals metals computer and electronics and transportation equipment represent the most prolific in terms of goods exported. The New York Governor’s Office also recently unveiled the state’s 2021 infrastructure plan a $306 billion program which will help to fuel export growth in future years.

3 – Los Angeles CA

Total value of goods exported in 2020: $50.185 billion

Los Angeles thanks to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach is home to the largest seaports complex in the western hemisphere. It is therefore no surprise that the city ranks highly as a top center for global trade: In 2020 just more than $50 billion of goods were exported representing a steep decline of nearly 18% on 2019. However despite being badly hit by the pandemic Los Angeles still sent several billions of dollars’ worth of goods to Mexico Canada Japan China and Germany which make up its top five export markets. Computer and electronics goods are the city’s biggest export with just over $10 billion in international sales in 2020.

4 – Chicago IL

Total value of goods exported in 2020: $41.279 billion

The Windy City ranks fourth in the USA for global trade with exports of more than $41 billion in 2020. Unlike many other major U.S. cities Chicago was relatively shielded from the pandemic impact in terms of exports only suffering a 2.7% drop on 2019 levels. Canada and Mexico are its largest exporting destinations followed by China Germany and Japan with chemicals being the most valuable export sector ($7.596 billion). Chicago’s other key exporting industries include computer and electronics transportation equipment machinery and agricultural products. Its central location also makes it a strategic hub for business reflected by the fact that a quarter of all American freight traffic passes through the city.

5 – Dallas TX

Total value of goods exported in 2020: $35.642 billion

Dallas was less protected against the economic standstill created by the COVID-19 pandemic suffering a 9.7% drop in export businesses during the course of 2020. However the city still managed to export the fifth most goods in terms of value last year. Around half of this income came from the transportation equipment and computer and electronics sectors with U.S. neighbors Canada and Mexico once again representing the top two exporting destinations. Dallas is in an extremely well-connected part of the country with Texas being the top state for rail miles and public roads and also home to formidable port and airport facilities.

6 – New Orleans LA

Total value of goods exported in 2020: $31.088 billion

New Orleans is one of America’s most important cities when it comes to the global trade of agricultural products. Last year more than $15.7 billion of export income was derived from this busy sector with other significant contributions coming from petroleum and coal products processed foods oil and gas and chemicals. Unlike many of its fellow heavyweight exporting cities New Orleans’ primary exporting destination is China by some considerable distance with $7.864 billion of goods being sent there in 2020. Mexico is a distant second registering $2.9 billion in imported goods from the city. Japan the Netherlands and Colombia make up the rest of New Orleans’ top five export markets.

7 – Detroit MI

Total value of goods exported in 2020: $30.715 billion

Detroit is another city where a specific exports sector dominates. In this case it is transportation equipment which accounted for over half ($16.686 billion) of all exporting value in 2020. Among the key transportation goods produced and exported from Detroit are spark ignition engine trucks weighing over five tons large and mid-sized cars as well as parts and accessories. The city’s exports took a huge hit as a result of the pandemic 2020’s figure being more than 25% down on 2019’s value. Mexico and Canada meanwhile continue to be Detroit’s major export destinations with the third and fourth most valuable markets being China and Spain respectively.

8 – Miami FL

Total value of goods exported in 2020: $29.112 billion

Three of Miami’s top five exporting destinations are with southern neighbors most notably Mexico Brazil and Colombia which between them account for about a sixth of all exports. This is no surprise given Miami’s favorable location on the southeastern tip of the United States but the city also makes it easy for Latin American businesses to trade–helped by the fact it is blessed with multimodal infrastructure and is considered the America’s second-largest financial hub. Its most exported goods include computer and electronic products transportation equipment and chemicals with other key exporting destinations being Canada and Germany. Last year saw Miami take a heavy pandemic hit with exports down 18% versus 2019.

9 – Corpus Christi TX

Total value of goods exported in 2020: $28.784 billion

Corpus Christi is America’s foremost oil and gas export hub and is almost unique in registering a year-on-year growth in export revenues in 2020 which were up by $1.97 billion (7.3%). The Port of Corpus Christi saw a massive 65% growth in crude shipments last year a remarkable feat given the immense volatility experienced in the global crude market. A major reason for this growth has been the recent development of pipeline infrastructure into the port from key production sites in western Texas. Corpus Christi’s major exporting destinations are mostly found in Europe and Asia with the top five export markets comprising China the Netherlands the UK South Korea and Taiwan.

10 – Portland OR

Total value of goods exported in 2020: $27.824 billion

Completing the top 10 U.S. cities for global trade is Portland. Like Corpus Christi it saw a considerable rise in the value of exported goods in 2020 reaching over $28.8 billion and growing by 17.1% ($4.062 billion) on 2019 export revenues. Given its proximity to Canada it is little surprise to see its North America neighbor ranking in Portland’s top three exporting destinations. However the city does far more business with Mexico and especially China which alone accounts for more than a third of all export income ($9.784 billion). Here there is strong demand for computer and electronics products as well as machinery and agricultural goods.

The rest of the top 20

11 – El Paso TX ($27.154 billion)

12 – Atlanta GA ($25.790 billion)

13 – San Francisco CA ($23.864 billion)

14 – Seattle WA ($23.850 billion)

15 – Boston MA ($23.234 billion)

The next highest-ranked group of cities sees us journey around the States from El Paso in the South to Seattle up in the far Northwest.

El Paso just misses out on featuring in the top 10 but not by much. It’s huge trade with Mexico saw it amass more than $27 billion in exports in 2020 the majority of this involving computer and electronic goods. Next is Atlanta which relies heavily on transportation equipment exports for its revenues with Germany Canada and Mexico all acting as key trading destinations. San Francisco adds another Californian city into the top 20 for global trade thanks to its notorious technology scene; Belgium Canada and the three major East Asian economies of China Japan and South Korea being the most valuable export markets there. Seattle also enjoys sizable export activity with China and nearby Canada most notably in transportation equipment and food products. Completing the top 15 is Boston which only saw a slight drop of 1.2% in exporting revenue in 2020 once again its key markets being China and Canada along with Germany Mexico and Japan.

16 – Philadelphia PA ($23.022 billion)

17 – Cincinnati OH ($21.002 billion)

18 – San Jose CA ($19.534 billion)

19 – San Diego CA ($18.999 billion)

20 – Minneapolis MN ($17.109 billion)

The final group making up the top 20 U.S. cities for global trade starts with Philadelphia which is one of the country’s most prolific traders with the United Kingdom. Indeed the UK is second only to Canada in terms of the value of goods received from the Pennsylvanian city with the chemicals sector being the most valuable exporter.

In Ohio Cincinnati makes the top 20 despite seeing a drop in exports of 27% last year. Despite this the city still managed to export more than $10.5 billion of transportation equipment. The next two largest exporting metropolitan areas both reside in California with San Jose ranking No. 18 thanks to its strong technology sector exports and healthy trading relations with major Asian economies such as China Taiwan and Japan. San Diego at No. 19 enjoys far stronger trade with Mexico its main exporting sectors being manufactured goods computer and electronic products chemicals and machinery. Completing the top 20 is Minneapolis whose key export destinations include Canada Mexico and China with strong exporting activity in the machinery chemicals and electronics sectors.",,,

How exciting! There’s no shortage of amazing things to do in Mexico City — the largest city in North America — which has something for all types of travelers.



In fact with no end to the cool things to see planning a trip to Mexico City (CDMX for short) might intimidate you. As with all big cities you could spend a year in CDMX and still discover new things to do. If you keep in mind that you’ll never see it all in one trip that helps make planning a bit less stressful.

You can however make it a priority to see all the things on your own bucket list so you have the best Mexico City trip possible. This list covers all the highlights in this huge metropolis and all the places that most travelers will enjoy to get to know Mexico City.

Best Things to do in Mexico City

Get your map here to follow all the things to do in Mexico City

Ready to discover the Top 10 things to do in Mexico City? Let’s get to the list starting with the one place that’s outside of Mexico City limits but a must-visit — the Teotihuacan Pyramids.

1. Climb Teotihuacan Ruins

The pyramids at Teotihuacan (pronounced tay-oh-tee-wok-on) are among the oldest and most important of all Mexico archeological sites. It is one of the 35 Mexico UNESCO World Heritage Sites and sees about two million visitors each year — which ties with Chichen Itza Ruins.

With such an important place you will want a guide to show you around and explain the history and symbolism all around you. There are plenty of great Mexico City to Teotihuacan tours and all the best ones include transportation so you don’t have to worry about how to get to Teotihuacan.

Though located only 35 miles (50km) away the drive or bus ride to Teotihuacan from Mexico City can take more than two hours in bad traffic; it’s normally about 75 minutes. The way to keep travel time to a minimum is to leave Mexico City by 7:30am and arrive at 9am when they open.

This strategy will serve you in two ways. Most ruins in Mexico including Teotihuacan don’t have much shade. As historians and archeologists conduct research at the site often the trees have been cleared for their ease of study meaning visitors don’t have many shady areas.

When you arrive at Teotihuacan early you beat both the traffic and the heat. If you want to climb all three Teotihuacan pyramids (Pyramid of the Sun Pyramid of the Moon and Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl) it’s best to do so before the midday sun starts beating down.

After 3-5 hours exploring the entire Teotihuacan site Sculpture Garden and Teotihuacan Museum head to the nearby La Gruta restaurant. La Gruta meaning “the cave” is in fact located underground in a cave!

2. Visit Frida Kahlo Museum

The most famous Mexican artist of all time Frida Kahlo lived until her last day in the Coyoacan neighborhood of Mexico City. Coyoacan is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city with buildings dating back to the 16th Century.

There are many things to do in this part of the city but none is more popular than visiting the Casa Azul or Blue House. The Casa Azul was actually Frida’s bright blue home where she lived with her family until her death in 1954.

The Frida Kahlo Museum has been well-preserved and you can see both Frida’s art and the surroundings that inspired her — as she was bedridden during the years she painted. For die-hard Frida fans there’s also the Diego & Frida Studio House and Dolores Olmedo Museum which has the city’s largest collection of her art.

Casa Azul is non-traditional in that it’s her home and not a proper museum. While it is definitely a large house it has a capacity restriction most museums don’t. As one of the top sites in Mexico City it sells out most days so purchase tickets in advance to make sure you get in.

Before leaving Coyoacan head to the Mercado de Coyoacán (Coyoacan Market) for some tostadas. This colorful and lively locals’ Mercado is great for photos and many say it has the best tostadas in Mexico City.

3. See the Underground Templo Mayor

One of the most fascinating sites in Mexico City is actually partially buried underground! The Templo Mayor (Main Temple) was once the seat of the Aztec Empire during King Montezuma’s reign — when the city was still known as Tenochtitlan.

During the Spanish conquest they buried the temple underground to show their dominance over the Aztecs. They also used some of the bricks to construct the Catedral Metropolitana the massive Mexico City cathedral located only steps away.

In 1978 some Mexico City electrical workers came across the temple by accident while digging near it. This began a decade-long excavation project to unearth the temple. Today you can tour the temple remnants and visit the Templo Mayor Museum to see artifacts discovered during the excavations.

4. Explore Centro Historico and Zocalo

The Templo Mayor is one of the coolest places in Centro Historico (Historic Downtown) but it’s not the only one. Downtown Mexico City and the Zocalo (Main Square) is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with plenty of history monuments and museums to warrant spending a full day there. Here are some highlights of things to do in Mexico City’s Centro Historico.

Palacio Bellas Artes

If you’ve seen any photos of Mexico City there’s a good chance you’ve seen the Palacio Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts). This classical European building is itself a work of art but make sure to head inside and see the impressive art deco interior.

Metropolitan Cathedral

The giant Catedral Metropolitana (Metropolitan Cathedral) is one of the 30 largest churches in the world with a capacity of about 6750 people. Of all of Mexico City’s gorgeous churches and there are many this is the grandest. When inside don’t miss the largest pipe organs on the Americas Continent.

Palacio Nacional

The 650-foot-long (200m) Palacio Nacional or National Palace spans one entire city block! It is located next to the cathedral in the Zocalo or Main Square. Inside there are most of the federal government offices though many people visit to see the four murals by Mexican artist Diego Rivera which depict the four phases of Mexico’s history.

Auditorio Nacional

If you are looking for unique things to do in Mexico City Shen Yun performs annually at the Auditorio Nacional. Auditorio Nacional is an entertainment center that is considered one of the best venues for specialized theater which is fitting for Shen Yun.

Shen Yun is a performing arts show that features classical Chinese dance a live orchestra stunning costumes and captivating digital backdrops. It is an interactive multimedia dance show that transports the audience to ancient China filled with myths and legends. Booking tickets to Shen Yun is a chance to immerse in an unforgettable cultural experience and witness the beauty and grace of Chinese dance and music. Get your tickets here.

Barrio Chino (Chinatown)

In most of the world’s big cities you’ll find a Chinatown — and Mexico City’s no different. Though Chinatown in Mexico City isn’t huge you can enjoy a nice walk through the area to take some photos of the colorful paper lanterns that hang above the streets and the large red arch at the neighborhood’s entrance.

Torre Latinoamericana (Latin American Tower)

The 44-story Latin American Tower is one of the most iconic buildings in Mexico City’s skyline. Take the elevator up to the Mirador (Observation Deck) on a clear day for some of the best city views. It costs $200 pesos ($10USD) to access the Mirador so don’t bother on cloudy or foggy days as you won’t see much.

5. Xochimilco Boat Ride

The Floating Gardens of Xochimilco (pronounced so-chee-mill-co) is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The canal system here was hand-dug by the Aztecs centuries ago. The plots of land throughout the canals called chinampas were used for farming. When people needed to buy food they’d canoe through the canals to each farm.

Today Mexico City locals and visitors alike flock to Xochimilco to ride on the brightly-colored trajineras (gondolas). The large trajinera boats can accommodate about 15 people each so many head to Xochimilco with large groups and for parties.

Besides the trajinera boats that carry Xochimilco visitors other boats will float by yours with vendors selling tacos snacks and beer. You’ll also see mariachi boats with full bands on board which will serenade you for about $250 pesos ($12.50USD).



You can hire a boat for as long as you’d like but standard Xochimilco tour cruises last 2-3 hours and cost about $1000 pesos ($50USD). The boats operate both day and night as locals party late into the night at Xochimilco especially on weekends and holidays.

6. Stroll Reforma Avenue

Angel of Independence on Reforma Avenue

Tree-lined Avenida Reforma (Reforma Avenue) is one of the main roads in Mexico City. All along this street you’ll see street art and statues including the Golden Angel de la Independencia (Angel of Independence) a Mexico City landmark. If you walk all the way west down Reforma you’ll wind up in Chapultepec Park.

7. Visit Chapultepec Park & Castle

Bosque de Chapultepec (Chapultepec Forest or Chapultepec Park) is one of the most-visited urban parks on Earth. It is also massive at about 1700 acres (7 square km)! Given its size and number of attractions you could spend a week here and not see everything.

Within Chapultepec Park you have the Castillo de Chapultepec (Chapultepec Castle) nine museums two lakes prehispanic ruins the Chapultepec Zoo and more — so you have to be selective with your time. For most visitors Chapultepec Castle is a must see in the park.

This is North America’s only true castle as it’s the only one on the continent that at once housed members of the royal family. The former home of Emperor Maximilian I and Empress Carlota is now one of the top attractions in Mexico City.

8. Marvel at the Anthropology Museum

The Museo Nacional de Antropología (National Museum of Anthropology) is located inside Chapultepec Park. Though that park has nine museums in total this is its most popular museum. In fact the massive Anthropology Museum is the most visited museum in Mexico City.

Inside you’ll journey back in time through Mexico’s record history starting with the ancient Olmec civilization which lived about 4500 years ago! You can see one of the giant Olmec head sculptures in the museum as well as the Aztec Sun Stone Coatlicue Sculpture and more.

9. Wander Roma & La Condesa

Roma and Condesa are two of the best neighborhoods in Mexico City with some of the top restaurants and bars in the city. These are mostly residential areas but there are some great shopping tree-lined streets beautiful parks nice homes cool street art and hip sidewalk cafes in both neighborhoods.

Located right next to one another you can spend some time strolling them both. For architecture lovers you’ll see buildings in design esthetics ranging from colonial to mid-century modern and art deco — each one more charming than the next.

When you need a break from walking head to Parque Mexico or Parque España two of the nicest parks in Mexico City. There are also some great brunch cafes in the area like Panaderia Rosetta Lalo and Maque or for a lunch meal head to Contramar Lardo and Pujol el Molino.

10. Eat Mexico City Tacos

The last and perhaps most important of all things to do in Mexico City is eat tacos! In this city each street has a few options for both restaurants and street food tacos and it’s actually hard to eat back tacos in Mexico City.



Now some places are definitely better than others but don’t be afraid to try anywhere that catches your attention especially if there’s a long line (a very good sign). If you want to check out the city’s best head to Taquería Orinoco El Hidalguense and Por Siempre Vegana Taquería for vegan tacos.

Final Thoughts: Things to Do in Mexico City

We’ve reached the end of the list — though it barely scratches the surface of Mexico City things to do. For first-time CDMX visitors however these are the must-sees. After visiting the places on this list you’ll have a better idea of the lay of the land and on your next trip you’ll want to venture off the beaten path.

Will it prompt a rethink of government support?,"Open this photo in gallery: A visitor to the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station in Clarington Ont. looks out onto the facility grounds during a tour in February 2016.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

Ontario Power Generation’s selection of GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy to help build a small modular reactor (SMR) at its Darlington station in Clarington Ont. set in motion events that could shape Canada’s nuclear industry for decades to come.

OPG’s choice announced in December is the BWRX-300. It’s a light water reactor the variety most popular in developed countries and quite unlike Canada’s existing fleet of CANDU heavy water reactors. Though not exactly small – the BWRX’s 300-megawatt nameplate capacity is roughly equivalent to a large wind farm – it would produce only one-third as much electricity as traditional reactors. It would use different fuel produce different wastes and possibly have different safety implications.

The Darlington SMR would be the first BWRX-300 ever constructed. By moving first OPG hopes Ontario will become embedded in a global supply chain for these reactors.

“OPG ourselves we don’t really get anything out of it – it’s a lot of work” said Robin Manley OPG’s vice-president of nuclear development. “Our goal is to have as many contracts signed with Canadian suppliers as we possibly can.” But that might not satisfy some critics who’ve protested OPG’s selection of a U.S. design by GE Hitachi which is based in North Carolina.

It does seem to confirm the end of Canada’s tradition of homegrown reactors. The BWRX-300 would be Canada’s first new reactor since Darlington Unit 4 in Ontario completed in 1993. According to Mycle Schneider Consulting the average age of the country’s 19 operational reactors is 38 years. Attempts to update the CANDU design proved largely fruitless; OPG and Bruce Power opted to refurbish reactors at Darlington and Bruce stations to operate another few decades while sizing up SMRs as a possible next act.

Time is running short. This decade is widely regarded as crucial for building emissions-free generation capacity. SMRs will be late to that party even if this BWRX-300 is built on time. Delays and cost overruns ever-present risks with any reactor could kill its prospects.

The partnership with OPG represents a major coup for GE Hitachi a U.S.-Japanese alliance that set up its SMR subsidiary in Canada less than a year ago. There are at least 50 SMR designs worldwide but most exist only on paper; vendors compete vigorously to sell to experienced nuclear operators such as OPG because they represent an opportunity to build a bona fide reactor that might entice other clients. For the same reason OPG’s decision is a blow to the losing candidates Oakville Ont.-based Terrestrial Energy Inc. and X-energy an American vendor.

“There’s lots of enthusiasm among nuclear reactor designers developers and national laboratories and academic nuclear engineering departments” about SMRs said Edwin Lyman director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists who published a report on SMR reactor designs in early 2021. “There’s a lot of supply but there’s not much demand because utilities don’t want to be guinea pigs.”

Nuclear industry executives and government officials hope the Darlington SMR will be the first of many deployed in Ontario and beyond. SaskPower is also shopping; it has collaborated with OPG since 2017 and said the BWRX-300 is among its candidates. Canada has a small population so observers doubt the country could support supply chains for multiple reactor designs.

But OPG’s selection of an American SMR has drawn some sharp criticism. Some observers assumed Terrestrial enjoyed a home turf advantage particularly in light of the federal government’s decision to invest $20-million toward its Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR). The Society of Professional Engineers and Associates a union representing engineers and others working on CANDU reactors complained that “priority should have been given to Canadian design.”

“It is a slap in the face for Terrestrial” said M.V. Ramana professor at the University of British Columbia’s Liu Institute for Global Issues. “It is not a good sign for Canada’s nuclear industry.”

Prof. Ramana added that OPG’s decision may prompt a rethinking of government support to SMR developers. In addition to Terrestrial’s funding Moltex Energy received $50.5-million from the federal Strategic Innovation Fund and the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency to advance the Stable Salt Reactor-Wasteburner it is working on in New Brunswick. ARC Clean Energy received $20-million from New Brunswick’s government toward its ARC-100 reactor.

“If these companies are not able to persuade OPG then maybe we should stop funding them” he said.

But observers said that of OPG’s three publicly-announced candidates GE Hitachi was the conservative choice. Whereas most SMR vendors are startups that have yet to build a single reactor GE Hitachi has been in the business since the mid-1950s. The BWRX-300 is billed as the 10th generation of the company’s light water reactor design.

“I would bet money that that was the decisive factor” Mr. Lyman said. “Its supply chain is probably better established than these other designs that have very little or no operating experience and have a whole lot of other unknowns associated with them.”

Other experts have reached similar conclusions. Tractebel an engineering firm that has worked on nuclear projects in 20 countries assessed dozens of SMR designs for Estonia a couple of years ago. The BWRX-300 made its short list favoured as a simple “proven technology.” (Terrestrial also scored highly but Tractebel concluded molten salt reactors such as its IMSR are further off.)

Unlike CANDUs which consume unenriched uranium light water reactors require fuel enriched to increase Uranium-235 content. Mr. Lyman said that by adopting any non-CANDU design Canada will become dependent on enriched fuel imported from the U.S. Europe or elsewhere.

The industry would also need to learn how to dispose of unfamiliar wastes. The Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO) which is in the final stages of selecting an underground storage site for Canada’s radioactive spent fuel said spent BWRX-300 fuel would generate more heat and radioactivity than CANDU fuel but could be stored in fewer containers placed further apart.

“We will learn from our international partners who already have plans to permanently store this type of waste in a deep geological repository” the NWMO said in a statement.

All this assumes OPG’s reactor gets built. To begin with the BWRX-300 actually isn’t licensed to be built anywhere. GE Hitachi is participating in the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission’s Vendor Design Review through which it receives early feedback from the regulator on its reactor. Completing that process would confirm the CNSC didn’t find any features that would be offside from Canadian requirements.

After that GE Hitachi would need a construction licence. Like other SMR vendors GE Hitachi pitches its SMR as including “passive” safety features meaning during an accident the plant would have sufficient water and electricity to operate without intervention for days even weeks. A safer reactor might also be a cheaper reactor: For instance the SMR might require less containment than traditional designs and thus less concrete. GE Hitachi says the BWRX-300 occupies less than 10 per cent of its predecessor’s volume. But the CNSC would first have to agree the reactor has really earned lower safeguards.

“It’s pretty early on in the licensing process” Mr. Manley acknowledged. “We as the operator are very confident that we will be able to license this reactor.”

But critics say completing the reactor by 2028 is a tall order. According to Mycle Schneider Consulting one in eight reactors that have begun construction since 1951 were never connected to the grid. Many survivors meanwhile arrived years later than promised.

Mr. Manley said 2028 is “an aspirational goal” rather than a hard deadline. The project schedule will firm up over the next two years.

OPG has yet to publish a cost estimate but according to a report published by PwC the SMR project “is expected to spend $2-billion over seven years.” That’s already higher than the US$1-billion price tag GE Hitachi promised for a BWRX-300 in 2019. (In public presentations GE executives declared that keeping the price below US$1-billion was crucial to its plans to exponentially grow its customer base.)

Even so Mr. Manley said OPG’s intention is that the SMR will be cost competitive with other clean energy options.

Prof. Ramana said cost escalation is practically inevitable. The AP1000 reactor a pressurized water reactor from Westinghouse that produces 1110 megawatts was originally supposed to cost US$2-billion. But the price of the two-unit Vogtle plant in Georgia was estimated at US$14-billion and later rose above US$30-billion. Westinghouse’s marketing materials emphasized that the reactor has been tremendously simplified making it less expensive to build operate and maintain.

“Historically the vendor estimates have always been far far lower than what the actual costs are going to be” Prof. Ramana said. “I don’t think there’s any reason to expect this to be different.”

Mr. Manley conceded that during the past two decades large nuclear plants “have been challenged to get done on schedule and on budget.” But that’s one reason OPG decided to build an SMR. They “are lower capital cost simpler smaller and therefore faster and easier to get built” he said.

This also won’t be the first time OPG has managed a complex high-risk capital project. The company says the $12.8-billion refurbishment of its Darlington station now half-complete is on time and on budget. That experience has demonstrated that “when we take the time to plan the job properly we are able to come up with a good estimate and a good schedule that we’re able to meet” Mr. Manley said.

When global pharma majors like Glaxo Smith Kline Bristol Myers Squibb Amgen or Baxter need a reliable partner to co-innovate today they turn to Syngene.

Jonathan Hunt MD & CEO of Syngene spoke to BusinessLine on what sets the company apart in the competitive CRAMS space and the road ahead. Excerpts:

Recently Amgen renewed its research collaboration contract for five more years. You seem to have sticky customers who work with you for longer periods instead of the traditional industry norm. What is different?

That is because of our business model. What we do including how we operate doesn’t have a lot of precedents in India. Some tend to look at us as just another derivative of the Indian generics industry but we are not. We are a services business focussed on science and innovation.

Inside our campus is the mindset is that we are a People’s Republic of the United States FDA (Food & Drug Administration). We operate in a highly regulated industry that has controls checks and balances apart from governance and rigour. We operate to a single standard of global science driven by excellence and a high compliance regulatory mindset. Whether it’s the US FDA European or Indian regulators we meet and exceed their standards every day. It is one of the things that reassures our global clients.

We don’t do much with Indian partners because the Indian life sciences industry is not yet fully focused on innovation. Our global partners range from companies in Australia to Japan Europe and of course North America. What they’re looking for is intellectual collaboration and added value.

Twenty years ago one would come to a company like Syngene for something scientifically simple but done well. However today they’re coming to Syngene because we can intellectually match their thoughts and innovation debate with them add value collaborate and drive science along with them.

Haven’t CRAMS or even CDMO (contract diagnostic and manufacturing) services been offered earlier by a number of players including the likes of Divi’s and Cadila?

Not really. Unfortunately the nomenclature doesn’t help. It’s like alphabet spaghetti in some ways with CRAM’s CDMO or R&D discovery services.

Our focus as a company is more towards the research innovation piece the front end. So think of us predominantly as scientists in labs doing innovative experiments. If you look at some of the companies you mentioned for instance Divi’s I think they’re a really good company. However they are downstream of that into the manufacturing. And they do that well but it is different from innovating up the value chain. So we’re a little bit further upstream.

Predominantly where we overlap is manufacturing. If you look over recent years some capital investments and expansion that we’ve put in place has gone into increasing our development organisation. We run on four different divisions — Discovery Services the traditional heartland and by value and volume the biggest today; Dedicated Centres a specialised form of discovery research for the likes of Amgen; Development Services the scientists in the lab working out formulations and processes; and Manufacturing where we work out how you do things at scale.

Divi’s for example is particularly strong at manufacturing. In the pharma industry the average timeline from having an idea to getting a product to the market would be 10 to 12 years. We do a lot of work in years 1/2/3 even into year 4. Some of the organisations that you describe are more active in years 7/8/9/10.

Does such co-innovating reflect in your margins?

On a global basis across our Chinese European Indian or other competitors our margin structure is above average and often upper quartile. It might vary slightly depending on what we’re doing on the capex side. We’ve been a high-growth business for a decade or more and we’re constantly scaling and growing. So some margins are compressed by that sort of investment.

The more you are seen as a scientific equal and a source of good ideas and problem-solving solutions the stickier clients are and longer the contracts will be. We’ve created a culture a workforce and a set of processes that add value and we want to ring-fence and protect it. So we have worked on becoming a platform for integrative drug discovery that allows us to sit not just with big clients but with players of all sizes. Today we count among our clients eight of the top 10 and 18 of the top 25 biopharma companies in the world.

We offer a good fit for innovative start-up biotechs. We are (nearly) a 30-year-old company of real scale breadth depth and experience who they can collaborate with. Because they’re small organisations they don’t have masses of departments to manage contracts relationships and outsourcing. They want to meet as scientific collaborators and for us to really contribute to their growth.

You have more than 400 clients. Beyond the pharma sector what other segments are witnessing growth?

The animal health segment is growing well. Six of the top 10 animal health companies have their antecedents in being divisions within pharma companies. We also have clients in the nutraceutical and cosmetics business. They are a good adjunct to our core business.. But actually the core business is human health whether it’s pharma or biotech mega-cap corporations or innovative start-ups.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Technology executives say this year’s supply-chain bottlenecks which have hit parts for everything from iPhones to Ford F-150s are particularly acute in chips that don’t shuffle zeros and ones. Analog chips treat incoming information about temperature sound and electrical current more like a human would on a scale with many gradations.

Among the biggest analog chip makers is Dallas-based Texas Instruments founded in 1930. TI engineer Jack Kilby is credited with inventing the integrated circuit in 1958.

Students and engineers know TI for its hand-held calculators which it still makes. But its $170 billion market capitalization is built on its dominance in analog chips where it holds 17% to 20% of the world market this year according to Taiwan-based market research firm TrendForce.

While makers of sophisticated digital chips such as Intel Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. get most of the spotlight a lack of analog chips costing a few dollars apiece can hold up supply chains for products with tens of billions of dollars in sales.

Samson Hu co-chief executive of Taiwan-based laptop maker Asustek Computer Inc. recently lamented that his factory assembly lines were getting disrupted by a shortage of analog chips managing battery use or amplifying sound effects. He used an abbreviation for the term “integrated device manufacturer"" a class of companies including analog-chip makers that design and make their own chips.

“The uncertainty as we have observed lies with a certain big American IDM company "" Mr. Hu said in November on an earnings call. He didn’t name the company but industry officials said that based on Mr. Hu’s description of the big company’s products he was talking about Texas Instruments. A spokeswoman for Asustek declined to comment and representatives for Texas Instruments didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.

Mr. Hu said he expected supply from the American company to remain tight until its capacity expansion next year. TI has said a new $6 billion factory is set to open in Richardson Texas in the second half of 2022.

Apple Inc.’s chief executive Tim Cook talked in an October earnings call about the billions of dollars in sales opportunities Apple is losing because parts shortages mean it can’t make enough iPhones and other devices. Mr. Cook referred to “legacy nodes"" a term for older production processes that encompasses analog chips and some digital chips.

“The chip shortage is happening on legacy nodes"" Mr. Cook said. “Primarily we buy leading-edge nodes and we’re not having issues on leading-edge nodes. But on legacy nodes we compete with many different companies for supply.""

Besides Texas Instruments major analog-chip makers include Analog Devices Inc. of Wilmington Mass. and two European companies Infineon Technologies AG and STMicroelectronics NV.

Industry executives and analysts say TI’s problems in meeting demand resemble those of other companies but that it tends to get more attention because of its leading position.

Texas Instruments says it is doing its best to serve customers and acknowledges that some aren’t getting everything they want. “Clearly we’re well below where we want to be"" in inventory said Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi in an October earnings call.

The company has new capacity in the works that it says will require tens of billions of dollars in investment with construction starting next year on two factories in Sherman Texas.

At a September investor conference Chief Executive Rich Templeton cited this road map in asking for patience. “You cannot change your capacity footprint in substantial ways inside a year or two"" he said. “We’d love to have more capacity now. But there’s a lot of things in life you’d love to have.""

Texas Instruments has 15 manufacturing sites world-wide. Apple includes TI on its supplier list and names eight TI locations including Texas Maine Taiwan Japan and China’s Sichuan province. People involved in the Apple supply chain say TI parts have been one factor in shortages of products such as the iPhone this year. Apple declined to comment.

TrendForce the research firm said in a December report that analog-chip makers have a backlog of orders from automotive customers stretching to the end of 2022. Consumer-electronics makers are also dealing with monthslong waits and higher prices it said.

The world’s biggest and most valuable chip makers—Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Samsung and Intel—have spent tens of billions of dollars on new capacity. Generally these chips have remained plentiful.

Yet of the 50 or so chips crammed into the latest high-end smartphones only four or five fall into the leading-edge category say executives and analysts in the industry. The others include analog chips that perform tasks such as powering the phone’s display or managing its battery charger.

The analog-chip makers tend to design manufacture and sell chips themselves which is why they are included in the category of integrated device manufacturers. Advanced digital chips by contrast are often designed by one company and made by another typically a specialized “fab"" such as TSMC.

In volume terms about 80% of the world’s semiconductor production comes from IDMs said Zhao Haijun co-chief executive of China’s biggest contract chip manufacturer Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.

At an industrial forum in November in Shanghai Mr. Zhao said major IDMs were four to five months behind in meeting demand and usually didn’t build much wiggle room into their plans.

“A shortage of 5% could lead to a crazily surging price"" he said. “This is precisely the result of inflexibility along the supply chain.""

Yet analog-chip makers have been cautious about expanding because of the industry’s history of booms and busts. Texas Instruments executives have said they want to be disciplined in addressing customer demand.

“At some point they’ll have too much product and that’s what creates the cycles in our industry"" said TI’s investor-relations head Dave Pahl on an earnings call in October. “So it won’t surprise us if the cycle comes to an end at some point. We’ll be prepared for that.""

Bahrain all set to launch first stage of health insurance for expats

TDT | Manama

The Daily Tribune – www.newsofbahrain.com

Bahrain is all set to boost ahead to a more advanced phase of its ambitious health care project designed to provide mandatory health insurance for expatriates in the Kingdom.

The project dubbed Mandatory Private Cooperative Health Insurance Programme (PCHIP) for Expatriates is nearing the launch of its first stage.

This development is as per a tender launched by the Supreme Council for Health seeking a supplier to “perform specific tasks” during the first stage. According to the tender board the tender attracted two companies.

Aon Bahrain quoted BHD 210000.000 and Marsh (Bahrain) Company quoted BHD 5287586.000 for taking up the work. A successful vendor SCH says should provide administrative and brokerage services for the first stage of the programme concerning mandatory health insurance for residents.

Tender Board however says that the company quoting the lowest amount may not necessarily award the tender as price becomes a principal concern only after fulfilling technical and other criteria set.

National Health Plan

As per Health Insurance Law No. 23 of 2018 health insurance is mandatory for all citizens residents and visitors. The decision is also part of the National Health Plan (2016- 2025) that paves the way forward for the health industry in Bahrain.

One of the main objectives of the Plan is the adoption of the Social Health Insurance Programme (SEHATI) to develop the quality of the current health system and ensure sustainability.

Sehati on way

Recent reports say that the National Health Insurance Programme Sehati will be implemented early next year by launching a self-management project at health centres and government hospitals on a trial basis. The scheme is expected to cover expatriates in the second quarter of next year and nationals early 2023.

How does autonomy for primary healthcare centres works?

Under the new system each individual will get paired with a family physician.

The family physician will provide therapeutic and preventative services: such as vaccinations and early detection of diseases such as cancer diabetes and others. If specialist care is needed the patient will get it through a secondary healthcare hospital.

Follow up will be through a family physician at the primary healthcare centre. Hospitals will also be granted more autonomy in the direct day-to-day running of their activities regarding budgeting and human resource capital.",,,,,,

( ) — A new year could mean a necessary upgrade to a new phone. Major mobile carriers will be shutting down their 3G networks in 2022 rendering older phones useless.

The retirement of the 3G network is to make room for more advanced networks like 5G which is much faster.

Once the 3G network is shut down 3G cell phones will not work.



In addition some older 4G phones that do not support HD Voice (VoLTE or Voice over LTE) will also stop functioning. This means users will not be able to make or receive calls and texts even to 911.

Data services will also be unavailable on those devices. AT&T said it will shut down its entire 3G network by February 2022.

T-Mobile which merged with Sprint said it will fully retire Sprint's 3G network by March 31 Sprint's 4G LTE network by June 30 and T-Mobile's 3G network by July 1.

Verizon said it will completely shut down its 3G network by Dec. 31 2022.

The Federal Communications Commission said other carriers like Cricket Boost Straight Talk and some Lifeline mobile service providers use the networks of AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon. As a result phones under those carriers could also be affected.

The major mobile carriers have each set up web pages with more information on their plans to phase out their 3G networks. The web pages include lists showing which phones are affected.









Those who need to get new phones to avoid a loss of service are advised to ask their providers about trade-in offers to upgrade at a discount or no cost.

A Verizon employee says users should log into their accounts to see what upgrades they are eligible for.

Verizon said it initially announced it would shut down its 3G network in 2019. But the carrier pushed back the date to help its customers transition to newer devices.

Verizon said more than 99% of its customers are on the 4G LTE or 5G network and less than 1% are using 3G.

The FCC said the retirement of the 3G network will not only affect phones but other electronics like medical devices tablets smart watches SOS services in vehicles home security systems and other products connected to the 3G network.

Check out the fancy tech,"Apple iPhone 14 is still months away from launch. However in a bizarre sort of way the rumors around the features that the 2023 models presumably called Apple iPhone 15 have already started making their way to the internet. The iPhone 15 Pro model is rumored to be getting rid of the physical SIM card slot. Apple Inc which introduced support for eSIM on its iPhone XR iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max is now reportedly planning to ditch the physical SIM card slot from the future iPhones.

Apple iPhone 15 features tipped

Also read Looking for a smartphone? To check mobile finder click here.

A Brazilian publication has reported that the Apple iPhone 2023's Pro models iPhone 15 Pro will not have physical SIM card slots and will feature eSIM technology for connectivity. The upcoming iPhones are speculated to come with dual eSIM support. However it's not clear if the non-Pro models will have the physical SIM card slot or they too will rely on eSIM technology for connectivity.

That Apple's planning to ditch the SIM card slot is not that surprising as the tech giant is said to eventually move to a portless iPhone and ditching the physical SIM card slot looks like the first step to that.

Though Apple might launch an iPhone without a SIM card slot the company is expected to continue to offer a version with a physical SIM slot in countries where eSIM service is unavailable.

However these are just rumors and it is too early to say something about the features of iPhone 15 which might get launched in 2023. These all are speculations and there's no concrete evidence to back any of these reports. Earlier rumors about Apple planning to remove the Lightning port from its iPhones had surfaced on the internet too. However ultimately there is so much interest in the iPhone topic that even the slightest information gets blown out of proportion.

Indubitably the tech giant has been introducing new features for its users regularly. The company first introduced Qi wireless charging technology in its iPhones back in 2017 with the launch of the iPhone 8 series and the iPhone X. In 2020 Apple also introduced a host of MagSafe-branded wireless charging devices.

What the latest rumor does is hint that the company is inching closer to introducing portless iPhones one upgrade or device at a time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY2l0aWVzL2NoZW5uYWkvcHJvdGVzdC1lbXBsb3llZXMtdGFtaWwtbmFkdS1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LWZveGNvbm4taW1wcm92ZS13b3JraW5nLWNvbmRpdGlvbnMtNzY5MDQ1Ni_SAYkBaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NpdGllcy9jaGVubmFpL3Byb3Rlc3QtZW1wbG95ZWVzLXRhbWlsLW5hZHUtZ292ZXJubWVudC1mb3hjb25uLWltcHJvdmUtd29ya2luZy1jb25kaXRpb25zLTc2OTA0NTYvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After protest by employees Tamil Nadu govt asks Foxconn to improve working conditions,"The Tamil Nadu government Saturday asked the Taiwanese electronic equipment major Foxconn to come up with a slew of measures to improve the working conditions and quality of living of contractual employees attached to their operations in Chennai.

The government had to intervene after the employees protested and complained about the poor quality of food at work and the hostels resulting in several workers getting admitted to different hospitals.

In 2020 Foxconn had pledged to invest over Rs 7000 crore in expanding facilities including to assemble premium products such as Apple’s iPhones.

The communication sent by the additional Chief Secretary in-charge of Industries S Krishnan and the additional director general of Police P Thamarai Kannan to the company management on December 23 listed out a number of suggestions including efforts required to improve the quality of employees’ rooms washrooms water and other basic amenities at the hostel. The communication also specified that the rooms of employees should be properly ventilated.

Obtaining necessary permission from the district collector for the employees’ hostels and taking steps to cook the food served to employees within the place of their accommodation were among the government’s suggestions.

It also advised the company to ensure granting of emergency leaves for employees when it is required and suggested an alternative arrangement to ensure the required strength of employees through a manpower agency when a section of employees goes on leave.

A government statement issued in this regard said Foxconn assured that it will urge their contractors to provide quality food for all 15000 employees working for the company and promised that they will expand their facility and operations providing employment for more people soon.

La direction de l'entreprise publique invoque sa baisse de fréquentation et un changement d'habitudes des usagers tout en assurant qu'un commerce voisin est d'ores et déjà prêt à reprendre le flambeau en assurant le rôle de Relais de la Poste. Une décision qui a toutefois du mal à passer auprès des syndicats et de certains habitants et commerçants du quartier.

Des habitants et commerçants dépités

A l'annonce de cette fermeture imminente les habitants oscillent entre surprise incompréhension et résignation. ""C'est dommage. On utilisait ce bureau de Poste et c'était bien pratique car on est à deux minutes à pied"" réagit Laure. Ce n'est toutefois pas si étonnant pour Pierre déjà résolu à faire autrement : ""On voit que successivement dans les campagnes ou maintenant dans les villes les bureaux de Poste ferment. On essaye de s'adapter.""

Difficile quand même de s'y résoudre pour Pascal Hébras qui tient une cordonnerie à deux pas du bureau de Poste également entouré de plusieurs autres commerces. ""C'est un coup dur car c'est un service qui est important pour tout le monde. Moi le premier j'y allais régulièrement. En plus ça va faire un grand local vide ce qui n'est jamais bon pour une galerie marchande.""

Du changement pour des horaires élargis

De son côté la direction de la Poste assure que rien n'est perdu pour le quartier du Roussillon grâce à l'alternative proposée au sein du bureau de tabac de cette galerie marchande. En devenant un Relais de la Poste à partir du 10 janvier il permettra aux usagers de réaliser les opérations les plus courantes : acheter des timbres envoyer des recommandés ou encore expédier et recevoir des colis. Son avantage c'est d'être ouvert sur une plus grande amplitude horaire mais ça ne suffit pas pour le syndicat CGT FAPT de la Haute-Vienne car il faudra tout de même prendre sa voiture et aller ailleurs pour les opérations financières par exemple.

Il rappelle aussi la décision récente de fermer deux services du centre financier du groupe dans l'ex-capitale régionale.

Le mouvement d’Eric Zemmour Reconquête ! en Gironde a dénoncé vendredi dans un communiqué « la bassesse de la mairie de Bordeaux » assurant que mercredi matin « des agents (municipaux) ont pénétré dans la cathédrale (Saint-André) afin de le retirer ».

""C'est honteux et très bas d'instrumentaliser Noël pour servir la propagande électorale haineuse d'Eric Zemmour"" a réagi Laurent Guillemin l'adjoint au maire notamment en charge du culte. Contacté par l'AFP le diocèse de Bordeaux explique que le sapin a effectivement été retiré de l'entrée de la cathédrale mais d'un ""commun accord"" avec la municipalité après avoir compris que son installation quelques jours plus tôt sur la place Pey-Berland était le fait d'un ""groupe politisé"".

""On évite que des éléments très politisés soient présents dans des lieux de culte pour des raisons de neutralité"" a justifié l'abbé Samuel Volta vicaire général du diocèse.

Samedi dernier Génération Z le mouvement des jeunes partisans du candidat à l’élection présidentielle Eric Zemmour s’était vanté sur les réseaux sociaux de l’installation d’un sapin de Noël haut de 3 m sur la place de la cathédrale. Soit à quelques mètres du sapin de verre de la municipalité de Pierre Hurmic vertement critiqué il y a un an pour son refus d’installer « un arbre mort » à Noël. « L’idéologie écolo en péril face à l’éternité de nos traditions françaises » avait tweeté Génération Z.

Face à cette occupation « sans autorisation » la municipalité avait demandé que l’arbre soit déplacé. « Un groupe de jeunes a proposé au sacristain de le récupérer et ne sachant pas de qui il s’agissait il a accepté comme on accepte aussi des fleurs on reçoit souvent des dons » a relaté l’abbé Samuel Volta. Par la suite l’Église a « jugé bon de ne pas garder le sapin ». « Il nous semblait mieux de ne pas jeter de l’huile sur le feu » a souligné le vicaire qui ne souhaitait pas non plus voir l’arbre « gaspillé ».

La quantité de maïs importé et destiné à l’alimentation de la volaille et des bovins est estimée à 4 millions de tonnes par an a indiqué dimanche à Alger le ministre de l’Agriculture et du Développement rural Mohamed Abdelhafid Henni.

En marge des travaux du 9e congrès de l’Union nationale des paysans algériens (UNPA) le ministre a appelé à « trouver des alternatives à travers la culture de ces céréales dans le sud algérien ce qui permettra de réduire la facture d’importation ».

Le développement de l’agriculture saharienne est une des priorités du gouvernement qui s’emploie à étendre les espaces agricoles dans ces régions pour promouvoir la production agricole notamment la production de céréales pour éviter leur importation a expliqué M. Henni qui a invité les jeunes à investir dans les régions sahariennes assurant que « toutes les facilités leur seront accordées ».

Le secteur compte axer ses efforts sur le développement des produits agricoles stratégiques comme les céréales le lait et les viandes blanches a indiqué le ministre estimant que le déséquilibre que connaissent ces produits sur le marché était dû à « la désorganisation du réseau de distribution et de vente au détail ».

S’agissant des prix des produits alimentaires M. Henni a indiqué que ses services veillaient en coordination avec les services du ministère du Commerce et de la Promotion des exportations à ce que la marge bénéficiaire des commerçants ne dépasse pas 20% dans le cadre de la lutte contre la spéculation et la hausse des prix notamment à l’approche du mois de Ramadhan.

« Les commerçants sont tenus de respecter une marge bénéficiaire inférieure ou égale à 20% » a précisé M. Henni en marge des travaux du 9e Congrès de l’Union nationale des paysans algériens (UNPA) assurant que les secteurs de l’agriculture et du commerce « veilleront à ce que ce taux ne soit pas dépassé ».",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZXRlbGVncmFtbWUuZnIvZmluaXN0ZXJlL3F1aW1wZXItMjkwMDAvZGVzLXJlc3RhdXJhbnRzLXF1aW1wZXJvaXMtc3VyLWxldXItMzEtZGVzLWNvdGlsbG9ucy1wbHV0b3QtcXVvbWljcm9uLTM5MDI1NDIucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Des restaurants quimpérois sur leur 31 : des cotillons plutôt qu'Omicron,"À l’heure du passage à la nouvelle année il faudra raison garder et ne pas danser sur les tables. Mais le soir de la Saint-Sylvestre il sera possible de goûter aux plaisirs d’une bonne table. Des restaurateurs quimpérois ont pris la décision d’ouvrir ou d’assurer un service à emporter aux petits oignons. À force d’épreuves les brigades sont devenues des dures à cuire. Si le contexte invite au scepticisme (fermeture des discothèques interdiction de grands rassemblements menaces de nouvelles restrictions) l’heure n’est pas toujours à jouer les Cassandre mais bien à se mettre au piano. « On ne s’est pas posé la question trop longtemps. Très vite la décision a été prise d’ouvrir pour les réveillons » expose Tiffany Payen la cheffe de rang au Prieuré.

La vente à emporter fait un carton « Des réservations depuis novembre » L’établissement de Locmaria sera ouvert le midi et le soir du 31 décembre. Les premières demandes de réservation remontent au mois de novembre. « Comme la pression sanitaire était moins forte on a eu très vite des retours de clients ». Conséquence le restaurant des bords de l’Odet affiche complet pour le réveillon de la Saint-Sylvestre (60 couverts) et - c’est une première à cette date - accueillera au déjeuner un mariage d’une trentaine de convives. Hormis cet évènement familial « il y a beaucoup de réservations de petites tablées ».

À l’auberge du Ti-Coz on coupera - une fois n’est pas coutume - la poire en deux. « On est toujours ouvert lors des réveillons. Mais cette fois le risque nous a fait douter. C’est trop stressant ». Valérie Despinasse qui tient cette institution quimpéroise depuis 24 ans avec son mari Jean-Christophe a fait le choix unique des menus à emporter pour les réveillons. « C’est désormais une alternative qui fonctionne très bien. L’équipe a eu le temps de se roder lors des périodes de fermeture ». En un mois le carnet de commandes s’est rempli avec déjà plus de 150 réservations. « C’est un autre métier qui réclame de l’organisation et une autre cuisine. Pour la Saint-Sylvestre on sera fermé la veille pour assurer la préparation des repas ». Les restaurateurs y voient aussi une manière de maintenir le lien avec leur clientèle qui préfère jouer la prudence en festoyant à domicile.

Dr. Dorothy Jean Tillman II was only 10 when she became a freshman at the college of Lake County majoring in Psychology. In 2020 she earned her Master of Science from Unity College. She was accepted in 2021 when she was 15 into the Doctor of Behavioral Health Management Program at Arizona State University.

Speaking to ""Good Morning America"" Tillman said she has always held education in such high regard in part due to her family's background.

""People in my life like my grandmother who was part of the Civil Rights Movement she of course harped on the importance of education and consistently learning something always"" Tillman said.

""But the way I always held education so high on my own aside from being raised that way was finding different things to be educated about it doesn't just have to be all of the subjects that they teach you in school there's so many things in the world to learn about that we wish we knew about"" she said. ""I feel like that urge to learn something new just never didn't exist for me.""

Tillman said growing up she had always felt drawn towards psychology and related fields.

""They've always made me so curious"" she said. ""And so grinding away I could continue to study in that area. With even more that was attached to it. It was just really intriguing to me.""

In December 2023 at 17 Tillman successfully defended her dissertation to earn her doctoral degree in integrated behavioral health from ASU's College of Health Solutions. On May 6 she walked at ASU's commencement ceremonies.

Tillman told ""GMA"" prior to the big day that she was feeling ""so excited"" just like any other student.

""I love having a reason to celebrate and throw a big soirée"" she said. ""Just that walk and especially with people I haven't been there seeing every day since my program is online it's just gonna feel really fulfilling to finish.""

Dr. Leslie Manson a clinical associate professor at ASU told ""GMA"" that Tillman is the youngest person in school history to earn a doctoral degree in integrated behavioral health.

""It's a wonderful celebration and we hope ... that Dorothy Jean inspires more students"" Manson said adding of Tillman ""But this is still something so rare and unique.""

Throughout Tillman's time at ASU Mason said she saw her growth in gaining the skills of professional writing as well as leadership noting that Tillman is ""inquisitive"" and ""intelligent.""

""She has innovative ideas and motivation which is wonderful"" Mason explained. ""And truly I think what is inspiring is that she embodies that meaning of being a true leader.""

Mason added that ""other students can really learn the piece of dedication"" from Tillman.

""So that motivating energy those are the pieces that I think other folks can really turn to and feel inspired about"" she said. ""That curiosity is always there. And I think all learners come with that. But it's great to be able to see it in someone so young as well.""

Her inspiration and how she gives back to community

Tillman's journey to success wouldn't be made possible without the support from her mom whom she said is one of her biggest motivators.

""Seeing my mother consistently worked so hard to continuously uphold our family's legacy and be that person that everyone was able to go to if they needed anything... Always seeing [her] like [a] 'Wonder Woman' definitely made me want to grow up [into] an accomplished person"" she said.

An advocate for education Tillman is also the founder and CEO of the Dorothyjeanius STEAM Leadership Institute where she runs programs like summer camps to help kids find balance between arts and STEM subjects.

""I feel like adding art and putting a focus on it throughout science technology engineering and math makes the kids excited to learn all those things"" she said. ""And it opens them up to all of the possibilities and all the knowledge provided in that area of just STEM.""

As for her plans after graduation Tillman said she is ""just like any other teenager still figuring out what my specific dreams and goals are.""

""And I'm really just grateful that the world is my oyster and that I've done so much so young. And I have time to like kind of think that through"" she said.

Discussing her advice to other youngsters Tillman said she would remind them to be careful about being influenced on what they see on social media noting that some posts ""aren't real.""

""There's a lot more to whatever it is than what you're seeing you know and so to always remember that is definitely important"" she said. ""And to always remember that everyone has points in their life where they feel like they're figuring it out…And so figuring things out not knowing what you want isn't a bad thing. But making the choice not to sit down and try to figure it out is.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3R3by15b3VuZy1ib3lzLXNob3ctbXlydGxlLTE2MDc0MDM0OC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two young boys show up at Myrtle Beach area home. They say they were locked in a room,"Two “abnormally skinny” and bruised children showed up in the early morning hours to Socastee area home saying they had been dropped off at a nearby coffee shop according to an Horry County Police report.

The younger brother said they had been dropped of at a Dunkin’ around sunset on May 5 and walked to a house in the 6000 block of Bay Road around 12:30 a.m. May 6. The nearest Dunkin’ is a mile and a half from the house.

The two boys whose ages were not released were knocking on the side door and the woman at the home told them to go the front door. When she opened her door to the two boys one said he and his brother were cold and hungry and didn’t know where they were.

They said they don’t know the man who left them but that he had kept them in a locked room “for extended periods during the previous summer.”

The police report said the children were “abnormally skinny” and the kids told police they were given one peanut butter sandwich every one to two days. They both had bruising along their backs lacerations in various parts of their bodies potential infections and scars.

It appears from the police report that officers were able to locate people caring for the children.

One of the suspects stated he heard the children leave from the front door and saw them walking toward the entrance gate according to the police report. Another suspect said they had been taking care of the boys for around five years and had seven other children in the home. A walk through by police was then done.

As of Monday morning the case is still active and there have been no known arrests according to Horry County spokesperson Aaron Spelbring.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL29seW1waWNzL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvNDAxMzkyMzkvc2xvdmFraWEtdXBzZXRzLXVzLW90LWljZS1ob2NrZXktd29ybGQtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Slovakia upsets U.S. in OT at ice hockey worlds,"Open Extended Reactions

The elaborate stage production was a technical masterpiece with 37 countries participating for an audience of nearly 200 million people — larger than the Super Bowl Grammys and Oscars combined. But this year’s contest was also occurring against the backdrop of the war in Gaza in which an estimated 34000 Palestinians have died setting the stage for the most contentious Eurovision in the modern era. The week-long celebration of “unity” featured protests against Israeli participation that outnumbered the people inside the arena a Koran burning and Swedish police reporting credible hacking threats from Iran North Korea and Russia. ABBA never made an appearance.

This year was truly Eurovision’s Waterloo.

While Russia’s bloody conflict in Ukraine permeated every aspect of the contest these past two years Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza is different. Russia’s actions united the Eurovision coalition in response while Israel’s have left the EBU’s member countries bitterly divided. The furious debates over the war pose an existential threat to a contest that has always put its faith in the power of music to bring people together. As Stig Karlsen the head of Norway’s Eurovision delegation told me “They need to look at the rules… for a lot of people it’s becoming ‘divided by music.’”

The tension in Eurovision’s identity between a light-hearted music competition and a political event has always existed. Founded in 1956 the song contest was born into a fractured Europe still stitching itself back together after World War II. That first year Walter Andreas Schwarz whose father had been killed by the Nazis represented Germany with a song about how his country was not properly dealing with the legacy of the Holocaust. The years following featured Italy censoring its own act out of fear that the pro-divorce song would sway a controversial referendum and Francisco Franco using the contest to advertise his dictatorship in Spain. With the integration of Eastern European countries after the fall of the Iron Curtain the political moments continued. One contestant dodged sniper fire to escape from Sarajevo under lockdown all to sing about the suffering of his people on the Eurovision stage.

But as the fundamental disagreements in Europe subsided Eurovision entered its own “end of history” commonly referred to as the “Sweden Era” in the early aughts when Eurovision changed from a stodgy cultural program to a big splashy arena show in the style of “American Idol.” Anyone watching the broadcast Saturday night saw the legacy of the Sweden era in the flashy LEDs and pyrotechnics. But it now exists alongside a growing sense of a Europe politically divided.

In the 2010s concurrent with the rise of right-wing authoritarianism on the continent Turkey and Hungary withdrew saying the contest had become LGBT propaganda. Belarus left the contest after its two pro-Alexander Lukashenko anti-protest anthems were rejected. And Russia was kicked out after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. As the Deputy Director General of the European Broadcasting Union Jean Philip de Tender put it when I sat down with him “What’s happened over the last 10-15 years is we’ve become more values driven.”

It was after the invasion of Russia that modern Eurovision seemed to have come into its own. The 2023 contest in Liverpool engaged directly with the war as acts expressed solidarity with the Ukrainian people including an openly anti-Putin anti-war number from the Croatian avant-punk band Let 3. But though Eurovision seemed to have found its voice as many Eurovision singers know even the most confident voice sometimes cracks.

The tension in this year’s Eurovision was embodied by a performer in the very first semi-final. Eric Saade represented Sweden in the contest in 2011 with a song that could be an anthem for Eurovision’s desire for global chart success. The song’s hook repeatedly intones “I will be popular” over the kind of bubblegum track that has led to Swedish dominance of pop music worldwide so it made sense that Saade would open the week celebrating Eurovision’s rising prominence by performing his iconic song.

But Saade is also of Palestinian heritage and so performed his gleefully apolitical anthem with a black and white checked keffiyeh his father gave to him wrapped around his wrist. The European Broadcasting Union which organizes the contest instantly criticized him for politicizing the competition. Saade hit back by pointing out that as a cultural symbol it should be treated no differently from the kind of traditional folk garb normally celebrated by the contest (including 2022 Ukrainian winners Kalush Orchestra’s ‘Hutsul keptar’ vests). Unless of course the EBU views Palestinian identity as inherently political.

“For me and for the EBU the rainbow flag is not a political flag” Eric Saade said. | Jessica Gow/TT News Agency/AFP via Getty Images

The lack of consistent principles from the organizers opens the competition up to charges of hypocrisy. The show has a flag policy for instance that deems all flags that aren’t the national flag of a participating country as political. Except for the LGBT pride flag. To say that a Palestinian flag is political but a gay pride flag is not seems ridiculous on its face but de Tender disagrees. “We have been embraced by the LGBTQI+ community. They have built this event” he told me. “For me and for the EBU the rainbow flag is not a political flag.”

On one level he’s right: The contest has an admirable history of support for queer rights. But the core of his argument is essentially that the gay pride flag isn’t political because Eurovision has a heavily gay audience. In other words underneath the elaborate rules and distinctions the contest makes between “values” (good) and “politics” (bad) is simple coalition management.

I spoke with Ireland’s Bambie Thug who had been told by the EBU that they had to remove their body paint calling for a ceasefire (using a medieval Irish alphabet called Ogham) but were still allowed to hold the trans flag onstage. I asked them how the EBU could better navigate these distinctions. Their reply: “They need some heart … and some humanity.”

Nemo the Swiss non-binary artist who would become this year’s winner seemed to embody the difference in comfort in talking about these two issues. When I asked them about a statement they released in support of a ceasefire they moved quickly to safer territory “I would just recommend to go read [my statement]…. I think it’s important to use your platform to raise awareness. A lot of what I talk about is being queer … and just honestly being myself at Eurovision in hopes that it inspires other people.”

The attempt to reverse engineer principles out of what will keep the membership happy is a big part of the story of how we got to the chaos of this year’s contest. The truth of the matter is that in 2022 the European Broadcasting Union didn’t initially want to kick Russia out releasing a statement reaffirming the contest’s apolitical nature. The EBU reversed course only after an open revolt from their membership.

This year the EBU decided to keep Israel in claiming that Eurovision is technically a contest among public broadcasters more than nations (true); they didn’t kick Russia out they kicked Russia’s public broadcaster out for being a propaganda outlet. Since KAN (the Israeli broadcaster) is independent from the Netanyahu government (and because there wasn’t the same outcry among top officials at other public broadcasters) the reasoning went there was no reason to kick them out.

The counter argument is that during the opening flag parade Eden Golan walked on stage waving the Israeli flag not that of her country’s public broadcaster. When I pushed him on this de Tender responded “When Russia was suspended from the Eurovision Song Contest there was a broad consensus amongst the membership.” Again values sit on top of much more practical considerations.

And so Israel was allowed in Eurovision 2024 with the song “Hurricane” setting the stage for the most contentious contest in recent history.

Metal detectors were everywhere in the week leading up to the finals. Armed police were stationed on street corners by train stations and smack in the middle of the dance floor of the event’s nightly official after-party EuroClub. Karin Karlsson who headed up organizing Eurovision for the city of Malmo in both 2013 and 2024 explained “There was a lot of security in 2013 as well but you couldn’t see it. This time [the police] decided they wanted to be seen. Swedes we are not used to police officers walking around with rifles like that.”

This is not to say that Eurovision fans weren’t able to have their fun anyway. As an Australian tourist cheerfully remarked to me “My husband and I play a game where we count the snipers on roofs.”

The chaos of the situation poured onto the stage as even the acts most strongly associated with carefree Eurovision camp felt the need to comment. Windows95man a performance artist who achieved viral fame when a picture of him in his signature cut-off jeans and Windows 95 t-shirt was retweeted by John Cena looked pained when I asked about his decision to participate in Eurovision. “We got thousands of horrible messages and I needed to decide for the whole of Finland” he said. “So I was like totally alone. This was the first time ever I needed to say something political so it was quite stressful.”

Some artists never had any hope of avoiding questions about the issue. Bashar Murad who’s Palestinian competed to represent Iceland this year at Eurovision just narrowly losing out in Iceland’s qualifying round. Eurovision runs deep in Murad’s bloodstream: His father was a member of the iconic Palestinian band Sabreen and both of his parents spearheaded an effort to bring the Palestinian broadcaster into Eurovision. Bashar was headlining FalastinVision a competition among Palestinian artists that was part protest and part music festival.

At FalastinVision it was hard not to think that the discussion over Israel’s participation was missing a key element: Was the problem that an Israeli artist was represented on stage or that a Palestinian artist wasn’t? Murad put it well: “They’re allowed to be humanized on the world stage while we are not.”

The day before the grand final things had already reached a breaking point. First the Italian broadcaster accidentally leaked the normally embargoed results of the second semi-final showing that Israel had garnered the most Italian votes. The winner of Eurovision gets to host the next year so suddenly the organization was facing the prospect that its brand would be further entangled with the most visible humanitarian catastrophe of the day.

Shortly after Netherland’s representative Joost an artist who performs in what can only be described as a Christian Siriano take on a Hillary Clinton pantsuit had been ejected from the rehearsal after an altercation. Rumors hit the press center with a level of ferocity unusual in the recent history of Eurovision.

At a press conference the night before a member of the Israeli delegation told their act that she didn’t have to answer a tough question from a journalist and Joost sharply replied “Why not?” So some in the press room wrongly thought the altercation emerged out of a clash between the Dutch and Israeli delegations.

It turned out that Joost had gotten into a fight with a member of the EBU production staff but the incident was a perfect example of how nearly everything in this year’s contest gets viewed through the lens of Israel. By the next morning Joost was out of the contest and under investigation by Swedish police. His song “EuroPapa” about how internationalism can bring us all closer together was not heard on stage.

There’s a way in which the politicization of the contest and its push toward greater commercialization so often seen in conflict are one and the same. Eurovision’s concerted push to go after the coveted youth demographic as evidenced by the recent addition of TikTok as a major sponsor has transformed its core audience. The festival swapped out its older demographic for a generation that expects political engagement from its universities cultural institutions and even brands.

Even Andreas Magnusson the host of FalastinVision conceded “I don’t envy the position the EBU is in.” His belief is that countries at war shouldn’t be in the contest at all. That sentiment was echoed by Stig Karlsen when I spoke to him. But that invites a whole other set of questions especially for a festival whose recent high points have been defined by Ukrainian resistance.

As I watched the final results come in Saturday the story shifted from the discord over Israel to Nemo’s victory. The artist’s song a gleeful mix of genres and styles reflective of their non-binary identity represents the best of what Eurovision has to offer. I reminded myself of the long history of the contest: the years countries dropped out in protest the times when either because of expense or politics it was almost discontinued. Even ABBA’s win in 1974 was followed by discord in Sweden over the cost of hosting the competition. An entire protest festival was organized.

As much as these times have pushed Eurovision to the brink they’re also a reminder of the importance of institutions that bring a mass public of varying political opinions together. If Eurovision can find a way to include the voices that were left off stage this year without breaking it will remain an essential cultural forum for working through the major issues of the day. A tall order to be sure but one that very few institutions have come as close to achieving. As Eric Saade’s song “Popular” opens “Don’t say that it’s impossible.”"

This Christmas the coach and the team rode from Starkville to Memphis on a bus.

For that brief moment Saturday evening Leach thought back on a Christmas long ago when he was a fourth-grader growing up in Wyoming.

Leach was a fan of ""Daniel Boone"" a television series that aired for seven seasons until 1970 depicting the famous pioneer’s encounters with Native Americans. So that Christmas Leach received a Daniel Boone musket from Santa.

“Back then kids and dogs ran all over the neighborhood” Leach said. “It came in extremely handy when you went out in the backyard with your friends and played Daniel Boone.”

All these years later Leach still has a penchant for replica guns. He might not run around the neighborhood to play Daniel Boone any longer but the 60-year-old coach has long admired key figures from previous generations.

Leach and Buddy Levy wrote a book - “Geronimo: Leadership Strategies of an American Warrior” - that was released in 2014 following the life of the Apache leader.

So this Christmas amid all the preparations for facing Texas Tech (6-6) on Tuesday (5:45 p.m. ESPN) Leach unwrapped a replica of Geronimo’s .45 Colt rifle.

“I’m still debating whether to shoot it or not” Leach said. “They say you’re not supposed to shoot those commemorative ones but I haven’t ruled that one out yet.”

Dec. 25 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Ball Aerospace is celebrating today's launch of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) from French Guiana. The Colorado-based company designed and built the advanced optical technology and lightweight mirror system that will enable Webb to detect light from the first stars and galaxies.

Ball Aerospace designed and built the advanced optical technology and lightweight mirror system for NASA's James Webb Space Telescope that launched Dec. 25.

""It is truly an honor to be such an integral part of the next great space observatory"" said Dr. Makenzie Lystrup vice president and general manager Civil Space Ball Aerospace. ""Today's launch is the culmination of a lot of hard work by a closely integrated team that spanned across multiple mission partners and NASA. We are tremendously eager to see the science the new observatory captures.""

Announced as the Next Generation Space Telescope in 1996 and renamed James Webb Space Telescope in 2002 the space science observatory represents the largest and most complex ever built. Once on orbit Webb will capture faint light from the very first objects that illuminated the universe after the Big Bang.

To make this possible Ball Aerospace worked with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and Northrop Grumman the prime industry partner to innovate the 25 square-meter (~269 square feet) mirror system consisting of 18 beryllium mirror segments working together as one mirror. It will be the largest mirror and the first segmented telescope ever deployed in space operating at the extremely cold space temperature of -406⁰ F (30K) necessary for infrared imaging of distant stars and galaxies.

Ball also developed the cryogenic actuators mounted on each segment to control individual mirror positioning and curvature radius within one ten-thousandth the width of a human hair. To align the mirror segments Ball also designed the 22 electronic flight control boxes to operate in a deep-freeze space environment to individually control each of the 132 actuators that keep the telescope segments properly aligned on orbit.

To innovate validate and demonstrate technologies used to develop Webb's pioneering optical system Ball Aerospace drew on its in-depth experience with space hardware designed for all four of NASA's Great Observatories (Hubble Space Telescope Compton Gamma Ray Observatory Chandra X-Ray Observatory and Spitzer Space Telescope).

Ball is also playing critical roles in other upcoming space observation missions. It is partnering with Goddard to develop the Wide Field Instrument for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and providing the spacecraft bus and telescope for the Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx). Earlier this month the Ball-built Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) launched from Kennedy Space Center on its mission to uncover the inner workings of some of the most exotic astronomical objects in our universe such as neutron stars and black holes.

The total number of All-Star votes cast this season were 169519 a 39 percent increase from last year’s votes and the highest ever in the history of V League reflecting the heightened interest in volleyball in Korea.The All-Star match takes a K-Star versus V-Star format where men's and women's V-League clubs are divided into two teams according to their previous season's performance. Last season’s clubs that ranked first third and fifth become the K-Star team and the teams that came in at second fourth sixth and seventh become the V-Star team.The All-Star match will be played in four sets with the women’s two teams competing in the first and third set while the men’s teams will play the second and fourth match.This season the women’s clubs of the K-Star team are GS Caltex Seoul Kixx Industrial Bank of Korea Altos and Korea Ginseng Corporation. They will team up with the men’s clubs; the Incheon Korean Air Jumbos Ansan OK Financial Group Okman and Suwon KEPCO Vixtorm.The Heungkuk Life Insurance Pink Spiders Korea Expressway Corporation Hi-pass Hyundai Engineering & Construction Hillstate and Pepper Savings Bank AI Peppers of the women’s V League together with the men's Cheonan Hyundai Capital Skywalkers Daejeon Samsung Bluefangs Uijeongbu KB Insurance Stars and Seoul Woori Card Wibee make up the V-star team.All-Star title selection is based on fan votes conducted in four categories: striker center setter and libero. According to the vote results seven players of both the men's and women's V League are selected as All-stars: the top three strikers the top two centers one setter and one libero.The first time ever for one player to receive more than 100000 votes Kim received 113448 votes topping the votes of all center players and receiving the most votes across all clubs and genders in the history of the V League.The previous record was held by Suwon KEPCO Vixtorm’s Seo Jae-duck who was named the 2018-19 All-Star with 89084 votes. This time around Shin Yung-suk topped the men’s V League votes with a total of 99502 votes.At the Tokyo Olympics Kim became a three-time Olympian having played on the big stage alongside veterans like Kim Yeon-koung Kim Su-ji and Yang Hyo-jin who were the ones to achieve the women’s national team’s stunning fourth-place finish at the 2020 Tokyo Summer Games — a feat Korea had not been able to achieve since the 2012 London Games. Kim being voted as All-Star with a record-high number of votes indicates that the women’s V League has recently gotten more attention than ever no doubt thanks to the historical fourth-place finish at the 2020 Tokyo Summer Games.The All-Star match will take place on Jan. 23 2022 at Pepper Stadium in Gwangju.BY YUN SO-HYANG [yun.sohyang@joongang.co.kr]",,,,,,,,,

The quaint village of Saltford nestled between the bustling cities of Bristol and Bath is more than just a passing point along the A4 Bath Road. Despite its location on a key route it boasts a tight-knit community where ""everyone knows each other and feels like they belong"".

Once perceived as lacking identity Saltford has transformed into a thriving hub for families couples and young people. Over the past decade the village has embraced numerous changes evident in the 'sold' signs dotting almost every street corner. Its prime position along a busy A-road and the scenic Bristol Bath railway path make it an attractive place to settle down.

Saltford offers a diverse range of homes from luxury properties with expansive driveways and mechanical gates to charming cottages adorned with plants and flowers. It also houses hidden architectural gems like the grade II listed Saltford House believed to have been built in the 1700s by architect Thomas Bennett for his personal use.

Like any desirable location house prices in Saltford reflect its growing popularity. However data from Rightmove indicates that the overall average price of homes there was £492222 over the last year marking a 10 per cent decrease from the previous year reports Bristol Live.

According to Rightmove's records ""The majority of sales in Saltford during the last year were semi-detached properties selling for an average price of £487400. Detached properties sold for an average of £571500 with terraced properties fetching £425000.""

Saltford offers easy access to Keynsham's town centre with a mere stroll and city centres and rural pubs are just a short drive away. The public transport system is quite capable with two primary services between Bristol and Bath the X39 and 39 still running every half hour into the pre-dawn hours despite the 2023 bus cuts that affected other areas. Additionally there's the A4 an hourly airport service.

Saltford also boasts places like The Riverside Inn on the banks of the River Avon and Thai Cafe on Bath Road offering delectable meal options. Though Thai Cafe primarily serves scrumptious Thai food in the evenings it has become such an integral part of the community that it invites people in for a daytime cuppa.

During a 2022 visit Nikki the proprietor of Thai Cafe shared: ""Saltford has become the place to be. Everyone knows each other and helps each other out.""

""I have been here for about 20 years. It used to be mostly retired people who lived here but we are getting more families and young people now.""

Nikki pointing to the restaurant's interior expressed her gratitude for local support: ""People around the village have helped to make the restaurant what it is today. If something is broken someone will help and fix it.""

She continued to praise the community spirit saying ""People in the community helped me to get the restaurant up and running when we had to shut for eight months. Everyone is so nice and so helpful. That's what makes the village so great the people in it. I feel like I belong.""

Highlighting the perks of village life Nikki added ""In Saltford you have things like parking space. You don't get that in most cities. I also know that if I walk home at 10pm from work I will be safe. You don't get antisocial behaviour around here.""

Overlooking the bustling Bath Road Thai Cafe benefits from the traffic calming measures. ""Luckily traffic is slowed down because of the traffic lights"" Nikki remarked.

""We do get a lot of cars go by but people have to get to work and we understand that. Those people the people that drive through the village aren't the people that live here.""

As the warmer months roll in Saltford becomes a haven for wild swimmers kayakers and paddleboarders boasting a picturesque marina and the Bristol Avon Sailing Club making it a perfect destination for water enthusiasts.

Salford Parish Council is at the helm of addressing local concerns in the village. A spokesperson for the Parish Council shared with BristolLive their pride in the community stating: ""Many people who live and work in the village make Saltford a great place to be through their voluntary contributions which are celebrated annually through the Saltford Parish Council Community Awards. Much of the community activity is centred around Saltford Hall run by the Saltford Community Association.""

""Saltford is fortunate to have a community run Post Office and library on the A4 Bath Road as well as many active commercial businesses based around the village. Saltford is surrounded by green belt land which preserves its rural setting; care of the local environment is a matter close to many villagers' hearts as shown by the many members of the Saltford Environment Group and Saltford Wombles.""

""The village is served by the Bristol to Bath Railway Path which is popular with walkers and cyclists alike. As a rural community Saltford Parish Council welcomes considerate visitors who follow the countryside code who leave no trace of their visit by taking their litter home or use one of the many bins around the village. Saltford's residents appreciate considerate parking by visitors and use of public transport is strongly encouraged due to limited parking in the village.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzEyL3VwdG93bi1hcGFydG1lbnRzLXVudmVpbGVkLWluLXJlZGV2ZWxvcGVkLWRvd250b3duLWJhdGgtYmxvY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uptown apartments unveiled in redeveloped downtown Bath block,"The Midcoast’s housing crunch eased slightly this month as developers unveiled 60 new Bath apartments geared toward senior residents.

The new apartment complex called The Uptown features 60 mostly one-bedroom apartments for tenants aged 55 and older. The apartments are for mixed-income households with rents ranging between $794 and $1495 per month. Around 42 apartments are classified as low-income according to developer The Szanton Company.

A large crowd gathered for the grand opening of the redeveloped Moses and Columbia Block Buildings on the corner of Front and Summer streets on May 8.

“There’s a housing shortage here and everywhere in Maine so the fact that we have one unit still available before we even open our doors speaks to the need for housing” said The Szanton Company Vice President Amy Cullen.

Around 10 existing units were already open in the Moses and Columbia building with Szanton adding four more units there Cullen said.

Applications for The Uptown opened in January with the apartments filling up in about one month leaving just one unit available at the time of the grand opening. The new tenants started moving into The Uptown on May 10.

“There is a housing crisis in the state and Bath is no exception” said Bath City Council Chairperson Mary Ellen Bell. “The Uptown project builds density in the downtown recreates underutilized space and provides attainable housing for some of our older residents.”

The newest addition of the building that connects to the renovated Columbia and Moses housing block sits on what used to be an empty lot that was once home to the Bath YMCA. Szanton bought the historic Moses and Columbia blocks back in 2020 with construction beginning in the summer of 2022 according to Cullen.

“The rehab of the existing historic building Moses and Columbia block that this project contains had a lot more work than we expected” Cullen said.

Most of the new tenants come from the Bath area with some coming in from out of state.

“For years to come these affordable homes are going to be a remarkable and lasting tribute to those who have worked so hard for affordable housing in this City of Ships” said MaineHousing Director Daniel Brennan.

""These are the very very first customers to get a Mach-E in China"" Anderson Chan Dearborn-based international communications manager for Ford told the Free Press.

The company is hosting a series of ceremonies throughout China starting in Shanghai and Beijing that highlight the deliveries because the size of public events is limited by pandemic-related restrictions he said.

Ford released a photo early Sunday of one of its first buyers in China advertising executive Jin Zhang receiving keys in Shanghai from Mark Kaufman general manager of Ford China BEV Division. BEV stands for battery electric vehicle.

Chan said Zhang fell in love with the Mustang while studying in America.

25 mall sites and counting

In China Ford has set up 25 storefront sites in major metropolitan areas for customers to buy electric vehicles directly rather than go through a traditional dealership — and more sites are planned. This storefront model in which no test-driving takes place on-site has been popular in the U.S. with Tesla. It opened its first storefront in Michigan in 2017 at Somerset Mall in Troy.

In China Ford began setting up storefronts in 2021 where customers walk in see the vehicle learn about all-electric products and place orders Chan explained.

""We will continue growing these stores in the weeks and months ahead"" he said. ""We wanted to use this as an opportunity to show how we are understanding China's customers and their desire for direct access.""

The Ford direct-to-customer stores are not standalone sites but rather located in high-traffic shopping centers that offer other global brands he said.

""We started rolling out the stores earlier this year. This initiative will continue in the year ahead. It's very much China-specific"" Chan said. ""China's customers have begun to want to access vehicles through these storefronts. So that’s what we set up.""

China has younger buyers overall that do vehicle research in advance and want the convenience of immediate access Chan said. Vehicle service still is available at dealerships.

Steep competition

Chan noted that a number of major automakers in China offer this sales model which is used by Tesla in the U.S.

China is considered not just strategically important for automakers but highly lucrative based on its young and growing population air pollution concerns and government incentives for all-electric vehicles.

The top-selling all-electric vehicles in China so far in 2021 are made by the joint venture SAIC-GM-Wuling that includes General Motors Tesla and BYD an electric vehicle maker backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported CNBC in October.

The Mustang Mach-E SUV is produced by Changan Ford a joint venture between Changan Automobile and Ford and manufactured in Chongqing China.

Governments worldwide led by China and Europe have created public policies that spur the adoption of electric vehicles in an attempt to reduce pollution that contributes to climate change.

Earlier this year Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway invested $500 million in a Brazilian fintech start-up called Nubank. This development is noteworthy because Warren Buffett seldom invests in start-ups preferring to stick to his “circle of competence”. Back in 2018 his company had surprised the business community when it had placed a rare bet in start-ups by investing $300 million in India’s Paytm. Paytm was listed last month and Nubank this month. As several other start-ups queue up for IPOs and record amounts of dollars flow into this alternative investment space one observes that the start-up activity has truly turned mainstream.",,,

(Image credit: Future) Right - welcome to the first day of the rest of your life. Or... just the chance to start finding some top deals for you to spend your carefully-saved cash. Let's begin as time is of the essence: my first recommendation is the Apple Watch 7 which is on for its lowest-ever price at Amazon - reduced to just $339 for the 41mm GPS version. We're seeing a few 'deals' coming through that aren't as cheap as on Black Friday (don't worry we always try to flag these when we see them) but this appears to be a geunine saving - and as someone whose partner has inexplicably decided they want an Apple Watch for the first time in their life I'm suddenly on the lookout for a deal. Go get an Apple Watch 7 for cheap cheap cheap at Amazon

(Image credit: Future) If you didn't get the best-selling AirPods Pro over Christmas you can snag the noise canceling earbuds at Amazon's after Christmas sale for $179.99 (was $249 ). That's an $80 discount and the best price you can find right now.



While we saw the AirPods Pro drop to $159 during Black Friday the AirPods were on sale for $197 last week so this is still a great deal on the earbuds that are currently in stock and ready to ship. Get the best-selling AirPods Pro in stock and on sale at Amazon for $179.99

(Image credit: Future) If you're looking to add smoothies into your 2022 routine Walmart's after Christmas sale has the top-rated Ninja professional blender on sale for $69 (was $99.99). That's the best price you can find right now and $10 less than Amazon's current deal.

Where to go to safely check card balances,"Did Santa bring you a gift card this Christmas?

Year after year gift cards have been one of the most popular holiday gifts and 2021 was not an exception.

According to the National Retail Federation's annual holiday survey gift cards were the second most popular gift of the holiday season with 46% of shoppers planning to buy an average of three or four cards this year. Holiday spending on gift cards was expected to total $28.1 billion the highest since $29.9 billion in 2018.

And with supply chain challenges shipping delays and shortages more cards were expected to be placed in stockings than in past years.

►Gift card deals:The best gift cards on sale that make perfect last-minute gifts: Adidas Amazon Disney+ and more

But when consumers will redeem the plastic cards or digital codes is another matter. According to a Bankrate.com poll from July 51% of U.S. adults have more than $15.3 billion in unused gift cards vouchers and store credit. This adds up to an average of $116 per person in gift cards.

Use your Christmas gift cards ASAP

The rule of thumb with a gift card? Use it before you lose it.

The Federal Trade Commission recommends using the card as soon as you can. It also advises treating gift cards like cash and using them early to get full value.

Another good reason to use the cards sooner rather than later: the risk that the retailer or restaurant goes out of business.

While gift cards are often accepted after businesses file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in many cases they quickly become worthless. Sometimes there's little or no warning before a business closes.

“I generally tell people if they have gift cards in their wallet use them yesterday"" Melissa Jacoby a bankruptcy law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill previously told USA TODAY.

The Bankrate poll found 29% of adults have let at least one gift card expire 27% have lost at least one and 21% lost out because a business closed permanently before they used at least one card.

Check gift card balances (carefully)

It's important to go to the actual retailer or card website and to confirm you are at the right place before entering any information. If you're not careful you can wind up at a website that appears to be legitimate but could steal your gift card balance making it worthless.

USA TODAY has rounded up the sites to check the most popular store restaurant and credit card gift cards. This list is current as of Dec. 24. Another way to check balances is with store apps and some retailers like Target allow you to add gift cards to app wallets.

Tips for using gift cards

If you received a gift card here are some tips to get the most out of them:

The fine print: Read the card's terms and conditions. Pay close attention to whether the card is redeemable only at a certain store or location.

Fees: Some state laws bar service fees and expiration dates on store gift cards but the rules on cards branded with the name of a credit card company are stricter. These cards cannot expire for at least five years and cannot have a service fee deducted unless it has not been used in 12 months.

Bonus cards: It's holiday gift card promotion season a time when select restaurants and stores give bonuses with gift card purchases. If you receive a bonus gift card sometimes called bonus bucks most of these will expire. Check terms.

Protect your card: Some gift cards can be registered as credit cards on websites listed on the card which can protect them against theft or loss. Also take photos of the front and back of the card or write down card details as some companies will replace lost or stolen cards if you can provide specifics. Save receipts with card information too.

Easy to use and clean."" —Dean Cuba

Aaaand here's what BuzzFeed Food writer Hannah Loewentheil has to say about it: ""I'd been contemplating buying an air fryer for quite some time but it wasn't until I found myself cooking every night with my family due to COVID-19 that I finally decided it was the right time to get one. Friends of mine were raving about their new Instant Vortex Plus 6-in-1 Air Fryer so after reading similar feedback on Amazon I decided it looked like a winner. And it happens to be made by the same company that makes the crowd-favorite Instant Pot. I figured I would be using this appliance primarily as air air fryer but as an added bonus it can also roast broil bake reheat and dehydrate food.

""I've had this air fryer for about three weeks now and I can honestly say it's become the hero of my kitchen. It preheats quickly it's large enough to a good amount of food at once it's easy to clean and it makes food taste crispy on the outside and moist on the inside without any oil. I've been using my air fryer to make vegetables just about every night and it makes them taste so good. If you're cooking for kids picky eaters or you just don't get so excited about eating vegetables the air fryer could be perfect for you. If you like chicken the air fryer might change your life and I don't mean that to be dramatic. The air fryer produces restaurant-quality chicken that tastes absurdly decadent except there's no oil involved in the cooking — just air. We also tried making sesame chicken in the air fryer using boneless skinless chicken thighs. The sesame chicken tasted almost identical to my favorite Chinese takeout and it had nothing to do with my cooking skills. Thanks to the air fryer the chicken gets so crispy. I couldn't believe I made this at home!!""

Get it from Amazon for $114.99.

Projects slated for the following year weren't as lucky.

Thus this year's gaming news was rich with delays piping-hot launches unfinished messes and game publishers scrambling to fill their schedules with undercooked backup plans. And that says nothing about gamers themselves wondering if crucial chips and parts might ever be plentiful enough again so they can buy the latest in console and PC gear.

Yet against all odds fantastic games still crossed 2021's finish line ranging from big-budget behemoths to surprising indies. This year in an effort to reduce ranking-based ire and celebrate every game on our list we're removing numbered rankings with the exception of crowning a formal Ars Technica pick for Best Video Game of 2021 at the list's very end.

This alphabetical-order list includes everything from breathless praise to caveat-filled considerations but each game's ability to crack this 20-strong list is in our opinion indication enough that each game merits a second look.

Aliens: Fireteam Elite

If you're a regular Ars reader with a decently powerful PC or game console and hot opinions about the convergence of Ridley Scott HR Giger and Dan O'Bannon you'll likely find something to love about the first truly fun co-op game in the Aliens universe. Fireteam Elite keeps it simple: you and two friends use gadgets and big guns to take out waves of even bigger foes mostly in the form of xenos but eventually with Working Joes in the mix.

How does such a simple pitch compete with dozens of other co-op shooters on consoles and PC? AFE lands on this year-end list not because of refreshing new ideas but because of solid execution. Cold Iron Studios strikes a careful balance between twisty battle-arena design compelling enemy patterns interesting co-op strategy options and variable combat pacing while stringing together a lengthy varied campaign with increasingly dire stakes that (shocker) Weyland-Yutani has made a mess of. During each campaign mission momentum rises and falls in a way that perfectly befits leaving your mic on and catching up with your squadmates between intense firefights while class-specific perks and weapons force teammates to keep tabs on each other and interact meaningfully.

Advertisement

The latter quality stands in stark contrast to the lonely feeling I get in Back 4 Blood a 2021 co-op combat candidate that struggles to catalyze collaboration between squadmates. I need more reasons to interact with online gaming teammates in 2021 not fewer. AFE gets this right in a nicely executed package even if its difficulty spikes will likely push your squad to die-and-retry extremes.

Cruis’n Blast

Many racing games have crises of identity; they commit to neither realism nor ridiculousness and wind up nowhere. This is not the case with Cruis’n Blast which embraces the loud garish and playful spirit of the arcade to its fullest. This makes sense: the game was originally developed as an arcade exclusive in 2017 before being ported to the Switch this past September.

Cruis’n Blast is purely devoted to speed. You never have to take your finger off the accelerator once you’ve pressed the gas. When you hit a wall you don’t stop; your car simply does a 360-degree spin and keeps pushing onward. There is no mini-map in the bottom corner because even when you’re turning the only direction you go is forward. This is a game where you can still zoom straight at 145 miles per hour while drifting and angling your car sideways. It’s all lovingly absurd: you can drive a tank or hammerhead shark and race through dinosaur-ridden jungles or UFO-invaded cities. You can drift and pop wheelies in a stealth chopper (complete with accompanying car engine noises). You can do a barrel roll.

There’s no online multiplayer—though there is split-screen for up to four players which Ars appreciates—and plenty of other racing games have more cars and tracks. (Forza Horizon 5 which nearly made our 2021 list is a better bet on that front.) Each race is more of a ride than a competition: the AI has a heavy rubber-banding effect and every track has scripted events that occur right on cue. Winning is about using your nitrous oxide at the right time and doing Mario Kart drift-boosts as often as possible not taking turns correctly. Still playing Cruis’n Blast is a rush each race a two-minute burst of effects and colors and mayhem. You get in and go and the game never pretends to be something it’s not. It’s a big honking joyous dose of unreality.

Death's Door

As you scroll through this list currently arranged in alphabetical order you'll find other games that arguably breathe more life into familiar gameplay conventions than Death's Door does. By the time you get through roughly 15 minutes of this top-down adventure game you'll likely remark on its fusion of Zelda-like traversal and puzzles and Dark Souls-like mix of brutal battles dodge-and-attack mechanics and dead enemies' spirits as currency.

But as 2021 wound down to a close we at Ars couldn't let go of Death's Door as a top-notch spit-shine of both combined concepts much in the way that 2017's Hollow Knight took our breath away as a familiar-yet-brilliant retread of all things Metroidvania. Death's Door coaxes its players along with a Tim Burton-caliber plot about faking like the Grim Reaper but the real fun comes from how the studio Acid Nerve which previously released Titan Quest combines masterful combat controls with gorgeously rendered stop-motion-like worlds and monsters. So what if it's familiar—when the execution is this snappy to play and gorgeous to look at?

Even better after its debut earlier this year on PC and Xbox Death's Door has since trickled down to Nintendo Switch in the form of a solid 30 fps port—and we can't say the same for other similar games on this year's best-of list. So if your year-end gaming plans will largely be spent on Switch perhaps because you're lugging one along on vacation you're better off committing to Death's Door than Nintendo's own Switch-exclusive 2021 re-release of Zelda: Skyward Sword.

After Airbus and the peeling paint headaches of its composite A350 it now seems that Boeing may have a similar issue with its composite 787.

Composite materials bring substantial advantages in aircraft manufacturing and design. Aluminium has plenty of merits and it can be built into incredibly light structures too. But materials like carbon fibre have more elasticity which brings new benefits. The 787’s unusually “bendy” high aspect ratio wings are one of them.

But new materials come with new challenges. And it seems that after Airbus Boeing has its own peeling paint issues with its 787. To be clear Boeing maintains that the nature of this problem is different from that of Airbus’ A350. But it still relates to painting and composites. In this case the problem is in the wings of an unspecified number of 787s belonging to Air New Zealand.

Boeing Peeling Paint and Composites

The aluminium-alloy wings of previous aircraft designs usually have little or no paint on them. But planes like the Boeing 787 the Airbus A350 the smaller A220 and UAC’s MC-21 need paint (hopefully not peeling) on their composite wings. Like the fuselage in the A350 the 787’s wings also have a copper layer to help create a Faraday cage. This is to help guard against lightning strikes. But we don’t know if this peeling paint issue has to do with the way Boeing implemented this layer.

In the case of the fuselage of the A350 the paint the carbon fibre fuselage and the copper mesh between them have to stick together as the aircraft pressurizes and depressurizes expanding and contracting accordingly. This expansion is not an issue with a wing. But the wing bends up and down as it takes the plane’s weight. And the Boeing 787’s wing bends a lot – which makes it more challenging to keep the paint from peeling.

In this case it appears that Boeing believes the issue relates to UV light which degrades the paint. Like Airbus Boeing is adamant that this peeling paint is not a safety of flight issue. It’s also not an urgent issue to repair. According to reports Air New Zealand’s 787s will fly to the US next May to get new paint. They will also get a new protective layer against UV light to keep the issue from reoccurring.

Options for Fixes

This is a long-term solution. Boeing also offers shorter-term fixes like local touch-ups to take care of the peeling paint. The manufacturer states that it is working closely with its customers (plural) to address this cosmetic issue. So we can assume that more airlines have such issues with Boeing accommodating their needs to offer the right fix.

As we have seen Qatar and Airbus have now gone the legal route with regards to the A350’s paint issues. We also know that Qatar has a sizeable fleet of 787s: 30 787-8s and 7 operational 787-9s with more on order. Its aircraft are a bit older on average than those of Air New Zealand.

Like Boeing Airbus has offered to solve the peeling paint issues of its A350 customers. Qatar wasn’t happy with this solution however. It will be interesting to see how prevalent the issue is with the world’s 787 fleet. But unlike Airbus and the A350 Boeing and the 787 has more pressing issues these days.

In 1991 Behrends created the egg-sized bas relief image cast in sterling silver of four-time Indianapolis 500 winner Rick Mears. But it was another sculptor that created the images of Mears following his first Indianapolis 500 win in 1979 his second in 1984 and his third in 1988.



Behrends became the sculptor for the Borg-Warner Trophy in 1990 and his first face on the trophy was Arie Luyendyk. Behrends has been doing it ever since.

Behrends has sculpted all four faces for Castroneves on the Borg-Warner Trophy for his Indianapolis 500 victories in 2001 ’02 ’09 and ’21.



On Dec. 13 Castroneves came to Behrends’ studio in Tryon N.C. just a few miles from the North Carolina/South Carolina state line.



Castroneves spent several hours in a live study sculpting session as Behrends sculpted intricate details of the winner’s face in the life-size clay head of Castroneves’.



It’s a key step in the process that will ultimately be the sterling silver face that will be permanently attached to the Borg-Warner Trophy.



“It’s incredible to be part of history and now Will Behrends will be part of history” Castroneves told SPEED SPORT. “You can see him on his line of fire. I had no idea how many levels you have to go through. Even today sitting down there for a few hours he will still go for many more hours to cover the details that the picture doesn’t.



“We don’t know how much work goes on behind we just assume you take a picture make some drawings and then sculpt it but there is much more than that.”



Behrends is one of the top sculptors in the world with some impressive commissions including oversized pieces of former United States Vice Presidents that are displayed in the United States Capitol Building in Washington D.C. He has also created oversize statues of some of the greatest players in San Francisco Giants history outside of their ballpark including Willie Mays Willie McCovey Juan Marichal Orlando Cepeda and Gaylord Perry.

His process for creating the faces on the Borg-Warner Trophy involves creating a life-size image then working it down to the egg-sized casting that is added to the trophy.



“Helio is the first four-time winner I’ve gotten to do all four of” Behrends said while sitting in the living room of his mountain residence. “Rick Mears’ fourth image was the only four-time winner that I did. Helio’s last victory was in 2009 12 years ago. So I always like to go back as I did with Juan Pablo Montoya who won his first in 2000 and his second in 2015. The span of years in between victories the face ages. I like to go back look at the differences start with a clean sheet of paper and do it all over again.



“This is that but also the thrill of being able to do a four-time winner.”



Castroneves turned 46 on May 10 but continues to display a boyish youthful appearance. In many ways the changes in his face from 2001 to 2021 have been subtle according to Behrends.



“Surprisingly little for 20 years” Behrends said. “His face has changed a lot less than mine has over those 20 years. He looks good. He is clearly in shape. He has aged well but I like to see the way age matures a face and makes it more distinctive. That’s been enjoyable on this one as well.”



SPEED SPORT got to spend the day with Castroneves at Behrends’ studio and observe the process and the interaction between the winner and the artist.



“All right Will so now is the big moment” Castroneves said as the moment came to unveil his latest likeness. “Let’s see how you did now because I believe I’m much better looking than when I was younger. I’m getting older I’m like wine better looking.”



With that Behrends took off the wraps and there was Castroneves’ likeness complete with his trademark smile and perfectly coifed hair.



“Oh My God – is this Tom Cruise?” Castroneves asked when he looked the sculpture. “It’s so amazing. This is incredible. My hair looks amazing too.



“I’m looking at myself. This is weird. This is amazing. Wow. I’m looking at a twin here. This is incredible. I’ve seen the trophy but this is my head. Great job.



“Man this is crazy. I like this guy. That is awesome. Will you are the man.”



Behrends took time to describe the process and his art to Castroneves who on May 30 performed his own masterpiece by artfully racing against Alex Palou to become the fourth four-time winner of the Indianapolis 500.



Castroneves is the 32nd Indianapolis 500 winner for Behrends. In three more years he will have sculpted a third of all the faces that are on the Borg-Warner Trophy.



“I’m glad my face is familiar to you” Castroneves quipped.



“You haven’t changed much over the last 12 years” Behrends said referring to the last time he sculpted Castroneves’ face for his third Indianapolis 500 win in 2009.



Among the topics the two discussed Behrends told Castroneves how it all began to work on smaller images for the Borg-Warner Trophy.



“There was a lot of learning because I had never done something that small” he explained. “When the Borg-Warner Trophy is on display most people aren’t able to get close enough to get a good look at it.



“There have probably been four or five people that have done every face since 1911 when the trophy began in 1934. In 1989 they came up with the idea to have a different sculptor every year. They didn’t think the differences in the images would be good so they asked me to do it every year.



“I start off big and then work small. I can go quicker by using memory. When I’m doing something like this you build it up and then boil it down. That is what this clay head helps me do. It helps get me to where I want to go.



“In that scale you have to emphasize key features on the face.



“The first one was Arie Luyendyk. It was challenging because he was the first one but also he had hair. I went with the hair and it was unlike anything else on the trophy. It was common back then but it wasn’t on the Borg-Warner Trophy. They had helmets on when Mario Andretti won in 1969 and then we went to Arie with the long hair.”

Designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox and developed by Boston Properties the 55-story structure will rise from a 25000-square-foot rectangular site between East 44th and 45th Streets that is currently occupied by a 15-story building that formerly housed the Metropolitan Transportation Authority headquarters. The new tower will yield 832613 square feet of office space 5357 square feet of retail space and 5357 square feet of subterranean circulation paths to Grand Central Terminal and the future East Side Access project. Rezoning plans for 343 Madison Avenue were approved by the City Council in mid November.

Not much change is outwardly visible since our last update in September. The entire building remains covered in black netting and metal scaffolding. We should really start to see momentum pick up next year as the old structure is dismantled level by level.

Current renderings of 343 Madison Avenue give us a street-level perspective looking down Madison Avenue with the double-height lobby space and a corner entrance leading to the Long Island Railroad.

The most prominent architectural feature of the design is the series of large multi-story trusses spanning the setbacks in the building massing. These sections are shown to be highlighted with bronze-colored walls and lined with landscaped terraces overlooking the Midtown skyline. The structure culminates in a rectangular glass volume housing a green wall tucked underneath a flat roof parapet.

The following renderings below give us a sense of the scale and presence of 343 Madison Avenue among the Midtown skyline. One of the main highlights that distinguishes the design from the surrounding towers is its series of large-scale diagonal trusses in front of bronze-colored walls. Above these sections appear to be multiple outdoor terraces populated with tall trees and amenity spaces stretching as high as the top level. The building is capped with a multi-story space with a soaring ceiling heights and a green wall enclosed in glass on all sides. Floodlights will illuminate the vegetation and act as the focal point of the crown for 343 Madison Avenue.

The rendering below is oriented looking north at the top of the eastern and southern elevations where the elevator core extends above the roof parapet. This rectilinear part of the superstructure would be enclosed with metal panels interspersed with thin vertical strips of glass that expose parts of the egress staircases.

YIMBY last reported that excavation for 343 Madison Avenue is expected to begin sometime next year and construction is anticipated to be completed by 2026.

The big question is: Which if any of them will actually start construction in 2022?

A glance at the wish-list gives no hint that the city’s real estate destiny including the fate of tiny apartment buildings might depend on beating a pandemic that shows no sign of abating.

But developers made their moves years ago. They bought land and air rights cobbled together financing and signed architects. Some nailed down city zoning and other approvals. Some demolished old structures in the way of their ambitions.

But it’s a long way from those crucial steps to bringing in the backhoes and shovels. Here’s a look at where some of the future jumbos are right now:

The mega-tower planned for the Grand Hyatt Hotel site on East 42nd Street — known as 175 Park Avenue — got its governmental green light his month when the City Council approved a zoning change to allow construction of the $3 billion-plus mixed-use mammoth rising to 1575 feet.

To exploit East Midtown size-bonus rules developers RXR Realty and TF Cornerstone will pay for and build hundreds of millions of dollars in Grand Central-area transit/pedestrian improvements and also provide 25000 square feet of free-to-the-public outdoor terraces programmed for arts and cultural uses.

But don’t look to the sky just yet. A spokesman told us “Now that the entitlement process is complete the developers will spend next year arranging construction financing and reaching out to potential tenants with plans to start demolition in 2023.”

Nearby in the Grand Central area demolition has begun at 343 Madison Avenue the former MTA headquarters. Boston Properties plans a 1050-foot-tall tower with more than 800000 square feet of offices and significant retail. It will also feature numerous underground pedestrian connections to Grand Central Terminal – which Boston is providing in exchange for a size bonus under new East Midtown rezoning rules. The project received its City Council green light last month.

However there’s no word yet on when ground-up construction will begin.

West 57th Street between Fifth and Seventh avenues — aka Billionaires Row — is without question the most active location for major new projects. Awaiting their marching orders are the empty lots at 41-47 W. 57th and 12 W. 57th St. as demolition proceeds one block west at 125 W. 57th St.

The No. 125 site was home to the Calvary Baptist Church and the Salisbury Hotel. As we reported in June the church will be restored and enlarged when a new 26-story mixed-use tower developed by Alchemy-ABR Investment Partners financial partner Cain International and the church itself is finished in 2024.

Ground-up construction is to begin soon on the $350 million project once demolition now underway is complete. The new tower will include 185000 square feet of office space. It was delayed when a lender pulled out in March 2020 forcing Alechemy-ABR to find new financing but all the hurdles have been cleared.

Between Fifth and Sixth avenues the company founded by Sheldon Solow is demolishing old structures to make way for 12 W. 57th a 670-foot-tall white marble luxury condo tower with a retail base designed by SOM architects. Two buildings are yet to be razed including the original Henri Bendel address. Solow passed away in November 2020 but his son Stefan Soloviev who reorganized the various Solow entities under the new umbrella of Soloviev Group seems no less eager to build.

Meanwhile excavation is expected to begin soon at another large site 41-47 W. 57th where developer Sedesco plans an 1100-foot-tall mixed-use tower with 119 condo units a 158-room hotel and a large restaurant. YIMBY reported last week that thanks to an agreement with the MTA Sedesco is to receive an acre of extra floor space in exchange for building new disabled-accessible elevators for the 57th Street F train station.

4 A number of 57th Street projects are awaiting marching orders.

Meanwhile Rudin Management is gearing up to demolish an old building at East 48th Street to make way for 415 Madison Ave. a planned 605-foot tower with 343100 square feet of office space. Rudin first needs city approval for an air rights transfer and for a size bonus in exchange for transit/pedestrian amenities — not unlike Boston’s plan for 343 Madison. The project will include a retail pavilion and a public concourse. A Rudin rep said “They’re working to complete ULURP early next year.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzI2L3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL2FsbC1vbmUtbm9uZS1hbGwtaXMtYmFubmluZy1zaW5nbGUtZmFtaWx5LXpvbmluZy1lYXNpbmctaG91c2luZy1jcmlzaXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,All for one and none for all: Is banning single-family zoning easing the housing crisis?,"And in most communities around Greater Boston more than 80 percent of the available land is zoned solely for single-family homes according to the Fair Housing Center of Greater Boston . That makes it illegal or next to impossible to say convert a finished basement into a rental unit or to build even modestly sized multifamily dwellings like the region’s familiar three-deckers in much of suburbia.

Cities and towns wield a powerful toolto control their built environment dictating what can go where within their borders: zoning. It’s why you can’t just open up a laundromat in your garage — some areas are zoned for commercial industrial or mixed uses while others are set aside for residential homes.

There’s nothing wrong with single-family houses of course. But not everyone wants (or more to the point can afford) to live in one. In fact not even half of Boston-area households live in a detached single-family home according to American Community Survey data. And by restricting nearly all residential development to the postwar ideal of a freestanding home on a large — and therefore expensive — lot communities can essentially keep many lower-income people out maintaining patterns of housing segregation that formed in the early and mid-20th century.

“Single-family zoning wasn’t created as a means to exclude but it very quickly kind of became a means of exclusion” said Christopher Ptomey executive director of the Urban Land Institute’s Terwilliger Center for Housing.

Simply put single-family zoning rules — or “apartment bans” as they’re sometimes called — are a big reason housing is so scarce expensive and exclusive in certain places. “Zoning for single-family houses has been … one of the major contributing factors to the crisis of housing supply and affordability” said Jessie Grogan associate director of reduced poverty and spatial inequality at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy in Cambridge.

By continuing to outlaw more affordable housing types — namely condos town homes and rental apartments — “single-family zoning today makes it more difficult to address the equity problems it’s caused historically” Ptomey said. That has led housing advocates economists and lawmakers to ask the same question: If single-family zoning helped create our affordable housing shortage and tends to perpetuate historic patterns of inequity and segregation why not get rid of the cause?

The first cities through the wall so to speak

That’s why in December 2018 Minneapolis effectively ended single-family zoning allowing duplexes and triplexes to be built citywide. That doesn’t mean an end to single-family homes or that quaint bungalows will soon sulk in the shadows of towering apartment buildings. It simply allows homeowners to build a two- or three-family residence on their lot without having to go through the onerous and costly process of applying for a zoning variance. The state of Oregon followed suit in 2019 and this past fall California — the epicenter of the nation’s affordable housing crisis — legalized the construction of duplexes triplexes and fourplexes on most single-family lots statewide.

The idea is to add extra housing supply gently and gradually to existing neighborhoods — supply that should according to basic economics help meet some of the demand for homes and therefore ease price growth.

So have those efforts yielded more housing or made a dent in affordability? The short answer is: not really not yet. But experts say it’s much too soon to expect dramatic results from such a long-term strategy. “It’s going to take years before we see the number of units being added that will really make a dent in affordability but it’s a step in the right direction” said Redfin deputy chief economist Taylor Marr. “It’s sort of a necessary but insufficient piece of regulation.”

“It took 30 or 40 years to see the impacts of what happens when you zone so much land for single-family use. And really it’s going to take 30 or 40 years for us to see how successful we’ve been in undoing that” Grogan added.

That’s not to say there haven’t been promising signs. In the 10 years from 2009 to 2018 Minneapolis permitted a total of 42 duplex units according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development — about four per year. But from 2019 through October 2021 builders already have permitted 80 duplex units more than a sixfold increase in the average annual rate and about four times as many as in nearby St. Paul. The 30 duplexes permitted in the city in 2020 were the most since 2003 and could soon be surpassed by the 2021 total.

Still a few dozen duplexes do not a housing crisis solve. Ptomey agreed that “upzoning” more single-family districts is just one small but much-needed housing policy. “In real estate there’s a notorious amount of risk aversion and I think it’s going to take a while — and for some property owners to start doing this — for others to kind of see the potential and to feel comfortable and safe changing the properties they own in this way.”

That’s how it’s played out with accessory dwelling units (ADUs) in California which legalized the development of so-called in-law apartments on most residential lots in 2017. It took time for people to get comfortable with the concept and the process Ptomey said but through 2020 California had added more than 22500 accessory housing units in three years according to the University of California Berkeley with thousands more permitted. “I think you’re going to probably see the same thing over time in these areas where you can have duplexes and triplexes” Ptomey said “a similar kind of slow growth on the front end but then as people see the opportunity it will build on itself.”

“Single-family zoning wasn’t created as a means to exclude but it very quickly kind of became a means of exclusion” said Christopher Ptomey executive director of the Urban Land Institute’s Terwilliger Center for Housing. Adobe Stock/tamas - stock.adobe.com

Preserving a neighborhood’s character

In suburban swaths of single-family houses existing homeowners often bristle at the notion of adding density fearful it will change the character of their neighborhood. But in places like Ipswich and Sudbury density often predated sprawl and culs-de-sac by several centuries.

“In a lot of those suburban towns you already have some pretty good examples of what [upzoning] looks like as you get close to the town center” Grogan said. “To some extent having more density and having town houses and apartments above retail is a more traditional form of development than single-family houses on large lots.”

“There is a way to do density that fits with the character of all different kinds of places” she added. “That looks different in Somerville than it does in Lincoln but it does not have to mean you’re eliminating single-family zoning and all of a sudden everybody’s building 10-story buildings.”

Another common fear among single-family homeowners is that allowing other housing types to be built will hurt their property values. In fact the opposite is often true. “They worry ‘Oh you’re trying to improve affordability that means you want to make my house value decline.’ And the two are not at odds” Marr said. “What just happened was that the development value of your land just got much greater because the potential of that land has increased.”

In Minneapolis existing single-family homeowners in upzoned areas saw their property values increase 3 percent to 5 percent compared with similar lots in neighboring communities according to early research by Daniel Kuhlmann assistant professor of community and regional planning at Iowa State University.

The math is simple: Imagine a half-acre suburban lot outside Boston that holds a single million-dollar house. If the land were upzoned to allow greater density that half acre could comfortably fit the original house plus a pair of town houses which would sell closer to the median price of a Boston-area condo around $625000. Suddenly the same plot of land has become more valuable while also creating more affordable housing options.

One benefit of upzoning residential neighborhoods as opposed to building new homes on greenfield sites (land that has not been built upon previously) is that it leverages existing infrastructure. “The roads are already there and a lot of Greater Boston’s neighborhoods are in walking distance of historic downtowns village centers and public transportation” said Amy Dain a housing policy consultant in Newton.

It also tends to add density in a subtle gradual way that’s less disruptive to a neighborhood’s feel than say an 80-unit apartment complex. Even if just one out of every 100 single-family homeowners in Massachusetts added a second unit it would net us more than 15000 new housing units statewide.

“If you’re talking one in 100 or even one in 20 those are really invisible” Dain said. “It doesn’t really change the character of anything — they’re highly dispersed they’re not causing major traffic impacts parking problems … history shows us that not everybody’s going to turn their single-family house into a duplex.”

Apartment bans in wealthy suburbs don’t just make it harder for low- and middle-income people to live in those communities; the same exclusionary zoning practices also shift development into other areas leading to gentrification and displacement in historically low-cost neighborhoods that welcome the new construction Dain said.

“The root cause of the escalation in home prices is not the new cafe the new apartment building or the new neighbors — the root cause is a region-wide housing shortage [which] creates a game of musical chairs that people with the lowest incomes will lose” Dain said. “In the absence of restrictions we would expect to see more development in the most expensive places” Dain added where the profit potential is higher for builders. But in Greater Boston she said there’s more growth pressure in areas like Everett or Lynn than Winchester or Marblehead. “Homeowners in a hundred suburbs are using local laws to prevent the market from building enough housing. The zoning laws in Wellesley Belmont Winchester Needham Westwood Milton Cohasset Weston and every exclusive community are causing displacement in Roxbury Hyde Park Medford Revere Quincy and so many places.”

Single-family zoning is just one arrow in the quiver for apartment-averse communities; other exclusionary rules such as minimum lot sizes setbacks and parking requirements yield similar results by different means. The best indicator that recent single-family zoning reform efforts are working Ptomey said is that people have begun discussing changes to those other policies too.

Grogan likens the challenge to scaling Mount Everest. “One policy change or building in one kind of place is not going to get us all the way to the top. It’ll move us up the mountain but we need to layer all of these efforts … building different kinds of housing units in different kinds of places if we’re really going to deal with the magnitude of our affordability crisis.”

At their core these four-legged robots are mobility platforms that can be equipped with different payloads depending on the type of information that companies want to gather. Competition in the four-legged robot market is heating up. In the U.S. Boston Dynamics has been developing its 70-pound Spot robot for about 10 years. Nearby MIT has also been working on a smaller four-legged bot it calls ""mini cheetah."" Ghost Robotics in Philadelphia is making robots geared toward military applications while abroad Swiss-based Anybotics is making a four-legged robot it calls Anymal for industrial customers. And Chinese companies like Deep Robotics Weilan and Unitree Robotics are all building their own versions though these last two companies seem to be at least partially focusing on the personal robotics market. According to Allied Market Research the global inspection robots market generated $940 million in 2020 and is expected to reach close to $14 billion by 2030. Take for example National Grid an electric and gas utility company that serves customers in Massachusetts New York and Rhode Island. The company has been using two robots made by Massachusetts-based Boston Dynamics to do routine inspections. The robots are equipped with LIDAR to help them navigate as well visual and thermal cameras to take detailed photos and thermal images of the equipment in the substation. Prior to using Spot most inspections at National Grid's substations were done by people. In some cases operation of the substation would have to be temporarily shut down because it would not have been safe for humans to do the inspections while the equipment was still on.

""We consider the investment in the robot to be a prudent investment because it improves the safety operating conditions for our employees"" says Dean Berlin lead engineer of robotics technology at National Grid. ""The robot also presents an advantage in that it's very repeatable. It collects the images from the same angle from the same vantage every single time which is very useful because it allows us to compare images collected at different times to each other to be able to see any trends or changes in behavior."" Others who've used Boston Dynamics' robot dog Spot include pharmaceutical group Merck and BP  which is using the robot to autonomously read gauges monitor corrosion and measure methane on some of its oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. Malaysian oil and gas company Petronas  is using robot dogs made by Anybotics to inspect its offshore platforms. Brazilian mining corporation Vale  is another early adopter of Anybotics' Anymal. Having completed initial testing Vale is now in the process of purchasing a robot to do inspections and gather data about the condition of equipment in one of its mines. Vale says having Anymal help with inspections saves its staff from having to go into potentially dangerous spaces which are often filled with dust noise and rotating equipment parts. BASF  a German-based chemical company is also testing Anymal at one of its chemical plants where the robot is gathering visual thermal and acoustic data of BASF equipment. Both Spot and Anymal have also been deployed on construction sites and in the case of Anymal at train yards to perform train inspections. ""These companies typically need to send out their teams of educated people to collect data about the state of their plant. And so their vision is with these types of robots such as Anymal to automate some of these tasks making sure that their people are safe and can save on some of the costs associated with actually transporting people on site"" says Péter Fankhauser CEO and co-founder of Anybotics.

Other use cases for quadruped robots are just starting to catch on. One of the most controversial has been using these robots for defense. In May of 2021 the New York City Police Department said that it would stop testing of one of Boston Dynamics' Spot robots earlier than planned because of fierce public backlash. ""Spot's role in public safety is one of keeping people out of harm's way. The NYPD was trying to use Spot in exactly that fashion where Spot was going to be the point of communication to a potentially barricaded and armed suspect who had hostages. That's a good use case for a robot "" Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter told CNBC. Though the robot in the NYPD incident was not armed and was being remotely controlled by a police officer concerns over fully autonomous robots being weaponized has led to the formation of an initiative known as the ""Campaign to Stop Killer Robots."" The coalition aims to ban the development production and use of fully autonomous weapons. Among its supporters are Tesla CEO Elon Musk the late Stephen Hawking and hundreds of A.I. experts. For Ghost Robotics the defense market is the company's bread and butter. The Philadelphia-based company says that out of its 20 plus customers 90% are U.S. and allied foreign governments. One of those customers is the U.S. Air Force which is using Ghost Robotics' Vision 60 robot to do security patrols around several bases. The Air Force says the robots can operate in a wide range of temperatures and are equipped with 14 sensors to help provide situational awareness. Ghost Robotics has also inked a deal with Singapore's Defense Science and Technology Agency. The agency says it will test and develop use cases for four-legged robots for security defense and humanitarian applications.

The anti-apartheid bill passed in the State Assembly by a vote of 45-17 and in the Senate 26-14.

Gov. Thomas H. Kean who signed the bill on August 27 1985 ten week before he won re-election to a second term with 70% of the vote. He called “status quo in South Africa was unacceptable.”

“We will not countenance the brutality that is apartheid by nourishing it with our investments” Kean said at the bill signing where a large crowd of Black clergymen frequently interrupted his speech with applause.

The legislation did not tie the hands of some major universities including Princeton and Rutgers which resisted divesting their investments in South Africa and led to student protests.

When Congress passed the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 that imposed sanctions on South Africa all sixteen members of the New Jersey delegation in the U.S. House of Representatives voted to support of the measure. After President Ronald Reagan vetoed the bill the full New Jersey delegation including six Republicans voted to override the veto. Just one of the sixteen Christopher Smith (R-Hamilton) continues to serve in the House.

In a floor speech Brown pointed out that Desmond Tutu the Archbishop of Cape Town and the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner was not eligible to vote in South Africa because he was Black.

Accompanied by Kean Brown U.S. Senator Bill Bradley and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter Rodino (D-Newark) Tutu visited St. Joseph’s Plaza Newark on January 12 1986.

The former Labour prime minister urged the government to create a multibillion pound programme of support for a “blighted generation” that has grown up under Tory rule amid huge public spending cuts Covid the cost of living crisis and the Ukraine conflict.

He drew parallels with “Thatcher’s children” – a cohort of young working-class people who grew up amid mass unemployment societal upheaval and social security cuts of Britain in the 1980s.

Austerity’s children – who account for 3.4 million of the UK’s 4.3 million children living below the poverty line – would face extra health educational and employment challenges as a legacy of the “decade-long experiment” of fiscal austerity he said.

At the centre of Brown’s proposed programme of support for children is a relaunch of the Sure Start early-years scheme in part funded by a £1bn social impact fund. Sure Start was a flagship New Labour government policy launched in 1998 but at least 1000 centres have been closed since 2010.

Brown has made several interventions on welfare policy in recent months describing Britain’s worsening levels of destitution as “obscene” and calling for root-and-branch reform of its “systematically shredded” benefits system in a series of pamphlets and lectures.

Although he has been careful to direct his proposals at the current government – he called on the chancellor Jeremy Hunt to use his planned September mini-budget to help families in severe hardship – it is clear he sees the UK’s deepening poverty “epidemic” as a problem for a future Labour administration.

Brown’s latest pamphlet Partnership to End Poverty published on Tuesday calls for “a clear vision and deliverable timetable from our government to end destitution now and poverty in 10 years” bringing together the state charities and businesses with the aim of eradicating material hardship within a generation.

Writing in the Guardian Brown said: “Most [of austerity’s children] have never known what it is like to be free of poverty. And yet in almost every single year of the last decade even as their need has been mounting the government’s support for children has been spiralling downwards each year more difficult than the year before as with almost surgical precision the government has made the already poor even poorer.”

He adds: “Commentators now write about Britain’s endemic problem of underinvestment highlighting the state of our railways roads utilities and physical infrastructure; but there has been less focus on the decade-long experiment – the greatest and most damaging underinvestment of all inflicted on austerity’s children who will soon enough come of age. The damage to them runs deep.”

Brown said children born in the 2020s were likely to be even poorer than those born a decade earlier with the number of UK children in poverty – 4.3 million – likely to rise in the immediate future to a record 4.5m.

His £3bn proposals for protecting the poorest families funded in part by a bank reserve funds levy include a revitalised Sure Start programme support for unemployed people and those on low wages to get better-paid jobs and an extension to the household support fund due to end in October.

In his pamphlet Brown called for a cross-government poverty taskforce to be created: “The sprawling nature of the poverty crisis – which has tentacles reaching into health education work community energy transport and more – should banish any illusion that this is a challenge that can be safely led from any one department” he wrote.

Brown’s intervention reflects wider concerns about the health and life chances of a generation hit by Covid and austerity. Earlier this year children’s services leaders called for a national “plan for childhood” to address the needs of a generation of young people scarred by austerity and the pandemic.

A government spokesperson said: “We will continue to make every effort to tackle child poverty which is down since 2010. Our £108bn cost of living package also prevented 1.3 million people including 300000 children falling into absolute poverty with the heightened cost of living pressures driven by the war in Ukraine and impact of Covid.

“Children are less likely to be in poverty where all adults work and our £2.5bn back to work plan will help over a million people break down barriers to work while we also cut taxes boost the national living wage and drive down inflation to support hard-working families.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYWJhZC5vcmcvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlX2Nkby9haWQvNjQzNTE4Ny9qZXdpc2gvQnJvdGhlcnMtb24tQnJvd24tVS1Sb3dpbmctVGVhbS1DaGFtcGlvbi1KZXdpc2gtUHJpZGUuaHRt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brothers on Brown U. Rowing Team Champion Jewish Pride - Amid rising antisemitism on American college campuses ...,"For Nathan and Asher Swidler two brothers on the Brown University heavyweight rowing crew team their strong and always evolving relationship with Chabad-Lubavitch began with the installation of a mezuzah on a cold day in Providence R.I. in the middle of the pandemic. Nathan (“Nate”) 23 and Asher (“Ash”) 22 are just 14 months apart in age and grew up in London to American parents. Having been raised with a strong sense of Jewish identity upon completing high school both boys spent a gap year in Israel. Nate has been rowing since the age of 15 when he picked up the sport during his school days at Eton a prestigious boarding school in England. When choosing which college to attend he decided on Brown as it is one of the top rowing teams in the country while also being well known for its rigorous Ivy League education. Ash was a rare “walk on” to the crew team which he joined during his junior year. RELATED And Nate’s not just another rower. His memorable rowing moments include winning the Henley Royal Regatta in 2019 beating Harvard last year in the dual race and rowing in the pair competition with his brother. Their family’s connection to Chabad goes back generations. The boys’ father Josh recalls his mother teaching in the Chabad yeshivah day school in Worcester Mass. which was led for more than seven decades by Rabbi Hershel Fogelman. Though at the time the family identified as Reform this connection eventually led them to keeping a kosher home. Another link in the chain was added when the Swidler boys arrived on Brown’s campus in January 2021. “We both knew we wanted mezuzahs on our doorpost” Ash told Chabad.org. Nate told a friend from London who was active in Chabad at Columbia University who in turn reached out to Rabbi Mendel and Chana Laufer co-directors of the Rohr Chabad House serving Brown University Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and Johnson & Wales University all of them in Providence. In 2021 the day after their mandatory “two-week quarantine” arrival period ended the rabbi greeted the boys outside the dormitories with a warm smile and open arms. Credit: Chabad of College Hill

The First of Many Meetings This was back in the Covid days and the day after their mandatory “two-week quarantine” arrival period ended the rabbi greeted the boys outside the dormitories with a warm smile and open arms—at the time he was not allowed inside due to pandemic regulations—and handed them each a mezuzah a homemade challah and cards with the Shema prayer. The relationship between the two British expats and the Laufers grew as the weeks went on. “Nate’s and my initial interaction with the rabbi swiftly led to weekly meetings” Ash said. “We would sit outside in the freezing cold January winter for hours. For me Rabbi Mendel’s conversations evoked an element of authenticity that I found to be lacking in conversations with hundreds of fellow students.” Ash who is the current student president of Chabad at Brown proudly chronicles its growth since he started there. “Today we have over a hundred students coming on a regular Friday night” he said. There is a kosher kitchen in the largest dining hall at Brown and this year dozens of students affixed a mezuzah to their doorposts courtesy of Chabad. Eventually the boys committed to putting on tefillin regularly. Rabbi Laufer sensing the opportunity for a meaningful birthday gift reached out to Ash’s father Josh to organize Ash to receive his own pair for his 22nd birthday. “Following the passing of my wife Ash found significant meaning and comfort in Torah study something I am both proud of and encouraged with my whole heart” Josh Swidler explained. “If I can play even the smallest part in enhancing Jewish identity and meaning for my children I will do it.” Nate participates in weekly Sinai Scholars classes and has managed to attend Shabbat dinners nearly every week of his senior year. The Swidlers devotion to Chabad and Jewish life on campus is even more noteworthy considering the demands made on college athletes. After resolving to put on tefillin regularly Ash received a pair of his own from Rabbi Mendel Laufer for his 22nd birthday.

Russ Curtis a spokesperson for the nonprofit organization International Bird Rescue said the organization has also recovered sick pelicans in Southern California. Since April 20 the organization has cared for more than 235 pelicans at its wildlife rescue centers in Fairfield in the Bay Area and San Pedro in Los Angeles.

“They’re in really poor physical shape. They’re starving and they haven’t gotten enough nutrition” Curtis said in an interview with KQED. Some of the injuries are from fishing lines and hooks.

“When there’s not the fishing stock that they can find they take chances around fishing piers and fishing boats and places where there are people with fishing tackle” he continued.

Sick birds have been spotted off Alameda Point in the Bay Area which is a roosting ground for brown pelicans. But many were found where people usually don’t find these stocky large seabirds. On city streets and parking lots for example. One bird in Santa Cruz attempted to walk into a bar Curtis said. The majority of pelicans at the Fairfield center came from the Monterey and Santa Cruz areas.

It’s not clear why the birds are having trouble finding food.

“It’s still a mystery” Curtis said. “We haven’t had any conclusive proof of what’s really going out in the wild right now.”

The Los Angeles Times reported there was a similar spike in malnourished brown pelicans along California’s coast in 2022 with no clear cause. International Bird Rescue reported other spikes in starving brown pelicans in 2010 and 2012.

During these prior incidents International Bird Rescue cared for pelicans for weeks.

“We’re not going to release them back out to an area where there is not proper fish stock for them to feed on” Curtis said. “They would just rebound and probably come back into care at some point.”

While they wait for more information Curtis said wildlife rescue centers like theirs — which rely on public donations — are feeling a financial squeeze.

“At this point we’re going through about 500 pounds of fish a day just at this center and that’s about $1000 a day” he said.

Curtis said the public can help by keeping an eye out for unwell brown pelicans.

“As you enjoy the warm weather and you’re at the beach or along the coast if you see a pelican that’s out of place or might have a fishing line injury if you see something say something” Curtis said. “Let your local animal control know that there’s a bird in distress and let’s get it into care as soon as we can.”

If you see an injured or unwell pelican you can reach International Bird Rescue’s Bird HelpLine at 866-SOS-BIRD or get help by calling your local animal control.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzc2VuY2UuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS95dmV0dGUtbmljb2xlLWJyb3duLWh1c2JhbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yvette Nicole Brown Wants Her Engagement At 52 To Inspire Women Not To Settle,"Jesse Grant/Variety via Getty Images

Actress Yvette Nicole Brown 52 and her fiancé Anthony Davis found love with each other when they weren’t looking. The couple who announced their engagement in December 2023 discussed their relationship and upcoming wedding on Getting Grilled with Curtis Stone. During the interview Brown encouraged women who are waiting for partners not to settle.

“To be my age to be single as long as I was single and to have waited — you know I didn’t just grab a guy I waited until I found the guy my heart loves that’s a testimony and that’s also aspirational and inspirational to women that are in my position” Brown told Stone during their chat.

She continued “I would love for a 40-something or a 50-something woman to see this story and go ‘Okay it’s right for me to wait for the right one or to not just marry whoever asks me first if I don’t feel it.’ It is still possible.”

While the actress is open to sharing her story she still wants to be intentional about retaining a level of privacy.

“So now I’m trying to thread the needle about how much do I share to encourage people without giving away what is special and important to me?” Brown asked.

The couple met initially when they were in their 20s while in an acting class at church and reconnected in recent years. Brown said she wasn’t actively looking for love but clearly love was looking for her. They were platonic friends and then things blossomed organically according to the actress.

“In life sometimes things happen and you think ‘Okay I’m done with dating. I’m not gonna deal with this anymore’ and then in comes somebody who’s pumping your heart helping you breathe and you don’t even realize it” she said.

During the interview Davis said friendship continues to be the foundation of their loving relationship. When they pivoted to talks about their upcoming wedding Brown admitted that she no longer fantasizes about an idyllic white wedding. Therefore she’s going into wedding planning a bit blind.

“I’m of a certain age and had stopped dreaming of weddings and you know I’m not one of those girls who has a vision board of ‘This is my dress.’ I did that in my 20s it didn’t happen. I was done” she said. “It’s been 30 years since I dreamed about a wedding or where I was gonna hold it or whatever so I’m clueless.”

Davis is similarly not stressing about the wedding and said he’d marry Brown whether it be “at the justice of the peace” or a fancy “vineyard.” He had one catch however when it came to the bride.

“It has to be you.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjQ5ZXJzd2Viem9uZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTgwNzM4LTQ5ZXJzLXJlcG9ydGVkbHktc2lnbmluZy1zaGFrZWwtdHJ5b3V0L9IBLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjQ5ZXJzd2Viem9uZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hbXAtMTgwNzM4Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,49ers reportedly signing DL Shakel Brown after tryout,"49ers reportedly signing DL Shakel Brown after tryout

An Arsenal of Weapons: The 49ers Have Quietly Become Even More Dangerous on Offense in 2024

By Don Atkinson 4 hrs

It's not a shock to anyone who looks back at the past two NFL seasons to contemplate that the San Francisco 49ers' offense has finally stepped out of the shadow cast by the team's ever-imposing defense. Since their 2019 Super Bowl run players like Nick Bosa Fred Warner Dre Greenlaw and former 49ers Richard Sherman and Jimmie Ward have garnered most of the attention when talking about the team. That was indeed the case until 2022 when future Hall-of-Fame running back Christian McCaffrey who came to San Francisco in a mid-season trade with the Carolina Panthers changed the conversation. The 49ers' offense was suddenly seen not just as a semi-capable complement to a sterling defense but rather as a unit that could put up some points and in a dramatic way. With the"

Murder of Danville Cab driver

Danville's first homicide of 2021 was one that stuck with the community.

Back in January police responded to the area of Gay Street and found 51-year-old cab driver Wendy Harris dead at the scene.

Investigators later arrested 47-year-old James Edward Fultz IV of Martinsville in connection with the incident.

Authorities believe Fultz got a ride in a cab and at some point during the fare cut or stabbed the driver.

In April new details surfaced of the incident after Fultz's court appearance. At the hearing a Danville police detective testified that woman who knows Fultz helped police arrest him. The detective said they gave her a recording device for her car where Fultz was heard telling her quote ""I just killed somebody tonight.""

Questions and controversies swirled around the cancelation of the Blue Ridge County Festival in September.

Originally Purpose Driven Events the company that organized the festival announced that it would be postponing the event until May 2022 ""at the request of local officials"" due to COVID-19.

Las Vegas police made a gruesome discovery on Thursday during what they had otherwise thought would be a routine traffic stop.

KLAS in Las Vegas reports that the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) was attempting to pull over a pickup truck on Thursday December 23 near the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino. Police say that after initiating the stop 57-year-old Eric Holland allegedly attempted to flee on foot. Officers subdued Holland by striking him with a taser.

Law enforcement contends that after apprehending Holland a search of his vehicle turned up human remains. Police report that several large coolers were located in the bed of the pickup and were found to contain human body parts including a severed head.

The Holland arrest comes just days after police made an arrest in a stabbing that occurred inside the Rio in early December. LVMPD alleges that Nicholas Dove 27 who is now in custody is responsible for the December 3 stabbing and murder of 38-year-old Carlos Polanco.

The Rio casino resort is operated by Caesars Entertainment. The property is just west of the Las Vegas Strip.

Mass Murders

Much remains unknown regarding the discovery of human remains on Holland’s truck. Holland is set to appear in court on Tuesday.

An investigation is ongoing into whose remains they are and how Holland became in possession of the body parts. Metro has not yet issued a press release on the incident.

Court records however show that Holland has been charged with one felony count of open murder with the use of a deadly weapon or tear gas. Open murder is a general allegation of murder and can result in an array of both felony and/or misdemeanor charges. Holland has been appointed a public defender.

While overall crime rates initially dropped during the early stages of the pandemic murders increased substantially in 2021. Metro Police reported last week that murders spiked 49 percent this year from 2020.

As of December 17 the LVMPD has investigated 143 murders in the Las Vegas Valley. Police say 98 of the killings were committed with firearms. Nineteen were by blunt trauma 15 by sharp trauma two by intentional overdose and two by asphyxiation. Seven causes of death remain under investigation.

Metro says 84 percent of the murders have been cleared meaning either arrests have been made or the cases have been closed.

Murders Comparatively Low

The number of Las Vegas murders in 2021 is more in line with pre-pandemic rates.

Las Vegas Murders 2020 — 96 2019 — 144 2018 — 120 2017 — 141

The 143 murders through December 17 in Las Vegas is considerably lower than some other US cities with comparable populations. Baltimore which actually has a slightly smaller population than Las Vegas has reported 335 homicides this year.

St. Louis which has a much smaller population has reported 189 murders through Christmas.

Chicago continues to lead the way in terms of cities with the most murders. The Windy City has confirmed more than 520 murders this year though its population is several times larger than Las Vegas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjhuZXdzbm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvaGFwcHktYmlydGhkYXktaWNvbmljLWZsYW1pbmdvLWhvdGVsLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtNzUteWVhcnMv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuOG5ld3Nub3cuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9oYXBweS1iaXJ0aGRheS1pY29uaWMtZmxhbWluZ28taG90ZWwtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy03NS15ZWFycy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

If you have a keen eye for detail and film references you may have noticed that there are many many references to the 1994 cult classic “Pulp Fiction” in Capital One’s newest holiday commercial.

“Pulp Fiction” stars John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson reunited for a fun holiday conversation talking about how Santa (Travolta) can help Capital One spokesperson (Jackson) to help him save money with virtual coupons.

Travolta 66 and Jackson 71 who starred together in the cult classic pointed to several in-commercial easter eggs that brings nostalgia to “Pulp Fiction” fans everywhere including the bolo tie in Santa’s online shopping basket (similar to the one Travolta wore in the movie) as well as Santa’s hair slicked back in a similar style to that of Vincent’s character.

Another easy-to-miss moment was Santa sipping on a milkshake through a straw likely referencing the “$5 milkshake” scene from the film. And if you didn’t catch Jackson’s t-shirt which reads “Happy Holidays ‘With Cheese’” think back to the film’s famous “Royale with Cheese” scene.

All of this goes to show the everlasting power of product placement in the form of notable films and scenes that viewers have embedded in their memories.

Valued at over $23.3 billion as of June of this year product placement continues to be the oldest form of marketing that arguably began with the 1982 blockbuster E.T. and continued onto films such as Home Alone and Cast Away.

Since 2020 the industry has seen a 14% increase in global spending while simultaneously marketers are slowly decreasing their spending on traditional advertising in the form of TV and print ads – making today’s streaming technologies all the more valuable.

With Capital One’s newest holiday commercial the financial institution capitalizes off nostalgia and consumers’ love for stars like Travolta and Jackson persuading viewers not to turn that channel hoping they will pick out film references such as those mentioned above.

View the current offers here.

TSA PreCheck (or Clear). Priority boarding. Lounge access.

Whether or not you have these amenities can make or break your airport experience. With TSA passenger screening numbers inching toward 2019 levels (and even exceeding pre-pandemic numbers on some days) these benefits can help maintain your sanity especially when you're traveling during the busy holiday season.

Now you can keep your cool with a complimentary massage at more airports if you have a Priority Pass Select membership.

A Priority Pass membership is one of our favorite credit card perks as it allows access to 1300-plus airport lounges around the world. A few years ago Priority Pass even added restaurants to its network allotting $28 to $30 per guest in food and drink credit at certain airports.

Now Priority Pass Select members can get a free massage at seven ""Be Relax"" airport spa locations according to One Mile At a Time:

10-minute head and facial massage plus a 10-minute aromatherapy session (a $38 value).

10-minute foot massage plus a 10-minute aromatherapy session (a $38 value).

To get your free massage you'll need to present your same-day boarding pass along with your Priority Pass Select membership card. The benefit is restricted to one visit per cardholder at all locations — except for the DTW spa near Gate A18 which allows cardholders to bring along one guest.

Unfortunately American Express has eliminated restaurant access and other non-lounge activities from its Priority Pass offering. So if you have a card such as The Platinum Card® from American Express (enrollment required) or the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card that comes with Priority Pass you won't be eligible for a free massage (or a visit to any of the participating Priority Pass restaurant locations).

The good news is that other premium credit cards through other issuers such as Capital One Chase and Citi are eligible for this benefit. Below we've listed some of the top cards that offer Priority Pass Select membership:

Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card: $395 annual fee.

Chase Sapphire Reserve: $550 annual fee.

The Ritz-Carlton Credit Card (no longer available to new applicants) : $450 annual fee.

Citi Prestige® Card (no longer available to new applicants): $450 annual fee.

The information for the Ritz Carlton Credit Card and the Citi Prestige has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Bottom line

If the lounge is overcrowded I know I'll be beelining straight to the Be Relax spas for my free massage. Not only that but I'm excited that this is the first Priority Pass benefit at JFK's Terminal 5 JetBlue's terminal that currently only has one airport lounge.

Plus with the Venture X card you can add up to four authorized users for free so you'll be able to share lounge access (and now free massages!) for no additional cost.

The next day Bridgers responded with a simple ""hello"" and that was enough for fans to absolutely lose their minds. While many responded with one-word comments like ""omg"" and ""PLEASE"" some were able to articulate their excitement a little more.

""PLEASE MAKE THIS HAPPEN"" one wrote.

""THIS COLLAB WOULD END ME"" tweeted another.

The tweet comes just weeks after Willow revealed she was working with YUNGBLUD in the studio.

""It seems like everybody that comes from here knows how to blow a duck call"" the 48-year-old call maker said.

Stephens is a world duck calling champion who grew up on a rice farm near Stuttgart long known as the ""Rice and Duck Capital of the World.""

A town of about 10000 residents Stuttgart is a six-hour drive from Oklahoma City and is hallowed ground to duck hunters. Mallards have been flocking to the rice fields and bottomland forests around Stuttgart for many many years.

That plus the maze of rivers bayous sloughs and oxbow lakes make Stuttgart located 45 miles southeast of Little Rock a magnet for ducks.

""We have a lot of hardwood bottoms around here that flood naturally"" Stephens said. ""It's just kind of a natural funnel where ducks come for wintering grounds.""

And it's wintering grounds for duck hunters from across the country.

A mecca for duck hunting

The flooded timber of the Bayou Meto Wildlife Management Area about 15 miles southwest of Stuttgart is considered the crown jewel of public lands for waterfowl hunting.

The opening days of waterfowl season can get crowded at Bayou Meto even with its 33832 acres.

Between 1500 to 2000 hunters use the area each day in the early days of duck season and about 350 hunters use the area daily the rest of the season.

Thirty-five miles southeast of Stuttgart is the White River National Wildlife Refuge home to the largest concentration of wintering mallard ducks in the Mississippi Flyway.

Across the Delta region of southeast Arkansas near the confluence of the White Arkansas and Mississippi rivers there are duck hunting opportunities galore when there is adequate rainfall to flood the public hunting areas along the river bottoms.

""This is a very dry year for us and we don't have quite the public land available because it's not flooded"" Stephens said. ""But on a normal year that's what I think brings a lot of people here. You can just put a boat in and go somewhere and hunt.""

Last weekend Stephens met duck hunters from Florida Maine North Carolina Montana Oklahoma and Texas in Stuttgart. In addition to mallards hunting speckled-belly geese has become extremely popular in recent years he said.

""There's a lot of good hunting in Stuttgart for sure"" Stephens said.

Stuttgart is Ducktown

The town of Stuttgart embraces all things duck and duck hunting during and outside of waterfowl season.

""That's one of the cool things about Stuttgart"" Stephens said. ""It's kind of duck season 365 days a year. Everything is just centered around the rice harvest and the fall migration of ducks""

There are numerous of duck hunting guides operating in Stuttgart. It is home to the world duck calling championships each Thanksgiving weekend.

Mack's Prairie Wings which advertises itself as America's Premier Waterfowl Outfitter calls Stuttgart home.

Down the road from Mack's is Rich-N-Tone Calls (also called RNT Calls) one of the largest duck call manufacturers in the world. Stephens is RNT's president and chief executive officer.

And his journey to the top of the call making world began when he was a young boy in Stuttgart.

A community of call makers

Stephens first went duck hunting with his dad at age 5.

""I don't remember a whole lot about it but I remember when I got to be the age of 6 or 7 they gave me a duck call to blow when we were sitting out in a blind"" he said. ""I was just making a bunch of racket really.""

A duck flew in and the hunters shot it. Stephens said there is no way that duck could have been responding to the noise he was making but it hooked him on duck calling.

In Stuttgart there was a community of call makers and a young Stephens would be a frequent visitor to watch them work and pick their brains.

""There were probably a dozen call makers in this town"" Stephens said.

One of the best was a local craftsman named Butch Richenback who won a world duck calling championship in 1972 and was the 1975 Champion of Champions caller.

In 1976 Richenback started Rich-N-Tone duck calls. In the beginning making duck calls was more of a hobby and not a full-time job for Richenback Stephens said.

""I grew up going over to his little shop in his garage learning how to blow a duck call"" Stephens said. ""And that is where I got interested in making calls.""

More than 20 years later when Richenback began having health issues he began looking to sell the company. Richenback could have sold Rich-N-Tone to a larger company but he asked Stephens whom he had mentored as a boy to buy it.

Stephens was working as a landscape architect at the time and was reluctant about taking over for a legend but he bought the company in 1999.

The Flying Duck tap room

Today Rich-N-Tone is one of the top sellers of duck calls in the world and the company has its own duck hunting show on the Sportsman Channel. Stephens is one of three co-hosts.

Rich-N-Tone calls are machine-built then finished by hand and tuned but Stephens also has his own brand of custom-made calls that he still makes by hand. The Rich-N-Tone calls sell from $65 to $200 while Stephens' custom calls start around $500.

Visitors to Rich-N-Tone's headquarters in Stuttgart can view how the calls are made. They can also see a collection of vintage duck calls.

In addition to being a call maker Stephens is a call collector. He displays old duck calls from different collectors around the country at his store and manufacturing facility in Stuttgart.""Right now we have a duck call collection from Tennessee"" he said. ""It's over 200 calls dating back from 1880 to 1950. We get a lot of people that come through to see the calls and get a beer.""

That's because three years ago Stephens also added a tap room for craft beer at Rich-N-Tone. The company's flagship beer is the ""Flying Duck.""

Rich-N-Tone partnered with Flyway Brewing in Little Rock to make the ""Flying Duck"" beer which is sold in Harps Food Stores and liquor stores across Arkansas and Oklahoma.

The Flying Duck tap room gets crowded during duck season.

""During duck season we are packed"" Stephens said of the tap room. ""It's cool because you don't go to too many places where the whole place is filled with duck hunters.""

A Carnival cruise ship that departed Miami has “a small number” of people aboard who have tested positive for Covid-19 and it has been denied entry to ports at two Caribbean islands the cruise line said.

However the Carnival Freedom ship was granted access to visit Amber Cove in the Dominican Republic company spokesperson AnneMarie Mathews said in a prepared statement.

“Carnival Freedom is following all protocols and has a small number on board who are in isolation due to a positive Covid test” Mathews’ statement reads.

“Our protocols anticipate this possibility and we implement them as necessary to protect the health and safety of our guests and crew. This is a vaccinated cruise and all guests were also tested before embarkation” the statement reads.

The Carnival Freedom departed Miami on December 18 and stopped in Curacao on Tuesday. Its planned stops at the Caribbean islands of Bonaire on Wednesday and Aruba on Thursday were canceled.

Those stops were replaced by Friday’s stop in the Dominican Republic and the ship will return to Miami as planned on Sunday the cruise line said.

The ship’s entry into Curacao was also delayed due to the Covid-19 cases detected onboard.

Dr. Izzy Gerstenbluth the national epidemiologist for Curacao told CNN that he was alerted by the ship prior to its docking that it had crew members who tested positive for Covid-19.

Gerstenbluth wanted to assess the situation once the ship docked but he said he was delayed due to an emergency on the island. Once Gerstenbluth arrived on the cruise ship he determined the cases were contained among the crew he explained. Curacao allowed the ship’s passengers to leave the ship but the crew remained onboard he said.

Ashley Peterson a passenger aboard on the cruise told CNN the cruise line refused to inform her why the ship was delayed entry into Curacao. Later that day she learned from a news report the delay was triggered by Covid-19 infections she said.

Peterson said it wasn’t until the next day when the ship was denied entry into Bonaire that passengers were officially informed of the Covid-19 cases and said she may have taken a flight back to North Carolina if she knew of the positive cases.

When asked by CNN Carnival Cruise Line did not address specific claims by Peterson.

Carnival and many other cruise lines require passengers to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 with some exceptions for children.

The cruise line is working closely with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health authorities at the destination it visits according to the statement.

“The rapid spread of the Omicron variant may shape how some destination authorities view even a small number of cases even when they are being managed with our vigorous protocols” Mathews’ statement reads. “Some destinations have limited medical resources and are focused on managing their own local response to the variant.

“Should it be necessary to cancel a port we will do our best to find an alternative destination.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3Rvcnkvb24tYW4tOC1kYXktY3J1aXNlLXdlLXdpbGwtaGF2ZS1vbmx5LWdvbmUtdG8tb25lLXBsYWNlLW9uLWEtZGVsYXllZC1zY2hlZHVsZS10aGV5LXRoaW5rLTEwMC1wZXItcm9vbS1pcy1lbm91Z2gtY29tcGVuc2F0aW9uLTExNjQwNTI4MDI10gGtAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9hbXAvc3Rvcnkvb24tYW4tOC1kYXktY3J1aXNlLXdlLXdpbGwtaGF2ZS1vbmx5LWdvbmUtdG8tb25lLXBsYWNlLW9uLWEtZGVsYXllZC1zY2hlZHVsZS10aGV5LXRoaW5rLTEwMC1wZXItcm9vbS1pcy1lbm91Z2gtY29tcGVuc2F0aW9uLTExNjQwNTI4MDI1?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'They think $100 per room is enough compensation?'

Over 60 vessels were under observation after ""reported cases of COVID-19 have met the threshold for CDC investigation"" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

The Washington Post reported that several cruise liners were denied port at their scheduled destinations.

One of them the Carnival Freedom was turned away from the Caribbean island of Bonaire the Post reported.

""We're sailing on a petri dish"" said Ashley Peterson a 34-year-old passenger on board cited by the Post. ""I feel like I just spent my past week at a superspreader event.""

In a statement to AFP Carnival confirmed that ""a small number on board were isolated due to a positive COVID test.""

""The rapid spread of the omicron variant may shape how some destination authorities with limited medical resources may view even a small number of cases even when they are being managed with our vigorous protocols"" the company said without providing further details.

The Carnival Freedom arrived in Miami Sunday morning debarked all guests and ""will depart on its next voyage as planned"" the company said adding if it was denied entry to a certain port it would work ""to find an alternative destination.""

It added the CDC was ""fully informed and supportive of our protocols and operational plans.""

Earlier this week 55 people tested positive for COVID-19 aboard a Royal Caribbean International cruise the company said.

The infections spread among passengers and crew members on the ""Odyssey of the Seas"" despite 95% of the people on board being vaccinated against the coronavirus according to Royal Caribbean.

The ship did not dock at the Caribbean islands of Curacao and Aruba the last scheduled stops on its eight-day voyage out of precaution.

Here's What You Need To Remember: In 1996 a group of PLA officers including intelligence chief Gen. Ji Shengde approached Xu Zengping a former PLA basketball star who had become a successful businessman arranging international events. The cabal’s proposal: to have Xu purchase the carrier as a private citizen ostensibly to serve as a casino so as to avoid undesirable scrutiny.

China was proud to launch its first aircraft carrier the Liaoning in 2012. This vessel was a refit of an incomplete Soviet Kuznetsov-class cruiser carrier. However the story of how China got that ship in the first place may as well be a comedy—because the carrier was actually a rogue acquisition for the Chinese military against the wishes of the government in Beijing. And it was undertaken by a basketball player who claimed he wanted to build a floating casino.

The People's Liberation Army Navy first became interested in acquiring an aircraft carrier in 1970 when China was still on bad terms with both the Soviet Union and the United States. However few concrete steps were taken because the cost and complexity of such an endeavor far exceeded the PLAN’s limited capabilities during the Cold War.

The Soviet Navy did deploy its first carriers in the 1970s: Kiev-class vessels that could launch Yak-38 Forger jump jets of limited effectiveness. By the 1980s the Soviets began construction of two more promising Kuznetsov-class carriers. These had a “ski jump” ramp allowing more conventional—and much higher-performing—Su-33 Flanker fighters to take off from it. Like the earlier Kiev class the Kuznetsov was technically an “aircraft-carrying cruiser” due its powerful armament of twelve P-700 Granit antiship missile systems. This technicality was important as “aircraft carriers” proper weighing more than fifteen thousand tons (which is to say virtually all aircraft carriers today) were not legally permitted by the Montreux Convention to transit from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean via the Bosporus Straits.

However the fall of the Soviet Union left the second vessel in its class the Varyag only two-thirds complete in Ukraine lacking its armament and electrical systems. Construction ceased in 1992 and the cash-strapped Ukrainian government did its best to pawn off the fifty-five thousand tons of inoperable metal rusting in its Mykolaiv shipyard. Russia India and China all passed.

A two-part series in the South China Morning Post in 2015 revealed the machinations behind how the carrier ended up in Chinese service anyway two decades later. It turns out the PLA Navy did want the Varyag—the team sent to inspect it recommended purchasing it! But the government in Beijing was worried that acquiring a carrier might increase tensions at a time when it was seeking to further open itself to Western investors.

Instead in 1996 a group of PLA officers including intelligence chief Gen. Ji Shengde approached Xu Zengping a former PLA basketball star who had become a successful businessman arranging international events. The cabal’s proposal: to have Xu purchase the carrier as a private citizen ostensibly to serve as a casino so as to avoid undesirable scrutiny. Then the PLAN could collect it for its own use once the political winds were more favorable.

This cover story is not as ridiculous as it sounds. Remember those Kiev-class carriers mentioned earlier? Two of them are now moored in China serving as amusement parks. The Minsk was actually purchased by a consortium of video-game arcade owners in Shenzhen for $4.4 million and has since been moved to Nantong north of Shanghai. And the original Kiev? Now a floating hotel in Tianjin. However the more modern Kuznetsov-class Varyag was undoubtedly of much greater practical interest for the PLAN than either of those ships.

Xu was down with the scheme and borrowed the equivalent of $30 million in Hong Kong dollars from a friend to help fund the venture—the first expense of which was to create a $6 million shell company in Macau called Agência Turística e Diversões Chong Lot Limitada in order to maintain the fiction. (Macau was still in its last years as a Portuguese colony at the time.)

In January 1998 Xu arrived in Ukraine and met with the shipyard owners. After four days of negotiations in which enormous bribes were offered and fifty bottles of 124-proof baijiu liquor were consumed he reached an agreement to purchase the carrier for $20 million—well below the cost of a single jet fighter today. He wasn’t able to make the payment until a year later with a $10 million extra late fee tacked on.

Some international observers smelled something fishy in the arrangement—Xu’s company did not actually have a gambling permit in Macau nor a listed phone number or address. Ironically however a Jane’s analyst interviewed by the Washington Post at the time stated it was “farfetched” that the PLA Navy would try to operate the Varyag due to its decrepit and incomplete condition.

By June 2000 everything was ready to go. The carrier’s four engines were packed in grease seals (they had yet to be installed) several tons of blueprints were sent overland to China by truck and a Dutch towing company was ready to tug the 306-meter-long vessel all the way back to China. What could go wrong?

Ever been stunned by the towing fee after your car breaks down far from home? Imagine that but around five hundred times worse. Why five hundred? Because that equals the roughly five hundred days the Liaoning was stuck being towed in circles off Istanbul after the Turkish government denied it passage to the Mediterranean via the Bosporus Straits.

The Turkish maritime minister argued that should there be a mishap towing the 306-meter-long carrier—which could not maneuver or move on its own power—it might spin around and block the Bosporus straits to all shipping or run into one of the bridges connecting the two halves of Istanbul. The straits are only seven hundred meters wide at their narrowest point and require at least six major course corrections to navigate. Hundreds of ships had suffered accidents there in the past. Curiously the Chinese appear to have perceived the Turkish refusal to be in retaliation for China’s opposition to the NATO air campaign in Yugoslavia the previous year.

The Liaoning spent sixteen months racking up $8500 a day in towing fees. Finally Beijing had a change of heart on the matter and stepped in on August 2001 promising major concessions on tourism to persuade the Turks to let the Varyag pass.

Finally on November 1 in an operation involving more than two dozens tug and emergency vessels the Varyag was towed through the Bosporus without incident and traversed the Dardanelles the next day. The hard part was over.

Except for the sea storm with sixty-mile-per-hour winds that struck the rudderless vessel off the island of Skyros two days later causing it to snap its tow lines. It took two more days to recover the runaway carrier. Tragically a Portuguese sailor fell to his death while helping reconnect it to its tugs.

Once under power a normal vessel could have taken the shortcut through the Suez Canal and straight on back to China via the Indian Ocean. But the canal would not accept powerless vessels such as the Varyag so it had to cruise all the way around Africa Vasco de Gama–style chugging along at a brisk jog of seven miles per hour.

In March 2002 the carrier finally arrived at the port of Dalian in Liaoning province which would lend the carrier its name in Chinese service. Three years later it was put into a dry dock to allow for an extensive refit process including sandblasting away all the rust and restoring and installing the engines in 2011.

The PLAN intended to operate the vessel as a pure carrier rather than as a cruiser-carrier hybrid so the shipbuilders didn’t bother with the enormous antiship missile systems. They instead confined its armament to a trio of short-range HQ-10 air-defense missile launchers and a few close-defense guns. The vessel’s primary weapon of course would be its complement of twenty-four J-15 Flying Shark fighters. The Flying Sharks are domestic copies of the Russian Su-33 fighter a prototype of which was also acquired from Ukraine in 2001. The Liaoning also flies six Z-12F antisubmarine helicopters four airborne early-warning variants and two Z-9 rescue choppers.

The Liaoning was commissioned on September 25 2012 and the first J-15 landed on it a month later. A home-built carrier based upon the Liaoning will soon put to sea this year; those blueprints must have proved useful.

The Liaoning is hardly equal to a U.S. supercarrier—in addition to its smaller air wing and lack of a nuclear power plant its steam turbines are prone to breaking down and the ski-jump deck limits the fuel and weapons load its fighters can carry. However it afforded China a leap forward in its naval construction program—which now includes five more carriers in the coming decade of increasing planned capability. According to Xu Zengping a naval officer told him that the Varyag saved China fifteen years of research and development.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEyL2VuZC1vZi15ZWFyLTIwMjEtZi0zNS1taWxlc3RvbmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,End of Year 2021 F-35 Milestones,"End of Year 2021 F-35 Milestones Naval News reached out to the Joint Strike Fighter Program Office in December 2021 for an update on the F-35 and how the U.S. Defense Department views the latest developments in peer nations copying this single-engine single pilot stealth fighter that has entered operational service with the U.S. Armed Forces and U.S. allies around the world. The F-35 arguably has pushed the envelope in 5th Generation fighter technology with technology advancements in stealth design sensor fusion adaptability computer processing power commonality situational awareness and digital architecture and avionics. While the F-35 still has some “teething problems” to resolve the design has matured enough to be able to take off from U.S. and NATO nuclear-powered and conventional aircraft carriers.

To close the 2021 year on news about the F-35 Joint Stealth Fighter updates Naval News reached out to the F-35 Lightning II Joint Program Office with questions in December 2021 and received a reply from Laura M. Seal Public Affairs Lead F-35 Lightning II Joint Program Office. Naval News asked the Joint Program Office about future weapons that the F-35 might carry such as the Raytheon “Stormbreaker” AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile (JATM) LRASM or any new gun pods and the F-35 Joint Program Office referred Naval News to the branch services and International Partners of the F-35 for answers; therefore look for F-35 armament update stories from Naval News in the future.

“The F-35 enterprise is bringing the world’s most advanced fighter capabilities to bear from the Middle East to the Arctic. To date the F-35 enterprise has delivered more than 730 aircraft 11 services worldwide have declared initial operational capability and five countries have conducted operational F-35 missions.”

Laura M. Seal Public Affairs Lead F-35 Lightning II Joint Program Office

According to the Lockheed Martin’s “F-35 Fast Facts” as of December 1 2021 the F-35 stealth fighter’s Short-Takeoff and Vertical Landing (STOVL or F-35B) and folding-wing aircraft carrier variant (F-35C) have achieved 8 out of 16 carrier activations and are active in 21 out of 30 bases around the world. The F-35s have achieved 463000+ flight hours (and that number includes the conventional takeoff F-35As used by the Air Forces) in 267263 sorties with 14 services flying the single engine single pilot stealth fighter with 11 services declaring Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in nine nations. F-35s have seen six operational missions and 254+ detachments and deployments completed.

Meanwhile production unit costs have shrunk for all variants as has the cost per flight hour while reliability and “maintenance man hours per flight” have steadily improved.

Aircraft carriers that currently have and are planned to operate the F-35Bs and F-35Cs are:

USS Wasp (LHD 1)

USS Essex (LHD 2)

USS America (LHA 6)

HMS Queen Elizabeth (UK)

USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70)

Through various legal and illegal means peer nations have copied the U.S.’s F-35 stealth fighter with copycat designs of their own that closely resemble the Lockheed Martin design. Some improvements to the original Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter design were made by the peer nations such as twin-engines and possibly twin ejection seats whereas analysts have determined weaknesses and areas of interest in other features of these F-35 stealth fighter copycats.

Year-end Review

At the height of the global Covid-19 pandemic this year when many airlines around the globe grounded their aircraft and closed their routes national carrier Qatar Airways kept flying adding more destinations and meeting the needs of thousands of passengers.In tackling one of the most challenging and extraordinary 12 months in the airline's nearly 25-year history Qatar Airways has displayed its strength resilience and commitment.Qatar Airways played a key role providing lifeline to many during the pandemic delivering vaccines PPE medical equipment and even e-commerce.This year Qatar Airways won the 'Airline of the Year' at the 2021 World Airline Awards managed by the international air transport rating organisation Skytrax.2021 also saw Qatar Airways becoming the 'first global airline in the world' to achieve the 'prestigious' five-star Covid-19 Airline Safety Rating by international air transport rating organisation Skytrax.The national airline's home and hub Hamad International Airport (HIA) was named the 'World's Best Airport' in the Skytrax 2021 World Airport Awards.HIA has been steadily rising in the 'World's Best Airports' rankings since the start of its operations in 2014.Hamad International Airport expansion is one month ahead of schedule and will be completed by September 2022 boosting annual passenger capacity by 20mn.Qatar Airways was the first GCC carrier to join global airline alliance oneworld enabling its passengers to benefit from more than 1000 airports in more than 160 countries with 14250 daily departures.Qatar Airways Cargo one of the world's leading international air cargo carriers serves more than 60 freighter destinations worldwide via its world-class Doha hub and also delivers freight in the belly-hold deck of passenger aircraft to an extensive network.Recently Qatar Airways became the first carrier to make a transaction on the IATA Aviation Carbon Exchange (ACE) using IATA Clearing House (ICH).The IATA Aviation Carbon Exchange (ACE) is a centralised marketplace where airlines and other aviation stakeholders can trade CO2 emission reduction units for compliance or voluntary offsetting purposes. With a secure and easy to use trading environment ACE offers the highest transparency in terms of price and availability of emission reduction units while simplifying the process for air carriers to access carbon markets to achieve their decarbonisation targets.Last month Qatar Airways said it was looking at carbon-neutral growth and seeks the help of fuel suppliers to give affordable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).Group Chief Executive HE Akbar al-Baker said at a media event at the Doha International Airport in November“We are already are giving a good value for money to our passengers with the kind of product we offer. At the same time it is important for us that our growth should remain carbon-neutral.”Al-Baker had also said Qatar Airways was going to“imminently place” a large freighter order to meet the needs of the national airline's cargo business.'We are seriously looking at placing a large cargo order a freighter order because ... as we are also growing our freight business we need to be sustainable in that and we are going to imminently place a large freighter order' al-Baker said.In November Qatar Airways showcased its role as a global launch customer for the latest generation Boeing 777-9 aircraft after welcoming the ultra-modern fuel efficient jet to Doha International Airport (DIA).The aircraft which is anticipated to join the award-winning airline's fleet in the near future will be the world's largest and most efficient twin-engine jet delivering 20% lower fuel consumption and emissions than previous generation aircraft. Key technologies enabling this efficiency are its new carbon-fibre composite wing new engines and natural laminar flow nacelles.Recently British Airways and Qatar Airways marked the 'next milestone' in their Joint Business Partnership as they announce their intent to extend their Joint Business.This month Qatar Executive the private jet charter division of Qatar Airways Group took delivery of a further three Gulfstream G650ER aircraft reaffirming its position as the largest owner-operator of the ultramodern jet with a total of 11 in its fleet. All three aircraft will operate on strategic ultra-long-haul routes to Africa the Americas Asia-Pacific and Europe.In November Qatar Airways brought its Airbus A380 aircraft back into operation to alleviate fleet capacity challenges for the winter peak season.It was for the first time in more than 18 months earlier this week that a Qatar Airways Airbus A380 took to the skies positioning the aircraft from Doha International Airport (DIA) to Hamad International Airport (HIA) after the airline reluctantly took the decision to welcome the fleet back into operation due to ongoing capacity shortage.Al-Baker said“When it comes to the preparation for Hamad International Airport we are on target. We are going to increase the capacity (annual) of the airport by 20mn passengers – to cater to over 58mn passengers. It is a world class facility that we are putting up- and as a matter of fact we don't want to be number two anymore.”“We always want to be the best airport in the world. And this is exactly what we are aiming for… and this is what we will deliver.”Qatar Airways' ambition to bring people together through the power of sport and to support the communities in which it operates continued this year despite the challenges presented by the pandemic.As 'Official Airline Partner' of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 the national carrier is looking forward to being the airline that will fly millions of football fans to Qatar for the tournament.ends"

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

RESERVE – In 2019 DSC Dredge LLC a world leading manufacturer of cutter suction dredges located in St. John the Baptist Parish signed a memorandum of understanding with Deep Diggers Ltd Bangladesh with a project focus of providing an engineering design and component package.

Deep Diggers Ltd imported all the dredge components from DSC including the Caterpillar diesel engine dredge pump gearbox cutter assembly winches hydraulic system and lever room and controls. All steel fabrication including the hull side pontoons ladder and spuds were built by Deep Diggers at their facility in Chattogram Bangladesh. Deep Diggers installed all the DSC supplied components including the complete hydraulic and electrical systems. After a year building and countless manpower hours the two companies are proud to announce the successful launch of two 18” Shark Class dredges. DSC provided Product Support for 30 days onsite to help commission the two new dredges and provide crew training in operations and maintenance.

A video of the launch accompanying this announcement is available by clicking here.

Director of International Dredge Sales at DSC Dredge Charles Sinunu commented “Deep Diggers Chairman Gauhar Siraj Jamil and his directors had the wisdom and confidence that they could produce quality dredges with the support from DSC. I expected some challenges with the first build but everything went very smoothly. We have proved the concept to ourselves and to the local market. We look forward to a very long relationship with Deep Diggers.”

The 18” Shark Model SH-10300-200-56D has the advantage to dig to 17m (56 ft) below the surface deeper than most of the dredges in Bangladesh. The dredges built in Bangladesh will use the same advanced components as DSC dredges built in the USA including variable displacement-load sense and variable displacement-closed loop systems. They are powered by a single Caterpillar C32 diesel engine rated 1125 hp and features a 200 hp cutter drive.

With the advanced DSC hydraulic system and fuel-efficient Caterpillar engine this dredge will have a very low cost of operation which means more profits for the dredge contractors in Bangladesh. This is a game changer for their industry.

One of the Deep Diggers Directors Mr. Omar Sharif (Tuhin) stated “We were pleased to partner with the premier dredge manufacturer from the USA DSC Dredge. I have known Charlie Sinunu for more than 15 years and we always hoped that we could find a project together. Now as one of the Directors of Deep Diggers and the local representative of DSC we can build as well as service all DSC dredges in the country. We are factory trained and pride ourselves on providing 24/7/365 service to all DSC clients in Bangladesh. We look forward to building many more dredges in the future with DSC.”

DSC Dredge President and CEO Bob Wetta commented “I am extremely proud of the finished product with all of the setbacks of COVID in 2020 the Deep Diggers manufacturing team stayed diligent in bringing this dredge to life. We look forward to the future and what it holds for our collaboration.”

DSC is a global leader in the dredge manufacturing industry engineering superior customized dredging solutions to meet specific application needs while continuing to exceed customer expectations.

In fact sometimes it's a little stomach-turning or even downright horrific. In 2021 we saw plenty of examples that demonstrated just how gruesome nature could be. From sex-crazed zombies to tongue-gobbling parasites here are some of the biggest gross-outs in science news this year.

Mind-controlled necrophiliacs

Why would male flies mate with dead females? A fungus made them do it. (Image credit: A. Naundrup et al.)

A type of fungus that affects house flies eats them from the inside out consuming the flies' bodies after hijacking their brains and making them climb elevated surfaces to disperse fungal spores. Even after infected females have died the fungus still has a use for the corpses. From inside each corpse the fungus emits a scent that lures male flies and compels them to mate with the dead females in order to distribute the fungal spores even more widely.

Fuzzy eyeballs

A rare and bizarre condition affecting a male deer in Tennessee caused a dense layer of hair to sprout from its eyeballs  leaving the corneas completely covered. Known as corneal dermoids the growths were benign tumors made up of skin tissue containing hair follicles and they likely formed early in the animal's development. As the deer grew what would normally have been clear corneal tissue was instead covered by a layer of skin and hair obscuring the animal's vision.

Stomach bursters

A population of Melitaea cinxia butterflies that an ecologist released on a Finnish archipelago in 1991 introduced a Russian nesting doll set of parasites to the island ecosystem. Tucked away inside the caterpillars were the eggs and larvae of a parasitic wasp Hyposoter horticola. And hiding inside the Hyposoter larvae was a second smaller parasite: another wasp Mesochorus stigmaticus. The larger wasp species hatches and grows inside the caterpillar eventually bursting through the insect's body and killing it. But while Hyposoter grows so too does the Mesochorus parasite which bursts out of the living body of its wasp host and then exits the corpse of the caterpillar.

Rectal mushroom

When scientists discovered a tiny 50 million-year-old carpenter ant preserved in amber they noticed that the ant's body contained a little something extra: tendrils of a parasitic fungus that culminated in a bulbous cap poking from the insect's posterior. The piece of amber came from the Baltic region and DNA analysis revealed that the fungus was a previously unknown species which the researchers named Allocordyceps baltica. Had the insect and fungus not been engulfed by sticky tree resin and locked in an amber tomb the mushroom that stuck out of the ant's rear-end would have released spores as part of the fungus's reproductive cycle.

Tongue-eaters

Here's a relationship that's in questionable taste: A parasitic isopod replaced the tongue of a fish that was recently caught in Texas. Also known as a tongue-eating louse the most well-known species of this isopod is Cymothoa exigua. Juvenile isopods swim inside a fish's mouth by entering through the gills; they then clasp onto the tongue and cut off the blood supply until the organ eventually withers and falls off. The growing isopod then replaces the tongue in the fish's mouth. But this process doesn't kill the fish which can coexist with these parasites for years.

A taste for organs

Mmmmm organs. Asian knife-toothed kukri snakes know what they like and what they like are frog organs which are preferably consumed while their prey is still alive. Researchers observed multiple instances of the snakes feasting on organs from frogs in Thailand Vietnam and Hong Kong. Kukri snakes typically use their daggerlike teeth to slice open eggs but their teeth are equally effective when used as slashing weapons to expose frogs' innards. Two of the snakes were seen swallowing their frogs whole — but only after consuming the organs first the scientists reported.

Social vomit

Social networks for humans might be somewhat less popular if people had to build their connections with vomit. But that system seems to work just fine for ants which forge bonds by vomiting into each others' mouths. Known as trophallaxis this practice allows ants to share proteins nutrients and hormones and it strengthens connections between colony members. An ant colony can contain thousands of individuals divided into groups each performing specialized tasks that can affect their stomach contents. But when those contents are passed from mouth to mouth the entire colony can share an individual's nutritional and hormonal benefits.

Caterpillar drinkers

Of course 2021 would be the year that scientists informed us about butterflies slashing open caterpillars to drink their insides. Researchers in Indonesia watched as seven species of milkweed butterflies drank from ""wounded and oozing caterpillars"" in grisly meals that sometimes lasted for hours. Using tiny claws on their feet the butterflies carved gashes in caterpillars' bodies to expose the liquid inside; because caterpillars eat milkweed plants their body juices were brimming with chemicals from the chewed-up leaves. This made the caterpillars delicious targets for male butterflies which use milkweed compounds to help them attract females.

Carcass shredders

It's not every day that marine biologists get to observe (and film) a group of hungry great white sharks tearing a humpback whale carcass into bite-size chunks. A team of researchers in Massachusetts embarked on a tagging mission in August and were looking for basking sharks when they spotted a shark ""feeding frenzy"" around the floating corpse of a young humpback in Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. The scientists captured photos and video of the carnage and were even able to attach acoustic sensors to some of the great white sharks as they fed; that way they could later track the movements and behaviors of these deep-sea predators.

Butt-busting fungus

During the spring and into the summer of 2021 black-bodied red-eyed cicadas emerged in the northeastern United States in the billions. This mass emergence happens once every 17 years and a deadly fungus called Massospora cicadina which only parasitizes cicadas  follows the same 17-year timetable. Fungal spores in soil cling to the exoskeleton of a cicada nymph after it digs its way out of the ground; the spores then penetrate the cicada's body and multiply as the nymph metamorphoses into an adult. Eventually the fungus becomes so dense inside the living insect that it replaces the cicada's rear-end with a solid mass of yellow spores that are visible when that part of the cicada's exoskeleton cracks and falls off. The fungus also changes cicada behavior making the insect mate more frequently — and thereby infect more cicadas.

Phil Mickelson is one of the most prominent golfers on the PGA Tour. He has 45 PGA Tours and six major championship wins in his career so far. Moreover Mickelson also became the oldest player to win a major championship as he won the 2021 PGA Championship. He won this event at 50 at Kiawah Island.

Since the pandemic break Phil Mickelson has started wearing sunglasses while playing golf. Meanwhile wearing sunglasses while golfing isn’t a common sight and hence it amused everyone. Moreover he revealed the exact reason for wearing these glasses on a golf course during an event. So let us see why exactly does Phil Mickelson wears sunglasses?

Why did Phil Mickelson started wearing sunglasses?

Phil Mickelson wore sunglasses for the first time at the Charles Schwab Challenge which was the first event after the pandemic. After a few days Mickelson was in the commentary box where they asked him the reason for wearing sunglasses. “Back during Covid break I did this Carac cream which is like skin cancer chemotherapy treatment on your face for like two weeks” said Phil.

“You skin blotches up and you kill these cancer cells that you can’t see. And when I went outside I had to wear some protection. So I wore these glasses to kind of protect the area around my eyes.” However it wasn’t clear if he was using the cream as a precaution or to combat an existing condition.

Moreover Phil Mickelson said they didn’t move around while swinging and it helped him to keep his eyes relaxed as well. Hence the 2021 PGA Championship winner decided to wear glasses every time while playing on a golf course.

The term has been awash in conversation this year – but it’s actually been around as far back since the 1970s. From slick billboards to paper straws we look at how greenwashing has shapeshifted to the many guises that are still rife in society today.

What is greenwashing and how can I avoid it?

A History of Greenwashing: How Did We Get Here?

It all started with a towel

Greenwashing was coined by a student looking for a towel back in the 1980s at a hotel in Fiji . It’s said that he found a note asking guests of the hotel to pick up their towels because reusing them would help the environment. That student was the environmentalist Jay Westerfield who noticed an astonishing irony. While the resort claimed to be protecting the reefs and the island’s ecosystem on the note the resort was in the middle of an expansion. Westerfield wrote an essay citing the hotel’s note as greenwashing for a literary magazine and the term got picked up in mainstream media.

1970 – 1990s: Behind advertising’s glittering façade

Only a year after Westerfield’s essay was published came the notorious People Do campaign by Chevron an American energy company. Commonly cited as the best example of corporate greenwashing the campaign ran through the mid-1980s featuring cuddly bears sea turtles and butterflies and showing their work restoring marshes once used for oil exploration.

What’s typically prevalent in greenwashing is that there’s always an element of truth to the claims but what critics pointed out was that many of their deeds featured in advertising campaigns were mandated by the law. As the Guardian highlighted Chevron’s environmental CV wasn’t exactly watertight with reports claiming the company was violating the clean air act.

Before the term ‘greenwashing’ was even coined there was the infamous Crying Indian commercial by Keep America Beautiful in 1971. The bucolic scene was set with a native American Indian making his way through an Eden-like river on a wooden canoe. He oars to a city harbour that’s strewn with litter set in a shipyard that’s thick with smog. Gazing outward onto the main road someone tosses their litter on him from a car he looks at the camera with a tear rolling down.

Peel behind the storyline and the advertisement quickly loses its sheen. The protagonist: the crying Indian was neither crying nor an Indian. The Hollywood actor was an Italian-American Espera Oscar DeCorti whose braided hair was a wig and skin colour was deepened with makeup.

Keep America Beautiful producers of the campaign was founded by The American Can Co. and the Owens Illinois Glass Co. and later Coca Cola and the Dixie Cup Co. But during the 1970s after the advertisement debuted Keep Americal Beautiful went against the ‘bottles bill’ legislation that would require soft drink producers to sell their goods in reusable containers.

Early 2000s: It’s Not Me; It’s You – shifting the blame onto the individual

The Keep America Beautiful campaign’s main takeaway was to encourage the public to clear away their litter and it still speaks for how climate change is often portrayed in the media. Much of the political industry-wide systemic problems with climate change are often idealistically repackaged into personal problems that the public can ‘solve’ in their daily lives echoing the advertisement that aired almost 50 years ago.

BP popularised the term ‘carbon footprint’ in 2004 which almost two decades later is so widespread that’s its origin as a marketing campaign is often lost. In 2006 the company unveiled its carbon footprint calculator where the public could calculate how their normal daily life which included things like going to work and buying food became complicit in climate change.

Where we are now

The law is catching up with greenwashing. The US Federal Trade Commission is due to review its Green Guide which will provide an outline for environmental marketing claims in 2022. The UK watchdog Competition and Markets Authority is currently investigating greenwashing too. But we still have a long way to go: only 20% of the UK public actually trust if a product is sustainable. For a practical guide on how to avoid greenwashed products have a read of our tips.

McDonald’s followed up with with Famous Orders for J Balvin and ventured into the K-Pop world with the band BTS. These celebrity meals repackaged foods that were already on McDonald’s menu sometimes adding special sauce packets as a novelty. The Saweetie Meal offered in July include “Saweetie ‘N Sour” sauce for dipping Chicken McNuggets.

McDonald’s wasn’t alone

Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen banded with rapper Megan Thee Stallion on Megan Thee Stallion Hottie Sauce for its chicken sandwiches and nuggets in October.

Taco Bell appointed Little Nas X as chief impact officer an honorary title the chain said “would allow him to collaborate on the brand experience from the inside out.”

And Snoop Dogg continued an association with Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers that included working a drive-thru window at a Dallas restaurant.

Chicken sandwiches

Fried chicken sandwiches have become a must-have on quick service menus. The so-called chicken sandwich wars started in August 2019 when Popeyes Louisiana Chicken added a sandwich to its menu going up against Chick-fil-A and in 2021 nobody seemed willing to call a truce.

“Now it’s just required that everyone have a chicken sandwich” said marketing expert Deb Gabor author of “Irrational Loyalty” a book about how companies bond with consumers.

Carl’s Jr. went big on crispy chicken added sandwiches to its permanent menu and its breakfast menu and then following up with limited time offers. Burger King McDonald’s and Farmer Boys made similar moves.

Chains that were already known for chicken such as KFC and Wendy’s added new chicken sandwiches to their menus.

Jollibee an Asian restaurant chain that is rapidly growing in the United States entered the fray in September with its Jollibee Chickenwich and in December introduced Spicy Chickenjoy a hotter version of its signature fried chicken.

Virtual brands

With restaurants closed or unable to use all of their space due to lockdown the novel coronavirus created a growth climate for online brands that are ordered through delivery services. They bring food to the public instead of requiring people to come to them.

Such businesses are called virtual kitchens. Other frequently used terms include ghost kitchens and cloud kitchens. They often have short menus focused on items that travel well such as chicken wings.

The appeal to entrepreneurs is low startup costs and fewer real estate headaches.

Robert Earl co-founder of Virtual Dining Concepts was selected by Quick Service Restaurants magazine as one of the top digital disruptors of 2021. Last last year he hit pay dirt launching Mr. Beast Burger a partnership with influencer Jimmy Donaldson who has 62 million YouTube subscribers.

Earl also partnered with celebrity chef Guy Fieri and other stars such as Mariah Carey whose McDonald’s collaboration includes free cookies perhaps putting her in competition with her own online cookie business.

One of his newer concepts is Buddy V’s Cake Slice a partnership with “Cake Boss” star Buddy Valastro that can be ordered in Southern California cities from Encino to Yucaipa according to its website.

Established restaurant chains are also dabbling in virtual concepts. They include Dickey’s Barbecue Pit which in June launched a virtual brand called Big Deal Burgers. Cracker Barrel which has only two locations in the Inland Empire expanded its footprint into Hollywood through a virtual operation called Cracker Barrel Kitchen.

‘Real’ food

Consumers’ growing awareness of what they’re putting in their bodies has caused several restaurant chains to describe their foods as minimally processed or “real.”

Islands Restaurant a casual chain launched a “clean food” campaign last summer promoting its made-to-order french fries.

In August Shake Shack boasted about Damon Roy the New Orleans beekeeper who generated much of the raw honey used in the glaze for the chain’s Hot Honey Chicken sandwich.

Chipotle Mexican Grill which boasts about the limited number of ingredients in its foods takes it a step further by campaigning for sustainability. In November it announced a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent by 2030 in its supply chain restaurant operations and packaging.

Chipotle also carries out its real food theme in its online merchandise. This month it introduced an “all natural” bar of cilantro soap.

Staff shortages

Fallout from the novel coronavirus pandemic continues months after California reopened dining rooms.

Restaurants are striving to make customers’ experiences as normal as possible but staffing shortages remain a challenge.

Some have responded by shortening their menus shortening their hours or opening on fewer days.

But the challenge is more than just the number of employees according to Mike Whatley vice president for State Affairs and Grassroots Advocacy for the National Restaurant Association.

It’s the loss of experience and even of a friendly face that diners remember.

“We’ve lost a lot of talent both front of house and back of house” he said in a phone interview.

“There are a lot of people who go to a restaurant because of their favorite food server or favorite bartender. If that person has left the industry or left that restaurant that affects customer experience.”",,,,,,

Some 1200 people attended the unexpectedly emotional gathering.

Heidelberg's famous Church of the Holy Spirit a 600-year-old edifice in the town's historic city center was the scene of an unusual religious service on Sunday where some 1200 congregants came together to pray and contemplate (and enjoy) a performance of US pop star Taylor Swift's songs as part of a special liturgy.

Staged under the name ""Anti-Hero — Taylor Swift Church Service"" organizers at the Protestant church said the event was conceived to attract younger people as well as to focus on the profound religious convictions expressed in many of Swift's songs.

Swift — who was not at the service but rather on her latest European tour — was raised in the American ""Bible Belt"" and has never hidden her Christian beliefs often integrating these into her music.

This was what inspired church organizers. ""The Church of the Holy Spirit has always been a place of encounter and exchange. That's why a pop-music religious service fits so perfectly"" said Heidelberg Pastor Christof Ellsiepen. ""With it we are giving space to the questions and issues that occupy the younger generation.""

A contemplation of the gospel according to Tay-Tay

Though the idea might suggest a wild concert atmosphere it was largely one of quiet devotion.

Parish Pastor Vincenzo Petracca quoted numerous lyrics and traced Swift's biography emphasizing her attachment to and understanding of Christianity in everyday life.

Petracca acknowledged that Swift's songs are open to numerous interpretations but highlighted the strong Christian — and political — messages she integrates into her songs which address the subjects of women's rights racism and gender equality among others.

The pastor noted however that such topics have made Swift the object of criticism in conservative Christian circles especially among Evangelicals in the US who have branded her ""anti-Christian.""

Swift herself has chastised ""hypocritical faith"" that puts dogma before people. The pastor emphasized as well that ""her faith knows doubt and inner-conflict.""

""Theologically speaking she points to the justness of God"" says Petracca adding ""For her faith and action are inseparable.""

A congregation moved to tears and dancing in their pews

Throughout both Sunday services — two were staged in order to accommodate the large number of people who attended — the congregation which was notably younger and and more female than is often the case were treated to live performances of six Swift songs.

These were performed by Tine Weichmann — a singer from Hamburg and now a professor of popular church music in Heidelberg — and her band. Behind them a rainbow-colored sign reading ""Everybody is welcome!""

One of the most emotionally stirring moments of the service came when Weichmann and her band performed ""Soon You'll Get Better."" Swift wrote the song for her mother who had been diagnosed with cancer.

The lyrics she penned speak to desperation and the healing powers of medicine — and of prayer: ""Holy orange bottles each night I pray to you / Desperate people find faith so now I pray to Jesus too.""

Pastor Petracca who admitted the Church of the Holy Spirit was ""built for Gregorian liturgical music and not for Taylor Swift"" said of the service ""I stared into beaming faces — and during the song that Taylor wrote for her cancer-stricken mother many had tears in their eyes.""

But no Swift-themed service would be complete without an uplifting communal outburst of joy which is exactly what happened when the band struck up the concluding hymn ""Shake It Off!"" This brought the entire congregation to their feet singing and dancing before breaking into furious applause.

""Anti-Hero"" was just the latest in a series of ""City Church Rock 'n' Pop"" services started in 2015.

This June the Church of the Holy Spirit has invited guests from across Europe to take part in a street dance service that will be held at the same time as its ""Church Battle"" dance competition.

PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- Philadelphia police are investigating after a vandal spray-painted swastikas and anti-LGBTQ messages around St. John's Lutheran Church in the Mayfair section last week.

Whoever did it also targeted a flag meant to promote inclusivity authorities say.

Members and employees of St. John's Lutheran Church arrived Friday morning to find hateful homophobic messages spray-painted on several walkways outside the church.

Pastor Daniel Eisenberg told Action News in an exclusive interview that the vandal didn't stop there.

""It was shared with me that the progress flag that we have hanging that was not only ripped down but also the same message was spray-painted on it"" he said.

Investigators also reported that what appears to be two swastikas were spray-painted on the pavement outside the church.

The pastor says that while this act of hatred has him rattled the response from the community has given him hope.

""Five or six people showed up with pressure washers and ready to go"" he said. ""And like within 12 hours after these messages of hate were put up they were gone.""

On Monday detectives unveiled surveillance images of the vandal which unfortunately are not very clear.

Now investigators are looking for more surveillance video along the 3100 block of Tyson Avenue from last Thursday night.

In the meantime Eisenberg says he hopes the person who did this realizes that acting on your hatred is never a good idea.

""I wish that whoever did this could see all of us as siblings of God. See us as people worthy of dignity and respect"" he says.

If anyone recognizes the person in the surveillance images or if anyone has information on this case they are urged to contact the police.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2VyZXQuY29tL2ZhaXRoLzIwMjQvMDUvMTIvdXRhaC1sYXR0ZXItZGF5LXNhaW50LXRlbXBsZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Utah still 'the breadbasket of the church' – Deseret News,"This article was first published in the ChurchBeat newsletter. Sign up to receive the newsletter in your inbox each Wednesday night.

Utah will be home to 30 of the 350 temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints once construction is complete on all announced temples. The Deseret News recently spoke to the church’s Utah Area president Elder Kevin W. Pearson to talk about the state and temples after the media open house tour for the Taylorsville Utah Temple.

“Utah’s really still the breadbasket of the church” he said in an interview that touched on membership growth and activity and temple covenants and blessings.

Elder Pearson helped lead the media tour which kicked off a public open house that ends on May 18. The Taylorsville Temple will be dedicated on June 2.

Elder Pearson 67 who earned a Harvard MBA and was the CEO of a health care information technology and research company has a broad perspective on the church having served as a General Authority Seventy since 2008 when he was called while serving as president of the Washington Tacoma Mission. He previously served as president of the Pacific Area president of the North America West Area counselor in the Europe East Area presidency and area assistant in the North America Southwest Area.

Deseret News: What is the “State of the Union” for the Utah Area?

Elder Pearson: You’ve got roughly 2.2 million members of the church here. You’ve got some of the most active members in the church here. We have 645 soon to be 650 stakes in Utah. So there’s a tremendous amount of strength in Utah. I’m working with some of the strongest membership of the church.

This is really still where the bench strength is in terms of leadership. Probably still 52-plus percent of all senior couples that serve in the world come out of Utah. About 28-29-30% of all the young missionaries come out of Utah. So Utah’s really still the breadbasket of the church. It is a global church to be certain but the church globally is facilitated by the faithfulness of the members of the church.

Now 21 temples operate in Utah of 30 that are announced (for the state). Where do you think that comes from? It comes from the fact that members of the church have been so faithful in keeping the commandments that they have been blessed and prospered. They’ve prospered in the land to use Book of Mormon language and because of that their faithfulness in paying tithings has created extraordinary opportunity now. You think about April 6 1830 and the organization of the church then with six members to where we are today and what it took in terms of sacrifice to build Kirtland (Ohio) and Nauvoo (Illinois) and now the extraordinary abundance that the church has been blessed with is a direct function of the faithfulness of members of the church. It is extraordinary to go from location to location and witness that.

Almost every stake you go to you think ‘This has got to be the most faithful stake on on the earth’ but it’s just over and over and over. Now having said that there are struggles there are challenges for members of the church. The Salt Lake Valley is sort of declining in membership as people move out to the southwest and to Highland and on the other side of the lake and other places. So there are challenges but there are areas where the church is just exploding. We cannot possibly build buildings fast enough. And there are other areas where it’s like ‘OK this used to be an enormously strong area. Now it’s it’s changing.’ So Utah’s very dynamic is the point I’m trying to make. The church is very dynamic in Utah. It’s not monolithic in terms of the experience you have in any given stake or ward but it still continues to be the stronghold of the church. And it’s just a joy to serve here.

Deseret News: During the April general conference many of the talks were about temple covenants about finding stillness about following Jesus Christ’s teachings about the two great laws of loving God and loving others. What did you take away from conference?

Elder Pearson: If members listened carefully with all of these temples being announced and built — there seems to be one open house after another in Utah — I just hope that the members of the church don’t get casual about the extraordinary significance of having a House of the Lord.

We want to make sure that people are less excited about the architecture of a new building and ‘Boy I wonder what the color scheme is in this temple’ and a lot more focused on ‘What promises am I making what are those covenants?’ — the covenants of obedience and sacrifice and chastity and the gospel and consecration. We make very real promises to our Heavenly Father and the Savior and they are absolutely serious about those.

We’re hoping that members of the church will be ever more increasingly serious and focused on their own covenants. What we’re hoping is that these new temples will help members become ever more focused on putting the Savior and their covenants at the very center of their lives and not just having those an aspect of their lives. We hope the increased proximity of temples will help them with that. The proximity we hope will increase significantly the frequency that people get to the temple. The hope is that there will be a transformational mindset that whenever people see or think about the temple they’ll think about the Savior and they’ll think about the sacred promises they’ve made and they’ll be even more determined and committed to keeping them in every aspect of their life. We hope that members will come to cherish and honor those commitments and covenants above any and all other commitments in their lives. I think that’s the essence of the messages you would have heard over the weekend in conference.

We’re going to teach that. We’re going to continue to teach that everywhere we go at President Russell M. Nelson’s behest so that children will grow up knowing what promises are and what they mean and that they’ll be increasing in their capacity commitment and determination to make and keep sacred covenants in the temple and keep them all their lives.

Deseret News: What are the blessings that come from keeping those commitments in that focused way and making them central and making Christ central in one’s life?

Elder Pearson: My wife’s parents would be an example of this. They were Norwegian and they sold everything they had to come to the U.S. so they could be sealed in the temple. The blessing they wanted was an eternal family. First and foremost that is the blessing. For my wife June and I it’s to be sealed together for forever. The blessing is it changes the way we live our lives it changes the way we think about our marriage that we’re in it for the long term. We don’t let short-term roadblocks or bumps in the road upend us. That is a blessing. It shapes the way we live our lives. For many of members of the church in the past they would get to the temple once in their life and that was it but they went for that one blessing and that assurance.

For us in our day and time the blessing of the temple is that you can come and you can you can rise above the noise. You can rise above the lack of civility. You can rise above the disregard for sacred things and you can come to a space where you are literally a guest in the house of the Lord and you can feel more powerfully the influence of the Holy Ghost. You can feel a sense of peace and assurance in your life. Life is not perfect and there are many challenges that people face but they can come here and feel the blessing that because they’ve made covenants with the Savior in the end all will be well.

That is a day-to-day week-to-week month-to-month blessing that people can have in their lives that’s different than coming for the one blessing of being sealed for time and all eternity and never having an opportunity to go to the temple again.

In addition to that the temple is a place of revelation and a place to feel close to the Lord and to get the answers to challenges or questions or difficulties that you’re facing to gather up strength. All of those things are available in the temple. If you’re listening to our prophet in the days to come we are going to need that more than ever before. So I think the blessings available in the temple are constant but they’re also changing in terms of the times in which we live.

That’s something we hope we can help communicate effectively to the members of the church. Now you can come for daily blessings and weekly blessings and not only the singular hope of eternal families.

It was Hanlon himself who had brought Uehlein back to the church in 1999 after years of spiritual distance. On the day of Hanlon's funeral Uehlein sat in the front pew of the church and listened to the bell choir which he would normally direct. Six Jesuit priests concelebrated Mass and the parish was packed with friends and relatives. When the choir played a Celtic tune called ""Pulling Bracken"" Uehlein got up and sat back with the choir in the position that would have fallen to Hanlon to play his partner's part. At the end of the funeral a piece of disco music blasted into the church and all the attendees erupted in heartfelt applause as Hanlon's coffin was carried out Uehlein told NCR. ""He brought me to St. Francis Xavier at a time when I was probably in one of the darkest periods of my life. Not sure where I was headed not even living at home I was living in a halfway house"" said Uehlein.""That funeral was a true celebration of life.""

Until the group ceased to exist in 2006 both Uehlein and Hanlon were active members of St. Francis Xavier's ""Gonzaga Group"" which gathered dozens of LGBTQ parishioners with HIV/AIDS for more than 10 years to offer spiritual support. Even today to the left of the parish's main altar there is a smaller altar consecrated as a memorial for all those who have died of the disease dedicated to the Jesuit St. Aloysius Gonzaga who for the Catholic Church is the patron saint of young people and of AIDS patients and caregivers. In an account on the Outreach website leadership of the parish's gay and lesbian ministries said that in 1986 St. Francis Xavier was the first Catholic parish in the country to hold a memorial service for a man who had died of AIDS. Over the past 40 years since it has stood out among others in the New York Archdiocese for its pastoral activities aimed at LGBTQ parishioners' inclusion its constant liturgical and eucharistic renewal to make the sacraments more accessible to everyone and its mission to fight racism poverty hunger and homelessness.

The parish has more than 20 different ministries outreach and faith formation programs — ranging from environmental protection to racial justice from Ignatian spiritual direction to the practice of yoga for meditating at church. Its motto is simply ""All are welcome.""

""I have taken full liberty of the phrase in the general instruction in the Roman Missal where it says 'When local customs dictate' "" said Uehlein who today still serves as director of music ministries. He said being constantly prepared for a spiritual music repertoire that uniquely accompanies all the different groups and ministries in the parish as ""a really tricky line to walk."" ""The important thing is to be able to keep the music in a balanced way so that the universal liturgy of the church is not lost"" he said. He listed some of the most important music dance and readings programs he has created in recent years such as ""Songs for Peace"" which began after the beginning of the war in Syria in 2012 and ""Songs for the Earth"" which was started in 2007 and then repeated every year to raise awareness about environmental care along with the local environmental ministries of the parish.

Like Ulhein John Weber a 68-year-old member and coordinator of the Gay Catholics group at the church landed at the parish in the late 1990s. ""Maybe this is a home that I could belong to"" he recalled thinking after reading a New York Times article about the 1986 memorial for the AIDS victim.

During his first few Masses there Weber said he felt comfortable only sitting in the back of the church until after a few weeks he decided to pluck up his courage and sign up in November 1998 for a retreat for gay and lesbian parishioners held in upstate New York. About 40 people attended.

""There was a full gamut of people on that retreat who were striving for something more than what the church was able to offer"" he said adding that after the retreat his faith kept growing toward a ""direction of service."" Through the parish's Gay Catholic ministry Weber writes letters to U.S. dioceses to tell them about their activities and to raise awareness about welcoming LGBTQ people into the Catholic Church. In June 1994 both the Gay Catholics ministry and the Catholic Lesbians ministry first took part in the New York City Pride Parade waving a large yellow parish banner. Xavier was the first Catholic parish to march under its name in the parade the Outreach post recalled engaging in evangelization and outreach. Since that event Xavier has participated annually in the march pausing only during the COVID-19 pandemic. St. Francis Xavier is also a supporter of AIDS Walk NY a march held once a year in May in Central Park to raise funds to support HIV prevention and treatment in underrepresented communities. ""Since Good Friday the Catholic Church has been proclaiming the Gospels of 'Seeing and Being Seen.' Until HIV and AIDS are eradicated those living with HIV and AIDS still need to be seen and companioned"" Weber said during a post-homily reflection at a Mass at the parish on April 21.

Uncovering liturgical meaning Luz Marina Díaz the parish's director of religious education says it is ""a prophetic parish."" Since she took her role in 2007 she has so far introduced about a dozen new faith formation programs that engage children and teens of all ages as well as their parents she said.

Every first Sunday of the month St. Francis Xavier hosts a ""family Mass"" in which the pastor calls all the children to sit on the altar steps during the homily and music is provided by an intergenerational choir composed of both parents and their children. On other Sundays children may participate in a separate chapel in another Mass called ""Mass class"" in which they are free to stop the pastor at any time during the Mass to ask questions about the liturgical meaning of each gesture and word the priest carries out.

""We want them to have a kind of a robust theology and spirituality of the Eucharist"" said Jesuit Fr. James Miracky an associate pastor.

""We've had a really robust way of opening that up for people and we're really proud of that"" he said adding that adults have asked that similar initiatives be put in place for them as well. When children are busy with catechism after Masses their parents are often invited to stay in the church to take part in discussions with special guests on different topics each week such as in-depth talks on the sacrament of Eucharist a program on Pope Francis' 2015 environmental encyclical Laudato Si' and discussions about how to accept their children's gender and sexual identities. Once a month St. Francis Xavier also hosts a longer-than-usual ""contemplative Mass"" celebrated by Jesuit Fr. Ricardo Da Silva another associate pastor in which attendees are free to move meditate and pray in silence in multiple spaces of the church.

Díaz who also sits on the parish's interreligious committee said that despite her church's generous openings as a woman she has her own ""struggles"" with the church.

""I would like to be a deacon"" she said. ""I prepare parents and godparents of children to be baptized; I am the person here who organizes and schedules the baptisms so I go through all the process. The only thing that I need is the ordination to be able to baptize though the Catechism of the Catholic Church says that in case of emergency anyone can baptize. I would like to have that to complete the process of such a wonderful sacrament. Like me there are many other women here that are doing many things that deacons do."" Women's participation in the life of the church was one of the most widely debated topics during the parish's meetings for the local consultations of the ongoing synod on synodality. After their discussions the parish produced a report that was later sent to both the New York Archdiocese and the Vatican. ""One parent said in exasperation 'My daughter can be an astronaut or a doctor. But she can't give a homily at church' "" the section of the report focusing on women in the church reads. ""Another participant called the exclusion of women as priests and deacons — and the subsequent sacrifice of the insight derived from their lived experience — as a 'deep loss for every practicing Catholic.' ""

Seeing humanity On March 24 Palm Sunday a 76-year-old homeless Vietnam War veteran died suddenly of a heart attack in a subway train car in downtown New York. When police officers tried to search for documents in his jacket to identify him they could only find a piece of paper with two names and two phone numbers on it. One was that of Ralph Martin a longtime volunteer at the soup kitchen that is held every Sunday at St. Francis Xavier and another was that of Roxanne De La Torre director of outreach at Xavier Mission. Xavier Mission is a nonprofit organization that in 2012 became independent from the Church of St. Francis Xavier where about 40 years ago a group of parishioners had decided to open a soup kitchen to help with hunger and homelessness in the neighborhood. Although today it is no longer part of the parish Xavier Mission still operates in the parish offices and relies both on volunteers from other ministries in the parish and on occasional volunteers coming from other parishes in New York. According to the 2023 Xavier Mission's Impact Report thanks to government grants donations and more the organization provided clean clothes to more than 1000 guests served about 42000 meals every Sunday and donated another 60000 groceries to citizens in need that year.

The First Church of Cannabis was founded by Levin in 2015 in response to Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act which was signed into law by former governor Mike Pence on March 26 2015 and went into effect on July 1 2015.

When the law finally went into effect on July 1 the doors of Levin's beloved establishment opened that same day as previously reported by the IndyStar. According to the First Church of Cannabis website the group's mission is to ""celebrate life's great adventure by building on compassion good health and love.""

While the group is unable to participate in the ""holy sacrament"" of being able to light up at their regular Wednesday service they've found other ways to fill the time according to the IndyStar. A typical service starts with a shorter sermon from Levin before opening the floor to members to discuss concerns. They also perform a ""diety dozen"" with affirmations of marijuana as a means of healing. Learn more about the ""diety dozen"" here.

Where is the First Church of Cannabis?

The First Church of Cannabis is located at 3400 S Rural St. in Indianapolis.

Who founded the First Church of Cannabis?

Levin 68 founder and leader of the First Church of Cannabis is a long-standing marijuana advocate who began working with the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) in the late 19990s according to the church's website. He eventually started his own pro-cannabis organization ReLegalize Indiana.

Levin also ran for political positions as a Libertarian in the early 2010s with marijuana legislation as a key focus but came up short. When the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed ""Bill took this as an opportunity to establish The First Church of Cannabis on the basis of 'Cannatarian' religion where love is the most important and including the sacrament cannabis"" according to Church of Cannabis.

Marijuana Church challenges Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act

Levin and the Church of Cannabis filed a lawsuit against the state of Indiana Pence and Attorney General Greg Zoeller in July 2015 with the claim that denying them the right to smoke in public infringes on religious freedom. A second lawsuit was filed on March 3 2016 against the city of Indianapolis the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department and former Police Chief Rick Hite.

The filed suits argued that members' use of marijuana at the Church of Cannabis should be protected under Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act but was dismissed by the Indiana Court of Appeals in December of 2018.

""I feel sorry for the people who are not educated in this subject matter"" Levin previously said to the IndyStar. ""We'll keep doing what we're doing because we're doing God's work.""

Kesehatan mental juga penting diperhatikan selayaknya kesehatan fisik. Kesehatan mental merupakan komponen mendasar dari definisi kesehatan. Kesehatan mental yang baik memungkinkan orang untuk menyadari potensi mereka mengatasi tekanan kehidupan yang normal bekerja secara produktif dan berkontribusi pada komunitas mereka.

Definisi kesehatan mental menurut WHO adalah kondisi kesejahteraan (well-being) seorang individu yang menyadari kemampuannya sendiri dapat mengatasi tekanan kehidupan yang normal dapat bekerja secara produktif dan mampu memberikan kontribusi kepada komunitasnya.

Berdasarkan UU Nomor 18 Tahun 2014 tentang Kesehatan Jiwa kesehatan jiwa didefinisikan sebagai kondisi dimana seorang individu dapat berkembang secara fisik mental spiritual dan sosial sehingga individu tersebut menyadari kemampuan sendiri dapat mengatasi tekanan dapat bekerja secara produktif dan mampu memberikan kontribusi untuk komunitasnya.

Pada usia remaja (15-24 tahun) memiliki persentase depresi sebesar 62%. Depresi berat akan mengalami kecenderungan untuk menyakiti diri sendiri (self harm) hingga bunuh diri. Sebesar 80 – 90% kasus bunuh diri merupakan akibat dari depresi dan kecemasan. Kasus bunuh diri di Indonesia bisa mencapai 10.000 atau setara dengan setiap satu jam terdapat kasus bunuh diri. Menurut ahli suciodologist 4.2% siswa di Indonesia pernah berpikir bunuh diri. Pada kalangan mahasiswa sebesar 69% mempunyai niatan untuk bunuh diri sedangkan 3% lain pernah melakukan percobaan bunuh diri. Depresi pada remaja bisa diakibatkan oleh beberapa hal salah satunya ketika putus cinta.

Remaja saat ini pasti merasakan yang namanya jatuh cinta. Ketika sedang jatuh cinta ia akan memfokuskan perhatiannya pada seseorang. Awalnya jatuh cinta memang membuat kita menjadi orang paling bahagia di dunia akan tetapi ketika kita dikecewakan oleh cinta itu langsung membuat kita merasa down seketika. Putus cinta bisa disebabkan oleh beberapa hal seperti selingkuh perbedaan agama dan yang paling sering terjadi di Indonesia adalah putus cinta karena orang tua tidak setuju mengenai hubungan sang anak.

Saat menjalani hubungan sebuah konflik pasti terjadi yang menimbulkan perdebatan antara pasangan. Dilihat dari teori konflik putus cinta merupakan keadaan ketika adanya suatu permasalahan yang disebabkan oleh perbedaan suatu pendapat di antara keduanya. Lalu adanya sikap tidak bisa menerima sebuah transformasi dalam hubungan. Ralf Daherndorf yang merupakan salah satu tokoh teori konflik menyatakan bahwa masalah yang terjadi secara berulang-ulang akan menciptakan sebuah perubahan.

Remaja saat ini berpikir bahwa dengan adanya cinta hidupnya akan lebih terasa bahagia dan menyenangkan. Memang jatuh cinta membuat kita bahagia namun ketika terjadi putus cinta Terkadang kesedihan dan kekecewaan mendalam yang dirasakan anak muda akan berujung pada tindakan negatif seperti self harm dan minum minuman keras. Banyak terdapat kasus anak muda yang memutuskan bunuh diri setelah mengalami putus cinta. Hal itu dikarenakan perasaan sedih yang mandalam sulit untuk menerima kenyataan merasa menderita merasa tidak bahagia dan lain sebagainya.

Oleh karena itu kita harus bisa menerima kenyataan walaupun kenyataan itu pahit. Jangan sampai kita melukai diri karena putus cinta karena hidup kita jauh lebih berharga daripada yang kita pikirkan. Melepaskan sesuatu adalah keinginan untuk mengubah keyakinanmu untuk membawa lebih banyak kedamaian dan kegembiraan ke dalam hidupmu alih-alih berpegang pada keyakinan yang membawa rasa sakit dan penderitaan.

“Waktu tidak menyembuhkan rasa sakitmu kamu hanya perlu belajar bagaimana melepaskannya”

-Roy T. Bennett

Meski fokus untuk melayani penumpang di pesawat ternyata Novi juga relawan aksi sosial untuk ODGJ (orang dengan gangguan Jiwa).

Semenjak resign dari pramugari Novi tidak langsung menjadi youtuber dengan konten sebagai relawan aksi sosial. Ia hanya memposting beberapa kegiatan positif tersebut di instagram pribadinya. Namun seiring berjalannya waktu akhirnya ia membuat akun youtube yang bermodalkan hanya 3 orang crew.

""Nah untuk dari awal itu memang kita terdiri dari 3 orang. Saya kameramen editor. Kameramen bisa jadi editor editor bisa jadi kameramen. Dan akhirnya kita terbentuk sekarang totalnya 16 orang. Itu dari berbagai macam profesi termasuk trauma healing yang kita sedang rangkul untuk menjadi tim"" cerita Novi dalam program Sosok.

Semua dilakukan Novi dengan menggunakan uang pribadinya. Baik untuk merawat ODGJ biaya pengobatan dan biaya untuk membuat konten tersebut. Namun tidak hanya ODGJ Novi pun turun tangan juga untuk menangani berbagai macam kasus.

""Dari mulai ODGJ orang terlantar yatim piatu dhuafa yang sakit yang lagi fight untuk sembuh dan pecandu obat-obat terlarang. Mulai dari pecandu obat pecandu lem pecandu bensin solar pecandu cat itu macam-macam case-nya"" ujar Novi.

Novi juga merawat beberapa bayi yang terlahir dari orang tua yang mengalami gangguan jiwa. Ketika orang tuanya dinyatakan sembuh oleh dokter jiwa maka Novi dengan senang hati akan mengembalikan anaknya.

""Tetapi sekali lagi apabila ibunya sembuh dan pulih dari persetujuan pihak dokter jiwa kita akan kembalikan seluruhnya. Karena niat kita bukan mengadopsi niat kita bukan memiliki tetapi hanya merawat sementara"" tegas Novi.

Jika sebagian orang memandang ODGJ adalah orang yang lemah dan terlantar tetapi hal tersebut tidak berlaku bagi Novi. Ia pun membeberkan beberapa alasannya mengapa bisa jatuh cinta dengan ODGJ.

""Yang membuat saya jatuh cinta dengan ODGJ pada saat ODGJ yang maaf sekali tidak pernah disentuh sama orang lain. Kondisinya kotor mungkin sakit luka-luka di bagian tangannya di bagian kakinya karena penuh ikatan dan tali. Setelah saya bersihkan dengan tangan saya sendiri kemudian mereka bersih mereka mengucapkan terima kasih bahkan mereka tidak mengucapkan terima kasih-pun melihat itu saja saya sudah bahagia banget."" jelas Novi.

""Kenapa bahagia?

Karena saya bisa membantu orang lain dengan tangan saya sendiri"" lanjutnya.

""Tidak penting apa pun agama atau sukumu kalau kamu bisa melakukan sesuatu yang baik buat semua orang orang tidak pernah tanya apa agamamu.""



Pemikiran Abdurrahman Wahid alias Gus Dur itu niscaya akan abadi. Sebagai pengingat agar identitas keagamaan maupun keyakinan setiap individu jangan menjadi alasan seseorang menolak salah satu fitrah manusia: Berbuat kebaikan.

Kabar menyejukkan datang pada Senin 20 Desember 2021. Hasil riset Kementerian Agama Republik Indonesia (Kemenag RI) menunjukkan indeks Kerukunan Umat Beragama (KUB) tahun ini menaik 493 poin dari tahun sebelumnya ke angka rata-rata nasional 7239. Angka itu berdasar kategorisasi Kemenag dinilai baik.

Tenaga Ahli Menteri Agama Mahmud Syaltout mengatakan indeks KUB berguna sebagai dasar untuk memetakan memprediksi dan mendeteksi potensi konflik atas dasar perbedaan agama. “Karena indeks KUB dibangun dari beberapa variabel yaitu toleransi kerja sama dan kesetaraan” kata Mahmud.

Ya menumbuhkan kerukunan antarumat beragama di Indonesia tidak boleh hanya berhenti pada sikap toleran terhadap orang lain yang berbeda keyakinan. Karena toleransi hanya sebagai syarat awal agar kita bisa saling menerima dan menghargai perbedaan. Aspek selanjutnya yang harus dipenuhi ialah kesetaraan sebagai cerminan tindakan untuk saling peduli dan melindungi serta memberi kesempatan yang sama dengan tidak mengedepankan superioritas kelompok mayoritas. Jika kedua aspek sebelumnya bisa terpenuhi maka kerukunan antaragama akan menciptakan dimensi kerja sama dengan semangat empati dan simpati kepada setiap manusia Indonesia tanpa diskriminasi.

Peristiwa intoleransi berlatar belakang keagamaan memang masih kerap meletup di berbagai daerah di Tanah Air. Namun membaca kisah-kisah indahnya toleransi kesetaraan dan kerja sama dari anak-anak muda di Indonesia yang berbeda agama membawa pesan mendalam: Indonesia tanpa diskriminasi agama bukan utopia belaka.

Gen Z Indonesia lebih terbuka menerima perbedaan agama Ilustrasi millennial dan Gen Z/Dok. IDN Times Pada tahun 2019 lalu Andi Ahmad Yani peneliti Center for Peace Conflict & Democracy (CPCD) Universitas Hasanuddin Makassar meneliti sikap toleransi Generasi Z (GenZ) atau yang disebut juga sebagai Centennials. Hasil penelitian tersebut menunjukkan 62 persen atau mayoritas dari 1.854 responden sangat toleran terhadap topik terkait agama yang berbeda dengan keyakinannya di media sosial. ""Dari riset kami itu membuktikan bahwa mereka toleran. Mereka sama sekali tidak mempersoalkan tentang agama atau etnis ketika mereka mencari teman baik di dunia nyata maupun di dunia digital"" kata Yani saat diwawancarai IDN Times via telepon Minggu (26/12/2021). Riset tersebut kata Yani dilakukan untuk mengkonfirmasi hasil riset dari SETARA Institute pada 2018 yang menyebutkan 10 kota intoleran. Kota itu adalah Jakarta Sabang Banda Aceh Medan Tanjung Balai Padang Cilegon Depok Bogor dan Makassar sebagai 10 kota dengan skor toleransi terendah. Timnya pun mengunjungi kota tersebut dan meneliti kembali persoalan toleransi dengan pendekatan berbeda. Yani dan tim fokus ke anak muda generasi Centennials atau anak muda berusia 17-21 tahun. Sebanyak 1.854 responden dari kota-kota yang disebutkan SETARA mengisi kuesioner online. Yani dan tim mencoba mengkonfirmasi bagaimana anak-anak muda ini melihat tentang perbedaan agama suku etnis dan beberapa isu lain seperti LGBT dan sebagainya. ""Kami konfirmasi bahwa anak Centennials di 20 kota itu mereka merasa tidak begitu mempersoalkan perbedaan agama maupun persoalan etnis suku dalam aktivitas mereka baik digital maupun real life"" kata Yani. Survei tersebut disebar di sekolah negeri sekolah swasta sekolah agama seperti madrasah aliyah sekolah Islam sekolah Kristen yang umumnya di daerah urban yang menjadi fokus studi SETARA Institute. ""Kita ingin memastikan bahwa responden kita memiliki latar yang variatif"" katanya. Yani mengatakan penelitian ini melibatkan responden yang bisa mewakili semua kelompok agama. Hal ini juga sekaligus memperlihatkan bahwa sebenarnya anak muda Centennials termasuk kosmopolitan. ""Mungkin karena di dalam sosial media aktivitas mereka lebih banyak di dunia digital. Minimal tiga jam per hari. Itu memiliki perspektif yang lebih terbuka dengan berbagai isu perbedaan yang mereka lihat mungkin dibandingkan seniornya (generasi sebelumnya)"" kata Yani.

Agama bukan penghalang anak muda Indonesia membangun relasi sosial Syamsi Nur Fadhilah (tengah) saat berfoto bersama teman-temannya. Dok. Pribadi Temuan Yani Cs sejalan dengan apa yang dikemukakan Syamsi Nur Fadhilah (25). Syamsi asal Makassar itu beragama Islam. Dia bersahabat dengan beberapa orang berbeda agama. Sa'adillah Mursik Sadly Tri A. Putra dan Ade Rezkiawan Embas yang beragama Islam Hendrik Thio yang memeluk Buddha serta Michael Manggabarani Syam penganut Katolik. Perbedaan agama ini tak lantas menimbulkan jurang pemisah. Buktinya hubungan persahabatan mereka telah terjalin selama 5 tahun yaitu sekitar 2016 lalu hingga sekarang. ""Awalnya karena ketemu di satu komunitas sering handle project komunitas bareng-bareng. Jadi lebih intens ketemu lebih sering ngobrol sampai akhirnya kebawa di luar komunitas juga"" kata Syamsi kepada IDN Times Minggu (25/12/2021). Bagi Syamsi memiliki relasi persahabatan beda agama rasanya sama dengan persahabatan lainnya. Karena menurutnya manusia memang perlu menjalin hubungan dengan manusia lain tanpa perlu melihat agama dan etnisnya. ""Tapi entah kenapa zaman sekarang ini kalau kita punya punya relasi dengan orang yang berbeda agama dengan kita malah jadi semacam hal yang langka dianggap tidak lumrah. Padahal itu hal yang normal yang seharusnya bisa jadi biasa saja tanpa perlu diromantisasi"" katanya. Dia sering heran saat orang lain memandang hal itu sebagai sesuatu yang aneh. Jangankan persahabatan keluarganya yang beda agama saja sering dipandang aneh. Padahal menurutnya agama merupakan hak dan privasi setiap individu. ""Intinya ya bergaul saja jangan membatasi diri selama itu tidak menyangkut urusan keimanan. Urusan agama cukuplah jadi urusan masing-masing kita dengan Tuhan"" kata Syamsi. Hubungan persahabatan berbeda agama juga dirasakan Fauziah Mursid. Wanita asal Depok Jawa Barat ini sudah enam tahun bersahabat dengan teman perempuan yang beragama Kristen. Sejak berpindah pekerjaan dari Bandung ke Jakarta Fauziah menemukan teman sejati yang sekarang menjadi sahabat karibnya di lingkungan pekerjaan. ""Dulu pas di Jakarta itu tahun 2015. Terus ketemu sama teman satu ini Dita namanya Sampai sekarang kita dekat dan udah jadi sahabat "" ujar Fauziah kepada IDN Times Jumat (24/12/2021). Fauziah tidak memungkiri jika masih ada keluarganya yang memandang negatif persahabatannya dengan orang berbeda keyakinan. Salah satunya disampaikan keponakannya yang menilai bahwa mengucapkan selamat atau memberi hadiah kepada mereka yang non-musim adalah haram. Tidak sekali Fauziah beberapa kali menerima pernyataan tersebut dari orang lain. Namun dia tidak menghiraukan omongan itu semua. Menurutnya setiap orang memiliki pandangannya masing-masing termasuk ketika ingin berteman atau bersahatan dengan siapapun meski beda agama. ""Kalau ada pemahaman itu (tidak boleh berteman dengan beda agama) artinya masih ada pendidikan kepada anak yang dilakukan entah oleh keluarga di sekolah atau di tempat belajar agamanya kan"" kata Fauziah.

""Di atas semua agama dasarnya itu cinta"" Ilustrasi toleransi agama (IDN Times/Mardya Shakti) Di Indonesia hubungan asmara dari pasangan yang berbeda agama kerap kali menemui jalan buntu. Namun Bagus (35) dengan Tasya (34) sejoli asal kota Medan itu saling menerima pilihan agama masing-masing. Bagus penganut Islam tak sedikit pun mempermasalahkan perbedaan keyakinan yang dimiliki pasangannya yang beragama Kristen Protestan begitupula sebaliknya. ""Kita kan saling mempercayai satu sama lain. Di atas semua agama dasarnya itu cinta"" ucap Bagus kepada IDN Times Jumat (24/12/2021). Bagus menceritakan sejak memiliki hubungan dengan pasangannya itu ia kerap mengikuti dua acara keagamaan yang berbeda. Biasanya dalam perayaan hari raya Idul Fitri Tasya akan bersilaturahmi ke rumah Bagus. Demikian sebaliknya jika perayaan Natal Bagus akan berkunjung ke rumah Tasya. ""Kalau acara Natal itu aku biasanya datang ke rumahnya. Sebaliknya kalau hari raya Idulfitri juga sama dia yang datang ke rumah ku. Gak masalah"" cerita Bagus. Pun dalam melakukan ibadah rutin yang dilakukan. Bagus tak mempermasalahkan kegiatan yang dilakukan Tasya. Tak jarang pula Bagus akan mengantar pasangannya jika hendak ibadah mingguan. Baginya jika ikut serta dalam beberapa kegiatan agama lain bukan berarti ia ikut mengimani. ""Karena itukan hanya mengantarkan saja. Bukan berarti mengimani"" ucapnya. Kesetaraan dalam beragama dibuktikan dengan baik oleh pasangan suami istri di Kota Surabaya Jawa Timur. Abed Nego (32) yang beragama Kristen dan Tanamal Devy Dian Pramita (31) yang beragama Islam. Sudah delapan tahun usia pernikahan mereka. Keluarga mereka rukun dan harmonis sebab tidak menjadikan perbedaan agama sebagai sebuah masalah. Abed menceritakan sejak menikahi Devy dia merayakan tiga hari besar keagamaan. Pertama ialah Imlek karena Abed masih keturunan Tionghoa. Kedua Idulfitri karena istrinya seorang muslim ditambah keluarga ibu dan mertuanya muslim. Ketiga Natal karena keluarga dari ayahnya Kristen semua. ""Dalam satu tahun itu tiga hari besar aku jalani"" ujarnya saat berbincang dengan IDN Times Kamis (23/12/2021). Abed sangat menghormati jika sang istri menjalankan kewajibannya sebagai seorang muslim. Yakni menjalankan salat lima waktu. ""Ya aku persilakan monggo salat lima waktu"" kata dia. Begitu sebaliknya ketika hari minggu Abed ditemani istri dan dua anaknya ke gereja. ""Tapi anak-anak mana yang terbaik aku kasih pemahaman. Kalau Kristen gini muslim (Islam) gini. Sama-sama baik cuma caranya aja yang berbeda"" jelas warga Ploso Timur Surabaya ini. Penerimaan keragaman yang utuh oleh Abed dan istrinya ini juga berdasarkan pengalaman yang dirasakan sejak kecil. Abed mengatakan ayahnya merupakan keturunan Tionghoa mulanya beragama Konghucu. Sedangkan ibunya beragama Islam. Ketika menikah orangtua Abed memilih berpindah Kristen. Sama halnya keluarga istrinya ayah Devy dulunya beragama Kristen. Kemudian ibunya beragama Islam. Ketika menikah memutuskan beragama Islam. ""Akhirnya kita semua menyadari kita dari keluarga yang berbeda-beda. Di dalamnya ada toleransi. Intinya kalau ada kegiatan dalam keluarga saling mendukung"" ungkap dia. ""Aku juga gak canggung kalau ikut Idulfitri karena basicnya dari ibuku kan muslim. Dulu sebelum nikah masih ke sana unjung ke sana (keluarga ibu). Meski pun sama istriku sewaktu pacaran saling ngerti kalau kita berbeda memang (agamanya). Dulu dari orangtua masing-masing juga berangkatnya dari agama yang berbeda-beda"" imbuh Abed.

Toleransi saja tidak cukup butuh kesetaraan hidup dalam bingkai kemajemukan Suasana persiapan Natal di Gereja di Desa Piling Penebel Tabanan (Dok.IDNTimes/Istimewa) Dimensi kesetaraan hidup beragama sangat terasa bagi Lidya yang tinggal di Gili Trawangan Lombok Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB). Bagi Lidya masyarakat sektiar yang mayoritas muslim selalu memberi ruang yang sama bagi setiap agama untuk merayakan hari raya. Bagi Lidya merayakan Natal di pulau yang dijuluki seribu masjid ini selalu aman dan damai. Tak ada halangan apapun selama perayaan Natal di gereja-gereja Kota Mataram. Bahkan beberapa kelompok pemuda umat Hindu dan muslim di Kota Mataram juga turut membantu dalam pengamanan Natal di gereja. Bentuk keberagaman ini selalu dapat dilihat pada perayaan hari-hari besar umat beragama di Lombok. Saling menghormati ditunjukkan untuk menjaga Kota Mataram tetap aman dan nyaman bagi umat beragama. Ni Nyoman Ayu Respani yang tinggal di Tabanan Bali mengungkap hal serupa. Menurutnya hingga saat ini dia dan teman-temannya menjalani pertemanan dengan harmonis tanpa ada perdebatan mengenai perbedaan agama. ""Sebenarnya bagaimana menjaga toleransi itu ada semuanya muncul dari kesadaran masing-masing. Kalau kita memiliki pemahaman kuat soal toleransi maka meski ada yang hendak memecah belah tidak akan berhasil"" ujarnya. Menurutnya cara sederhana untuk menjaga toleransi beragama dalam pertemanan selain menghormati adalah dengan mengucapkan selamat hari raya keagamaan. ""Kalau teman merayakan hari keagamaan biasanya datang silahturahmi"" kata dia. Perayaan Natal 2021 di Tabanan begitu kental dengan nuansa adat Bali. Bentuk toleransi beragama yang tetap dipertahankan selama puluhan tahun adalah budaya ngejot antara umat beragama di Desa Adat Piling. Di desa ini umat Hindu dan Kristiani hidup berdampingan dengan damai. Setiap perayaan umat beragama ditandai dengan budaya ngejot seperti yang rutin dilakukan setiap hari raya Natal. Ketua Persekutuan Umat Katolik Desa Piling Andreas I Made Agus Wirawan pada Jumat (24/12/2021) menyampaikan perayaan Natal di tempatnya selalu sama setiap tahun. ""Kami gelar budaya ngejot dan sudah dilakukan pada Kamis 23 Desember 2021 kemarin. Hari ini kami lakukan kerja bakti di Gereja"" ujarnya.

Kerukunan hidup dibutuhkan agar kita tidak saling menyakiti dan menyingkirkan Acara perayaan Natal yang penuh keakraban dan kehangatan di Pondok Harapan Suster Persaudaraan Ilahi. (IDN Times/Fariz Fardianto) Upaya menumbuhkan kerukunan hidup umat beragama di Indonesia harus diiringi tindakan nyata dalam bentuk kerja sama yang baik di antara majemuknya masyarakat Indonesia. Dengan kerja sama yang tulus terbangun kepercayaan yang kuat di antara sesama anak bangsa yang tentu saja dengan dasar pemahaman bersama bahwa mereka dapat hidup berdampingan dengan damai tenang saling memajukan dan menguatkan tidak untuk saling menyakiti dan menyingkirkan. Wujud dari kerja sama itu dapat terlihat pada perayaan Natal 2021 di sejumlah daerah di Nusantara. Persaudaraan Lintas Agama (Pelita) Semarang yang mengusung tema Safari Natal 2021 juga menggelar kegiatan selaras. Koordinator Pelita Setyawan Budi mengajak anak-anak muda lintas iman ikut mengunjungi Pondok Harapan Suster Persaudaraan Ilahi di Jalan Pusponjolo Raya Semarang pada Sabtu (25/12/2021). Di acara itu Pelita Semarang mengajak dua biksu yang hadir mewakili umat Buddha sejumlah anggota Gusdurian dua mahasiswa dari generasi muda FKUB Jateng satu keluarga jemaat Ahmadiyah serta seorang pemeluk Hindu dan pemeluk Konghucu. Selama acara Natalan para suster tak canggung melantunkan lagu Malam Kudus dan Edelweis sembari bermain angklung. Suaranya yang merdu ditambah iringan angklung membuat perayaan Natal di Pondok Harapan terasa khidmat. Apa yang dilakukan oleh para suster tersebut menunjukan nuansa Natal yang sederhana. ""Saya sangat terharu melihat acara Natalan yang guyup lalu banyak orang-orang yang berbeda agama ikut datang kemari. Itu benar-benar membuat saya sampai merinding"" kata Transena seorang suster ketika berbincang dengan IDN Times usai acara Natalan. Sementara di Kalimantan Timur Dumasary Murny yang tengah bersuka cita merayakan Natal memilih untuk mengajar bahasa isyarat kepada difabel tuli di daerahnya tanpa memandang latar belakang agama. Itu dilakukannya sebagai bentuk cinta kasih sesama manusia. ""Memang berbeda dari tahun sebelumnya. Saya usulkan untuk mengajari teman-teman tuli yang berbeda agama bagaimana menikmati Natal"" ujarnya bersemangat saat dihubungi IDN Times Jumat (24/12/2021). Di Kelurahan Labuhan Dalam Kota Bandar Lampung perbedaan keyakinan juga tidak menghalangi warga untuk saling membantu umat beragama lain yang merayakan hari besar. Ketua Bankom Labuhan Dalam Septia Wanto mengatakan sikap saling menghargai dan toleransi antarumat beragama di wilayahnya sudah terjalin sejak dulu. Menurutnya umat Hindu sekitar selalu mendukung dan membantu kaum muslim setiap kali merayakan Idulfitri Iduladha dan hari besar lainnya. Hal serupa juga dilakukan umat muslim saat Hari Raya Galungan dan sebagainya. ""Kami saling bekerja sama. Semisal saat salat Idul Fitri atau salat Jumat mereka (umat Hindu) ikut membantu berjaga parkir. Ketika upacara Nyepi Pujawali hingga Galungan uamt muslim turun membantu kesiapan hingga menjaga parkir. Pada intinya kami saling bahu membahu menjaga ketertiban dan kenyamanan saat melaksanakan kegiatan keagamaan"" kata dia.

A Delhi Court on Tuesday warned Former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini to be careful in the future after he showed up at the virtual hearing while lying on his bed.

Essentially the Special Judge CBI Sanjeev Aggarwal was hearing a 1994 abduction case in which Sumedh Kumar Saini is an accused and for that purpose he had joined the proceedings through VC (Cisco Webex App).

However during the case proceedings the Court observed that he had joined the VC proceedings/Court while lying on the bed. On being asked he submitted that he is unwell and is down with a fever. However no medical certificate in this regard had been furnished or filed on record by him.

To this the Court warned him by observed thus:

It may be noted that Saini and three other policemen have been accused of kidnapping and murdering a Ludhiana man in the year 1994. Earlier this case was being heard before a Court in Haryana however its trial was transferred to Delhi court on the direction of the Supreme Court.

The CBI had charge-sheeted Saini and the other accused policemen under various sections dealing with kidnapping or abducting in order to murder criminal conspiracy wrongful restraint and wrongful confinement of the IPC.

Saini had appeared for the recording of statements of prosecution witnesses in the case however since a request for exemption had been received on behalf of the witness on medical grounds the Court allowed the witness plea and listed the matter for further proceedings on January 15 2022.

About the incident that occurred in the court of Justice G.K Ilanthiraiyan a Division Bench of Justice P.N. Prakash and Justice R. Hemalatha noted:

By The Editors and Friends

With these brief snapshots of wonderful people many of whom have appeared on our pages we honor those we have lost this year. We will remember them always. If you dreamed about them you’d wake up smiling. Those were the sort of friends they were.

Virgil Abloh

Virgil Abloh the transcendent designer creative director and entrepreneur worked so prolifically across the mediums of music art and fashion that he managed to revolutionize entire industries in his brief 41 years on earth. Trained as an architect he designed an entire way of life for legions of young people. I know this for certain because my 14-year-old son shared the sad news of his passing with me. He is one of those young people who can’t get enough of Virgil’s album covers his clothes his DJ sets at music festivals. That kind of reach is incredible.

Virgil’s irreverent streetwear at Off-White led to Louis Vuitton where he infused a sense of joy into the menswear and accessories of the storied house. That joy and his wonderful willingness to express it made Virgil unique among fashion insiders who so often pride themselves on ennui and disillusionment.

How lucky we were to have this spirit living and working among us and committed to creating unique experiences right here in our (and his) beloved Chicago. From the MCA exhibit to the talks Virgil gave at the museum and the phenomenally vibrant Louis Vuitton pop-up shop we had glimpses into his truly inventive mind.

So many Chicagoans benefitted from moments with Virgil. These musicians artists and designers will carry on inspired by this lovely man reminding us always that Virgil was here.

Well done. Rest well.

Geoffrey Atkins

A world racquets champion for 18 years straight who spent an important period of his life in Chicago and Lake Forest Geoffrey Atkins is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of the quintessentially British sport a game played indoors with a hard ball rocketing about at such speed that competitors could get killed if struck by it.

“As the game is quite dangerous you have to concentrate” the English-born Atkins told me many years ago. “There wasn’t much fooling around on the court during a match. I was excited by the speed of the game and the satisfaction of getting hard shots back.

“Rackets has been one of the most important influences of my life.”

He first earned the world championship in 1954 – a year after Queen Elizabeth was crowned – and held it until 1972 before retiring undefeated. In addition Geoffrey was an excellent squash player capturing the Chicago City Squash Championship in 1955-56 among his other titles. He was an avid recreational tennis player and golfer well into his 70s and during the Wimbledon fortnight the Englishman could often be found watching matches at Centre Court.

Timuel Black

Civil rights activist educator author and historian. (1918-2021) was for many the face of Chicago history. The great-grandson of slaves and the son of sharecroppers who came to Chicago during the Great Migration he grew up in Bronzeville graduated from DuSable High School and Roosevelt University earning his masters from the University of Chicago. A teacher for over four decades at area high schools and colleges he was an organizer of the Chicago contingent for the 1963 March on Washington and urged Harold Washington to run for mayor. Heralded by U.S. Senator Dick Durban as “for me and so many others—a personal hero” Black received many honors for his service in World War II and his writings and civil rights work. He received the University of Chicago’s prestigious Benton Medal for Distinguished Public Service in 2017. The university commended “his combination of historical training and understanding of Chicago history to his work on the Black Metropolis Oral History Project.” He was the author of Bridges of Memory a two-volume history of black Chicago and his memoir Sacred Ground: The Chicago Streets of Timuel Black

Richard Driehaus

Richard Driehaus thoughtful philanthropist brilliant businessman dedicated preservationist enthusiastic museum founder was quick to laugh eager to throw a party and eternally honing a work ethic nurtured by his parents and the Catholic schools he attended and burnished on the floors of his investment firm Driehaus Capital Management LLC.

Richard died of natural causes on March 9 2021 at the age of 78. He was a larger-than-life figure whose magnetic personality was matched only by his enormous generosity. Both individually and through the work of The Richard H. Driehaus Foundation and the Richard H. Driehaus Charitable Lead Trusts he supported an array of different organization and initiatives including many in and around Chicago.

In 2003 Richard Driehaus set out to restore the 1883 Nickerson Mansion to create a public space to share his passion for late 19th century arts and culture architecture and design. The Museum is just part the grand legacy of this self-made Chicagoan. Today his entrepreneurial positive and resilient spirit echoes the spirit of those of who came before him who built and rebuilt the historic corridor of East Erie Street. As he carried their torch forward those of us entrusted with his charitable legacy will assume his mantle of lifelong learning the importance of giving back approaching one’s endeavors as a masterpiece and the unyielding belief in the power of art and architecture to inspire minds

Dr. Lester Fisher

If animals can speak on Christmas Eve as some believe there was a cacophony of praise murmured amidst the Zoo Lights at the Lincoln Park Zoo from creatures great and small celebrating Dr. Lester Fisher who died just days ago at 100. In his four decades of leadership he transformed the Zoo making it an international leader in conservation and care of animals an institution celebrated around the world and a welcoming spot at no cost for Chicago. Quiet in nature Fisher knew how to listen to both people and animals. Early on his director’s office was located in the monkey house and he developed a love for gorillas particularly the famous Bushman. He related recently how he loved to visit him and talk a bit. He came to the Zoo as a part time veterinarian just after World War II having had a chance assignment of looking after General Patton’s bulldog Willie. When the legendary Marlin Perkins left for the St. Louis Zoo in 1962 Fisher became Zoo Director and served for four decades. Perhaps most famous as a leader in the conserving gorillas he transformed the Zoo into a happy home for all animals and a place to go during tough pandemic times.

Pamela Kelley Hull

Pamela Kelley Hull died in Lake Forest on November 10 age 93. She was the granddaughter of Stanley Field longtime head of the Field Museum of Natural History and a nephew of the first Marshall Field. A native of Cheshire England Stanley may well have inspired Pam’s enduring affinity familiar to all her friends for Anglo culture and the British country house. A walk through Pam’s well-made garden told the tale. A collaboration with the renowned designer John Brookes it was a colorful and enchanting “English muddle” of delphinium clematis and lush David Austin roses. She loved the lore of gardens too and her research into the records of the Lake Forest Garden Club (which she served as president 1978-80) uncovered a trove of glass lantern slides picturing many lakefront gardens now lost to history. Her aesthetic interests took her further afield to London and courses sponsored by the Attingham Trust in which she explored many facets of British landed estates and their vast holdings of pictures books porcelain and textiles. She became something of an expert herself.

Pam was married first to Vernon Armour with whom she had four children (Linda Kelly Cynthia Landreth Vernon K. and Gordon F.) and later remarried to Roger B. Hull. She was generous to many Chicago and national cultural institutions. A last major benevolence was her lead contribution to the restoration of an elaborate overmantel by the 17th c. master carver Grinling Gibbons a work long in storage and scheduled to go on display at the Art Institute late this spring. Godspeed Pam with our gratitude.

~ Helmut Jahn

There is a reason so many preservationists have advocated for repurposing and reinvesting in Helmut Jahn’s architecture. Jahn was a groundbreaking and evocative designer who brought us some of the world’s most bold and memorable spaces. Far from mundane his public spaces are awe inspiring. His mastery of scale and proportion created spaces that continue to amaze and inspire those who visit.

Landmarks Illinois partnered with Jahn for many years to imagine a reuse for his one-of-a-kind James R. Thompson Center in Chicago. We have called attention to the long-threatened Post Modern building on our Most Endangered Historic Places in Illinois four times since 2017 and remain committed to preserving his design vision. Today we await the National Park Service’s final decision on a nomination we commissioned to include the Thompson Center on the National Register of Historic Places making it one of the first buildings from this period designated as historic in the United States.

Jahn was unapologetic about bringing his bold ideas to life. Now it is our job to preserve the work of this masterful provocateur who helped to distinguish Chicago’s skyline from every other city. We look forward to the reuse of both the Thompson Center and his Lakefront Center as exciting destinations and remain committed to protecting Helmut Jahn’s unique and dynamic design legacy.

Jan Jentes

Jan Jentes whose self-effacing and quiet manner might belie her dynamic leadership of so many community and cultural organizations including those at the Art Institute of Chicago is remembered by her 19-year-old grandson Lazlo Jentes a first year student at Macalester College in the poem below.

I think of you in splash of paint

On canvases you wrought anew

In carpet indentation faint

From seats that once supported you

In suits and finery adorned

Clothes worn today to softly mourn

And were you here to watch me fly

A smile on your lips would lie

So while I grieve lost love of art

Your inspiration mends my heart

And though these words were written weeping

You’re on your feet again not sleeping

In golden halls above away

Where shows and concerts for’ere replay.

~ By Laszlo Jentes

Fred Krehbiel

I like so many others was blessed to have known Fred Krehbiel. In my case he was a presence since I was a little girl and guided me on many levels not the least of which was as a member of my board of directors as I founded and built my business. He always found time to listen and help regardless of how busy he was himself. Fred was a deeply loyal and caring friend who quietly sought ways large and small to help scores of people and to make a difference. He was the most generous person I have ever met. He lived by and embodied the Golden Rule and believed that all lives have equal value. His was a life well lived and for those of us to whom he was a guiding light his death leaves a permanent void.

Carey MacFarland Lennox

For those of us lucky enough to have known Carey her death from colon cancer in early May at the age of 59 robbed us of a caring and compassionate friend.

Carey lived life to the fullest. A “lifer” at Latin; a Middlebury graduate with a fluency in Italian and a love of all things Italian; a photographer who was able to capture those special unscripted moments; an artist creating stunning beaded necklaces; a connector of people who never forgot a birthday and loved to celebrate important milestones and holidays; Carey wove all this together with her career and her family.

May we celebrate knowing her and never forget her deep and generous love.

Betsy McCormick Lelyveld

Those who knew Betsy McCormick felt they were with a person filled with bright enthusiasm a determined work ethic and the big heart she took everywhere despite a lifelong battle with disability.

Always a passionate advocate for women and children she held strong opinions could fight fiercely and focus clearly. She called attention to unfairness and promoted community involvement. As a Junior League volunteer she helped organize a project at Family Focus a drop-in center serving struggling women with small children.

A diligent researcher she was head librarian of the Joseph Brennemann Library at Children’s Memorial Hospital. She helped create the first Medical Library certification examination and the Medline computer search system.

She served on the Woman’s Board of Lincoln Park Zoo the Guild of the Chicago History Museum and the Infant Welfare Society

Betsy and her husband Steve raised daughter Katie in Chicago and spent summers at their home on Lake Geneva. Her final years were in La Jolla near her family when she needed more intensive support. During the pandemic her family could regularly be seen waving with balloons and signs four floors down so that she might see them maintaining a lifelong commitment to making her happy.

Suzanne Carbonneau Mack

The strikingly lovely and beautifully educated young woman from Montreal spotted by the handsome American who sweeps her off her feet and back to Chicago. This charming true-life story belonged to Suzanne Carbonneau and her husband Walter Mack who contributed to the fabric of our City in significant ways. For those of us who visited with Suzanne and her school friends at Murray Bay Quebec reunions we saw the savoir faire and French wit she shared throughout her life and the fun of her childhood in that cosmopolitan French Canadian hub. Her ancestors from Bordeaux were among the first European settlers in the 1600’s. Her late brother Guy served as Canadian Senator and Speaker of the Canadian Senate and another brother Pierre as a Canadian General. She loved sharing with her daughters Linda Mack and Elaine Timbers and her son Stephen Walter Mack their French connections. Beautiful of dress and of manner she reflected the je ne sais quoi of her ancestors.

A championship golfer she shared her wise skills with the Woman’s Board of Rush University Medical Center Woman’s Board of Northwestern University the Antiquarian Society of the Art Institute The Women’s Board of the Field Museum and The Contemporary Club.

Florence McMillan

Florri McMillan gave off sparks. She was smart and funny and optimistic all of which enabled her to overcome what seemed overwhelming physical challenges during her life. Although her pals managed to discourage her from learning to fly there was little else Florri wouldn’t try. Occasionally we got caught up the wake of her latest passion but none of us could match her versatility. A gifted writer Florri could present a scholarly paper to a group of academics in the morning and sponsor a one woman show of her abstract art that evening.

Now that she is free I imagine Florri is finally getting to fly making ever bigger loops as she soars gleefully through the air. 30

Jack Sandner

The youngest chairman in the history of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Jack Sandner guided what became CME Group to its perch as the world’s largest derivatives marketplace. But family was what mattered most to him.

He was omnipresent in his support of his children’s and grandchildren’s activities. Said Andy McKenna a longtime friend and chairman emeritus of McDonald’s “If there was a book about being good to your family it would be about him.”

All of his children with his wife Carole were adopted. Jack also helped other families adopt children. He embraced helping others. Said his son Chris “He was available to anyone who sought his counsel or general support. My father never gave up on anyone.”

As a boy his bare-bones apartment on the South Side was heated by a pot-bellied stove. The pugnacious youngster became a successful Golden Gloves boxer. Jack’s boxing mentor was Tony Zale and he credited a gift from him – the book The Power of Positive Thinking –– as turning his life around.

Jack is deeply missed. His impact was immense –just like billboard of his smiling face which hovered above a Chicago expressway after he passed away.

Joanne Smith

At her death on September 6 Dr. Joanne Smith received worldwide tributes for her leadership and vision as President and CEO of the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. At that time Shirley Ryan shared Smith’s far-reaching impact as did Connie Coolidge a volunteer leader there in many capacities. Their words capture many of the reasons people admired this internationally acclaimed leader in her field.

From Shirley Ryan:

“Dr. Joanne Smith was a transformational and visionary health care leader. Her impact in the field of rehabilitation sciences will be felt globally for many generations to come. Joanne blended a culture of hope and positivity integrating scientific research technology and superior clinical care. I was honored to be her colleague and friend and will miss her always as my soul sister.”

And from Connie Coolidge:

“Joanne was a visionary with an entrepreneurial spirit. She set ambitious goals and was tenacious in reaching them quickly pivoting around any obstacles she encountered. She led by example working harder than anyone fueled by her enthusiasm for the project at hand. She was compassionate as a doctor quick to share a laugh with patients.”

Valerie Solti

Although she was born in Yorkshire and based in London while she and her husband toured international music venues Valerie Solti said she became a “total Chicagoan” the moment she landed in our town. Wife of Sir Georg Solti music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra from 1969 until l991 she loved our architecture art and our citizens. She was the most personable person I ever knew following the lives of musicians and friends their children and grandchildren and developing opportunities for talented young musicians through the Solti Foundation she established.

Her daughters Gabrielle and Claudia and her four grandchildren brought her much happiness and she built true friendships. She was so pleased when Claudia moved to the United States. Valerie was a dedicated humanitarian who helped both people and animals.

I met Valerie when she first arrived in Chicago and moved into the Mayfair Hotel where I worked. They travelled a lot and her primary concern was that the Maestro felt at home there. A BBC broadcast journalist they met when she interviewed him. He was the love of her life. Claudia told me that her last word was Maestro.

Laura Sudler

My Mother Laura Sudler was a funny bird in many ways. A vivacious bright individual with an extremely loving heart. She spent a lifetime learning cultivating meaningful friendships and cherishing family.

She was a master of telling it like it is – with her shoot from the hip sensibility.

If she liked you…she loved you. If she didn’t…well she would tell you that too.

As a Mother she made some impressions subtly through a framed collection of sayings discretely displayed around the house. As a youngster I didn’t grasp the full meaning of these snippets of wisdom but as a parent their meaning rings true!

Here are a few that I now have hidden in my home awaiting discovery.

“Children move out now…while you still know everything”. Any parent with teenagers can see why my mother displayed this prominently.

At our summer home discreetly displayed in a lovely cross stitch: “Who invited all these tacky people?” Funny but often true!

“Ask not what your Mother can do for you. Ask what you can do for your Mother” Was displayed in the kitchen for maximum effect and minimal results.

There is one sign that Mom doesn’t have. I would like to give it to her now. It reads “Thanks for everything Mom…I love you.” I am pretty sure that one would be out for everyone to see.

Frank Sullivan

When we lost Frank Sullivan in June major Chicago media discussed Frank’s many facets including his years as an award-winning Chicago Sun-Times reporter his role as Press Secretary to Mayor Richard J. Daley and his 1989 best-selling book about the late mayor Legend.

At Classic Chicago we remember Frank best as Publisher of Avenue M which he bought in 1985 and smartened up bringing in a team that today is a core of Classic Chicago. He hired Kay Whitfield as Director of Photography assigned Judy Bross a delightful column titled Judy’s People and named this writer his Editor.

Frank lived long vital years rich years—91 in all—always learning continually growing and forever remaining in the middle of his life packing several careers and many interests into those years and stretching them out. One can scarcely have regrets but we do miss him.

Anne Marie Mohan reported in October 2021 that the Coca-Cola Company has found two paths to a 100% bio-based bottle one that uses sugar from corn and another that uses forestry waste.

The Coca‑Cola Company’s sustainable packaging journey has crossed a major milestone this week with the unveiling of its first-ever beverage bottle made from 100% plant-based plastic excluding the cap and label that has been made using technologies that are ready for commercial scale. The prototype bottle comes more than a decade after the company’s PlantBottle debuted as the world’s first recyclable PET plastic bottle made with up to 30% plant-based material. A limited run of approximately 900 of the prototype bottles have been produced.

“We have been working with technology partners for many years to develop the right technologies to create a bottle with 100% plant-based content—aiming for the lowest possible carbon footprint—and it’s exciting that we have reached a point where these technologies exist and can be scaled by participants in the value chain” says Nancy Quan Chief Technical and Innovation Officer The Coca‑Cola Company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vam91cm5hbC5jbGFzc2ljY2Fycy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNi9waWNrLW9mLXRoZS1kYXktMTk2My1mb3JkLWYxMDAtZGVjb3JhdGVkLWFzLWNvY2EtY29sYS1kZWxpdmVyeS10cnVjay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pick of the Day: 1963 Ford F100 decorated like a Coca-Cola delivery truck,"The Pick of the Day this good-looking 1963 Ford F100 pickup truck gets a full description from the seller as to its physical and mechanical conditional but the biggest question is never addressed.

Why is this Ford festooned with Coca-Cola logos and slogans? It looks cool enough but why? Is it a former Coke delivery truck or maybe used by a local beverage supplier? Or maybe it was redone by some past owner who just loves Coca-Cola and wanted to tell the world.

Whatever the Coke emblems make this truck looks like a rolling piece of Americana both because of the iconic logo and because a classic Ford truck always seems like an evocative piece of nostalgia. So solid on both counts and it would look good on a Christmas card with Santa at the wheel and a decorated tree in the bed.

“This truck is in exceptional condition with all original steel in excellent rust-free condition” says the dealer advertising the Ford on ClassicCars.com.

“Super-straight all-original steel body with no signs of rust. Older paint looks good with a little bit of a patina here and there.

The Ford’s glass is in very good condition the bed is in great shape and the undercarriage has the “original cab corners floor pans rockers and frame rails all appearing to be rust-free” the seller notes.





“Clean interior unmolested original dash with functional gauges” the ad says. “Seat cover is older but in good shape with no rips or tears.”

The truck has a Ford 302cid V8 under the hood obviously a later engine linked to an automatic transmission. There are Coca-Cola emblems on the valve covers. The truck runs great the seller says with good brakes and all electrical gear functioning including the lights and gauges.

The asking price is $24900. Although potential buyers would be advised to ask the seller “What’s with all the Coca-Cola stuff?”

I mean what else did we expect? It’s ”THE” COCA-COLA! — and yes there is a lot to unpack so grab your juice box or whatever feels like a comfort zone to you and enjoy.

First off the invite-only event took place on Monday November 22 2021 at Eko Hotel Lagos Nigeria and was well attended by the crème de la crème of the Nigerian media the Coca-Cola System leadership and key stakeholders and partners across the country. Shameless name drops will be the Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria Professor Yemi Osinbajo and the Deputy Governor of Lagos State Dr. Obafemi Hamzat — like I said it’s COCA-COLA!

The event opened to a lounge area that had mouth-watering finger foods fabulously dressed guests chatting excitedly away an all-you-can-drink bar with – I promise you – the most delicious cocktails you’ve ever tasted. The final boss of this section was a Coca-Cola System museum wing that had artefacts on display and a history wall that tracked the beverage company’s achievements for the last 70 years.

As the celebrations progressed there was not one but TWO exhilarating performances from the thespians at Terra Kulture and all these happened while we stuffed our faces with delectable meals. It was not all play however as The Coca-Cola System which comprises Coca-Cola Nigeria and its bottling partner Nigerian Bottling Company took some time to celebrate 70 iconic Nigerians who have been pivotal to the company’s business in Nigeria.

The highlight of the evening was the Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria Professor Yemi Osinbajo’s witty and encouraging speech. He spoke on how between 1975 to 2017 he probably drank 29200 bottles of Coca-Cola. He also congratulated the Board and Management of The Coca-Cola Company on the iconic anniversary celebration and saluted the System’s hard work and dedication to thriving and maintaining its leadership position in the market.

We all love a trier but some gifts are objectively bad and there’s no overlooking it.

Sometimes it just comes down to a question of taste but there are other times where all you can do is laugh and wonder what the gift-giver could possibly have been thinking.

We don’t want to be ungrateful – after all it’s the thought that counts – but it’s nice to see the funny side.

So without further ado here’s a selection of some of the weirdest and worst Christmas gifts people have ever received.

A car emergency kit for carless Sharon*

‘It actually is an OK gift if you have a car – there was a road flare tire gauge emergency flat repair seat belt cutters etc’ says Sharon who was given the gift by her sister.

‘Pretty useless if you don’t have a car though. I think I ended up donating it to a charity shop.’

Nipple tassels and fluffy high heels for Jane

‘Around the time I was trying to end it with an ex he bought me some sexy pink fluffy high heel satin shoes and nipple tassels.

‘My daughter and I ended up using the tassels as hats for her Barbies.’

A coffee bean sack and reduced Coca Cola cans for Tim

‘My dad gave me an empty coffee bean sack two years ago. Still not sure why.

‘Nothing was wrapped. He’s a very odd man that I don’t see very often.

‘He gave us a box with reduced Coca-Cola cans a Chicago tea towel and then underneath was the massive coffee bean sack.’

A teeny tiny gravy boat for Bex

‘I asked for “a cute gravy boat” as in a nice patterned one but dad took that as miniature.

‘It held about 10ml of liquid.’

A very unchic sequin hat and scarf for Leah

‘As a teen my grandma gave me a black sequin beret with a matching sequin scarf (don’t think Parisian chic but Huddersfield market). Meanwhile my sister got a golden necklace with a cute bear on it.

‘It made me question what had I done to her.’

This squirrel is just like the one Jane got (Picture: Hen Party Warehouse)

A red squirrel-shaped nutcracker also for Jane

‘When I saw it I just felt guilty for not liking it and couldn’t quite figure out my reactions in time to feign joy.’

An encyclopedia for then-ten-year-old Eoin

‘I remember bursting into the living room on Christmas morning – and in amongst my pile of presents there was a large heavy rectangular parcel. I had no idea what it could be but I was very excited so I left it until nearly the end of my gift-opening frenzy.

‘Finally it was time. I picked it up excitedly tore off the wrapping paper and discovered… a Hutchinson Encyclopedia 2001 edition.

‘Not quite the surprise I was hoping for at the time but it still sits on the bookshelf next to my desk in my office to this day.’

A book about gay catholic priests for Jack

‘It was called something like “Hidden voices: Stories of gay priests” or something like that. And it was given to me with absolutely zero context.

‘It was just presented to me – an atheist homosexual – as something I would enjoy or relate to.’

Special to The Columbus Dispatch

Live plants are a cherished part of winter holiday festivities for many central Ohio families. From poinsettias in many different colors and shades to the stately and colorful amaryllis these plants are often received as gifts and placed in various locations around the home without a thought about their potential toxicity to children or pets.

Unfortunately the same holiday plants that bring us joy and color can be dangerous when ingested by inquisitive pets and children. This fact doesn’t have to prevent us from enjoying these plants but it requires us to be cognizant of where we locate them if there are pets or young children in the home. Let’s look at the potential toxicity of some of the best-loved holiday plants.

• Amaryllis paper whites daffodils: These bulbs forced for holiday blooming are popular gifts for plant lovers but they are toxic to both pets and humans. Ingesting any part of these plants can cause abdominal pain convulsions and cardiac arrhythmias. The good news is that the leaves of these plants are far less toxic than the actual bulbs.

• Poinsettia: This quintessential holiday plant now available in an array of different colors shades and leaf characteristics is likely the most misunderstood holiday plant when it comes to potential toxicity. While ingesting the leaves or stems of poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima) can cause gastrointestinal discomfort it will not cause severe illness or death — contrary to what Grandma may have told you!

• Mistletoe: While hanging live mistletoe (Phoradendron flavescens) may yield an extra peck on the cheek this holiday season it should be avoided in households with pets because it is extremely toxic. Ingesting even a small amount of live mistletoe can cause gastrointestinal upset seizures and even death when large quantities are ingested by pets. Pet lovers should opt for plastic or silk versions of this plant for the backdrop for their holiday smooches.

• Cyclamen: Only in recent years has cyclamen (Cyclamen persicum) become popular as a winter holiday plant available with flowers in many shades of red and pink as well as white. This plant contains dangerous saponins which can cause intestinal symptoms when ingested. The tuber or root of cyclamen is the most toxic part of the plant.

• Holly berries: Branches of shiny holly foliage with its festive red berries are popular and nostalgic holiday decorations but the berries are extremely toxic when ingested by humans or pets causing vomiting diarrhea dehydration and drowsiness even if just one or two berries are swallowed. The leaves of holly (Ilex opaca) can also cause discomfort if swallowed due to their sharp edges. Once holly berries dry out they fall from the branches sometimes putting them in easy reach of curious pets and children. Extreme care must be taken when displaying live holly branches with berries when pets or children are present.

• Christmas cactus: The indoor Christmas cactus (Schlumbergera bridgesii) provides a vibrant pop of color for the holidays and beyond but has been known to cause ataxia (abnormal uncoordinated movements) and mild stomach upset when ingested by cats.

With attention to proper plant selection and strategic placement in the home plant lovers with pets or young children can enjoy the colors textures and fragrance of these holiday plants.

If ingestion of toxic plants is suspected in children contact the Central Ohio Poison Center at Nationwide Children’s Hospital at 1-800-222-1222. Pet owners who suspect pet illness from ingesting toxic plants should contact their veterinarian or the 24-hour emergency pet poison hotline maintained by the ASPCA at 1-888-426-4435.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Anne Marie Mohan reported in June 2021 that this indulgent ice cream brand pioneers the use of recycled plastic with the material sourced from mixed plastic waste converted to plastic resin feedstock through advanced recycling.

Colgate-Palmolive is inviting European consumers to make toothbrushing part of their beauty ritual with its new Elixir line of three toothpaste formulas in a striking PET package that breaks from category norms in every way. Says Colgate-Palmolive Co. Worldwide Director of Oral Care Packaging Liz Mellone “Colgate Elixir is toothpaste reimagined—breathtaking design with beauty-inspired ingredients in a unique packaging technology that is recyclable and designed to let people enjoy the toothpaste to the last drop.”

According to Mellone the three innovative toothpaste formulas—White Restore Cool Detox and Gum Booster—were co-developed in tandem with the package a clear inverted 80-mL (2.7-oz) PET bottle with a clear overcap. The sleek and stylish container is a significant departure from and a more eco-friendly alternative to traditional toothpaste tubes which are made from a multilayer construction of plastic and aluminum that renders them non-recyclable.",,,,,,,,,,,,

PONCA CITY Oklahoma—When Earl “Trey” Howe III returned home here after four years of military service the first thing he noticed was the smell.

Howe grew up in and around Ponca City the site of the Phillips 66 refinery one of the oldest and largest crude oil refineries and tank farms in the country. The smell from the plant—a sulfur-rich odor somewhere between rotten eggs and freshly paved asphalt—was so constant he’d never even noticed it.

But now it seemed to follow him everywhere.

“Depending on which way the wind is blowing I’ll get a stronger whiff on some days than others” Howe 51 the former chairman of the Ponca Tribe of Oklahoma said. “It’s overpowering sometimes.”

A soft-spoken 6’4” father of three Howe lives just a few blocks from the refinery in the house where his grandparents once lived. Sometimes at night the flares which burn off excess hydrocarbons that can not be easily recovered or recycled are so bright and so loud—the whoosh of flames sounds like a jet engine—they can be seen and heard from miles away.

“You could feel it more than hear it” Howe said of a recent flaring that shook the ground and left him wondering if he and his family should evacuate. It was “like I was sitting next to a bomb.”

Ponca City takes its name from the Ponca Tribe a Native American tribe that lives nearby. For more than a century the region in north central Oklahoma has been ravaged by the environmental degradation associated with oil and gas development.

From abandoned oil and gas wells to refineries tank farms and hydraulic fracturing the pollution and destruction—including damage from thousands of man-made earthquakes—have exacted a heavy toll on the region’s air land water and people.

In many ways Ponca City and its 24000 predominantly white inhabitants are well off. Its schools library sports centers parks and concert hall would be the envy of most small towns in America.

But interviews with local residents historical records legal depositions and internal government reports tell of a sacrifice zone where oil rights were first taken from the Ponca Tribe and then exploited by the oil and gas industry with little thought given to environmental protection.

The resulting development has left homes enveloped in toxic fumes black slime oozing from basements emissions of fine particulate matter that can damage the heart and lungs and walls cracked from earthquakes induced by injecting wastewater from hydraulic fracking deep underground. In one case the fumes were so overpowering a family was forced to leave their home for several years.

Groundwater contamination from what is now the Phillips 66 refinery led to one of the largest environmental settlements in U.S. history with the company buying and razing an entire neighborhood in the early 1990s.

But the contamination wasn’t entirely eliminated: Over the last 20 years the refinery’s owners have bought out and leveled dozens of additional homes for unstated reasons. But through a review of county property records and well-monitoring data provided by state regulators Inside Climate News has found that the location of the houses closely tracks unsafe levels of benzene and other contaminants in groundwater a fact that has not previously been reported. And Phillips 66 has continued to remove contaminants like petroleum oil gasoline or diesel fuel from extraction wells near the neighborhood.

Bernardo Fallas director of corporate communications for Phillips 66 said the company conducts its operations in a manner that protects human health the community and the environment.

In White Eagle the headquarters of the Ponca Tribe several miles downstream where the Arkansas River and Salt Fork of the Arkansas River meet the pollution has been especially damaging. Children once swam in the waters while people fished from its banks. In recent years fish have washed up dead along the shoreline killed by a still-unidentified pollutant. Water from private wells in the community are no longer fit for drinking gardens are contaminated with pollution and inhalers are as common as cell phones.

“We’re being killed as surely as when they brought us the smallpox blankets and wrapped us in poison” said Casey Camp-Horinek a tribal elder and official environmental ambassador for the Ponca Tribe. “We’re being wrapped in a poison that kills the air the water and the Earth and that kills my people.”

‘We Have to Find a Way Forward’

The degradation in and around Ponca City is emblematic of the systemic long-term devastation of the environment that a group of lawyers and advocates are pushing to make an international crime. The campaign aims to treat “ecocide” in the same way as genocide or crimes against humanity offenses that are prosecuted by the International Criminal Court in the Hague.

Criminalizing ecocide is likely to take years if it succeeds at all and even then many challenges would remain. The law could only be applied to future crimes and the United States is not a member of the international court so the impact of its petroleum industry might remain outside the law. But the Ponca Tribe isn’t waiting on legal wrangling half-a-world away. The tribe is seeking protection under a parallel effort known as the rights of nature a legal movement that has sprung up in countries around the globe in recent decades seeking to grant legal rights to rivers forests and wildlife.

In 2018 the Ponca Nation became the first tribe in the United States to sign into law a rights of nature resolution and the tribe is now working on an additional rule that would give added protection to the rivers that run through their community.

“We have to find a way forward” Camp-Horinek said.

The rights of nature approach she said more closely aligns with an Indigenous understanding of the environment in which human beings are a part of nature not separate from it. “We are nature protecting itself” she said.

The legal standing of the rights of nature remains unclear. So far no U.S. court has upheld a rights of nature law and courts that have ruled on whether rights of nature can be enforced have all said they cannot. As more Indigenous and other communities pass rules on the rights of nature however that could change.

If courts do rule in favor of the rights of nature the implications for oil and gas companies operating near the Ponca Tribe could be significant. The tribe’s 2018 resolution includes a provision that if a corporation is found guilty of an offense related to the rights of nature the chairman of the board of the corporation will be held liable with a maximum sentence of a year in prison and a $5000 fine per day for each offense.

Such protections may be needed now more than ever.

Although a landmark 2020 U.S. Supreme Court ruling delivered greater tribal sovereignty for Native communities in Oklahoma state efforts to fight the ruling could jeopardize what limited environmental regulations currently exist on Indigenous lands.

“It has messed with our ability for the Clean Water Act to be successfully implemented and for the Clean Air Act to be successfully implemented” Camp-Horinek a leader of the rights of nature movement for the tribe and for tribes globally said. “So we are using the rights of the river as a possible way to protect the Ponca people.”

‘I Hope I Don’t Have to Move’

On a drive around the southern edge of Ponca City Howe a member of Ponca’s tribal council or “business committee” brings his silver Ford Explorer to a stop next to a culvert where a small stream flows out of the Phillips 66 refinery on its way to the Arkansas River.

“Me and my friends would ride our bicycles down here” he says pointing to the now fenced-off drainage ditch where he used to bike as a kid.

“It’d be grayish and sometimes reflecting off the light you could see a rainbow of colors” Howe said of the water.

The creek flows through what used to be a thriving low-income Indigenous Black Hispanic and white community with its own grocery store church and school.

The school closed in the late 1970s after dozens of students began fainting from fumes from the nearby refinery.

In 1989 residents from the neighborhood sued Conoco the owner of the refinery at the time after black slime began oozing into their basements. The residents claimed unusually high rates of cancer respiratory problems birth defects skin rashes and other illnesses they believed were linked to an underground spill from a tank or pipes at the refinery. They pointed to Conoco’s own water samples that showed elevated levels of benzene in the groundwater.

As part of the settlement Conoco agreed to buy and either tear down or relocate about 400 homes near the refinery although the company never admitted fault for any adverse health effects. All that remains of the community that was once there is the brick archway entrance to the school.

But ConocoPhillips and the subsequent owner of the refinery Phillips 66 have torn down more than three dozen other houses since then in a residential neighborhood east of the refinery. The buyouts track closely with areas where the concentration of benzene in the groundwater exceeds the EPA’s maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 0.005 milligrams per liter according to a map from 2014 that is part of the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality’s permit for the refinery. Benzene occurs naturally in crude oil and is produced during the refining of gasoline. Long-term exposure has been associated with leukemia.

Phillips 66 also has continued to remove tens of thousands of gallons of “light nonaqueous phase liquid”—contaminants such as petroleum oil gasoline or diesel fuel—from extraction wells near that site in recent years according to data from the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality.

A 1990 settlement between Conoco and Ponca City residents living near the refinery resulted in the company buying out and either tearing down or relocating approximately 400 homes. However the buy outs didn’t end there as the company has continued to purchase and remove dozens of additional homes in the neighborhood since the settlement as shown in these satellite images from 2004 to 2019.

Fallas the Phillips 66 corporate communications director acknowledged the continuing purchases and the fact that the company has continued to remediate pollution.

“Since the early 1990s Phillips 66 (then Conoco and ConocoPhillips) has worked cooperatively with state regulators to continue remediation and monitoring of groundwater beneath and surrounding the Ponca City Refinery” Fallas said.

He added “As part of our state permitting requirements impacted groundwater is drawn back to the refinery for recovery and treatment. Phillips 66 has purchased and continues to purchase property near the refinery that meets certain criteria to increase the buffer zone between the community and the refinery.”

Overall pollution levels in the area have gone down over the past 20 years Erin Hatfield communications director for the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality said but added”That said a number of wells are still over the MCL for benzene.”

Howe lives only a few blocks from the most recent buyouts.

He said he worries that the underground spill that resulted in the mass-buyout in the 1990s may now be spreading into his neighborhood.

“I hope I don’t have to move” he said.

A House From Hell

A few blocks from Howe’s home and a block from the most recent spot where Phillips 66 is buying out houses sits one of the most extreme examples of the fallout from the region’s more than 100 years of oil and gas development. In 2013 Chris and Sherry Walls and their four children had to flee from their home after the local gas company discovered the house was enveloped in a cloud of methane gas.

The Walls spent three years living out of hotels and rental properties before the Oklahoma Corporation Commission installed a ventilation system designed to suck gas from beneath the house and vent it above their rooftop. The Walls returned home soon after but the ventilation system only made matters worse so the family stopped using it.

Still grieving from the death of one of their sons wracked with debt exacerbated by the constant moves and unable to find the source of the leak Chris Walls may have found it to be more than he could take. On June 18 2017 Father’s Day Sherry found her husband’s body hanging in their garage.

“I think our house had a lot to do with it” she said.

Four years after her husband’s death Sherry Walls and her daughter Diamond are living in a house still enveloped by gas. ​​An internal Oklahoma Corporation Commission report from 2018 viewed by Inside Climate News concluded there is a “possible well location on the Walls property or even under the house.” Gas wells were drilled in the neighborhood around 1910 and are among an estimated 25000 to 100000 “orphaned” wells in the state for which the operator is unknown or no longer exists.

Walls said the Ponca City mayor and Phillips 66 had offered to relocate her to a new house but it was smaller than her current home she said and she declined. Ponca City officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Sharon Wilson a gas imaging specialist with Earthworks an environmental advocacy organization based in Washington visited Walls’ home in 2017 soon after Chris Walls died. Using a thermal camera she looked at the images and was appalled not only by the volume of gas she saw billowing from the ventilation system but the gas she smelled as she stood outside the home.

“I don’ t know how they can live there” Wilson said. “The state should have done something about it a long time ago. It’s a failure of the regulatory agency.”

Oklahoma Corporation Commission spokesman Matt Skinner said the ventilation system that his agency installed solved the problem.

“It worked perfectly” Skinner said. “We literally moved if not heaven the earth and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to [get to] a place where it wasn’t seeping gas” Skinner said.

However the 2018 internal Oklahoma Corporation Commission report came to the opposite conclusion.

“The Corporation Commission’s Oil and Gas Division along with all the people who have worked on this situation are very disappointed that the extraction remediation effort fell short of our goal” the report stated. “It is apparent that efforts at the surface to divert the stray gas are—futile.”

This Will Bring ‘Bad Medicine’

In 1908 not long after the last land run in the newly formed state of Oklahoma and the year Henry Ford unveiled the Model T an oil prospector from the East arrived on the Cherokee Strip. E.W. Marland a wildcatter and lawyer who had already made and lost an oil fortune in Pennsylvania spent the next three years drilling dry wells while living on credit at the Arcade hotel in Ponca City.

An amateur practitioner of the emerging field of geology Marland took an interest in a hillside southwest of town that he believed to be a geologic dome a cap under which might lie a vast reservoir of oil.

The land belonged to Willie Cries for War a member of the Ponca Tribe which the U.S. Army had forced from its ancestral homelands in Nebraska to what is now Oklahoma some 30 years before.

The outcrop where Marland wanted to drill was a sacred site for the Ponca offering commanding views towards their homeland in the north and the confluence of the Salt Fork and Arkansas Rivers to the southeast a reminder of their earlier home where the Niobrara and Missouri Rivers meet. The hilltop also was a tribal cemetery where bodies were placed on top of wooden scaffolds rather than buried underground.

Drilling into the hilltop was out of the question. But with the help of some local ranchers—who depending on the historical account were either benevolent protectors of the Ponca or vultures who preyed on them at every turn—Marland gained permission to drill a short distance downslope from the cemetery.

When the well came in as a gusher White Eagle one of the last Ponca chiefs warned that it would bring “bad medicine” for him his people and for Marland the oil baron later recalled.

“He said this will all come back to impact all of us” Camp-Horinek said. “And we’re living in that time.”

After Marland struck oil Cries for War who was 19 at the time was well compensated in royalty payments for the lease he signed enough for him to live well in his younger years. He bought a large house and several vehicles and hired a cook maid and driver.

But Cries for War was the exception among the Ponca. The Miller brothers—the ranchers who helped Marland negotiate the lease—bought or leased tens of thousands of acres from the Ponca including the mineral rights that went with the land. In return the ranchers owners of the 101 Ranch often paid no more than a sack or flour or potatoes and a few scraps of meat according to “The Real Wild West: The 101 Ranch and the Creation of the American West” by historian Michael Wallis.

In 1920 a federal grand jury indicted the Miller brothers on what ultimately grew to 49 criminal counts charging them with defrauding the Ponca of large tracts of land. The brothers pled guilty to illegally acquiring Indian land valued at more than $380000 although the ruling was later overturned in a federal appeals court.

“It always bothered me to see the Miller Brothers played up as heroes when they defrauded Indians of land greater in value than train and bank robberies committed by the Daltons Doolins James and other bandits combined” Ferdie Deering a longtime columnist for the Daily Oklahoman and editor for the Farmer-Stockman magazine later wrote.

‘Downstream From All That Waste’

Sitting in his print shop in the village of White Eagle Howe recalled how his great uncle Willie Cries for War once sucked stingers out of his neck after he’d been stung by bees.

Howe whose black-rimmed glasses end in neon green at the temples remembers Cries for War as a penniless elder his money long gone living in a spare bedroom of his grandparents’ home.

The oil well drilled on land that used to belong to his great uncle was the beginning of what became the Conoco and later the ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 empire. Marland the oil-man who talked Cries for War into allowing drilling on his land became one of the richest men in the world building a “palace on the prairie” in Ponca City from which he played the role of a British nobleman hosting fox hunts and polo matches for the city’s more affluent white community.

In 1918 Marland built an oil refinery the Phillips 66 refinery in Ponca City a few blocks from where Howe now lives. Soon after opening the refinery began to dump its petroleum waste into the Arkansas River.

For the Ponca Tribe based several miles downstream in the village of White Eagle that was the beginning of the contamination of their drinking water supply. Though the tribe recently built a new water supply system many in the community fear it too is contaminated and they rely primarily on bottled water.

“Conoco flourished and continues to flourish at the expense of those downstream from it” Howe said. “And instead of making things right for the tribe that began their oil production—we should have been one of the wealthiest tribes in not just Oklahoma but the country—we’re downstream from all that waste.”

As a member of the Ponca City Chamber of Commerce board of directors Howe tries to build better relations between the predominantly white community and the Ponca Nation. Growing up Indigenous in and around Ponca City he said he often felt invisible. As a child he excelled at basketball and could dunk by his sophomore year of high school but he was overlooked for Ponca City’s varsity squad something he attributes to being the only Indigenous kid on the team.

Howe is a prominent figure in the region a former chief of police for White Eagle and the current police commissioner for the neighboring Otoe–Missouria Tribe. But when he does errands in Ponca City he said people—from gas station attendants to the staff of the Lowe’s home improvement store—often look past him to help a white person standing behind him.

Ben Waters Trey’s grandfather on his mother’s side worked for the refinery helping to weld many of the large oil tanks across the sprawling nearly four-square mile facility. Earl Howe Senior his grandfather on his dad’s side had cancer though he didn’t die from it. All three of his grandfather’s brothers and Trey’s father Earl Howe Junior died from cancer.

Kay County including Ponca City and the village of White Eagle has one of the highest cancer rates in the state.

Howe doesn’t use fancy terms like “genocide” or “ecocide” but he wonders nonetheless if the refinery was to blame for so many deaths.

“There are a lot of other tribal members who died from cancer” Howe said. “I don’t know if any of those are a direct link but I think there’s an abnormal rate of cancer that could be related to that.”

‘This is Bad Bad Stuff Going On Here’

If the fumes and contaminated water were not enough of a threat in the region until recently a fine black powder routinely covered the cars lawns clothing and pets of the people who lived just south of Ponca City.

Just past the Ponca City city limits on highway 177 a petrochemical plant operated by the Continental Carbon Company manufactures carbon black an incredibly fine powder made from low value heavy oil by-products at the Phillips 66 refinery just to the north.

Carbon black is used to strengthen tires and as a pigment in inks. It is also a potential carcinogen that can penetrate deep inside human lungs.

“The particles are so fine that if you tossed them in the air and didn’t have any wind they would stay airborne for two days” Camp-Horinek said.

In the early 2000s tribal members living near the plant raised the issue with Camp-Horinek’s brother Carter Camp an Indigenous rights advocate and former leader of the American Indian Movement. In a push for greater tribal sovereignty he helped lead a months-long armed standoff with federal agents at Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota in 1973 for which he spent three years in prison.

“They came to my brother Carter and said ‘Look this is bad bad bad stuff going on here. Our children are being born with cancer. We’re dying from what it’s doing to us’” Camp- Horinek said.

The Camp family and other members of the Ponca Tribe decided to take on Continental Carbon. They teamed up with a workers union inside the plant and sent a delegation to the parent company’s headquarters in Taiwan where they held a hunger strike to protest the lax environmental controls at the Ponca City plant.

Without admitting any fault Continental Carbon agreed to a $10.5 million settlement with the Ponca Tribe in 2009 that included tearing down 11 nearby houses and providing relocation funding for those who had lived there.

A row of driveways along the highway that give way to a field of grass and shade trees are all that remain of what were once low-income homes for families.

“I’m not happy with it” Camp-Horinek said. “Because what they did not do is stop Continental Carbon from operating in the same manner as they always have. It’s still going on and they did not get further medical care for all of the people that were impacted by it.”

In 2015 the company entered into a consent decree with the EPA and the Department of Justice to invest $98 million in pollution controls at the Ponca City plant and similar carbon black plants in Alabama and Texas.

In 2018 the Trump administration granted the company an extension giving the Oklahoma plant until April of this year to begin pollution controls to reduce emissions of particulate matter nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides.

​​Dennis Hetu president of Continental Carbon said the additional pollution controls at the company’s Ponca City plant are now complete.

​​”The consent decree said I had to have it up and running this year and it’s up and running” he said.

However an EPA spokeswoman said installation of the pollution controls have not in fact been completed at the Ponca City plant.

“Technical issues associated with the installation of controls and Winter Storm Uri have caused delays” the spokeswoman said referring to the ice and snow storm that caused widespread power outages in Texas in February.

‘If You Can Imagine Being That Child’

Fighting for environmental protection and for the rights of Indigenous people in the face of extreme adversity is in many ways a part of the Ponca DNA Camp-Horinek’s in particular.

On a blazing hot August afternoon in the Clyde Warrior Memorial building in White Eagle a building named after a Ponca youth leader and prominent civil rights activist in the 1960s Camp-Horinek recounts how her people came to live in Oklahoma. It was a forced relocation that as she described it her people should not have even survived.

“My grandfather was around 6 years old at that time when they came into our village site and rounded us up like cowboys would herd cattle at the point of a gun with bayonets at our backs” Camp-Horinek 73 said. “They forced us to leave our homes without our food without our hunting equipment without our cooking equipment without our seeds and walk nearly 700 miles.”

After arriving in what is now Oklahoma in 1877 one in every three members of the Ponca Tribe soon died from starvation and disease.

One of the Ponca chiefs Standing Bear promised his only son who at age 16 lay in a canvas army tent dying of malaria that he would grant his final wish returning his body to their homeland in the north.

“He escaped with his son and went back to Níʼ b d áska or now called Nebraska and after a series of legal moves was declared the first Native to be called a human being under the eyes of the law” Camp-Horinek said of a legal ruling that was a landmark for not just the Ponca but for all Native Americans. “Up until that time we weren’t even considered to be human beings.”

The stories of those who came before her have had a large influence on Camp-Horinek who has dedicated much of her adult life to environmental activism and chairs the Indigenous Council for the Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature an organization advocating for the rights of nature worldwide. Working with a tribal attorney she helped craft the Ponca Tribe’s first rights of nature resolution and she is now working on a second resolution that would provide added protection to the rivers that flow through her people’s land.

She describes her own childhood as that of a brown child growing up in extreme poverty. The youngest of six children in a family of migrant farm workers she attended 12 different schools and in a desperate attempt to make friends allowed herself to be “born again” into seven different Christian churches.

“If you can imagine being that child” Camp-Horinek said “and not being able to understand the full impact of what the system had laid on her and on the other hand… knowing I am a Ponca knowing I was the granddaughter of chiefs and great granddaughter of war chiefs and survivors.”

“Those dualities left me an ability to be awakened into who I was supposed to be” she said.

‘Earthquake Capital of the World’

In 2015 Camp-Horinek’s activism and Howe’s work on the tribal council came together.

In May 2015 Howe who had recently been elected chairman of the Ponca Tribe received a federal grant to construct a veterans’ memorial at the Ponca tribal cemetery to honor members of the community who had fought for their country.

The Ponca cemetery lies half a mile south down the hillcrest from where Willie Cries for War once owned the 120 acres he would later lease to Marland. The site still offers sweeping views of the Salt Fork to the southeast. When the leaves fall from the cottonwood trees each fall you can see where the Salt Fork empties into the Arkansas River a couple of miles downstream.

But a new larger hill the Ponca City landfill just to the north now towers over the cemetery partially blocking views of the Ponca’s ancestral homelands in Nebraska.

“I would imagine our people stood here and looked in all directions and this was the perfect spot to memorialize our people that passed on in view of the river and what looked like their homeland” Howe said. “Now a big portion of that to the north is obstructed by this big mound of trash.”

As Howe walked the rows of headstones in the cemetery to make sure he had identified all the veterans buried there he couldn’t help but notice how many of his community members had died at an early age.

In the tribal council Howe’s concern about the oil industry’s pollution found fellowship with Camp-Horinek’s activism. The two did not know each other well but they knew of each other’s families and Howe was familiar with the Camp family’s history of activism.

When Camp-Horinek ran for a seat on the Ponca tribal council and won they began working together closely and one of their first targets was hydraulic fracturing. Camp-Horinek had recently spoken out against fracking at a public hearing at the Oklahoma state capitol.

By 2016 earthquakes created by fracking were reaching epic proportions in Oklahoma caused not by fracking itself but by the injection of large volumes of wastewater deep underground. Before the state’s fracking boom in the late 2000s Oklahoma averaged two earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater per year. By 2015 that number had soared to 903 earthquakes in a single year more than twice the number of similarly-sized earthquakes recorded in California that year making Oklahoma the “earthquake capital of the world.” On Sept. 3 2016  a 5.8 magnitude earthquake the largest in state history hit 15 miles southeast of White Eagle near Pawnee Oklahoma.

At the same time fish in the Salt Fork river were washing up dead near the tribe’s powwow grounds in White Eagle. News reports later suggested that a leaking tanker truck near a wastewater injection well site may have been the cause but an investigation by state regulators was inconclusive.

Matt Skinner of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission said they found no evidence linking the tanker truck or other oil and gas operations in the area to the fish kill. Skinner said there have been die-off events recorded in the river for decades because of the water’s naturally occuring high salinity which gives the river its name.

In February 2016 the Ponca tribal council with Howe as chairman and Camp-Horinek as a newly elected member passed a resolution banning fracking on Ponca land. The following year at Camp-Horinek’s urging the Ponca business committee passed the first rights of nature resolution approved by a tribe in the United States.

“We have to pay attention to our behavior and what we are doing as a species or simply cease to exist so that the Earth can heal” Camp-Horinek said. “She will endure whether the human species endures or not I think we are at a point of choice there.”

‘A Way to Protect the Ponca People’

The Ponca Tribe is now in the process of developing a second rights of nature resolution for the Arkansas and Salt Fork rivers which Camp-Horinek says would give the rivers stronger legal protections.

Such protections come as the enforcement of environmental regulations on Native lands has been called into question. Following the Supreme Court ruling McGirt v. Oklahoma that returned tribal sovereignty to much of eastern Oklahoma last year Gov. Kevin Stitt has sought to claw back state control.

In one such effort Stitt’s administration invoked a long-dormant rider that Oklahoma Senator and fossil fuel proponent James Inhofe attached to a transportation bill in 2005. The rider grants the state of Oklahoma rather than Native American tribes or the EPA the authority to administer environmental regulations in Indian county.

For the Ponca as well as for many of the state’s other tribal nations control of environmental regulations on tribal land by a state they feel is dominated by oil and gas interests is cause for more than a little concern. The industry is so influential in Oklahoma that the state capitol building is “the only capitol in the world surrounded by working oil wells” according to the Oklahoma House of Representatives. One of them called “Our Petunia’ was drilled in the middle of a flower bed on the capitol building’s lawn.

“Gov. Stitt used that rider to take over our environmental protection laws” Camp-Horkinek said. “We are using the rights of the river as a possible way to protect the Ponca people.”

‘Something Needs to Happen Here’

Driving north from the Ponca Tribal cemetery Howe heads towards his great uncle’s former allotment. He is halted by a gate and a “no trespassing” sign at top of the hill on the north side of the landfill. The view from this side of the landfill looks a lot different from what Howe’s ancestors would have seen from the place where they once laid their deceased on raised scaffolds.

A pile of brush that has been set on fire—in an apparent expansion of the city landfill—burns unattended in a shallow pit dug into the crest of the hillside. A short distance beyond a pumpjack whirs as it sucks oil out of the earth. Further afield the tanks and stacks of the Phillips 66 refinery mark the Ponca City skyline.

Wells have been extracting oil and gas from north central Oklahoma for more than 100 years. Regulators estimate 25000 to 100000 “orphaned” wells lie buried underground across the state. Credit: Phil McKenna

But looking out over his ancestor’s former land Howe also sees signs of hope. In addition to the fires and fossil fuel extraction infrastructure the pinwheels of distant wind farms dot the horizon in nearly every direction. In recent years a number of large wind farms have been built in the area though so far none belonging to the tribe.

Howe said he’d like to buy an electric vehicle. Wind energy he said could be a solution for the entire Ponca Nation’s transportation needs.

“If you took just one turbine it could feed our whole community” Howe said.

Photo Courtesy of Casey Camp-Horinek But Howe and the Ponca Tribe aren’t stopping there. Further afield far beyond even what Howe can see from the hilltop Camp-Horinek recently traveled to Glasgow Scotland on behalf of the tribe to COP26 the United Nations climate summit. There she met with U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland the first Native American to head the Interior Department. Camp-Horinek presented Haaland with a personalized blanket a gift from the Ponca Tribe embroidered by Howe and pressed her tribe’s case for rights of nature protections. It’s unclear how the meeting or the rights of nature resolutions will ultimately affect the tribe but the efforts are worth pursuing Howe said. “Something needs to happen here” he said.

This week Canopy Growth traded at the lowest price since 2017 as two analysts slashed their price targets into the single digits. In fact as of the close on Thursday Canopy Growth has now declined 4% since October 27 2017 the day before Constellation announced its first investment in the company:

We aren’t going to weigh in today on the investment merits of Canopy Growth but we did share our view last week for those who might be interested. Instead we will review the history of the Canopy Growth strategic investment and discuss what might happen over the next two years ahead of the expiration of the warrants that Constellation holds in the company.

Constellation Jumps In

While four years doesn’t seem like a long time the cannabis industry was quite different when Constellation made its first investment in late 2017 after almost a year of preliminary discussions. Back then the company traded on the TSX in Canada but hadn’t yet begun trading on NYSE (later the NASDAQ). In its fiscal Q1 ending in June 2017 which was reported in August it had generated revenue of just C$15.9 million exclusively from the Canadian medical cannabis market as adult-use didn’t launch until late 2018.

Constellation has made three equity investments into the company and also holds C$200 million of the company’s convertible debt. The initial investment of C$245 million bought 9.9% of the company and came with warrants. The price at the time was C$12.98 (18.88 million shares) and included an equal number of warrants at the same price that were to expire 30 months after closing.

Less than a year later Constellation announced its second investment of C$5 billion at C$48.60 per share for 104.5 million shares in August 2018 just ahead of adult-use legalization. This investment came with warrants as well that were subsequently amended.

The third investment came in May 2020 when Constellation exercised the warrants it had received from its first investment just ahead of their expiration paying C$245 million to acquire 18.88 million shares at C$12.98. The stock was trading then near C$22. With that investment the company then owned 142.25 million shares at an average cost of C$38.59 for a total investment of C$5.49 billion. The 142.25 million shares represent 36% of the outstanding shares of Canopy Growth and the remaining 139.7 million warrants now well out of the money would give Constellation a majority of the company upon exercise.

Frustration Sets In

When Constellation made its second investment in late 2018 it took control of the Board of Directors. In May 2019 Canopy replaced its CFO with Mike Lee a Constellation veteran. The first sign of trouble at Canopy Growth was the sudden departure of former co-CEO and co-founder Bruce Linton just six weeks later. Another Constellation veteran David Klein who had begun serving as a director when the second investment closed in November 2018 and as Chairman in October 2019 became CEO in January 2020.

In October when Constellation reported its fiscal Q2 its investor presentation painted a rosy picture of its investment in Canopy Growth calling it a “global cannabis leader in cannabis sales with a leading market share position in the recreational cannabis market.” It detailed the plan Canopy had shared earlier this year to reach positive adjusted EBITDA by its March 2022 quarter and to reach positive operating cash flow for all of the fiscal year ending in March 2023.

Of course in November Canopy Growth withdrew its outlook. At present analysts don’t expect the company to generate positive adjusted EBITDA even in fiscal 2024. Additionally the company has continued to lose share in the adult-use market in Canada. According to data from Hifyre it was fifth behind Tilray HEXO Auxly and Organigram during the month of November with share at just 8.8%. This has to be exceedingly disappointing to Constellation to see Canopy which was the clear market share leader in Canada when it made its investment struggle to remain in the top five.

Since then there have been some substantial announcements. Most recently the company announced the pending sale of its German pharmaceutical division which accounted for C$11.9 million (9%) of revenue in its most recent quarter. The sale price was EUR80 million compared to the purchase price of EUR225.9 million in 2019. Even assuming a full earnout the sale price of EUR126.6 million would represent a loss of 44%. This large loss extends upon substantial write-downs of fixed assets and inventory over the past two years.

On November 19th shortly after its disappointing financial report the company announced that CFO Mike Lee and President Rade Kovacevic are leaving at the end of 2021. Additionally Constellation CEO Bill Newlands resigned from Board of Directors in late November replaced by Constellation CFO Garth Hankinson. The company didn’t issue a press release disclosing it instead in an SEC filing without any sort of explanation.

We can understand why Constellation is frustrated. Slide 48 from that investor presentation in October depicted Canopy Growth very positively:



Walking back its financial outlook certainly wiped out the first point regarding progress towards becoming profitable. In its fiscal Q2 Canopy Growth net revenue declined from a year ago by 3% to C$131 million and the company’s adjusted EBITDA loss of C$163 million hurt by inventory write-downs was C$77 million worse than a year ago. Even excluding the inventory write-down it would have been -C$76 million the worst among all cannabis companies globally in both absolute levels as well as relative to revenue for those companies that generate substantial revenue.

Despite strong growth in the adult-use sales in Canada during that time Canopy Growth’s sales into the adult-use market fell 1% compared to a year ago during its Q2. In fact its sales in all cannabis categories except CBD fell compared to a year ago as did its overall sales in what it calls “other consumer products” which declined 12% due primarily to the 34% decline in its Storz & Bickel unit. Canopy Growth thus far has failed to capitalize on its potential.

The balance sheet has become a substantial challenge that we think led the company to sell the German pharmaceutical subsidiary at a steep loss. The unit which doesn’t fit with Constellation’s strategic vision for Canopy any longer generated C$23.3 million of revenue in H1 of Canopy’s fiscal year 8.7% of overall revenue. The sale price including the full earnout is about 3.5% of the current market cap of the entire company. This initial cash of approximately C$115.5 million will leave the company with about that amount of net cash at 12/31 by our estimate. We had previously discussed our expectation that total cash would be at or below the outstanding debt at that time due to the outflows from cash from operations and the up-front payment subsequent to 9/30 to Wana Brands. Canopy has total debt of C$1.5 billion including C$600 million of debt due in June 2023 that is convertible at C$48.18 far above the current price and a US$750 million credit facility that matures in 2026.

With respect to the point about a strong management team two of the top executives at that time were fired in November as detailed above including the last remaining legacy Canopy exec as well as the Constellation-installed CFO.

At C$12.54 Canopy Growth now trades 67.5% below the cost of Constellation’s investment into the company. From our perspective it has bet on the wrong horse. While some of the challenges Canopy has faced have been out of its control like the slow rollout in Canada of adult-use the pandemic and a longer path to entry into the United States than the company anticipated it’s very clear that the company is not what Constellation thought that it was buying back in 2018. Canopy is not a leader in global cannabis and it continues to bleed financially. The company has moved from an abundance of cash into a position of what will soon be net debt and that debt is due in the intermediate term and will impede its growth in our view. At present Canopy’s financials will continue to weigh on those of Constellation leaving it in a tough position. After all its own executives have been running the company for more than two years now and haven’t been able to fix the challenges.

How This Could Play Out

By November 2023 Constellation will have a big decision that it must make. At that time its first tranche of warrants 88.5 million at C$50.40 (about 4 times the current price) will expire. Barring a big rally in the stock Constellation and Canopy could move to reduce the warrant conversion price and/or extend the term as we approach late 2023. Constellation could also potentially just buy the remaining shares of the company if the price continues to decline. Buying Canopy Growth could interfere with the company’s commitment to improving cash flow and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

We think Constellation is in a tough position as it must decide over the next 22 months how it can create value where it has failed to do so thus far. A big factor in how it addresses the situation will likely be the timing of its potential ability to own direct cannabis assets in the U.S. As long as Canopy Growth remains locked out of the market it becomes increasingly difficult for Constellation to commit additional capital to it. If there is still no clear path for Canopy to enter the U.S. Constellation could move to exit its investment.

The recent sale of its German pharmaceutical unit could be the precursor to additional divestitures at Canopy Growth. The first source of additional funds to deal with the cash drain from its existing operations could be the sale of its Storz and Bickel unit. In the first half of fiscal 2022 the unit has generated revenue of C$38.6 million or 14.4% of sales. Vaporizers don’t seem consistent with the overall strategy of Constellation at this time. When it announced the German divestiture Canopy Growth defined its strategic focus as cannabis and cannabinoid-based consumer products. Canopy paid EUR145 million (equivalent now to C$210 million) and could likely generate slightly more than that currently. The retail stores could be another source of potential cash. In the first half of its fiscal year Canopy Growth generated C$34 million in revenue from its stores in Canada 12.7% of overall sales.

The problem with selling potentially non-core assets to address the weakening balance sheet and continued drain of its operations on cash flow is that Canopy Growth’s core Canadian cannabis operations are likely the biggest impediment to profitability and this could lead Constellation and Canopy Growth to move in two directions. First they could continue to consolidate the industry as they did with their acquisition of Supreme earlier this year. This is a risky strategy in our view. We think the more likely scenario is that the company moves to dramatically reduce its scale in Canada. This would likely entail substantial write-down of its C$353 million in inventory and C$1.1 billion in fixed assets C$910 million of which is in Canada as it further scales back its Canadian operations.

Canopy Growth’s financial condition has deteriorated substantially since Constellation made its investments into the company and there is no quick fix. Not only has it used up most of the net cash that Constellation infused into it but it is far from profitability and has failed to achieve the leadership position that such a substantial investment should have yielded. Now Constellation must decide over the next two years how to address the problem. Canopy Growth’s future success seems likely tied to its ability to enter the U.S. cannabis market. It doubled down on its strategy of arranging future acquisitions with contractual agreements when it paid US$297.5 million for the right to acquire 85% of Wana Brands in October. Its rivals Cronos Group and Tilray have also been pursuing this strategy but Canopy’s financial condition limits it from additional transactions in our view.

If Constellation then wants to continue to pursue the American cannabis market it will need to infuse Canopy Growth with additional capital or acquire the company and use its own balance sheet. Alternatively it could move to reduce the drain on cash by selling off some additional assets. Ultimately we think it needs to fix its Canadian operations which could be through additional consolidation to gain greater scale which we think is less likely or to dramatically reduce its focus on the market by pulling back on adult-use a strategy that Aurora Cannabis has recently adopted.

Conclusion

Fear of missing out prompted a speculative investment into Canopy Growth four years ago. Constellation took control of Canopy effectively at a substantially higher price a year later and has been running the company since then with control of the Board of Directors and through the installment of its own executives at the top of Canopy as well as deeper in the organizational chart. The results to date have been horrendous and deterioration in Canopy’s outlook in November has already led to some big changes. Over the next two years Constellation has a number of alternatives it can pursue but the status quo absent a change in the ability to conduct business in the American cannabis industry will continue to challenge the company which could see a negative impact on both the income statement (Canopy losses that flow through its P&L) and its balance sheet (carrying value of its investment). From our perspective the best option is to retrench significantly from the Canadian adult-use market in order to improve cash flow ahead of its pending 2023 debt maturity. If Constellation is serious about the U.S. cannabis market it needs to restore investor confidence in the stock of Canopy Growth. Otherwise Canopy Growth won’t be able to continue to raise and deploy capital into the U.S.

Friends

This week Canopy Growth traded at the lowest price since 2017 as two analysts slashed their price targets into the single digits. In fact as of the close on Thursday Canopy Growth has now declined 4% since October 27 2017 the day before Constellation announced its first investment in the company:

We aren’t going to weigh in today on the investment merits of Canopy Growth but we did share our view last week for those who might be interested. Instead we will review the history of the Canopy Growth strategic investment and discuss what might happen over the next two years ahead of the expiration of the warrants that Constellation holds in the company.

Constellation Jumps In

While four years doesn’t seem like a long time the cannabis industry was quite different when Constellation made its first investment in late 2017 after almost a year of preliminary discussions. Back then the company traded on the TSX in Canada but hadn’t yet begun trading on NYSE (later the NASDAQ). In its fiscal Q1 ending in June 2017 which was reported in August it had generated revenue of just C$15.9 million exclusively from the Canadian medical cannabis market as adult-use didn’t launch until late 2018.

Constellation has made three equity investments into the company and also holds C$200 million of the company’s convertible debt. The initial investment of C$245 million bought 9.9% of the company and came with warrants. The price at the time was C$12.98 (18.88 million shares) and included an equal number of warrants at the same price that were to expire 30 months after closing.

Less than a year later Constellation announced its second investment of C$5 billion at C$48.60 per share for 104.5 million shares in August 2018 just ahead of adult-use legalization. This investment came with warrants as well that were subsequently amended.

The third investment came in May 2020 when Constellation exercised the warrants it had received from its first investment just ahead of their expiration paying C$245 million to acquire 18.88 million shares at C$12.98. The stock was trading then near C$22. With that investment the company then owned 142.25 million shares at an average cost of C$38.59 for a total investment of C$5.49 billion. The 142.25 million shares represent 36% of the outstanding shares of Canopy Growth and the remaining 139.7 million warrants now well out of the money would give Constellation a majority of the company upon exercise.

Frustration Sets In

When Constellation made its second investment in late 2018 it took control of the Board of Directors. In May 2019 Canopy replaced its CFO with Mike Lee a Constellation veteran. The first sign of trouble at Canopy Growth was the sudden departure of former co-CEO and co-founder Bruce Linton just six weeks later. Another Constellation veteran David Klein who had begun serving as a director when the second investment closed in November 2018 and as Chairman in October 2019 became CEO in January 2020.

In October when Constellation reported its fiscal Q2 its investor presentation painted a rosy picture of its investment in Canopy Growth calling it a “global cannabis leader in cannabis sales with a leading market share position in the recreational cannabis market.” It detailed the plan Canopy had shared earlier this year to reach positive adjusted EBITDA by its March 2022 quarter and to reach positive operating cash flow for all of the fiscal year ending in March 2023.

Of course in November Canopy Growth withdrew its outlook. At present analysts don’t expect the company to generate positive adjusted EBITDA even in fiscal 2024. Additionally the company has continued to lose share in the adult-use market in Canada. According to data from Hifyre it was fifth behind Tilray HEXO Auxly and Organigram during the month of November with share at just 8.8%. This has to be exceedingly disappointing to Constellation to see Canopy which was the clear market share leader in Canada when it made its investment struggle to remain in the top five.

Since then there have been some substantial announcements. Most recently the company announced the pending sale of its German pharmaceutical division which accounted for C$11.9 million (9%) of revenue in its most recent quarter. The sale price was EUR80 million compared to the purchase price of EUR225.9 million in 2019. Even assuming a full earnout the sale price of EUR126.6 million would represent a loss of 44%. This large loss extends upon substantial write-downs of fixed assets and inventory over the past two years.

On November 19th shortly after its disappointing financial report the company announced that CFO Mike Lee and President Rade Kovacevic are leaving at the end of 2021. Additionally Constellation CEO Bill Newlands resigned from Board of Directors in late November replaced by Constellation CFO Garth Hankinson. The company didn’t issue a press release disclosing it instead in an SEC filing without any sort of explanation.

We can understand why Constellation is frustrated. Slide 48 from that investor presentation in October depicted Canopy Growth very positively:



Walking back its financial outlook certainly wiped out the first point regarding progress towards becoming profitable. In its fiscal Q2 Canopy Growth net revenue declined from a year ago by 3% to C$131 million and the company’s adjusted EBITDA loss of C$163 million hurt by inventory write-downs was C$77 million worse than a year ago.

Here’s What You Need to Remember: The vulnerabilities of the big carriers are real and the U.S. needs to either remedy those problems or consider an alternative means of delivering ordnance.

The United States has decided to spend many billions of dollars on the CVN-78 (“Ford”) class of aircraft carriers to replace the venerable Nimitz class. The latter has served the U.S. Navy since 1975 with the last ship (USS George H. W. Bush) entering service in 2009. The Fords could be in service in one configuration or another until the end of the 21st century.

Just as the U.S. government has determined to make this investment numerous analysts have argued that the increasing lethality of anti-access/area denial systems ( especially China’s but also Russia and Iran) has made the aircraft carrier obsolete. If so investing in a class of ships intended to serve for 90 years might look like a colossal waste of money.

As with any difficult debate we should take time to define our terms and clarify the stakes. The anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) systems around the world may indeed curb the effectiveness of the Ford class but the U.S. will still find uses for this ships.

Define Obsolete:

We need to carefully describe how we think about obsolescence. Military analysts often equates obsolescence with uselessness especially while pursuing dollars for new gadgets but the two words don’t mean the same thing. In every war armies navies and air forces fight with old even archaic equipment. Built for World War II the A-26 Invader attack aircraft served in the Vietnam War. The USS New Jersey  declared obsolete at the end of World War II fought off Korea Vietnam and Lebanon. The A-10 “Warthog” thought by many to be obsolete before it even flew continues to fight in America’s wars. For countries less well-endowed than the United States the point hold even more strongly; all of the armies currently fighting in Syria and Libya use equipment that the U.S. considered obsolete decades ago.

The point is that even if the ships of the CVN-78 class cannot penetrate advanced A2/AD systems they can still serve other useful purposes. Indeed American carriers since 1945 have entirely earned their keep on these other missions which include strike in permissive environments displays of national power and commitment and relief operations. “Obsolescence” for one kind of mission does not imply uselessness across the range of maritime military operations.

Carrier vs. A2/AD:

People have predicted the obsolescence of the aircraft carrier since the end of World War II. The Soviets developed an elaborate system of submarines sensors and aircraft designed to strike US aircraft carriers. The U.S. developed countermeasures including the F-14 Tomcat  intended to defeat and distract the Soviet systems. As war never happened we never had the opportunity to test the capabilities of a carrier air wing against a flight of Tu-22M “Backfire” bombers. The Soviets and the Americans worked hard against each other countering each innovation with an ever-more-sophisticated reply. Each iteration led to a different constellation of power and vulnerability; the bombers had the upper hand at some points and the carriers at others.

The next generation of A2/AD capabilities will have a similarly non-linear character. While Chinese missiles might have the range and terminal maneuverability to find U.S. carriers missile defense and electronic counter-measures might make the missiles ineffective to the point of uselessness . Similar improvements in anti-submarine technology could limit or eliminate the vulnerability that carriers face against undersea threats. Carriers that become “obsolete” may not stay that way.

Flexibility:

The utility of a large flat-decked ship comes primarily from the kinds of aircraft it can carry and launch. The aircraft carrier as a concept has survived in no small part because aircraft carriers are good for jobs other than penetrating tightly defended A2/AD systems. Indeed no U.S. carrier since World War II has ever needed to directly challenge such a system. Instead (as noted above) aircraft carriers have found themselves jobs in a variety of other conditions.

The U.S. Navy has enjoyed the advantage of nearly unfettered access to enemy airspace over the past twenty-five years and has structured its air wings accordingly. While the U.S. has been slower than many would have liked to adapt to the new array of anti-access threats  the development of fifth and sixth generation stealth aircraft as well as the eventual procurement of long range carrier-based strike zones can help restore the usefulness of the CVN-78 class even if anti-access weapons drive the carriers further out to sea.

The Final Salvo:

Plenty of world-beating weapons quickly become obsolete. The fast battleships of World War II went into reserve less than a decade after their commissioning. The early fighters and bombers of the jet age sometimes had even briefer lifespans. Aircraft carriers in widely variant forms have enjoyed a good long run. They survive because aircraft have short ranges and fixed airfields have significant military and political vulnerabilities. These two factors seem likely to persist.

However just because flat-decked aircraft carrying ships will likely be with us does not mean that the Ford class which emphasizes high-intensity high technology warfare represents an ideal investment of U.S. defense capital. The vulnerabilities of the big carriers are real and the U.S. needs to either remedy those problems or consider an alternative means of delivering ordnance.

The latest data suggests that over 75% of realtors actively use social media to build relationships with clients whereas 98% of would-be buyers and sellers also rely on online sources for their real estate needs. Consistent content flow and interactions with prospective clients are among the most efficient tools in promoting one’s real estate business. However building a following among clients is a daunting task that may take years to accomplish.

Jeremy Batoff of Batoff Group at Compass Real Estate has crossed an impressive threshold on social media that few real estate agents can accomplish making him the most ‘followed’ realtor in the Greater Baltimore Area. Given his vast network on both the demand and supply sides Batoff leads the pack of Baltimore metro area agents. The interactions he creates with his clients make him well-known accessible familiar and trustworthy. Alongside his engaging lifestyle and travel content Batoff posts current listings along with other real estate interests. As Batoff’s profile is super active and draws thousands of followers he can capitalize on his robust social media following placing many eyes from all corners of the country on his listings and bringing new prospective buyers to the Baltimore real estate market.

Lately the Baltimore area has been drawing newcomers from neighboring states especially New York and Washington DC looking to trade the daily hustle and bustle of the big city for a quieter more relaxing way of life. In the last two years Maryland has become one of the more popular destinations for relocating New Yorkers due to its high quality of life and lower cost of living. While many NYC residents choose not to relocate fully an increasing number have decided to purchase “weekend” homes. Whether it be an estate in the Greenspring Valley or something more rural in Monkton horse country both are within a convenient driving distance from New York City many times the same commute time as other popular weekend spots such as the Hamptons. Young families with children in particular have been drawn to Baltimore because of its great schools; it is home to seventeen colleges and universities some among the nation’s best. Moreover there are many jobs in the area with major employers in health care biotech manufacturing fintech and sports. Several Fortune 500 companies are headquartered here including Black & Decker Constellation Energy T. Rowe Rice.

As Baltimore welcomes New Yorkers and others seeking a change of pace it is very much a two-way street. New York has become a popular destination likely thanks to an easy commute via Amtrak of an increasing number of Baltimore residents looking for something new and exciting. Whether scooping up pieds-a-terre for weekend jaunts to the city or purchasing starter apartments for children who have decided to relocate post-college more and more Baltimore residents seem to be purchasing New York City apartments. Fortunately Batoff has an in for those Baltimore clients wishing to have their very own piece of the Big Apple- star NYC Compass agent Eric Goldie. Ranked the top NYC agent on social media with transactions ranging from starter apartments to multi-million-dollar penthouses Goldie also happens to be Batoff’s fiancé. As Batoff and Goldie themselves split time between a West Village apartment and Greenspring Valley horse estate they are a testament to the perfect combination of city life/country life that is sought out by an ever-increasing number of today’s sophisticated buyers.

But Realme begs to differ with its new under-screen fingerprint scanners in its upcoming Realme GT2 series.

Realme’s General Vice President and Chief Officer of Realme China Mr. Chase Xu Qi has gone to Weibo recently to share with fans about the latest fingerprint scanning technology that Realme will equip in the upcoming Realme GT2 series.

From the screenshots shared on Weibo we notice some sort of Heart Rate Monitor menu page on-screen and the instruction seems to suggest to the user to put their thumb on the fingerprint scanner to measure their heart rate. This feature heart rate scanning feature via the fingerprint scanner seems like a unique and interesting idea but time will tell after release whether it will be a highlight or be just a mere gimmick.

The fingerprint scanner announcement was later supported by Digital Chat Station a popular technology leakster from China whereby he confirmed on Weibo that the Realme GT2 Pro is indeed not using your normal conventional optical fingerprint scanner.

The leakster also informs that the Realme GT2 Pro will be using Corning Gorilla Victus for better scratch and drop protection for users’ peace of mind.

In other news the Realme GT2 Pro’s design has been officially revealed by the company several days back but leaked renders of the Realme GT2 Pro from months ago may not be inaccurate after all as the latest leaks reveal that the Realme GT2 Pro may come in 3 different editions.

The one leaked render showing the Realme GT2 Pro having a long horizontal protruding camera bump may be the “Photographer Edition” of the Realme GT2 Pro. The “Photographer Edition” is said to feature a triple camera setup whereby each camera has been upgraded further compared to the standard edition to cater to professional photographers.

The Realme GT2 series will be announced officially on January 4 2022.

The New York Post reports 25-year-old Kendall resident Willy Suarez Maceo a licensed real estate broker who works for Century 21 in Miami South Miami Palmetto Bay and Kendall was charged with shooting a homeless man near downtown Miami last Tuesday night. That victim survived and was in critical condition as of Thursday.

Maceo then is believed to have targeted a second victim Jerome Antonio Price who was sleeping on a sidewalk in the city’s Wynwood neighborhood. In both incidents police surmise the suspect rolled up to his victims in his black Dodge Charger as they slept opened his door and fired on them.

The second incident was caught on camera according to the Post but charges were yet to be filed.

Miami Police interim Chief Manuel Morales said Maceo is now a suspect in a third shooting of a homeless man back on Oct. 16. In that incident Manuel Perez 59 was killed by a man who in surveillance photos looks like Maceo the paper reports.

Morales added it is possible Maceo attacked others noting the victims were “brutally targeted” for no apparent reason and the shootings may be the work of a serial killer.

“There may be other victims who suffered at the hands of this ruthless criminal” he told reporters.

Maceo was slapped with an attempted murder charge and ordered held without bail after his initial court appearance on Christmas Eve.

The Miami Herald reports detectives found Maceo in his car in Kendall on Wednesday with a 9 mm Glock on him and ballistics tests linked the weapon to the two shootings.

Circuit Judge Alberto Milian ordered him to remain behind bars citing the “particular pattern” of homeless people being targeted.

From the disappearance of the beloved combo pizza to the return of the churros even the most seasoned Costco members have noticed that the food court looks much different than it did a year ago because the warehouse chain gave us plenty of shifts twists and turns that had everyone talking. While each season lends itself to something different it's hard not to recognize the changes made both on and off the menu.

As the year winds down we're shedding light on how the food court has changed throughout the year. The number of changes to the Costco food court may seem endless so we've rounded up 13 of the biggest changes made to the warehouse chain's beloved food court.

Costco added a chicken sandwich to the menu.

Chicken sandwich wars reached new heights when Costco added its chicken sandwich to the menu. With the chicken sandwich craze sweeping the nation it wasn't long before Costco's new crispy chicken sandwich was born. Unfortunately the addition isn't found in the U.S. but the Instagram account @costcodeals found that Costco members in Vancouver BC Canada can get the menu item for $4.89 which comes with crispy breaded chicken and spicy mayo on a soft cheese bun at 810 calories.

Touchless soda dispensers made their debut at the food court.

The sensor-operated soda dispenser made its debut earlier this year and was met with mixed reviews. While the concept of putting your cup underneath seems simple enough some Reddit users say that some machines dispense overly carbonated soda that dispenses far more foam than soda.

But the biggest complaints came from the soda selections themselves. Depending on where you go the drink options can vary. One Reddit user wishes that the store offered slightly healthier options.

""I always feel like it is such a waste getting just water with a hot dog but the sugar is WAY to many calories…Something like un-sweetened Iced Tea or just flavored water no sweetner would be a god send"" said u/Anomaly1134.

Costco brought back outdoor seating…

Gone are the days of taking your food court orders to-go! The red and white benches are back after Costco removed seating areas from food courts at the start of the pandemic. As part of their safety measures the warehouse chain reduced the menu to hot dogs and pizza for takeout only—which meant no seating. But fret not because members can once again enjoy their meals outdoors.

…and indoor seating.

Costco took additional precautions when it also limited its indoor seating capacity and in some cases removed the tables entirely. But back in April there were heavy talks about reinstalling the tables for public consumption.

Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti predicted the food courts would make a full return at the time according to a CNN report. ""God willing. But it's going to take some time"" he said. Keeping with health guidelines the warehouse chain would enforce physical distancing at a reduced capacity.

Costco brought back churros.

The Twisted churros are back and bigger than ever. Back in March Costco brought back the menu item but with a twist. But with the increase in size comes an increase in price. Instead of the usual $1 members can expect to pay $1.49 for the bigger portion which means more cinnamon and more sugar for this sweet treat.

But does bigger always mean better? Some shoppers on Facebook commented that the previous version of the churros was better and even petitioned Costco to bring back the original recipe.

The combo pizza did not make a return.

Arguably the most popular item on the menu the combination pizza's disappearance made headlines and dominated online forums…so much so that pizza lovers forged an online petition requesting the return of the menu item with it garnering well over 8000 online signatures. The petition even stated that ""Countless Costco members and membership families have sworn to not renew their membership with Costco due to this travesty.""

A recent Reddit poll confirmed that desire is still at an all-time high when it comes to the pizza with the vast majority of users wanting the item brought back.

While this isn't necessarily a change with other items making their return after being taken off the menu to help with streamlining orders it is surprising given how much love the combo pizza gets online.

A new ice cream was introduced.

We all screamed for Costco ice cream…until it was sadly removed from the menu. For the longest time the warehouse chain served froyo but in May USA Today reported that Galanti wants to expand the food court menu with ""high-end soft ice cream to replace their frozen yogurt."" The ice cream can be served in either a cup for $1.99 or in a sundae with a chocolate topping syrup for $2.49.

Smoothies returned.

This year it was reported that the beloved smoothie is making a comeback to the food court. At 220 calories per serving it's even considered one of the healthier food court options when compared to other menu items.

""I have to say this fruit smoothie from the food court is pretty good"" said Reddit user u/therealdeb in early 2021 after getting one of these fruity concoctions.

But not everyone was a fan of the flavor. Some users from the same Reddit thread claimed that the drink used to appear ""more pink"" and that Costco changed its smoothie recipe.

Another Reddit user/Costco member noted that the food court used to carry the mixed berry flavor but this is something different. ""grew up drinking the berry smoothie so my heart broke just a little when they rolled out the new version"" they said.

Costco brought back the onion crank to its food courts.

After much pushback from members Costco listened to the voices of the people and delivered. Easily considered a fan favorite of the food court menu it wasn't long before members noticed the onion crank's disappearance. The long-awaited food court condiment made its triumphant comeback this summer but the return is bittersweet.

While some locations carry the machine others have yet to follow the trend leaving some shoppers curious about its reappearance. The answer remains unclear when each store will see the food court staple but the emergence of the onion crank in some stores is worth keeping hope alive.

Costco added touchless condiment stations.

If there's one thing that can make the iconic $1.50 hotdog any better it's topping it with some of your favorite condiments. Alongside the onion crank the condiment station also faced some modifications this year when the warehouse chain installed touchless condiment dispensers. Following the same idea of the touchless soda dispensers the condiment stations are activated by sensors. While the idea sounds great in theory Mashable reported that some customers complained about the mess from the machines dispensing improperly.

You might need to be a member to eat there.

Shoppers have noticed kiosks popping at the food courts that require them to scan their membership cards before ordering from the menu. There have been talks about required membership for years but it seems like this is the year that the requirement has been enforced more heavily.

Redditor u/johnthrives posted proof of this measure with a screen prompting customers to scan membership to continue.

""They're working to make it required everywhere…"" noted one Reddit user.

Although this rule may not be implemented at every food court it could be only a matter of time before you see a kiosk at your nearest store.

The chocolate-dipped ice cream disappeared.

Members had to say goodbye to this sweet treat after the food court removed it from the menu. The ice cream bar was dipped in rich chocolate and topped with toasted almonds made a lot of uproar once fans of the dessert noticed its disappearance. There's even a Facebook page dedicated to bringing the item back. Costco's had a history of reintroducing items to the menu so it's worth keeping hope alive.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Costco stopped taking food court orders over the phone.

Over the years some customers have opted to call ahead in order to place their food orders but it looks like those days are over. Unlike simply calling the nearest Costco store food court some Redditors have noted that they have to visit the store in person in order to have their orders filled.

""I have observed that in such places they primarily serve the customer who is already present as the exchange is already guaranteed"" said user u/tetsaga when explaining the potential reasoning behind the change.

Strong jewellery sales helped boost Costco’s internationbal Q4 e-commerce revenue by almost nine per cent according to Richard Galanti chief financial officer of Costco.

Costco's diamond and jewellery sales boom; history in the courts

When Costco opened its first Australian store in 2009 few people would have believed that the US-style large-format supermarket chain would offer diamonds and jewellery among the meat and vegetables aisles let alone that they would become a major product range.

However a decade on the 13-store chain has reported an increase in Australian revenue from $2.59 billion in 2020 to $2.82 billion in 2021 while its profit more than doubled from $22.22 million in 2020 to $46.39 million this year.

The results are recorded to 31 August each year.

Patrick Noone managing director Costco Australia told The Australian that the company had performed strongly throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting travel restrictions and that Costco’s jewellery category was increasing sales in the face of the company not being considered as a ‘typical’ shopping choice for a diamond engagement rings.

“Jewellery has done exceptionally well for us this year I think people are at home and getting married having babies and a lot of diamonds have been selling” Noone said in The Australian article titled Diamonds are Costco’s best friend as sales in Australia race to $3bn.





“Diamonds did well and that surprised us a bit in terms of selling well. I think it is mainly that we are getting traction with the quality of the goods - we are seeing $10000 diamond rings being sold for weddings $15000 earrings and things like that ..."" Patrick Noone Costco Australia

“Diamonds did well we sell gold and that surprised us a bit as well in terms of selling well.

""I think it is mainly we are getting traction with the quality of the goods we are seeing $10000 diamond rings being sold for weddings $15000 earrings and things like that and when people compare the quality out there in the market place and the savings it has proven popular"" Noone said.

The trend is not restricted to Australia. Strong jewellery sales helped boost Costco’s internationbal Q4 e-commerce revenue by almost nine per cent according to Richard Galanti chief financial officer.

On 9 December during an Earnings Call - a conference call between the management of a public company analysts investors and the media to discuss the company’s financial results during a given reporting period – Galanti told participants that jewellery was among Costco’s strongest departments with a 20 per cent jump in total revenue to $US1.67 billion for the quarter.

The Motley Fool finance website reported that Galanti said: ""We actually sold a couple of rings in the $100000 range.”

“In terms of e-commerce sales in the quarter ex FX [foreign exchange] increased 13.3 per cent year-over-year and that's of course on top of an 86 per cent plus increase a year ago in the first quarter. Stronger department in terms of year of percentages include jewellery tyres and home furnishings.”

During a March 2020 Earnings Call Galanti said “We recently sold another high-value large carat diamond for a little over $US600000"" while in May 2019 he claimed a customer had purchased a $US400000 diamond ring from the supermarket.

Costco is reported to be North America's fourth-largest retailer of fine jewellery and watches after Signet Walmart and Tiffany however; the company’s jewellery and watch departments have not been without controversy and legal action.

In 2010 Swiss watch brand Omega began what was to become a long legal battle to stop Costco stocking and selling its watches at massive discounts – reportedly up to a third less than US retail.

While that case was proceeding – it eventually took five years – Tiffany & Co. the iconic US jewellery brand began legal proceedings to stop Costco from selling what it described as counterfeit diamond engagement rings bearing the luxury retailer's name.

The case lasted eight years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9jaHJpc3RtYXMtaG9saWRheS1yZXR1cm4tcG9saWNpZXMtd2FsbWFydC10YXJnZXQtYmVzdGJ1eS1jb3N0Y28tMTY1NTg2N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Holiday Return Policies for Walmart Best Buy Target and More,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/christmas-holiday-return-policies-walmart-target-bestbuy-costco-1655867 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9jaHJpc3RtYXMtaG9saWRheS1yZXR1cm4tcG9saWNpZXMtd2FsbWFydC10YXJnZXQtYmVzdGJ1eS1jb3N0Y28tMTY1NTg2N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vNzE3MDQwL3JlZGRpdC1zYXlzLXRoaXMtaXRlbS1hbG9uZS1pcy13b3J0aC10aGUtcHJpY2Utb2YtYS1jb3N0Y28tbWVtYmVyc2hpcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reddit Says This Item Alone Is Worth The Price Of A Costco Membership,"Reddit Says This Item Alone Is Worth The Price Of A Costco Membership

For some Costco shoppers paying an annual membership fee of $60 (at minimum per the website) is absolutely worth it to be able to enter the warehouse-style grocery store's hallowed halls. Though the fee is a sacrifice many find that they are promptly paid back based on the savings they sock away from Costco's great deals. From affordable food court meals to the store's famed $5 rotisserie chickens many tempting price points at the store give it a competitive edge.

Of course not everyone is convinced about Costco-induced savings which is apparently why one person took to Reddit to ask ""Is Costco worth it for a two person household?"" Their query was swiftly met with commentary from hundreds of other users. Most insisted that the membership fee is worthwhile for anyone and several said that's thanks to one particular product that stands out for its value both in terms of price and quality of life."

Top the building which dates to the 19th century is located only a few miles from the Queen’s country estate at Balmoral; above the interior design nods to Scottish heritage while loudly declaring its 21st-century attitude.

Located in Braemar only a few miles from the Queen’s country estate in Balmoral the 19th-century inn was acquired a few years ago by Swiss gallery owners Iwan and Manuela Wirth co-founders of Hauser & Wirth galleries. They gave the property a complete top-to-bottom renovation.

From top a bed designed for sleeping in; the Artist’s Studio makes an elegant venue for a Zoom call; the quirky bathrooms are an antidote to the overly bland designs that are de rigueur at many hotels.

The result is a 46-room refuge that feels like a boutique hotel albeit one dropped down in the midst of breathtaking landscapes. But the views aren’t just on the grounds or out the windows; they’re also on the walls. Taking advantage of their day jobs the Wirths have stippled the inn’s baroque décor with pieces by Lucian Freud Man Ray Louise Bourgeois and other artists.

Top﻿ a portrait of artist Timothy Behrens by Lucian Freud hangs in the lobby; above one of several spots to procure a quality cocktail.

But don’t worry: they’ve retained many of the period and local touches—from stags’ heads and antlers on the walls to tweed coats and kilts on the staff. The best touch of all however may be the Artist’s Studio. Perched at the top of the stone building it not only affords views of the Cairngorms a range of local mountains but makes you feel like you’re in a private garret as it draws on the life of Duncan Grant a local artist who became a leading member of the Bloomsbury Group. Along with other artists he transformed a nearby farmhouse into a live-in work of art by painting on the walls and doors. It’s a room that inspires and invites. And unlike Princess Diana you’ll actually find yourself longing to return to this part of Scotland.

Whether you love the royalty or not we can all agree: everyone loves holiday-themed romantic comedies. Now there's a royally wonderful movie that has just been released for viewing on multiple platforms and it's certain to leave everyone feeling warm and fuzzy like a pair of wool slippers.

Christmas with a Crown is director Dylan Pearce's spirited seasonal entrée that bears shades of Coming to America courtesy of the script by Michael Varrati. Pearce is no stranger to the rom-com as Christmas Cupcakes and A Frosty Affair (renamed from 40 Below and Falling) will attest while Varrati is the ahem seasoned veteran of writing contemporary holiday-viewing fare with a filmography that includes A Christmas Mission A Christmas in Vermont Broadcasting Christmas and A Christmas Reunion (coupled with genre variations such as Deathcember the 'Der Krampus' of TV's History of Fright).

In this fun frosty flick Cassie (Lisa Durupt) is a successful businesswoman who returns to her hometown and works to try to save its Christmas festival. One of the volunteers is a handsome stranger. It seems that Prince Nicolas (Marcus Rosner) is having a spot of bother with his royal family and its many obligations. He escapes to live for himself but can one ever escape their family especially around the holidays?

I digress.

Crown is still every bit the cinematic confection you'd expect it to be and should make for enjoyable viewing for those who would press ""play"" on something new as opposed to re-watching Janet Leigh and Robert Mitchum in The Holiday Affair. Add to that how Pearce brought the filming to Edmonton and around St. Albert thanks to Alberta's climate and Ryan's Castle. Located north of the Villeneuve Airport the luxurious bed and breakfast was the perfect location for shooting scenes with royal characters.

At least the castle was reliable Pearce explained.

""We were lucky we had snow. That was a big thing"" he recalled.

""As for the filming itself what was great was that Edmonton has always been a really film-friendly city. We worked with the ESIO [Edmonton Screen Industries Office]. They helped bring the film to life. We were able to make it Christmas on Whyte Ave. in the heart of the art space in Edmonton which was great too"" he added noting that the production team installed Christmas decorations at West Edmonton Mall which explains a lot of the confused looks on the faces of many shoppers early last spring.

For those and other reasons the movie should have a built-in audience around the capital region but Pearce was recently gifted a shout-out that brought it to the world’s attention too. TV’s The Late Show host Stephen Colbert joked about people’s holiday traditions which included a quick list of holiday films.

“That was quite a surprise. He's someone I watch all the time. Just to be poked a little bit by him is a dream come true. It was pretty pretty great” the director commented obviously pleased with the mention and certainly taking the road that no publicity is bad publicity.

“It was a wonderful experience for the cast and crew and now we have a fun quote with him calling our film a 'soon-to-be no doubt Christmas classic' with his satire behind it. I thought it was great.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm8uY28udWsvMjAyMS8xMi8yNi9hLXZlcnktYnJpdGlzaC1zY2FuZGFsLXdoZXJlLXdhcy1pdC1maWxtZWQtYW5kLWNhbi15b3UtdmlzaXQtaW52ZXJhcmF5LWNhc3RsZS0xNTgyNjgwMC_SAXpodHRwczovL21ldHJvLmNvLnVrLzIwMjEvMTIvMjYvYS12ZXJ5LWJyaXRpc2gtc2NhbmRhbC13aGVyZS13YXMtaXQtZmlsbWVkLWFuZC1jYW4teW91LXZpc2l0LWludmVyYXJheS1jYXN0bGUtMTU4MjY4MDAvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Very British Scandal: Where was it filmed and can you visit Inveraray Castle?,"Here’s everything you need to know (Picture: BBC/Getty)

A Very British Scandal kicked off tonight on BBC One and features some gorgeous scenery – here’s everything you need to know about the filming locations of the show.

The three-parter written by Sarah Phelps tells the rise and fall of Margaret Campbell Duchess of Argyll (Claire Foy) who was caught up in a very public divorce battle with her husband Ian Campbell (Paul Bettany).

Set in the 1960s it also provides a heap of gorgeous fashion and enviable parties all set against a stunning Scottish backdrop.

When Margaret makes the move up to Scotland she puts her energy into restoring the castle to its former glory persuading her beloved father to give her the money for the project.

But where was the show filmed and can you visit Inveraray Castle where the Duke and Duchess of Argyll lived?

Where was a Very British Scandal filmed?

A BBC statement stated filming took place ‘all across the UK’ but it mostly sticks to locations in Scotland and London.

Writer Sarah Phelps confirmed the bulk of filming was carried out at Inveraray Castle where the actual Duke and Duchess of Argyll lived together.

The castle sits close to Loch Fyne in the Scottish highlands making for a beautiful backdrop for the drama.

Speaking at a recent Q&A she told Metro.co.uk and other press: ‘The fact we were able to film and crews were able to turn up and film and as I believe it the current Duke and Duchess were extremely welcoming.’

Sarah even detailed the long-lasting impact of Margaret’s knack for interior design.

She continued: ‘When we told them what we were making like I think I’d probably paraphrase but I heard that they said “I think we’ve got bathrooms because of Margaret!”

Actress Claire went on to share how accommodating the current occupants were commenting: ‘They were really generous and really kind.’

They even shared an evening together in which some old stories were told about headline-hitting pair.

‘They were so generous there was no kind of dishing of the dirt or anything like that but there was a scrapbook of the front pages of the newspapers at that time that wasn’t done by her – which was ginormous – and they were awful front pages.’

The notorious couple also owned a swanky apartment in Mayfair where Foy was seen filming in June earlier this year.

Can you visit Inveraray Castle?

Yes you can visit the gorgeous location as it is indeed open to visitors however it is currently closed until March 28 2022.

Those who want to go and see the Castle for themselves can visit between six months next year with it keeping its doors open until October 31 2022.

Visitors can either opt to explore just the gardens or peek inside the Castle too.

Tours around the interior are also offered showcasing the dining room bedrooms history room and famous weapon room to guests.

Inveraray Castle may be familiar to fans of period dramas as it was also chosen as the location for the Downton Abbey Christmas 2012 episode acting as the fictional Duneagle Castle.

A Very British Scandal continues tomorrow at 9pm on BBC One.

RAVENNA Ky. — Chesapeake & Ohio 2-8-4 2716 will visit New England following its restoration the Kentucky Steam Heritage Corporation announced on Saturday.

Kentucky Steam has inked an agreement with the Railroad Museum of New England to bring the big main line steam locomotive to its Naugatuck Railroad in Connecticut at some point in the future for a months-long residency. The visit will kick off what is expected to be a year-long trip from its home base in Ravenna Ky. where it is currently being restored.

C&O 2716’s trip to Connecticut — which Kentucky Steam President Chris Campbell said could happen sometime in the middle part of the decade — would be the first visit of a main line steam locomotive to New England in more than a generation. Kentucky Steam said additional stops on its maiden tour would be announced at a later date.

“We’re pleased to be hosting C&O 2716 on our railroad as it will be the first large steam locomotive to operate in New England since (the 1970s)” said Howard Pincus chairman of RMNE. “It’s a wonderful opportunity to partner with a capable and visionary group like KSHC. Moving operational steam locomotives between heritage groups is quite common in Great Britain but has only been done a few times in the United States.”

While many small steam locomotives have operated in New England in recent decades visits by large main line steamers have been few and far between. In the 1960s and 1970s Nickel Plate Road 2-8-4 759 led excursions there for Steamtown and Ross Rowland’s High Iron Company. And in 1975 Reading Company 2101 lead the American Freedom Train all the way to Portland Maine. Since then the largest steam locomotive to grace New England’s main line rails has been Canadian Pacific 4-6-2 1201 which made a trek across northern Maine in 1989.

The exact dates of the visit have yet to be determined and officials said they would not be announced until certain restoration benchmarks had been met. However there were already plans in the works for excursions along the Naugatuck’s 19-mile line between Waterbury and Torrington Conn. and even photo freights.

Kentucky Steam has been restoring 2716 since 2015. The group also owns a 40-acre former CSX Transportation yard in Estill County Ky. where the work has been taking place. Campbell tells Railfan & Railroad that for the last few years the non-profit has been focusing on working on the shop facility itself. Now that a lot of that work has been completed they plan on focusing on the locomotive more which is about 30 percent done.

“We are several years off from making our way up east” he said. “But with announcements like this we hope people who have considered contributing to the restoration can see an end goal in sight. We are excited to get the engine fully operational and bring people to us in Kentucky. But we are equally as excited to get out on the road.”

Campbell said while Class I railroads including CSX and Norfolk Southern have been very generous to the non-profit it’s important to not simply rely or hope for chances to get out on their rails. He said that working with established short line and tourist operators will get 2716 in front of more people when the locomotive is again running.

Along with Saturday’s announcement KSHC is spearheading a fundraiser to secure $10000 for the locomotive’s restoration by the end of 2021. To make a project-dedicated tax-deductible donation to the locomotive’s rehab visit www.kentuckysteam.org/donate or by mail to Kentucky Steam Heritage Corporation 499 Kirkland Ave Irvine KY 40336.

Browsing Facebook marketplace and I came across a 2006 Acura CSX Premium (+ Navi) priced at $8995 with 177000 miles for sale in Turlock California (where Colin Kapernick went to HS btw.)

On the market for 25 weeks either the owner forgot to delete his ad after it sold or shoppers are put off buying a Canadian market car in California.

Here’s a screenshot of the listing and a gallery of photos.

The Acura CSX was a Canadian market subcompact that shares its chassis with the 2006-2011 North American Honda Civic. Differences between Civic and CSX include front and rear fascias K20 engine variants standard in both base CSX and CSX Type S (base Civics got SOHC R18s) slightly sportier suspension and available leather seating.

The CSX looked markedly better that Japan decided to use the CSX design language for their JDM Civic over USDM Civic.

This particular one for sale is a non-Type S but has that highly coveted K20 engine five speed manual and factory leather.

The K20Z2 under the hood of this CSX is comparable to the K20A3 found in base Acura RSXs. At 9.8:1 both share the same compression ratio and at 153 HP and 139 lb-ft share similar power ratings. CSX’s peak HP comes in 500 RPM earlier compared to RSX.

177000 miles seems a tad high but for a 15-year-old car it’s par for the course.

If I were in the market for a sporty four-door this CSX ticks off a lot of boxes.

K-series engines are timing chain so I’d ask if there are maintenance records indicating valve adjustments spark plugs and a water pump replacement at 100000 miles.

I’d of course look for any signs of leaks around and under the engine and thoroughly inspect mounts struts and bushings since all will likely be worn at that age.

At $9000 I looked at 2006-2011 Honda Civics and this Acura CSX is priced on the higher side of the used 8th gen Civic spectrum.

It might not be the spicier Civic Si engine found in the CSX Type S but it’s a high revving K-series engine installed from the factory with 40 more HP than the USDM Civic.

Add the added factory performance over a regular Civic and that leather seating and this CSX looks mighty enticing.

Which leaves the elephant in the room…

How is it legal to register and drive an Acura CSX from Canada in California (or any state in the United States?)

To be eligible to register a Canadian market vehicle in the United States (and California) it must meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS)and EPA/State emissions compliance ratings.

It’s legal to import and drive an Acura CSX in the United States including highly regulated California.

Since the Acura CSX is structurally similar to the USDM Civic and the fact that this is not the first Acura CSX I’ve seen for sale online in California it’s safe to assume the CSX probably passes FMVSS.

And if it’s not clear from under-the-hood markings you can probably obtain a letter of compliance from Acura of Canada/USA to the same effect.

As for EPA and California emissions Acura CSXs meet Tier II Low Emissions standards for both the EPA and California’s ARB (CARB.)

Here’s an emissions label from this Acura CSX for sale on Honda-Tech earlier last year.

With registration and emissions worries cleared up pulling the trigger on a CSX already here in the United States might be the move if you’re in the market for a sporty but practical sedan.",,,,,,

The best-on-ground performance in the teenage Test debut the personal qualities that made people speak of him as a future captain the rise to that position despite a century and more of entrenched Australian opposition to bowlers taking the job.

That interpretation though would be overlooking the long long wait after that teenage beginning when Cummins had played one Test but spent six years being denied the next the cycle of injuries whirring as endlessly as the exercise bikes on which he did another stint of rehabilitation. Your early 20s are supposed to be a time of impulsiveness and expression not of quiet dedication to a long-term goal.

Having observed that discipline though an age of karmic benevolence towards Cummins resumed. Almost free of injury since his Test return in 2017 he has continued rising and rising in the ranks of world players and the estimation of those watching. As it seems even his Covid suspension from the second Test of this series has worked out giving him a break in a packed schedule without the angst and argument that would otherwise have surrounded resting the Test captain. Twice in previous Ashes Cummins has got through all five Tests but none had such short turnarounds between matches across the whole series.

On his return on the first morning of the Boxing Day Test Cummins looked every bit the better for his break. He stood by while Joe Root called the coin incorrectly chose to bowl first on a cool cloudy morning that had just seen its last shower of rain and immediately immaculately locked on to an off-stump line with enough seam movement to threaten. Like any good mob boss Cummins doesn’t make threats that he isn’t prepared to carry out.

Haseeb Hameed has shown moments of composure to the adherents and moments of weakness to the doubters but his dismissal in the first over gave nothing to either playing a line that he had no choice but to play left by seam and bounce that took the edge. Bounce too did for Zak Crawley returning to the team slicing from the shoulder of the bat to gully as he tried to nudge leg side an innings of 12 runs in a year in which he has averaged 11.2. Then another perfect line adjusted for a left-hander took out Dawid Malan while his toasted cheese sandwich was being readied on the grill ending the only partnership that has offered England any stability in this series.

In that first session Australia’s other bowlers had been manageable. Mitchell Starc looked for swing found none and wandered down the leg side taken off after three overs. Scott Boland on debut was accurate and serviceable while Cameron Green and Nathan Lyon both had a bowl without much effect. Had the attack been rounded out by someone other than Cummins England might have got through. The middle session might have become a parade of batting incompetence but it was the opening session against his quality when they were undone.

All of the above was received with relish by a sizeable Melbourne crowd. The MCG’s usual Ashes threshold of 90000 shrank this year to just over 57000 not by any government mandate but by the choice of people to stay away during another pandemic surge. It was still a crowd that would dwarf most in world cricket but a reduction reflecting a city that remains battered and wary after a difficult couple of years.

A bit like Cummins Melbourne has been extremely fortunate in a way that doesn’t discount its own particular privations. Pandemic death rates have been low vaccination rates are high and this balance of elements was hard won by the long lockdowns that forestalled one while enabling the other. With isolation not required since October the people like those who filled the stands today have been happy to burst back into the world. Those who left them empty remain cautious of the twists that this story could yet take.

The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.

Which added some poignancy at the MCG especially from a hometown perspective. There were crowd roars and circular waves and some all-time incompetence from a pitch invader. There were beach balls and beers. And there were absences. An atmosphere ebullient but less than it might have been. A celebration against a well-founded background hum of anxiety. Trying to congregate in the way of the recent past felt like trying to claim closure for something that is not yet done. The tranches of empty seats told that story without a noise.

Still in some ways the rituals of a Boxing Day felt important. The early burst of rain the cold delay. The gradual gentling of a day into something approaching pleasantness. The packed lunches and the shouted greetings. And there were the strange new things like a fast-bowling captain throwing himself the ball for one more quick burst before the lunch break. Knocking through England’s only partnership of resistance. Showing us someone for who at least for the moment most things keep going very right.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL3RoZS1hc2hlcy0yMDIxLTIyL2FzaGVzLXBhdC1jdW1taW5zLXNheXMtaGUtd2FzLXJlYWxseS1hbmdyeS1hZnRlci1taXNzaW5nLWFkZWxhaWRlLXRlc3QtMjY3MDgwM9IBfmh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL3RoZS1hc2hlcy0yMDIxLTIyL2FzaGVzLXBhdC1jdW1taW5zLXNheXMtaGUtd2FzLXJlYWxseS1hbmdyeS1hZnRlci1taXNzaW5nLWFkZWxhaWRlLXRlc3QtMjY3MDgwMy9hbXAvMQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Ashes: Pat Cummins Says He Was ""Really Angry"" After Missing Adelaide Test","Australia captain Pat Cummins didn't know how to channelise his anger after a fellow diner turned out to be Covid positive forcing him to miss the second Ashes Test in Adelaide.

""There was no one to blame. Once it became apparent the state rules you have to follow them.""

Cummins had tested negative after a RT-PCR but was asked to isolate as per the Covid rules in South Australia thus forcing his withdrawal on the morning of the Adelaide Test.

""You abide by the protocols but there (was) hardly any Covid around so I didn't factor it in at all until the bloke popped up next to me and said he's positive.

""No one did anything wrong. The poor guy just flew to Adelaide to try and enjoy a couple of days of cricket - I felt really bad for him as well.""

Cummins' teammates Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon too would have missed the match as they were supposed to join him for dinner at the same restaurant but since the skipper didn't check his phone for 40 minutes the two dined separately.

""They walked in angry - they kicked up a stink and sat out the back"" he said of Lyon and Starc.

""It's just one player it's slightly bigger news because it's Covid and the captain but it's not the end of the world it's not a huge change.""

Cummins thought he would cope but once he saw the Test match unfold on TV he felt angry again.

Australia won the toss and chose to field. They had chosen to bat in each of the last 19 home Tests in which they had won the toss.

James Anderson is playing his 168th Test putting him in a tie for second place in the list of the most-capped Test cricketers:

Pat Cummins' dismissal of Haseeb Hameed was his 100th Test wicket in Australia the 20th bowler to take that many.

Scott Boland 32 became Australia's oldest specialist fast bowling Test debutant since Geoff Noblet who played his first Test against South Africa at Port Elizabeth in March 1950 when he was 33 years 170 days old.

Joe Root started the Test with a Test batting average of 50.01587. He was dismissed for exactly 50 meaning his average decreased to 50.01578.

It was his ninth score of at least 50 in Australia without a century which equalled Bruce Laird's record. He is still two short of the most 50s by any player in a visiting country without converting any to a century:

When Cummins uttered the word ‘we will bowl’ he had the entire bowling unit beaming with joy

Bowler captains are rare in international cricket now a days. Now if you count pace bowlers skippering sides it has become an endangered situation. So when Pat Cummins was appointed as Australia’s 47th Test captain there was a divide on whether it would take a toll on his game.

But the reality thus far has been far away from the expectations Cummins has not just helped Australia to a 1-0 lead in his first Test as a skipper but has continually shown the blueprint for success. On Sunday he was on point yet again after winning a crucial toss in Melbourne in front of a jubilant Australian crowd.

Be it his articulate comments pre-match regarding the prospect of playing Scott Boland be it his precise statement on protecting Jhye Richardson or be it his view on what Australia would do on an overcast day. Cummins has been bang-on with his choices on and off the field.

His understanding of the conditions was on point on the first day when he only gave Mitchell Starc a burst of four overs before Lunch. And as a bowler Cummins has been immaculate understanding the line and length required immediately. It was yet again visible in Melbourne when he bowled against the English openers – Zak Crawley and Haseeb Hameed.







Cummins’ twin dismissal definitely put Australia on top very early on in the proceedings but the awareness that the duo of Dawid Malan and Joe Root have the ability to turn the game away was crucial.

The battle with Joe Root that defined day one

“It is pretty much Joe Root or nothing for this English side” uttered the commentators when Root walked out to bat early on in the game. In 27 Test innings this year the English skipper has walked out 15 times within the first ten overs of an innings which shows the vulnerability of the English top-order.

And every time he has walked out early his task hasn’t been just to score runs but to take England out of the mess. Yet again in Melbourne he was handed the responsibility of rebuilding and at the same time take the scoring mantle. In three of the 14 innings Root has scored 228 186 62 and in three out of the other 11 innings he has scored above 30 runs.

Interestingly ahead of this clash as explored by Bharat Sundaresan Root practiced endlessly in the nets on the fourth stump channel. It was evident in the Melbourne clash but the best part was that Root wasn’t leaving deliveries outside off stump.



“Root would play at some shoulder arms to others and if slightly short play a forceful cut shot which isn't always his response to that length in Test cricket” wrote Bharat and that was evidently on display in Melbourne. Root only left five deliveries alone only five and yet he was in control over 72% of the deliveries that he batted against Australia.

Attack is the best form of defense and Root exercised that to perfection. But what Cummins did early during the innings showed how he is a proactive captain. Immediately once Root was in his early days at the crease the Australian skipper brought on all-rounder Cameron Green who in his first spell drew 16.6% false shots from the pair of Dawid Malan-Root.

When England were somewhat comfortable against pace Cummins introduced spin in a crucial passage of play which eventually led to the dismissal. Malan who looked comfortable during his stay was undone by Cummins showing how the bowling changes were impeccable.

Starc vs Root and the downfall

Post Lunch the Australian captain brought Mitchell Starc on and in just his third over the left-arm struck to send Root back. All the preparation prior to the match to tackle the ball outside the fourth stump channel went in vain as the No.4 chased the wide delivery off Starc’s bowling walking back scoring 50.



And when Starc-Lyon were rather ineffective against Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow Cummins reintroduced Green in a spell that changed the complexion of the encounter. In the second spell the all-rounder who has thus far in the series been very impressive with the ball struck and only conceded one run in four overs.

Cummins perfectly had the match-up prepared for every English batter as visible throughout the first day’s play. When Bairstow was going well the all-rounder reintroduced Starc into the attack a bowler against whom he has been dismissed nine times his most. Not just that the right-hander only averaged 14.33 against left-arm pacers which made it a perfect night for Cummins and his team.

Clever bowling changes tight field setups and immaculate captaincy later England were shot out for just 185 runs out of which Australia had already scored 61 by the close of play.

The Australian mini-fire display

In the 16 overs that Australia played late in the day it was evident that the surface had no demons in it. But perhaps a lot of demons that were caused earlier in the day for England were due to the fact that the conditions were overcast and not necessarily the pitch in the middle.

David Warner in particular took the attack to the English bowlers scoring a counter-attacking 42-ball 38 where he collected five boundaries with ease. Against Ollie Robinson and James Anderson Warner stepped down to negate the late swing and against Mark Wood he stepped back deep to counter the pace.

Marcus Harris who thus far had a torrid time with the bat showed signs of grit during his stay plucking away at the bowlers with a 51-ball 20 staying unbeaten at the close of the day’s play."
CVS,CVS Health,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2hlYWx0aC8yMDIxLzEyLzI1L2xvY2FsLXBoYXJtYWNpc3RzLWZpbGwtcHJlc2NyaXB0aW9uLXZvaWQtYXMtYmlnLWJyYW5kcy1sZWF2ZS1ydXJhbC1hcmVhcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Local pharmacists fill prescription void as big brands leave rural areas,"Bill Mather a pharmacist in the small Iowa city of Greenfield wanted to make sure his neighbors could fill their prescriptions without driving long distances or enduring long wait times.

So when pharmacy chains and big-box stores began expanding into rural markets he sold his drugstore in 2007 to Pamida a grocery chain owned by the Shopko department store company hoping that would keep his practice alive. Then in 2019 when Shopko declared bankruptcy shuttering more than 360 stores he and another Shopko pharmacist helped open a new drugstore for the city of about 2000 people.

Across the country pharmacists like Mather are filling the voids left when large drugstore chains and big-box stores with pharmacies pull out of small communities. In some areas pharmacists who were let go when big chains closed are now opening new drugstores often in the same locations. In other areas pharmacy owners from neighboring towns are opening new branches. Without them numerous communities would have been left with no pharmacy.

It didn’t used to be this way. Big-box stores like Shopko started to move aggressively into the pharmacy market 30 years ago hoping customers would fill their carts while the store filled their prescriptions. Large chains established beachheads in small towns by acquiring independent pharmacies or driving them out of business.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the number of pharmacists employed at big-box stores peaked at more than 31800 in 2012. But as online sales and mail delivery of consumer goods and prescription drugs grew the big-box stores had no reason to stay. By 2019 the number of big-box pharmacists had dropped to fewer than 18000. (The bureau no longer reports the number.)

“The big-box stores came into smaller and smaller communities and they in essence outcompeted all the other pharmacies in the area” said David Zgarrick a pharmacy professor at Northeastern University in Boston. “Now they’re completely gone and with them the pharmacy services and everything else they provided. They left a vacuum in a lot of these places.”

With CVS Health’s recent announcement that it will close 300 stores a year over the next three years more towns could lose another tier of pharmacies: the big drugstore chains. CVS has not yet said which stores will close.

“We’re considering a number of factors when making these decisions including local market dynamics population shifts store density and the needs of underserved communities” said Mike DeAngelis a CVS Health spokesperson. “In fact reaching underserved populations has been a priority for us all through the pandemic such as the access to testing and vaccines we’ve provided.”

Kathleen Bashur a spokesperson for the National Association of Chain Drug Stores said chain pharmacies of all types and sizes play a significant role in meeting the health and wellness needs of communities throughout the nation. “The decision to close a store is a difficult one” she said.

Zgarrick attributes much of the decline in big-box pharmacies to Amazon and other online merchants that undercut the profitability of their non-pharmacy sales. In the past big-box stores could treat pharmacies as loss leaders and make up that revenue with sales of other goods. Now Zgarrick said big-box stores have to ask tough questions about how to allocate their space: “‘At the end of the day how are we going to make the most money per square foot? Is it by having a pharmacy or by selling tires?’”

Nelson Lichtenstein a University of California-Santa Barbara history professor who has chronicled the rise of Walmart said big-box stores are constantly reevaluating their store locations closing less profitable stores and opening new ones in places where they think they can make money.

“They just keep a kind of slow churn” he said.

The cost of building a big-box store is about $10 million Lichtenstein said and such stores can net $200 million in annual revenue. Pulling out of a location is therefore not a huge loss for a big company if revenues falter.

“So they will shut down the stores and leave a devastated town because the Walmart put the other guys out of business” he said.

Walmart did not answer questions about its closures.

The growth in online options for all kinds of items spurred by people shopping from home during the COVID-19 pandemic has put more pressure on big-box stores.

“Now they’re less likely to do that roaming shopping than they were five years ago” said Adam Hartung a business strategy consultant with Spark Partners. “They’re not going to say ‘Oh let’s pick up a prescription and while we’re at it let’s walk through the store and look at vacuum cleaners.’ That doesn’t happen anymore.”

Hartung said that the U.S. retail market has an excess of shops by as much as 40 percent compared with other countries and that more big-box stores are likely to close in the coming years.

But closures provide opportunities for regional chains or pharmacists willing to strike out on their own.

In Orofino Idaho the mayor the chamber of commerce and many residents appealed to pharmacist Rod Arnzen after Shopko pulled out. So Arnzen began delivering to Orofino from his store 23 miles away in Kamiah. He then opened a branch in Orofino in the building left behind by the pharmacy that had previously sold its business to Shopko.

Andy Pottenger who owns a pharmacy 45 miles away in Lewiston Idaho added a second pharmacy in Orofino population about 3000 after receiving hundreds of responses to an ad he had placed in the local paper to gauge interest.

“It was overwhelming” he said. “That kind of cemented the idea that we should do it.”

In Montana Mike Matovich a third-generation pharmacist opened stores in Roundup and Hardin after Shopko closures there.

“It’s a pretty good-sized community and has a hospital and clinic in town” Matovich said of Roundup “and all of a sudden people are driving 50 miles one way to fill an antibiotic for a sick child.”

Matovich has seen what can happen when a rural community loses its only pharmacy.

“If there’s a hospital clinic and a pharmacy there they’re going to do fairly well” Matovich said. “Once you lose one or the other the communities start to struggle because people start leaving to be closer to health care.”

For the residents of Greenfield Iowa Shopko’s decision meant they had to scramble. Shopko had sold the pharmacy records to a Walgreens 50 miles away. Some people turned to the Hy-Vee grocery stores in the nearby Iowa cities of Atlantic or Winterset or to the Walmart in Creston — each at least a half-hour drive away. Others switched to mail order.

“It was sheer chaos” former Shopko pharmacist Rachel Hall said. “People were trying to figure out what to do where they should send their prescriptions.”

Mather Hall and the rest of the Greenfield staff were given just one week’s notice after being told they had nothing to worry about. Their pharmacy had been among the chain’s fastest-growing locations.

“We literally had trophies from Shopko that we threw away when we left” Hall said.

Former Shopko executives contacted by KHN declined interview requests. Shopko Optical which operates in 11 states said it is no longer affiliated in any way with Shopko Stores and declined to comment.

Mather and Hall didn’t want to give up on Greenfield. They reached out to NuCara a chain with 30 retail pharmacies across five states and it agreed to help them open a drugstore in their city.

NuCara opened pharmacies in two other communities that Shopko vacated. In the Minnesota cities of Cokato and North Branch NuCara partnered with pharmacists who had previously sold their pharmacies to Shopko said Brett Barker vice president of pharmacies for NuCara.

In Greenfield Hall and Mather were forbidden from telling customers about the new NuCara drugstore until Shopko officially closed its doors. Hall said Shopko management wanted to maintain the value of the customer files it was selling to Walgreens. So Hall and Mather asked the local chamber of commerce to get the word out.

They found temporary space at the local hospital which relocated its billing office to accommodate them. A year later they moved back into their former location in the old Shopko building leasing the space from new owners who were running a household goods store there.

After serving three generations of Greenfield customers Mather was relieved the town still had a pharmacy. But he couldn’t get past how Shopko had ended things.

“The way they slammed the door I was really unhappy about that” Mather said. “It wasn’t fair to all the people at the Greenfield pharmacy and the people of Greenfield. Shopko couldn’t have cared less.”

Yet the move brought Mather full circle. Greenfield still has a pharmacy just as when he started at Murdy Drug in 1968. It’s just a different storefront with a new name on the sign.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpbGl2ZS5jb20vY29yb25hdmlydXMvMjAyMS8xMi9maXJzdC1zdGF0ZS1ydW4tY292aWQtMTktdGVzdGluZy1zaXRlLXRvLW9wZW4tdGhpcy13ZWVrLWluLXN0YXBsZXRvbi5odG1s0gGDAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpbGl2ZS5jb20vY29yb25hdmlydXMvMjAyMS8xMi9maXJzdC1zdGF0ZS1ydW4tY292aWQtMTktdGVzdGluZy1zaXRlLXRvLW9wZW4tdGhpcy13ZWVrLWluLXN0YXBsZXRvbi5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First state-run COVID-19 testing site to open this week in Stapleton,"STATEN ISLAND N.Y. — A fixed state-run coronavirus (COVID-19) testing site is opening on Staten Island later this week for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020.

The testing site will open inside of the Central Family Life Center located at 59 Wright St. in Stapleton this Wednesday. Testing will be performed Monday through Saturday between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.

Appointments can be made beginning Monday by visiting the BioReference website. Walk-ins will also be available.

The Central Family Life Center will offer PCR testing upon opening and rapid tests will be offered within a few days of opening the state said.

In total Gov. Kathy Hochul announced 13 new testing sites across the state to help handle the increased demand for testing and rise in cases because of the rapidly spreading omicron variant.

“To get through this winter surge and protect New Yorkers we will use every tool at our disposal” Hochul said. “By mobilizing testing sites throughout the state we will make sure testing is more accessible and convenient for New Yorkers. We will continue to expand testing availability to every corner of the state evaluating where more capacity and additional sites are needed soon.”

Under the administration of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo the state has only opened pop-up COVID-19 testing sites on Staten Island despite repeated calls for a fixed testing location for borough residents.

Last week Hochul announced 40 mobile pop-up COVID-19 vaccination sites across New York state with four slated for New York City. However every borough is slated to get a site except Staten Island.

FEDERAL TESTING SITES TO OPEN IN NYC

President Joe Biden announced last week the federal government would open testing sites across the nation with the first opening in New York City. The president said the first locations would open before Christmas.

The first Centers for Disease Control (CDC) test site in the city – called the Increasing Community Access to Testing Team (ICATT) -- opened in Jackson Heights Queens on Wednesday and two additional sites will open Thursday in Flushing and East Elmhurst.

De Blasio said Wednesday that six ICATT testing sites would open citywide but did not specify where and when the additional locations would open.

“I’m sending a letter to FEMA today” said Sen. Chuck Schumer who spoke at Mayor Bill de Blasio’s Wednesday press briefing after receiving a key to the city. “Asking them for a hundred new mobile testing locations. We need these locations across the city.”

By next week the mobile units will provide an additional 25000 no-cost PCR tests per week to communities in need.

“We’re grateful for the ongoing support the Federal government has provided NYC during this pandemic to ensure we have the necessary resources to diagnose and treat this terrible virus” said NYC Health + Hospitals President and CEO Mitchell Katz.

“The impacts we’re seeing from the omicron variant is further proof that we’re not out of the woods with COVID-19 but the additional testing capacity provided by President Biden and the CDC allows us to detect more of the infection and help New Yorkers heal and stop the spread” Katz said.

Joseph Kitonga is a 24-year-old from Delaware County who aims to reinvent the way primary care is delivered to hourly workers who lack health insurance.

His primary care service Vitable LLC has gotten strong reviews from employers and workers in child care restaurants and home care for its high quality and convenience. The firm has already signed up 10000 people in its current markets of Southeastern Pennsylvania and Delaware.

“The best part of all that is they come to you because when you’re sick you really don’t want to go nowhere” said Elaine Green a Somerset Academy pre-school teacher in Philadelphia whose school uses the service.

Kitonga who emigrated from Kenya to the United States with his family when he was 13 founded primary care provider Vitable LLC in 2019 while studying computer engineering at Pennsylvania State University and has been winning technology accolades and millions from investors.

Last year Vitable went through the prestigious Silicon Valley technology start-up accelerator Y Combinator and Kitonga won a fellowship from billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel’s foundation. The fellowship includes $100000 over two years for young entrepreneurs who skip college or drop out to build a business.

Forbes recently named Kitonga one of its 30 entrepreneurs under 30 years old to watch in 2022.

Vitable headquartered in Woodlyn with a second office in Northern Liberties sells virtual and in-person primary and urgent-care services to small employers of hourly workers charging about $50 a month per employee. The company has gained a foothold in a competitive arena joining such tech titans as Amazon.com in aiming to eliminate inefficiencies and inconvenience in basic care.

For all the technology accolades Kitonga’s business has a human focus inspired by the health-care travails of employees at Hosana Home Health Care a Delaware County company that his parents started in 2012.

“At their small business hourly workers made too much to qualify for Medicaid too little to afford comprehensive health insurance so they were stuck uninsured and overutilizing the ER” Kitonga said. “Vitable is built to be their primary-care plan that is both affordable and accessible.”

Patient convenience

Vitable has been a hit at Somerset Academy a child-care center and preschool on West Girard Avenue near Eighth Street.

“You don’t want to go to the doctors’ office. You don’t want to be bothered” when you’re sick explained Green a veteran pre-school teacher who has worked at Somerset for two years. “That’s what I like. Anytime I have an issue or a problem they’re always prompt always call and they even check back later. I like that.”

On Dec. 17 a nurse practitioner Vicky Tubens-Lowa who works about eight hours a week for Vitable was at Somerset doing required annual physical exams for Green and other staff members. Somerset employs 22.

“We absolutely love Vitable” said Tiffany Chavous Somerset’s director recalling how Vitable came to her house to check her for strep throat. Chavous also received her physical from Tubens-Lowa on the 17th.

Vitable’s approach attracted a $1.6 million investment led by SoftBank’s Opportunity Fund early this year and Vitable announced in October that it received $7.2 million in venture capital to expand. The next market will be Baltimore in February Kitonga said.

Philadelphia’s First Round Capital contributed more than 80% of the latest investment in Vitable which employs 22 and uses about 50 nurse practitioners such as Tubens-Lowa as independent contractors to provide much of the care. Vitable did not disclose its annual revenue or profitability.

First Round partner Josh Kopelman who chairs The Inquirer’s board said it’s important for a start-up founder to have a deep understanding of the problem the company is trying to solve which in the case of Vitable is serving low-wage hourly employees who often have poor access to affordable health care.

“Joseph connects to this on so many levels” Kopelman said. “This isn’t someone who won a business plan competition with a random idea. This is someone who is connected deeply with the problem.”

Primary care as hot spot for innovation

But Vitable isn’t the only company tackling primary care. There’s been a flood of investment over the last 10 years in primary care and telehealth by start-ups and giants such as CVS Health Corp. which has primary care HealthHubs planned for stores nationwide. Plymouth Meeting’s Accolade started to help employees of large companies navigate health care providers this year paid $380 million for PlushCare Inc. an online primary care provider.

“Within primary care what’s happening today is that all the big tech firms like Amazon and many of the digital first start-ups are getting into primary care because it’s relatively safe to price in the risk and to manage the population” said Paddy Padmanabhan  CEO of Damo Consulting near Chicago which specializes in digital health care. He said primary care can be very profitable under these new models depending on the health of the population covered.

Padmanabhan noted that Vitable’s approach to primary care — at small employers — is at the opposite end of the market from Amazon Care which is trying to sign up large employers for its hybrid of virtual and in-person primary care. In-person visits are available in only some markets.

Kitonga and Kopelman said most primary-care start-ups are designed as a convenience for employees of large companies people who already have good access to health care services.

“That is obviously the most profitable segment of the market but they left the long tail of the market small businesses the hourly workers completely underserved” Kitonga said generally of the industry. “For me that’s where the interest lay where I wanted to build this service for my parents and their employees. I think that’s where the problem is yet to be solved.”

Vitable’s backbone is a software system Kitonga and his employees built that allows the company to control the “end-to-end experience” including the app for members the electronic medical record of visits and the dashboard for employers said Kitonga who dropped out of Penn State in January 2020 and turned down a job offer as a software engineer at Microsoft Corp. to focus on Vitable.

Consumers can reach Vitable by phone email or through a smartphone app. After that initial contact Vitable’s algorithms route the patient to “the most appropriate care setting whether it’s a quick virtual visit or an in-home visit. All that enables us to have same-day visits available for members” Kitonga said. The service is not available for people 65 and older because of Medicare rules Vitable said.

Nurse practitioners such as Tubens-Lowa who also works in an urgent care center notify Vitable of their availability in two-week blocks. “It gives you a lot of flexibility. I can give them as much or as little time as I have available” she said.

What Vitable does for employers

Olive Baimba president of Elite Care & Staffing LLC in Upper Darby was thrilled to learn about Vitable in September 2020. Her home-care workers were facing months-long delays — because of the havoc COVID-19 caused in health care — in getting the annual physicals required to work as a caregiver.

Elite’s human resources director learned about Vitable when a company nurse practitioner came to their office building to give physicals at another home-care company based there. Elite soon signed up for the service and now has a three-year contract covering 150 full-timers Baimba said. Elite employs more than 300 overall.

“When we signed up it blew my mind. It was amazing their quality of service” Baimba said..

Some employers see Vitable as an added benefit that can help retain and attract workers at a time of widespread labor shortages.

That’s why Jon Myerow founder and partner at Tria which has three restaurants in Center City buys the service for his 65 employees. Tria also offers traditional health insurance gradually paying a greater percentage of the premium as employees’ tenure increases he said.

“Vitable is good for people both with health insurance and without health insurance” Myerow said. “It offers health care with no deductible and it’s incredibly convenient because they have nurse practitioners that go to the employees’ homes or workplaces or do telehealth. I’ve seen people using it who have Cadillac plans just because of its convenience.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uai5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8xMi9yZXRhaWwtc3RvcmUtY2xvc2luZ3MtMjAyMS10aGUtbGlzdC1vZi1jaGFpbnMtdGhhdC1jbG9zZWQtc3RvcmVzLWluLW5qLWFuZC1uYXRpb253aWRlLXRoaXMteWVhci5odG1s0gGXAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5qLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzEyL3JldGFpbC1zdG9yZS1jbG9zaW5ncy0yMDIxLXRoZS1saXN0LW9mLWNoYWlucy10aGF0LWNsb3NlZC1zdG9yZXMtaW4tbmotYW5kLW5hdGlvbndpZGUtdGhpcy15ZWFyLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Retail store closings 2021: The list of chains that closed stores in N.J. and nationwide this year,"The past two years haven’t been very kind to an already hurting brick-and-mortar retail industry.

The retail apocalypse continues to hit big-box stores hard and many have struggled throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some have pivoted to e-commerce and online sales. Others announced permanent store closings or filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Here’s a look at the major retail chains that announced closings or shuttered stores permanently in 2021.

American Eagle

American Eagle Outfitters announced early this year it would close over 200 mall-based locations in the next three years. The company is planning to increase the footprint of its lingerie and activewear brand Aerie by about 50 stores.

There are currently 32 American Eagle locations and and 10 Aeries locations in New Jersey.

Banana Republic and Gap

Banana Republic’s parent company Gap Inc. announced in 2020 plans to close roughly 350 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America by the end of 2023.

Over 200 stores have been shuttered since the 2020 announcement as Gap Inc. aims increase its online sales and decrease its brick-and-mortar presence.

In 2021 the company announced plans to close 100 Gap and Banana Republic stores worldwide.

Bed Bath & Beyond

The home goods retailer closed three locations in New Jersey this year:

Howell (4075 Route 9)

Jersey City (400 Marin Blvd.)

Rockaway (202 Enterprise Dr.)

In 2020 Bed Bath & Beyond announced plans to close over 200 stores citing a decline in sales amid the pandemic.

The company is planning to launch a number of new store brands to lure younger customers. It currently has 36 New Jersey locations and over 800 stores worldwide.

DSW

Designer Brands Inc. DSW’s parent company identified about 65 stores that “would make sense to close” over the next four years CFO Jared Poff said earlier this year.

Fossil

In March Fossil revealed a $96 million loss for the previous fiscal year and announced the closure of up to 75 stores in 2021 because of the pandemic-related losses.

J.C. Penney

The company shuttered a number of stores in 2021 after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the spring of 2020.

The filing resulted in the announcement of plans to close about 30% of its brick-and-mortar stores before the end of 2021. Since then 175 JCPenney locations have been liquidated.

New Jersey’s 11 JCPenney stores were not affected.

There are currently 671 stores throughout the U.S. and Puerto Rico.

Justice

The tween girls’ fashion retailer closed its final brick-and-mortar spots in early 2021.

Kmart

Kmart closed two New Jersey stores in 2021. They were located in Belleville (411 Main St.) and Kearny (200 Passaic Ave.).

1095 Route 1 (Edison)

1701 Morris Ave (Union)

There are currently over 1400 Office Depot store locations.

Pep Boys

Pep Boys will shutter several New Jersey stores as part of its plan to close over 100 locations and shift the company out of retail operations. The company will focus on Pep Boys garages and tire outlets.

Numerous stores in New Jersey closed retail operations in 2021 including locations in Audubon Cherry Hill Marlton Parsipanny Stratford and Turnersville.

There are currently over 1000 throughout the United States and Puerto Rico.

Shoppers World

Shoppers World which was one of Hamilton Mall’s anchor stores quietly closed in October.

The Children’s Place

The Children’s Place announced plans to close 122 stores in 2021.

There are currently 30 The Children’s Place locations throughout the Garden State. It’s unknown which New Jersey locations will close if any.

Victoria’s Secret

The underwear lingerie and womenswear brand announced that it planned to permanently close between 30 to 50 stores in the United States and Canada in 2021.

Its parent company L Brands which also owns Bath & Body Works is currently working on a method to split from Victoria’s Secret making the womenswear brand its own separate company.

Delta flight 2790 departed from Tampa International Airport at 5:39 p.m. Thursday. During the flight Patricia Cornwall became unruly and injured passengers and Delta employees police said. When the plane landed at Hartsfield Jackson International Airport statements from flight passengers and visible evidence led police to detain Cornwall.

Police contacted the on-call FBI agent and officers moved Cornwall to the Atlanta Police Department precinct. FBI agents then took custody of Cornwall. No other information was released.

The extent of the injuries suffered by passengers and Delta flight employees was not released.

U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in November directed U.S. attorneys to prioritize the prosecution of federal crimes on commercial flights.

“The Department of Justice is committed to using its resources to do its part to prevent violence intimidation threats of violence and other criminal behavior that endangers the safety of passengers flight crews and flight attendants on commercial aircraft” Garland said in a news release.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL25ld3MvY2hpbmEvZGlwbG9tYWN5L2FydGljbGUvMzE2MTA4MC9jaGluYS1ib3VuZC1wYXNzZW5nZXJzLWxpbWJvLWFmdGVyLWZsaWdodC10dXJucy1iYWNrLXVuaXRlZNIBdWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL25ld3MvY2hpbmEvZGlwbG9tYWN5L2FydGljbGUvMzE2MTA4MC9jaGluYS1ib3VuZC1wYXNzZW5nZXJzLWxpbWJvLWFmdGVyLWZsaWdodC10dXJucy1iYWNrLXVuaXRlZA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China-bound passengers in limbo after flight turns back to US,"“Several China-bound flights have been delayed or canceled recently with one plane returning to the US after flying half of the journey” the Chinese consulate in San Francisco said in its Twitter-like WeChat account on Sunday.

A Chinese consulate in the United States has lodged a protest with an American airline after one of its China-bound flights returned to the US midway through the journey.

It also reminded travellers to China to monitor schedules for changes and ensure they had completed tests for boarding.

“The consulate will continue to urge US airlines to guarantee passengers’ legitimate rights and [travellers] not to travel to China unless necessary” it said.

“Please choose airlines with caution to ensure smooth travel.”

The consulate did not name the airline but a 23-year-old Chinese film studies student who would only identify herself as Runtu said she was aboard Delta Air Lines flight DL287 to Shanghai on Wednesday when it returned to Seattle six hours into the journey.

The pilot said the aircraft had to return because “China’s entry policy has temporarily changed and the health code of all persons on the flight cannot be authenticated” she said.

Runtu said the flight from Seattle had already been delayed for a day. She said she was told that it was cancelled on Tuesday because there was a delay in take-off and the crew could not work overtime.

A Delta Air Lines spokeswoman said on Sunday that flight 287 from Seattle to Shanghai returned to Seattle after “new procedures required at Shanghai Pudong International Airport were implemented while it was en route” to Shanghai.

“The new procedures require longer time on the ground than Delta is able to schedule there” the spokeswoman said adding the carrier was working to rebook customers on alternative flights.

An employee at Shanghai Pudong International Airport said the requirements for international flights remained unchanged in the past few days and the cancellation of the Delta flight was not related to the airport.

“Other flights arrived normally that day even some from the US” the staff member said.

Runtu said she was staying at a hotel arranged by the airline and was told that she might not be able to board another flight home until January 9.

She said there were a number of other Chinese students on the flight and they were concerned that re-entering the US could affect their visas.

They were also concerned about the need for further coronavirus tests to board rescheduled flights and whether their health codes to enter China would remain valid.

“I am just taking it one day at a time” Runtu said.

As of Saturday afternoon Delta Airlines United Airlines JetBlue Airways and American Airlines had canceled a combined 950 Saturday flights.

Delta Air Lines canceled 308 flights on Christmas Day and has already canceled 69 flights scheduled for Sunday.

Saturday's cancellations come after United Delta and JetBlue canceled 454 Christmas Eve flights.

Delta Air Lines canceled 173 flights for Christmas Eve. The airline says the ""flight cancellations are due to a combination of issues including but not limited to potential inclement weather in some areas and the impact of the omicron variant.""

""Delta teams have exhausted all options and resources -- including rerouting and substitutions of aircraft and crews to cover scheduled flying -- before canceling around 90 flights for Friday"" Delta said in a Friday statement to ABC News. ""We apologize to our customers for the delay in their holiday travel plans. Delta people are working hard to get them to where they need to be as quickly and as safely as possible on the next available flight.""

And it's not just Delta that's feeling the impact of the variant on crews.

As of Saturday afternoon United had canceled 240 Christmas Day flights and 85 flights scheduled for Sunday. It had canceled 201 flights on Christmas Eve.

""The nationwide spike in omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation"" United said in a statement on Friday. ""As a result we've unfortunately had to cancel some flights and are notifying impacted customers in advance of them coming to the airport.""

""We're sorry for the disruption and are working hard to rebook as many people as possible and get them on their way for the holidays"" the airline added.

JetBlue has canceled 123 Christmas Day flights due to COVID issues. It had canceled 80 flights Christmas Eve.

""Like many businesses and organizations we have seen an increasing number of sick calls from Omicron"" JetBlue said in a statement Friday. ""We entered the holiday season with the highest staffing levels we've had since the pandemic began and are using all resources available to us to cover our staffing needs. Despite our best efforts we've had to cancel a number of flights and additional flight cancellations and other delays remain a possibility as we see more Omicron community spread.""

Alaska Airlines has resorted to offering extra pay to their healthy employees who can work added shifts into this upcoming Christmas weekend.

The airline says they have had to cancel 10 Christmas Eve flights due to some of their employees quarantining after reporting that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

American Airlines canceled 88 flights on Christmas Day.

""Our operation has been running smoothly and unfortunately a number of COVID-related sick calls led us to make the difficult decision to precancel some flights scheduled for today"" a representative for American Airlines said in a statement to ABC News on Saturday. ""We proactively notified affected customers yesterday and are working hard to rebook them quickly. We never want to disappoint our customers and apologize for any disruptions to their holiday travel plans.""

Airlines for America the group that lobbies on behalf of all major U.S. airlines is calling on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to shorten the quarantine time for fully vaccinated individuals saying the omicron surge may create ""significant"" disruptions.

""The omicron surge may exacerbate personnel shortages and create significant disruptions to our workforce and operations"" Nick Calio A4A's CEO said in a letter on Thursday to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky.

Calio proposed the isolation period to be shortened to five days from symptom onset for breakthrough infections.

""In turn those individuals would be able to end isolation with an appropriate testing protocol"" Calio wrote.

The letter comes after Delta Air Lines and JetBlue Airways both A4A members also asked for isolation periods for fully vaccinated individuals to be shortened.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NuYXRpb25ub3cuY29tL3VzLW5ld3Mvd2F0Y2gtYnJhd2wtYnJlYWtzLW91dC1vbi1kZWx0YS1mbGlnaHQv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c25hdGlvbm5vdy5jb20vdXMtbmV3cy93YXRjaC1icmF3bC1icmVha3Mtb3V0LW9uLWRlbHRhLWZsaWdodC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Report: Men brawl on Delta flight then just walk away,"NEW YORK – AUGUST 24 : A Boeing 757-2Q8 operated by Delta Airlines takes off from JFK Airport on August 24 2019 (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images) (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)

LOS ANGELES (NewsNation Now) — Delta Air Lines said it is investigating after TMZ obtained a video of a brawl breaking out between two men on a flight just before Christmas.

According to TMZ the flight occurred on a late-night flight from Los Angeles to Memphis.

In the video you can see two men violently wrestle each other in the aisle before other passengers step in.

Delta Air Lines sent NewsNation the statement below:

“Delta is investigating this incident. Safety is always our No. 1 priority and while unruly passenger incidents are rare there is no place for them on our aircraft or in our airports.” Kate Modolo Corporate Communications AT Delta Air Lines

TMZ reports no police were at the gate and both men proceeded to baggage claim.

This is just the latest in a string of incidents in airports and aboard airplanes this year some ending with passengers taped to their seats or zip-tied and some with them escorted off planes before they take off.

Just weeks ago the TSA issued a stern warning to those who would behave disruptively or violently in airports across the country. Violence on planes has spiked in recent months notably during the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent mask mandates. The TSA said they would take away TSA pre-check to those that violated airport rules.

This year alone the Federal Aviation Administration has tallied at least 5553 unruly passenger reports. Of those 3998 were mask-related incident reports.

Earlier this year NewsNation followed flight attendants from Delta American and Southwest Airlines as they were training to deal with unruly passengers. The self-defense class offered by the TSA teaches footwork mechanics and a fighter’s mentality.

The Associated Press and NewsNation’s Sydney Kalich and Ileana Diaz contributed to this report."

Rogue planets do not orbit a star and exoplanet hunters have found few such planets in our galaxy.

The team used 20 years of data from several European Southern Observatory (ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT) the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) and the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope located in Chile along with other facilities to make the discovery.

“We did not know how many to expect and are excited to have found so many” says Núria Miret-Roig in a release. She is an astronomer at the Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Bordeaux France and the University of Vienna Austria and the first author of the study published last week in Nature Astronomy.

Our new paper was just published in @NatureAstronomy (@nmiretroig Bouy et al)! Punchline: we found ~100 free-floating planets in a single star-forming region! This roughly doubles the entire sample of known rogue planets. A threadhttps://t.co/CW7WgCNvda 1/ — Sean Raymond (@sraymond_astro) December 22 2021

The researchers found the rogue planets in a star-forming region located within the Scorpius and Ophiuchus constellations.

This image shows the locations of 115 potential rogue planets highlighted with red circles (ESO/N. Risinger) This image shows the locations of 115 potential rogue planets highlighted with red circles (ESO/N. Risinger)

“We measured the tiny motions the colours and luminosities of tens of millions of sources in a large area of the sky” explains Miret-Roig. “These measurements allowed us to securely identify the faintest objects in this region the rogue planets.”

The team notes that the exact number of rogue planets found is hard to pin down and the count is between 70 and 170. They add that by studying rogue planets we may find clues to how these mysterious objects were formed.

The study adds there could be many such starless planets yet to be discovered. “There could be several billions of these free-floating giant planets roaming freely in the Milky Way without a host star” explains Hervé Bouy an astronomer at the Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Bordeaux France and project leader of the new research.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL3lwL2Rpc2NvdmVyL3lvdXItdm9pY2UvbGV0dGVycy1lZGl0b3JzL2FydGljbGUvMzE2MDc2MC95b3VyLXZvaWNlLWhvdy1ob25nLWtvbmctc2hvdWxkLXRhY2tsZdIBcmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL3lwL2Rpc2NvdmVyL3lvdXItdm9pY2UvbGV0dGVycy1lZGl0b3JzL2FydGljbGUvMzE2MDc2MC95b3VyLXZvaWNlLWhvdy1ob25nLWtvbmctc2hvdWxkLXRhY2tsZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Your Voice: how Hong Kong should tackle wasteful plastic packaging,"Have something to say?

Plastic invasion – excessive packaging in supermarkets

Marcus Leung Cheuk-ming St Mark’s School

Looking at vegetables and fruit with layers of plastic wrapping at the supermarket I have asked “Why is there so much plastic?” This may be a common question children ask their parents at the supermarket. In fact it reflects a serious issue in Hong Kong and not enough people are paying attention.

People are keen on buying produce with plastic packaging possibly because they think it is cleaner or more high-end. Therefore supermarkets continue packaging their products in this way.

According to a joint statement from four green groups earlier this month – Green Power Greenpeace Green Earth and Greeners Action – Hong Kong sold nearly 200 million packs of food last year with enough plastic wrapping to circle the Earth twice.

Excessive plastic packaging is especially common in Hong Kong’s supermarkets. Photo: Edward Wong

Plastic waste harms the environment. For instance if animals consume it they may hurt themselves or even die which will then affect our food supply.

To protect the ecosystem and ourselves the government should set up laws that limit disposable plastic packaging. The police should cooperate with the Environment Bureau to enforce these laws. The Environment Bureau should also set up reward schemes for supermarket chains that create less plastic waste.

Companies must also move towards zero plastic packaging. Customers ought to bring their own containers to buy dry goods like nuts and rice. By encouraging this habit the demand for plastic packaging can be reduced. The government should also offer financial support to those shops.

As human beings we have the responsibility to protect the natural environment. With laws good enforcement reward schemes and clear goals there will be a beam of hope for us to save the world.

How to address the future of Hong Kong education

Angus Kong Ying Wa College

I am writing in response to Hong Kong’s secondary schools lose 4500 students and 1000 teachers in single year (South China Morning Post December 1).

This has sounded the alarm for our education system and the government should take immediate action. It has clearly been caused by the 2019 social unrest and recent implementation of the National Security Law.

There is no way for the government to solve the current situation except by gaining back the trust of the people. However there are still some steps the government can take to reduce the impact of this emigration drain.

As people leave Hong Kong the city’s schools are facing high numbers of students and teachers who are leaving. Photo: K.Y. Cheng

The Education Bureau could start reducing the number of classes in schools or if possible closing some of the schools with a low number of students. This would centralise the government’s resources to be used in a more cost-effective manner.

Moreover the government should encourage more people to join the education sector by subsidising related university courses. This can create experienced teachers to replace the ones leaving Hong Kong.

Education is the most powerful weapon we can use to change the world. The government must face the current brain drain in our education system to protect the future of this city.

What to do if you see a wild boar

Chan Yuen-tung Tsuen Wan Government Secondary School

Like many other wild animals wild boars are strong and fast. But they will only attack if they are cornered or if they feel threatened. Wild boar attacks on people are rare. However wild boars are common in Hong Kong especially in countryside areas.

Hong Kong authorities have recently decided to capture and put down wild boars roaming urban areas after a police officer was bitten by one.

Wild boars only attack if they feel threatened. Photo: Edmond So

What should we do if we see a wild boar? Although we might be scared we should keep calm stay away and leave them undisturbed.

Wild pigs are wary of human contact. However if provoked or threatened they may become aggressive so we should be careful when we see them.

Help Hong Kong’s stressed and depressed students

Liang Tsz-to Tsuen Wan Government Secondary School

Nearly all Hong Kong students suffer from stress or depression because of school.

When exams are approaching teachers give students a large amount of material and notes for revisions. They only get a few days to revise everything. Some students might be too strict with themselves and they might worry that their parents will scold them if they do poorly.

Most schools divide students into elite classes and regular classes. Elite students receive better resources which is unfair to normal students. This system can undermine students’ confidence. If they cannot join the elite classes they might feel like they are rubbish which can cause more anxiety.

Students in Hong Kong are often quite stressed by the Diploma of Secondary Education exams. Photo: Sam Tsang

Schools should abolish the elite system and make education fair for all students. Teachers should teach lessons more quickly to ensure students have enough time to study. Parents should not criticise and pressure their children too much. Instead they need to give support and encouragement.

Students can address this problem by staying upbeat and asking for help when they struggle with their studies. They can also find ways to relax by reading a book or having a warming cup of tea.

I have felt fatigued insecure and depressed – I wanted to give up. But I turned to my favourite hobby and watched an inspirational film called Good Will Hunting (1997). This motivated me to get through the problems I was facing.",,,,,,,,,

At least in terms of the cloying view of Christmas presented in the songs we have been hearing in stores and on the radio since before Halloween decorations were stored in the basement.

I suggest — fully aware of the cynical undertones of my proposal — that we need some new secular Christmas melodies that reflect the world we now live in rather than the long-gone world represented in many traditional holiday songs.

For instance Meredith Wilson’s 70-year-old song has become a classic Christmas song but the imagery from 1951 doesn’t ring true today.

It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas

Everywhere you go

Take a look at the five and ten it’s glistening once again

With candy canes and silver lanes that glow

Five and ten? Since today’s prices are 10.69 times higher than average prices since 1951 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer price index a Dollar General store would provide a better image for Christmas shoppers. In reality though a modern-day Meredith would be writing about Amazon or Walmart as shopping bastions.

A pair of Hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots

Is the wish of Barney and Ben

A pistol that shoots? If Barney and Ben received a toy “pistol that shoots” today they risk being reported by nervous neighbors to law enforcement whose jumpy officers might draw a bead on them with their own 9mm Glocks. In these dangerous times Barney and Ben better ask for a Nerf Elite 2.0 Commander RD-6 a toy that could not be mistaken for a real weapon.

Dolls that’ll talk and will go for a walk

Is the hope of Janice and Jen

Dolls for Janice and Jen? Nowadays Janice and Jen are likely to ask Santa for a “pistol that shoots” and Barney and Ben would not be out of line to request “Dolls that’ll talk and will go for a walk.” Gender roles and stereotypes have thank goodness evolved since the post-WWII ‘50s.

There’s a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well

It’s the sturdy kind that doesn’t mind the snow

A tree in the Grand Hotel? In 2021 it is likely the glistening tree in the “Grand Hotel” is a pre-lit petroleum-based artificial evergreen adorning the sterile lobby of a Country Inn and Suites property nestled next to an interstate highway interchange.

That doesn’t mind the snow? Snow is becoming a dissipating commodity in our region it seems especially at Christmas time. According to records from the National Weather Service Harrisburg has not had an official white Christmas — at least 1 inch of snow on the ground on the morning of Dec. 25 — since 2002 when the area received 8 inches of the fluffy stuff from the clouds. We can ascribe the brown-ground Christmas mornings to global warming/climate change a phenomenon still being disputed by many anti-science types despite published warnings from Swedish physicist chemist and Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius in 1896.

“The Christmas Song” by Nat King Cole; “Most Wonderful Time of the Year” by Andy Williams; “Have A Holly Jolly Christmas” by Burl Ives. We become so wrapped up in the unreal worlds proffered by these and other songs that we are enticed to overlook the real challenges confronting us in 2021 and the opportunities to make the Nativity angels’ proclamation of “peace on Earth goodwill to men” something more than a greeting card catchphrase.

If we believed in goodwill for all people we would not have 38 million people including 12 million children in the United States experiencing food insecurity. Our citizenry would be demanding a fair living wage for all workers. We would be voting out those elected officials whose allegiance is to exploitative big businesses rather than to their hungry constituents and their families. There would be plenty of “homemade pumpkin pies” on every table in the nation.

If we felt genuine Christmas compassion we would not have 580466 people experiencing homelessness in America; these folks would instead be residing in safe clean affordable abodes not in cardboard hovels in alleys. People living out the true Christmas spirit would refute the Scrooge-like “Let’em get a job” or “They’ve made their choice to live on the streets” comments cast down by so many folks living in comfortable homes.

If we citizens desire peace on Earth we would respond to the 21570 murders in the country last year. “It is the largest increase in 100 years” Robert Anderson chief of the mortality statistics branch at National Center for Health Statistics said when referring to the FBI report showing a 30 percent increase in homicides the U.S. from 2019 to 2020.

With 7.9 billion people peace on Earth might be a pipe dream but peace in the United States is not an unreachable goal. Those who seek peace need to raise voices and votes to rid our legislators who are beholden to the undue influence of gun lobbyists and financed by ill-informed misled Second Amendment apologists.

If peace and goodwill are to be more than a slogan on a paid store advertisement in a newspaper or pop-up online ad our nation would be promoting and upholding the dignity of all humankind. We would be welcoming immigrants to share the bounty and freedoms of our nations. Whites and blacks and browns and reds and rainbows would all be treated fairly and respectfully in our communities. Elders would be esteemed and youngsters would live free of abuse.

While decorated trees flying reindeer perilous gift shopping excursions and an overweight hirsute elf receive much of the holiday adulation we should not forget that Christmas is at its heart a religious commemoration for Christians the birth of Jesus the Christ. For believers Christmas is much more than a time that represents on average 19 percent of retail sales for a year.

The real gift at Christmas is not something we give; it is what we receive through our faith in the Babe in a manger. For Christians and frankly for many other religious followers whose doctrinal tenets often mirror those of Christianity the gift from the Christ offers the freedom to follow in Jesus’ footsteps and emulate him in how we live with others.

Christmas celebrates the beginning of Jesus’ life; it is near the end of Jesus’ life that his adherents receive their instructions: “… for I was hungry and you gave me food I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink I was a stranger and you welcomed me I was naked and you gave me clothing I was sick and you took care of me I was in prison and you visited me.” (Matthew 25:35-36 [NRSV]).

Feeding Welcoming Clothing Healing Visiting Loving — these are the gifts we should be giving if we live fully and intentionally in the Spirit of Christmas.

These too are the endowments our country must provide to all its inhabitants if we are to uphold the principles of our Founding Fathers’ intentions: “We hold these truths to be self-evident that all [people] are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”

The Babe born in a stable came also to provide a way to true life true liberty and true happiness. We as Christians and/or U.S. citizens and/or human beings must pass on these gifts too.

And the thing that’ll make ’em ring is the carol that you sing

Right within your heart

Meredith Wilson got that one right.

Merry Christmas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd2Noc3R2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3Nob3BwZXJzLWRpc2FwcG9pbnRlZC1pbi1zYWxlcy10aGUtZGF5LWFmdGVyLWNocmlzdG1hc9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd2Noc3R2LmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9zaG9wcGVycy1kaXNhcHBvaW50ZWQtaW4tc2FsZXMtdGhlLWRheS1hZnRlci1jaHJpc3RtYXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shoppers disappointed in sales the day after Christmas,"While some people continued celebrating the holidays with family and friends Sunday others spent the day shopping for deals.

December 26 is one of the biggest shopping days of the year behind Black Friday and a few other days in December.



Elizabeth and Shawna Fordyce came down from Parkersburg to shop in Charleston. They said they're not seeing as many sales and deals as they're used to seeing the day after Christmas.

""There are no sales out. Every store we've went to the shelves are cleared"" Elizabeth Fordyce said. ""We do this every year. We go and shop at stores. We've been to Family Dollar Dollar General. We've been to the mall. We've been to the pet shop. We went to Bath and Body Works. Everywhere is out of sales. There's nothing there like there always is.""



The ongoing global supply chain problems may be a reason for some of those empty shelves. that 90 import container ships were waiting to unload in Los Angeles just days before Christmas.

The already limited inventory may have sold out quickly at some stores.

""I don't think they were getting as much as they thought they would before Christmas"" Fordyce said. ""So now they don't have stuff to sell after Christmas cause it's already gone.""

Approximately nearly 18 months since the Caribbean Community (Caricom) member states were first disrupted by the novel coronavirus pandemic we can now look back and examine the lessons learnt from surviving the catastrophic human social economic and political losses.

As we go through the Christmas season there is one more lesson we need to examine. As consumers of food clothing technology and other essentials — which we import predominantly from the United States of the America — we must acknowledge that things have now significantly changed and will impact our extra-regional purchases. The US prices of these goods have increased substantially due to several factors associated with global supply chains and shipping.

You may ask what does this have to do with our existence here in the Caribbean? I would argue it has to do with everything we require because we do not produce the gadgets tools equipment household items toys and processed foods that we consume on a daily basis. Instead they arrive at our seaports aboard massive cargo ships holding hundreds of 40 feet (12 metre) cargo containers stacked 10 to 12 containers vertically sometimes resembling my toddler’s Lego bricks from a distance.

Unfortunately the usual calm and pristine Caribbean Sea will be faced with further turbulent waters as the container ships will not laden the water and sail effortlessly into our regional ports but instead there will be heralded by significant delays and cancellation of orders. Christmas barrels decorations household items food and toys will not arrive at their intended destinations in time for the start of the season. After all popular US retailers Walmart Target Costco Ikea Bed Bath and Beyond and Dollar Tree to name a few have reported the impending delays and battles with the delayed shipments stuck at choke points across the country.

In a world in which crisis managers troubleshoot on a daily basis the apparent solution is the investment into chartering cargo vessels to deliver containers from Asia to the US terminals. After all the goods within container ships stuck outside major ports are of little value to the retailers unless they are offloaded and processed in a timely fashion which would allow the retailers to recoup losses and earn a profit during the holiday season.

According to a senior director at Gartner a Stamford Connecticut-based technology research and consulting company “We’ve seen disruption on top of disruption on top of disruption and we’re not able to mend the networks before the next disruption comes.” Delays have been caused by several occurrences. A representative from Dollar Tree Inc indicated that one cargo ship was delayed for two months due to a crew member testing positive for the novel coronavirus. Let us not forget the extreme weather patterns equipment shortages and unpredictable US-Chinese trade relations which immediately impact the global supply chains responsible for everything we use from food and fashion to drinks and diapers. On top of these challenges the company budgets for container shipping costs have not doubled but in some instances they have jumped to 150 per cent increase.

Now let it be known that the world witnessed for the first time ever what Steve Ferreira of shipping consultancy Ocean Audit has labelled “Containergeddon” with at least 60 container ships filled with items valued billions of dollars stuck outside of major US seaports of Los Angeles and Long Beach (together comprising US entry points for 40 per cent of imported goods) waiting to unload for days on end which is a major disruption unlike pre-pandemic times in which there was hardly any backlog of the major ships.

So what is the solution?

Walmart repurposed and chartered a former dry bulk cargo ship amongst other vessels with the aim of “bypassing log-jammed ports and secure scarce ship space”. The solution of chartering the ships can speed up the delivery of critical goods in a timely fashion to the mainland US. In the spirit of innovation and due to the unavailability of traditional 40-foot containers Walmart started to utilise 53-foot containers that are mainly used inland in the US. These large containers require specialised cranes to assist with the off-loading and become more labour intense. But the chartering of these ships is not a cheap solution since a monthly cargo charter costs major US retailers between US$1 million to $2 million and rising in cost dependent on the number of rented containers which could range between 500 and 1500 containers monthly.

Having read the state of play in the US the reality hits home to us in the Caribbean because we purchase hundreds of items from the popular US retailers as well as online from Amazon. We must now confront the reality that their challenges will exacerbate the challenges confronting our local retail industries and inevitably local consumers. Our solutions will not be as immediate but the time has now come for us in the Caribbean to think about expanding our seaports to achieve greater efficiency and increased movement to ensure there is space for the storage of containers consulting with the trade unions to ensure that port operations eventually become 24/7 similar to the Asian ports of origins.

In addition we must start to think and act as a collective where we source products from our regional and even indigenous markets. Furthermore as a region we should explore chartered joint cargo shipments directly from Asian to Kingston Wharves and then disseminated across the region. These are but a few thoughts to chart our path forward.

As the weather grows increasingly colder more and more folks are looking for that one perfect outdoor accessory to keep them warm while not acting as an eyesore. And ever since last year we’ve seen one popular backyard addition sell out at rapid rates: firepits. If your bookmarked picks are flying off the shelves worry not. Amanda Seyfried just introduced us to an in-stock option—and the best part? It’s on sale.

Bonfire Fire Pit Solo Stove ($249) Shop

After noticing the actor’s cozy setup on her Instagram Stories we discovered that she opted for Solo Stove’s best-selling Bonfire model. Smoke- and ashless the Bonfire uses strategically placed holes in the pit’s base to suck in air and create a strong flame resulting in hardly any cleanup. Not to mention the lack of smoke makes it easy on the lungs and eyes.

Unlike other similar products the Bonfire is portable (it only weighs 20 pounds) so it can be easily moved from spot to spot if you want to shift locations halfway through the evening. It wasn’t clear whether or not Seyfried toasted any tasty treats but if you’re in the mood Solo also sells stainless steel roasting sticks for all your marshmallow and hot dog needs.

After almost two years of getting very intimate with the pros and cons of our spaces renters and homeowners alike seem to be finally starting to design for themselves rather than just for the potential resale value (or in some cases the ever-important security deposit). Instead of universally appealing white kitchen cabinets or neutral upholstery the most popular @dominomag Instagram posts in 2021 showcase designers putting a twist on a classic painting the exterior of a traditional farmhouse black and wallpapering a powder room in a bold citrus print.

These spaces’ innovative layouts and color combinations alone offer enough ideas to fill 10 houses but we were just looking to design one ultimate place. Here we’ve gathered our most-liked photos by room to build your 2022 dream home. Keep reading for a tour.

The Exterior

It’s clear that the dark exterior trend isn’t going anywhere quite yet because for the second year in a row your dream house is black. Megan and Dustin Moon’s modern farmhouse clad in fiber cement board siding is complete with massive windows flooding the Kalamazoo Michigan property with light at all times of the day.

The Hallway

The most important element to any mudroom is storage. This entry in Clinton Corners New York by designer Lori Paranjape features plenty of open shelving for jackets and bags and durable brick floors (original to the home) that can stand up to muddy footprints. “No one comes over and feels like they shouldn’t put a glass down because they’re going to ruin an antique” she points out.

The Kitchen

It’s all about the little innovative details in your kitchen of choice. The chic doggie door in this space in Atlanta designed by Sherry Hart and Ladisic Fine Homes is so much better than the usual plastic flap—and it blends right in with the rest of the steel-framed entrance.

The Living Room

The living room in Patricia Nogueira’s Bay Area rental looks warm and layered now but she moved in during the pandemic with just a few lamps and her bed. Everything else she sold in a socially distanced garage sale raking in an impressive $4000 to put toward the new pieces.

The Dining Room

This year you opted for the fresh white walls and cane furniture in Jessie Bloede’s Austin new build. (A far cry from 2020 when the favorite dining room was a pastel pink wonderland.) Low-key materials can pack just as big a punch in unusual silhouettes like the tiered rattan chandelier overhead.

The Main Bedroom

The best kinds of closets are also pretty to look at. Take a cue from the mint green and cane custom doors in model Zippora Seven and photographer Terence Connors’s Montauk New York cottage.

The Bathroom

Latham Thomas grew up in a traditional museum-like house—so she went for the total opposite vibe in her Brooklyn home. Case in point: the vibrant powder room. A statement citrus-print wallpaper with coordinating tangerine-colored mirror enamored you at first glance.

The Kids’ Room

Bunk beds can excite grown-ups too. Just ask Josh and Jenna who decked out their daughters’ space with a bespoke design featuring three beds (one is just out of view to the right) and sneaky drawers underneath.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBhaWduaW5kaWEuaW4vdmlkZW8vZG9taW5vcy1hbmQtYS1ncm91cC1vZi1jaGlsZHJlbi1saWdodC11cC1jaHJpc3RtYXMvNDc0ODUz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Domino's and a group of children light up Christmas | The Work,"Domino’s Pizza rolled out a film for Christmas which was conceptualised by Enormous Brands.

The film opens with a man having a conversation with his son on the phone. He's disheartened to learn that his child won't be visiting him for Christmas for the second year in a row. This is followed by a group of children in his neighbourhood arriving at his door excitedly to wish him Merry Christmas. The man reacts angrily and tells them to celebrate with their parents. The children get back to one of their houses where there are pizzas from Domino's. Before eating the pizzas the friends decide to take a slice and use the toppings to make it look like a Christmas decoration. The man looks at it and decides to join in on the Christmas fun by getting his Santa Claus attire out and calling out to the children to celebrate the festival.

Sandeep Anand EVP and chief marketing officer Domino’s Pizza India said “Domino’s brand spirit lies in enjoying fun moments with friends and family. In line with this thought we are releasing this ad film rekindling the spirit of sharing after such difficult times of the pandemic that we have all lived with. In the spirit of happiness and kindness we share this as we ring in Christmas and New Year with a hope of better tomorrow.”

Ashish Khazanchi managing partner Enormous Brands said “Through this communication we want to display the fact that even little gestures can help brighten someone’s Christmas. Innocence can even be a slice made up like a Christmas tree. Innocence has the power to bring happiness back into our lives something Domino’s Pizza has always stood for.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd2R3bnQuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvcGhvdG9zLW5ldy1hcmVhLW9mLXRveS1zdG9yeS1tYW5pYS1xdWV1ZS11bnZlaWxlZC1hdC1kaXNuZXlzLWhvbGx5d29vZC1zdHVkaW9zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PHOTOS: Problematic Fire Door Replaced with Themed Wall at Toy Story Mania in Disney's Hollywood Studios,"During our latest ride of Toy Story Mania at Disney’s Hollywood Studios we noticed a few changes in the queue line.

You may recall a period where a portion of the Toy Story Mania queue had to be closed due to problems with the roll-down fire door between the original queue and the portion added for Toy Story Land in 2018.

Rather than have a roll-down door two themed doorways and a wall of dominos with small windows have been added.

Evergrande is the world’s most indebted property developer with over $300 billion in liabilities. It is struggling to repay bondholders banks suppliers and deliver homes to buyers epitomizing a bloated industry suffering from the Chinese government’s deleveraging campaign.

Company chairman Hui Ka Yan stressed during a meeting on Sunday that no one at Evergrande would be allowed to “lie flat” urging employees to fight day and night so that sales can be resumed and debts repaid Evergrande said in a statement.

“With the company resuming construction work at full steam the group plans to deliver 115 projects in December” Hui said in the statement. “With five days left this month we must go all out to ensure we meet the goal of delivering 39000 units this month.”

His pledge came a day after China’s top real estate regulator told the official Xinhua News Agency the government would resolutely tackle risks stemming from overdue delivery of residential properties by some top developers.

Also on Saturday China’s central bank said it would safeguard the legal rights of home buyers.

The statement said Evergrande had resumed cooperation with more than 80% of decoration companies and long-term suppliers having signed 6869 contracts with material suppliers.

The Chinese government has in recent months marginally eased property financing to prevent a hard landing of the sector but has not reversed its property curbs designed to reduce leverage and discourage speculation.

Saunders

Reflecting on the past year in these last days of 2021 I’m reminded of the lines of a poem by Pam Brown: “On a most ordinary day something wonderful can happen. Out of the commonplace may come the sight of something remarkable. …These are no ordinary days.”

Indeed this has been no ordinary year for UWF. Record enrollment record gifts and national recognitions inspired us to reach for the remarkable.

January gave us the opportunity to distribute $10 million in funding to area businesses through our Industry Resilience and Diversification Fund with a goal of creating jobs in Northwest Florida. Our online programs were ranked among the best by U.S. News & World Report.

Sweet news in February showed UWF’s School of Nursing exceeded state and national averages for 2020 by wide margins as 95.97% of its graduates passed the National Council Licensure Examination - Registered Nurses on their first attempt. UWF surpassed the national average for first-time pass rate by over five percentage points and exceeded the state mark by nearly 10 points. And once again we were named a Gold-level Military Friendly School in the annual Military Friendly Schools list for 2021-2022 the only large public school in Florida to earn the gold distinction.

We continued our march in March toward the creation of Florida’s CyberCoast with the launch of CyberSuccess a program to prepare veterans for the cybersecurity workforce sponsored by Regions Foundation. Our gorgeous 1600-acre campus in Pensacola earned its second consecutive recognition by the Arbor Day Foundation as a Tree Campus Higher Education.

April showered us with gifts when our annual Day of Giving surpassed its goals with 1170 individual donors. MilitaryFriendly.com marked us as a Military Friendly Spouse School another nod to the fine work we do with all our military-affiliated students. Not to be left out for bringing home the gold our spirited cheerleading team captured a national championship at the NCA College Nationals.

It did my heart good in May to celebrate graduation in person again at the Spring 2021 commencement at Blue Wahoos Stadium where Sen. Doug Broxson gave a warm address to the graduates.

More recognition arrived in June when UWF led the state in highest percentage of bachelor’s graduates employed one year after graduation. Our Bachelor of Arts in Legal Studies program ranked No. 1 by Best Value Schools.

Summer outreach hit a peak in July when the UWF Center for Cybersecurity gave Cadette Girl Scouts a unique opportunity to earn three badges through one of its GenCyber summer camps. UWF joined other local organizations in partnering with Autism Pensacola Inc. to bring Sensory Street to downtown Historic Pensacola.

Florida’s SBDC network housed at UWF celebrated 45 years of service helping small businesses in August and the Chemistry Scholars program was awarded the 2021 Inspiring Programs in STEM Award from INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine. Later that month I traveled to Miami to join my friend President Madeline Pumariega of Miami Dade College in signing a partnership to enhance cybersecurity workforce development in the state.

You could feel the love in September when we announced a historic gift from the late Dr. Herman and Valerie Rolfs through their estate. The donation which created the Dr. Grier Williams School of Music and included an Imperial Bösendorfer piano is valued at over $8.5 million. As a result every music student and Argo Athletic Band member at UWF will have access to a scholarship.

We were again recognized as a Top Public School in the South by U.S. News & World Report and again named a “Great College to Work For.” A sixth national excellence in diversity award reinforced our efforts toward inclusion as a key factor of our success.

A virtual simulation system at the UWF Center for Behavior Analysis provided hands-on training for local law enforcement agencies and UWF’s Army ROTC cadets in October. The VirTra 300 LE firearms training simulator is a virtual reality system designed to incorporate applied behavior analysis to real-time situations.

We were truly thankful in November when three of our athletic programs football soccer and volleyball brought home conference championships raising UWF’s total to 103. The UWF Cyber Club placed in the top two in a regional competition outranking prestigious cyber programs from the University of Central Florida and Auburn University among others. UWF junior Ashton Reichard earned gold in the prestigious nationwide Japanese Learning Inspired Vision and Engagement Talk competition.

An early holiday gift in December came in the form of a $3 million National Security Agency grant to expand the National Cybersecurity Workforce Development Program. I was delighted to confer a degree to Taher Ragooy the first graduate of UWF’s doctoral program in intelligent systems and robotics. Ken Ford founder and CEO of our program partner Institute for Human & Machine Cognition was on hand to hood the recipient.

At year’s end the Florida Board of Governors voted to extend my contract and that made me very happy. It’s an honor to be your president.

The Michigan Public Service Commission has approved a build-transfer agreement between Consumers Energy and Delaware-based Heartland Farms Wind Project for the construction of 72 wind turbines in Fulton Washington Newark New Haven North Shade and North Star townships.

When complete it will have the capacity to produce up to 200 megawatts of electricity.

Heartland Farms will develop the wind park including obtaining all real estate and interconnection agreements and the installation of the turbines and all other equipment according to the MPSC application.

Once the facility is finished and goes online which is planned before Dec. 31 2022 Consumers Energy will take ownership.

After it goes into operation the county will have nearly 420 wind turbines in service.

The Heartland Farms project will be the second owned by Consumers Energy in the southern part of the county.

Gratiot Wind Farms which includes 60 turbines in North Shade and New Haven townships went online in late 2020.

The others located in Gratiot County are:

Polaris Wind Energy an affiliate of Chicago-based Invenergy which has two other wind parks in the county built 68 turbines in Lafayette Hamilton and North Star townships that produce 160 megawatts of electricity for DTE.

Pine River Wind Energy has 29 turbines operating in Pine River Township and another 36 in Isabella County’s Coe Township. It was also developed by Invenergy to supply electricity for DTE.

Beebe Community Wind Farm which supplies electricity for Consumers Energy has 55 turbines in North Star Emerson and Washington townships.

Invenergy also developed the county’s first wind farm and the state’s largest in 2012 which features 133 turbines in Wheeler Bethany Emerson and Lafayette townships.

When the new wind farm is finished it will leave only four of the county’s 16 townships Arcada Elba Seville and Sumner townships without a wind park.

Turbines are not allowed to be constructed in Arcada Township because it’s home to the county’s only airport and their 500-foot height could interfere with flight patterns.

According to statistics from Greater Gratiot Development Inc. more than $1 billion has been invested in wind development in the county since 2012 providing local governments and schools a total of $57 million in new tax revenue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kb3dudG9lYXJ0aC5vcmcuaW4vYmxvZy93YXN0ZS90aW1lLXMtcnVubmluZy1vdXQtaXMtaW5kaWEtcmVhZHktdG8taGFuZGxlLTM0LTYwMC10b25uZXMtb2Ytc29sYXItd2FzdGUtYnktMjAzMC0tODExMDTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Time's running out: Is India ready to handle 34600 tonnes of solar waste by 2030?,"With India’s ambitious solar target of 280 GW by 2030 it is time to formulate a sound solar waste management policy

India does not have a solar waste management policy but it does have ambitious solar power installation targets.

Solar waste — the electronic waste generated by discarded solar panels — is sold as scrap in the country. It can increase by at least four-five-fold by the next decade. India should focus its attention on drafting comprehensive rules to deal with solar waste.

The issue was not addressed in the last electronic waste management regulations in 2016. SolarPower Europe and PVCycle supported by the European Union in India and the Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy could generate over 34600 tonnes of cumulative solar waste in India by 2030 according to a report prepared by the National Solar Energy Federation of India.

Solar panels have a life of 20-25 years so the problem of waste seems distant. It is likely that India will be faced with solar waste problems by the end of this decade and solar waste will end up being the most prevalent form of waste in landfills soon.

It is therefore imperative that a policy be formulated soon.

While photovoltaics generate only about 3 per cent of global electricity they consume 40 per cent of the world’s tellurium 15 per cent of the world’s silver a substantial chunk of semiconductor-grade quartz and lesser but still significant amounts of indium zinc tin and gallium.

A holistic approach to solar energy includes not only a green and clean perspective but also resource and material management.

The two most popular module technologies in India are crystallised silicon (C-Si) and thin-film (mainly cadmium telluride CdTe) with 93 and 7 per cent market shares respectively. Both the technologies have a recovery rate of 85-90 per cent.

The market value of raw materials recovered from solar panels could reach $450 million by 2030 according to a projection by the International Renewable Energy Agency.

In other words this amount of raw materials is approximately the same as that required to build 60 million new solar panels or to generate 18 GW of electricity.

The value of recoverable materials might surpass $15 billion by 2050 which would be enough to power 630 GW with two billion solar panels. Globally it is expected that end-of-life (EoL) of solar panels will drive the solar panel recycling business in the next 10-20 years.

Then why are we not recycling more?

The large cost gap between recycling and discarding panels in landfills points to an unpleasant truth: The process generates roughly $3 in revenue from the recovery of certain materials.

Recycling a solar panel cost between $20 and $30 according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory; sending it to a landfill costs $1-2.

How are other countries handling solar waste?

The EU is clearly ahead of other regions in terms of framing and implementing waste management policies for PV waste. The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive of the EU imposes responsibility for the disposal of waste on the manufacturers or distributors who introduce or install such equipment for the first time.

PV manufacturers are solely responsible for the collection handling and treatment of modules at the end of their lifecycle according to the WEEE Directive.

Currently most of the EU member states have come up with directives for collecting handling and management of PV waste.

The UK also has an industry-managed “take-back and recycling scheme” where all PV producers will need to register and submit data related to products used for the residential solar market (B2C) and non-residential market.

While there are no federal statutes or regulations in the United States that talk about recycling there are some states who have proactively defined policies to address end-of-life PV module management.

Washington and California have come up with extended producer responsibility (EPR) regulations. Washington now requires PV module manufacturers to finance the take-back and reuse or recycling of PV modules sold within or into the state at no cost to the end-user.

In addition New Jersey and North Carolina passed legislation in 2019 to study and explore PV module management options that can help in forming future legislations.

The federal government In Australia has acknowledged the concern and announced $2 million grant as part of the National Product Stewardship Investment Fund to develop and implement an industry-led product stewardship scheme for PV systems.

It is expected that the scheme will encourage shared responsibility throughout the supply chain to manage the impacts of PV modules through their life cycle and support the development of an efficient and innovative domestic PV recycling industry.

Countries such as Japan and South Korea have already indicated their resolve to come up with dedicated legislation to address the PV waste problem.

India needs a three-pronged approach to handle the mammoth quantum of PV waste it will generate in the next 10 years.

Roadmap to resource-efficient solar energy

Strong e-waste or renewable energy waste laws: EPR for the manufacturer and developers to take responsibility for end-of-life the solar panel. PV modules were the first to be included in the EU’s WEEE regulations. It includes options for financing waste management.

Infrastructure: To bring down the cost of recycling infrastructure investment is required coordination between the energy and waste sector to efficiently handle the renewable energy waste and build more recycling plants to avoid solar panels to end up in landfills.

Founded by module makers PV Cycle offers its members regional compliance services. The United States-based PV module manufacturer First Solar has its own thin-film recycling facility.

Environmental disposal and recycling of solar waste could be part of the power purchase agreement SECI / DISCOMS / government signs with project developers.

Ban on Landfills: Solar panel waste is harmful to the environment as it contains toxic metals and minerals that may seep in the ground.

New business models incentives or issues of green certificates to be provided to encourage the recycling industry to participate more.

Research and Development: Innovation in design may have an impact on the type of waste they generate; technology advancements will be significant in reducing the impact of renewable energy waste. New panels for example use less silicon and produce less waste during the manufacturing process.",,,,,,,,,

The Board voted to approve the proposal by Pleasant Grove Solar a subsidiary of Duke Energy to construct a 300 megawatt solar farm on nearly 2000 acres of land. Construction will begin on the project in spring 2022 with the farm set to begin operations in 2023.

“I think we’ve come up with a plan that really can be a perfect model a best practice for this kind of practice” said Jeff Neves business development director for Duke Energy.

Pleasant Grove Solar is also planning to seek approval to expand the farm onto land within the city of Marengo Riley Township and Boone County which would increase the farm’s size to 2668 acres according to Duke Energy’s proposal to the McHenry County Board.

“The project is an alternative energy source which will produce zero-emission energy to the electric grid and provide cost effective renewable energy to the public” Duke documents states.

The farm will be located southeast of downtown Marengo on the north side of Interstate 90. Pleasant Grove Solar plans to build their own substation on the north side of the tollway and will work with Commonwealth Edison to build a switching station south of the tollway.

A map shows parts of unincorporated McHenry County southwest of Marengo where a solar farm will be built in 2022. (McHenry County)

At the height of construction which will take between 12 and 18 months Duke estimates the project will create 300 construction jobs. When completed four to seven people will be employed by Pleasant Grove Solar at a time.

Duke also estimates the project will generate $40.3 million in local tax revenue over the farm’s 35-year lifespan. The largest portion of the tax revenue $16.8 million is estimated to go to Riley School District 18 according to Duke documents.

“I believe this is the highest and best use from a landowner’s position” said Kathy Meyer one of 10 landowners in the unincorporated area who will lease land for the solar farm.

Environmental advocates are also excited and say the project is an important step toward creating an energy efficient future in McHenry County.

“[Solar energy] is the way the world is going so I’m very excited we have a project here that will help us get there” Cynthia Kanner executive director of Environmental Defenders of McHenry County told the County Board on Tuesday.

Kanner said creating the solar farm in the county also will help the county meet new energy standards in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act better known as CEJA passed by state lawmakers earlier this fall. CEJA requires coal oil and natural gas electricity providers in Illinois to eliminate carbon emissions by 2045.

“The only way that will happen as we move away form extraction and harness energy from the sun is to work everywhere in our state” Kanner said.

Others in McHenry County are excited about the project because it will create new educational opportunities.

“The proposed project would offer opportunities for my students to tour a utility-scale power plant that captures renewable energy powers community stakeholders and enhances grid stability” said Ted Erski an earth science instructor at McHenry County College who teaches a course on renewable energy that requires students to design their own solar farm.

Once completed county notes indicate the solar farm will not change much for people for people who live nearby. County ordinances require natural vegetation to screen the solar panels from residences which will also act as a natural snow fence during the winter. Noise is also not expected to be a factor when the solar panels are in operation according to the county’s assessment.

In the summer Woodstock City Council gave approval to extend a permit to build a solar farm that would be able to power 150 homes near Route 14 and Lily Pond Road. The project has had an active permit for three years and construction has not yet started but officials say construction should begin next summer.

Last month the DeKalb County Board also approved construction for 6000 acres of solar farm construction. Discussions are also ongoing about building a solar farm in the city of DeKalb near the airport.

Duke Energy is also continuing to pushing for building a solar farm near Dixon. The proposal was previously rejected by the Lee County Board earlier this year.

Coal ash from a structural fill site entered an unnamed stream after a sinkhole formed in Mooresville state regulators announced today.

The sinkhole was in a parking lot built on top of a coal ash structural fill site off NC Highway 150. The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality did not specify which fill site was affected but state records show a previous sinkhole in a parking lot of the Terry K Smith Highway 150 project.

This site contains 45833 tons of coal ash sourced from Duke Energy’s Marshall Steam Station located on nearby Lake Norman.

DEQ said in a press release that a stream culvert pipe collapsed under a coal ash structural fill during heavy rains on Thursday Sept. 17 that caused a previously repaired sinkhole in a parking lot to reopen.

DEQ said it has been monitoring the sinkhole since becoming aware of it during a site inspection in July of 2019. The property owner had previously repaired the sinkhole in 2018 and 2019.

During site visits after the storm sediment containing coal ash was observed in the stream bed of the unnamed tributary where it emerges south of Highway 150.

DEQ staff collected water quality samples from the stream and is conducting ongoing monitoring. The location is in the area of a state Department of Transportation expansion project and DEQ has discussed necessary next steps with the property owner and NCDOT. DEQ also alerted county and state emergency management authorities.

There are dozens of known coal ash structural fill sites in North Carolina and more that have been reported but not documented.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvb2RuZXdzbmV0d29yay5vcmcvd2luZC10dXJiaW5lcy11c2UtY2FtZXJhcy1hbmQtYWktdG8tc2F2ZS1iaXJkcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wind Turbines Are Using Cameras and AI to See Birds –And Shut Down When They Approach,"Wind power is a powerful tool for reducing carbon emissions that cause climate change. The turbines however can be a threat to birds and bats which is why experts are looking for—and finding—ways to eliminate the danger.

The US government has allocated $13.5 million to look for solutions. But already a Boulder Colorado company has produced a camera- and AI-based technology that can recognize eagles hawks and other raptors as they approach in enough time to pause turbines in their flight path.

Their tool called IdentiFlight can detect 5.62 times more bird flights than human observers alone and with an accuracy rate of 94 percent. https://www.identiflight.com/

Using high-precision optical sensors the system calculates a bird’s speed and flight trajectory and if it is on a collision path with a turbine a signal is sent to shut that turbine down.

Winning an award for its performance in Australia the tracking system was installed in 2018 at a Tasmanian facility and was found to cut eagle deaths at the Cattle Hill Wind Farm by more than four-fifths.

Each day signals have shut-down their movement an average of 400 times—across the field of 48 turbines—for two to three minutes each time.

Across the globe Duke Energy in Wyoming is employing the same technology with impressive results at its Top of the World Windpower Project.

The IdentiFlight network of camera units watch for bald and golden eagles. When a camera detects an approaching object the system determines whether it’s an eagle within seconds.

Top of the World—named for a ridge where golden eagles roost—was the first wind site to use the technology. In 2014 IdentiFlight’s manufacturer Boulder Imaging used Top of the World for testing after eagles fatalities left the company in violation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

47 units made of eight wide-angle cameras now constantly scan the sky to monitor all 110 turbines. The camera unit is mounted to the top of a 30-foot pole and powered by software that learns and improves with each photo taken as ornithologists vet previously identified birds.

An independent study conducted in 2020 by The Peregrine Fund Western EcoSystems Technology and the US Geological Survey showed an 82 percent reduction in eagle deaths at the site which is located in Glenrock.

Bird lover and director of National Audubon Society’s Clean Energy Initiative Garry George admits “Our own science shows that climate change is by far the biggest threat to birds and the places wildlife need to survive.”

“IdentiFlight will make it possible to combat the worst effects of climate change and protect the birds we love in the process.”

Indeed a 2009 study using US and European data on bird deaths analyzed the number killed per unit of power generated by wind power vs fossil fuel and nuclear estimating that for every bird killed by a turbine nuclear and fossil fuel powered plants killed 2118.

Eagles have been capable of adapting too. Some of the raptors living at Top of the World have been on the site for years and have had no issues avoiding the blades.

Duke Energy announced it is installing IdentiFlight at Frontier Windpower II in Oklahoma and Wyoming’s Campbell Hill site.

Yes there are rising tensions in Europe and yes we watch Archduke Franz Ferdinand gunned down in the street in Sarajevo – but beyond the basic details the film very much forges its own alternate history.

In Vaughn's version of the war a mysterious organisation of criminals led by a bitter Scottish nationalist is largely responsible for the conflict manipulating the situation in Europe to start the war and keep it going for as long as possible – with their ultimate goal to bring about the destruction of England.

One of the criminal's right-hand men in this endeavour is notorious Russian monk Rasputin and although this version of the figure is suitably exaggerated star Rhys Ifans told RadioTimes.com that his portrayal was at least in part based on the historical record.

More like this

""Most of what we know about Rasputin anyway is arguably fictionalised"" he said. ""He does remain in our culture as a kind of anti-superhero already so he lends himself wonderfully to a vehicle like the what-if-ness of the Kingsman franchise.

""And he has such a specific look as well that's instantly recognisable – even if you know nothing of Rasputin generally that kind of silhouette is instantly recognisable.

""And then it was a case of learning who he was or what we know about him"" he added. ""We know he was mysterious he was very powerful he was physically very strong he had zero table manners he was very difficult to kill and he was a healer – arguably a very successful one. There's a lot of what-ifs around Rasputin himself basically so it's on a plate a little bit in terms of what you have to play with as an actor.""

He continued: ""The film gives us more information about Rasputin than we might think it's doing and what we might assume is fictionalised actually isn't.

""The two examples from the top of my head: in Rasputin's assassination there were actual members of the British Secret Service present in the planning of and the execution of the assassination. And then Rasputin famously had awful table manners and ate like a pig. But where we part ways is he wasn't obviously a champion Cossack kung fu dancer. But then again – who knows?""

One star who plays not one not two but three historical figures in the film is Tom Hollander who stars in the triple role of King George V of England Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. In the first act the film gives us a brief history lesson as to the relationship between the three monarchs all of whom were first cousins and although much of what happens thereafter is fictionalised the background itself is based in fact.

""There's a book called The Three Emperors by Miranda Carter that was very very helpful about the whole period"" Hollander explains when asked about the true history behind the characters.

""I had also played George V once before so I'd done a certain amount of research about him"" he added. ""But when you're playing a historical character in someone else's version of a bit of history they've made a lot of the decisions about the presentation of that character.

""Sometimes when you do research you encounter details which are not consistent with the version of the character that you're being asked to play – and you need to focus your work on the script to make that version of that character work. But Miranda Carter's book helped me it just stimulated my imagination to know what the real people were like.""

There are other historical figures who appear in the film too. For example Charles Dance takes on the role of Herbert Kitchener who was the Secretary of State for War during the start of World War One and whose death onboard the HMS Hampshire is recreated here albeit in a heavily fictionalised manner. (It's perhaps worth noting that while he's portrayed in the film as a purely heroic figure this glosses over the fact that in real life Kitchener was also responsible for expanding concentration camps and bringing about the scorched earth policy during Britain's Boer War campaign.)

Meanwhile other characters in the film who are based on real figures include Erik Jan Hanussen (Daniel Bruhl) Prince Felix Yusupov (Aaron Vodovoz) Alfred DuPont (Todd Boyce) Empress Alexandra Feodorovna (Branka Katic) Mata Hari (Valerie Pachner) and Gavrilo Princip (Joel Basman).

The long and short of it then is that while the central storyline and the key characters played by Ralph Fiennes Harris Dickenson Gemma Arterton Djimon Hounsou and Matthew Goode are entirely fictional there is at least a grain of true history in the film – albeit one that bears little resemblance to what was really going on behind the scenes.

Tesla Pearl White PPSW Touch Up Paint & Scratch Repair Kit Contains everything needed. But its not magic. Essentially any touch up paint kit will work. Dr Colorchip is another popular one. The main factor is technique not product. If you REALLY want to get a chip as close to 100% invisible as possible it takes a little time and patience. Like anything else where you want quality results cant rush.This youtube video explains it best. For deep chips you may even wish to use a method where you tape a small piece of sandpaper to a pencil eraser to smooth down the edges of the chip before you begin the process of adding several layers of touch up paint to fill up the chip to get it even with the surrounding area. This video was my guide to the small nicks I had. Just took a little patience but as noted in the pics they essentially are now invisible unless you are within maybe 1 foot of looking for them. And even then a sharp eye is needed to find where I used the touch up.For me (my personal opinion) the cost of paying to have PPF done on a front bumper/front hood (much less the rest of the car) isnt worth the cost at todays rates. (About $1k to $1300 to have both hood/bumper done here in Virginia). When I sold my prior car (S) which had PPF on the hood/bumper I got none of that cost back at sale time. And on the many other cars I've owned and sold myself none of those cars had PPF and I was still able to get top private sale dollar for all of them. Buyers were aware they were buying a used car with tens of thousands of miles and a few tiny nicks on the front was normal wear and tear. (and major ones were touched up by me at minimal cost)I do get that others feel differently.

MISS MINT Rare error £2 coin sells for £150 on eBay – you might miss the fault in your own change

A RARE error £2 coin has cold on eBay with a price tag more than £100 over its face value.

The coin has a minting error so the text on the edge of the heads side is misaligned.

1 The coin has a minting error making it valuable for collectors Credit: ebay

It was listed on the auction site for just £1 but sold for £150 following a bidding war between three eBay customers.

The seller said it is ""very rare"" and ""one of a kind"".

In the item's listing they said it was ""very unusual and would look great in anyone's collection"".

They added: ""I have collected coins for many years and have never seen a £2 with such defects"".

Other £2 error coins have been sold for much more than their actual worth on eBay.

Earlier this month a similar coin was snapped up for £100 as an eagled-eyed collector spotted it had seven mistakes on it.

Another one was sold for £255 but that went as part of a set and so commanded a higher price.

How to find and sell a rare coin

Taking a look at other coins on eBay can give you a good idea of how much you could make from your own spare change.

Keep a look out for commemorative coins as these often attract higher offers on the online auction site.

For example the rare Kew Gardens 50p always does well and it has been a popular collectors item ever since its launch in 2009.

The Blue Peter coin from 2009 date is also a collectors item.

Online tools from change experts like Coin Hunter are helpful to see how much your cash could actually be worth.

You can also refer to Change Checker's latest scarcity index update to see which coins are topping the charts in terms of value.

The Royal Mint also has its own account of the rarest coins in circulation.

If you're looking for other ways to verify the coin the number of bids on the listing can help you establish if a coin and the amount it has sold for is the real deal.

But remember that on eBay a buyer could pull out which means the coin won't have sold for the price it appears to have.

Fakes often float about on the internet too so keep these in mind when your looking so you don't get duped out of your hard earned cash.

Canadian singer/songwriter Allison Russell’s Outside Child made two lists. And so did Little Simz’s Sometime I Might Be Introvert.

Paul Robicheau

Concerts once actively fed my musical intake but that largely fell by the wayside through another pandemic year (a minor realignment compared to others’ true losses). I’ve settled on seven musical endeavors that most struck me in 2021:

Outside Child Allison Russell. This Canadian singer/songwriter comes into her own with a sublime solo debut that reflects her survival from childhood sexual abuse navigated with uplifting resolve and melodic grace. She effortlessly glides through a sweet and haunting amalgam of folk blues and gospel plus a touch of her clarinet. No surprise she was a leading light at this year’s Newport Folk fest.

Cavalcade Black Midi. Perhaps this eccentric maelstrom isn’t much crazier than our fractured world. London’s young rock experimentalists conjure the musical equivalent of a Bosch painting on a second album brimming with brash dynamics and increasingly immense range. My review.

Tone Poem Charles Lloyd & the Marvels. While Pharoah Sanders got more kudos for Promises his ambient collaboration with electronic artist Floating Points and the London Symphony Orchestra I was more engaged by the meditative spirit of fellow sax guru Lloyd and his band featuring sonic-sculpting guitarists Bill Frisell and pedal steel ace Greg Leisz. My review.

Sometime I Might Be Introvert Little Simz. An ambitious British-Nigerian rapper hits her groove with cinematic orchestration seductive soul-jazz sinewy Afropop and bouncy ’80s electro-funk accented by her autobiographic empowered flow and fairy-tale whimsy. “The top of the mountain is nothing without the climb.”

30 Adele. Five years later another Adele album another triumph. Sure it could be the phone book. But this post-divorce jag takes heart-on-sleeve vulnerability to mainstream heights thanks to its crack production and her ever-marvelous voice.

Reissue: Mingus at Carnegie Hall (Deluxe Edition) Charles Mingus. I loved the original album as a guest-capped blowing session but this stellar expanded set draws balance and power from the entire 1974 concert (including 72 minutes of previously unreleased music) that highlights the fabled jazz composer’s regular band before the encore fireworks. My review.

Concert: King Crimson at Leader Bank Pavilion. Some may dismiss the legendary prog-rockers’ three-drummer edition for its less-edgy repertory style but guitar master Robert Fripp’s septet (including historical holdovers Tony Levin and Mel Collins) recast the catalog with an orchestral approach that did justice to era-spanning material. And this September show was likely our last chance to ever see Crimson perform live. My review.

Paul Robicheau served more than 20 years as contributing editor for music at the Improper Bostonian in addition to writing and photography for the Boston Globe Rolling Stone and many other publications. He was also the founding arts editor of Boston Metro.

Daniel Gewertz

The biggest news on the Americana music front for good reason is Raising The Roof the long-awaited follow-up album by Robert Plant & Allison Krauss fully 14 years after the release of Raising Sand their Album of the Year Grammy winner. But since I haven’t listened to enough new releases to concoct a proper Top 10 list let me instead mention one album and one single release of 2021 that have received less hoopla in the media.

The single: Diana Jones “I Believe You” from the album Song to a Refugee (Proper Records)

Veteran folkie Jones took the title “I Believe You” from the congressional testimony of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaking in support of border refugees and their petitions for life-saving asylum. Three roots music luminaries — Steve Earle Richard Thompson and Peggy Seeger — join Jones each singing a verse. Issue-centered modern folk songs aren’t uncommon but they rarely deserve to join the ranks of the old standards as this moving anthem surely does. Simple elegant emotive.

The album: Allison Russell Outside Child (Fantasy Records)

Previously known as a member of Po’ Girl Birds of Chicago and Our Native Daughters this exorbitantly gifted singer songwriter banjoist and clarinetist finally appears to be on the verge of renown. Outside Child and the single “Nightflyer” have been nominated for three Grammys. After 20 years in music this is the first solo effort for the Canadian. It is a joyous sinuous album: a longtime in the germinating but recorded in four days. It’s undeniable that Russell’s many years of childhood sexual abuse inform the lyrical core of this brave work but it is no lie that the essence of Outside Child is the unfettered sound of rapture and release. Her videos show that this exquisite woman owns the stage in ways both quiet and forceful.

For 30 years Daniel Gewertz wrote about music theater and movies for the Boston Herald among other periodicals. More recently he’s published personal essays taught memoir writing and participated in the local storytelling scene. In the 1970s at Boston University he was best known for his Elvis Presley imitation.

Alexander Szeptycki

After jumping between music throughout the year these are the 10 albums I came back to the most at the end of the year.

Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak An Evening With Silk Sonic

Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak two old souls with a penchant for funk were pretty much guaranteed to make good on their Silk Sonic collaboration. It is obvious that the two were fully committed to the project. An Evening With Silk Sonic is an exercise in lovingly crafted retro funk homage chockablock with tongue-in-cheek innuendos breakup melodrama and sultry love jams.

Remi Wolf Juno

Remi Wolf’s full-length debut is vibrant overflowing with colorfully chameleonic music. Remi infuses futuristic pop with funky grooves that are put across by her impressive range and varied deliveries. This is an album that leans into the artist’s eccentricities and never stops being fun.

Japanese Breakfast Jubilee

Jubilee is a disc about moving beyond pain. Michelle Zauner ruminates on the ways she can feel joy again and each track is backed by breathless pop arrangements. This effort is delightfully soft and bright though there are intimations of painful memories.

Arca KicK iii

With each listen the music on Arca’s KicK iii becomes increasingly hypnotic. The producer inventively twists dance tracks through distortion chopping up drum beats and melodies to the point that they are almost unrecognizable.

Slowthai Tyron

Slowthai put a bit of the new and old on his sophomore album Tyron mixing mellow introspection with his characteristic grimy and aggressive spitting. The fusion works well — he is growing as an artist without moving too far away from what made him exciting in the first place.

BROCKHAMPTON Roadrunner: New Light New Machine



BROCKHAMPTON is a collective that offers a breathtaking range of talents which makes their recordings so raucous and exciting. Lead signer Joba’s devastating personal narrative is at the center of this project giving it considerable edge.

Tyler the Creator Call Me If You Get Lost

After a couple albums that showed the mellow side of this singer/songwriter Tyler the Creator returned to his foul-mouthed renegade roots. His verses which explore his past are well-penned and confidently delivered reflecting a more fully formed artistry.

Jeff Rosenstock Ska Dream

The concept behind Ska Dream is simple: Jeff Rosenstock rewrote his entire 2020 album No Dream shifting its genre to third wave ska. The mordant pop punk jams translate into ska with ease aided by the blaring horns and ramped-up musicianship.

Illuminati Hotties Let Me Do One More

Music producer mixer and engineer Sarah Tudzin channels life problems into hits. After dropping a mixtape to free herself from a label contract she founded her own imprint. This album is her debut and it injects effervescent pop punk creativity into each track. It’s a journey filled with joy and anger — and each is exhausted.

Little Simz Sometimes I Might Be Introvert

On Sometimes I Might Be Introvert Little Simz creates a world of her own. The instrumentals are lush and varied ranging from tracks with operatic choirs and horns to breathy acoustic numbers. The UK rapper flows effortlessly over it all weaving a captivating personal narrative.

Scott McLennan

As I write this Covid numbers are spiking and live music is croaking. Announcements about concert postponements arrive daily and the battered live-music industry is scrambling to keep things afloat by ramping up safety protocols. It is impossible to not feel conflicted: large gatherings of strangers — no guarantee that everyone is vaxxed coupled with lax enforcement of mask-wearing guidelines — seems to be a bad idea. In fact it may very well have contributed to the persistence of the pandemic. Then again it was SO.DAMN.GOOD. to hear see feel and smell concerts as they returned to clubs theaters and outdoor amphitheaters. The general willingness to do the right thing for the public is sometimes at odds with the lure of that alchemical combustion of band and audience getting off on each other.

So this look back on the music that sustained me during 2021 touches on records and live shows. It is not intentional but it is heavy on artists that I have been into for years if not decades. Believe me I wasn’t feeling particularly nostalgic. Frankly the stuff on this list crackled with contemporary energy whether it was by Ministry Exodus or a 33-year-old Frank Zappa recording.

Here are my 2021 musical oases:

Renewal by Billy Strings. Strings and his band were unstoppable and everywhere in 2021. They delivered their distinctive bluegrass for the modern era to just about any festival amphitheater and concert hall that would have them. Guitar phenom Strings came armed with a stunning new record that blended high-lonesome tradition with restless urgency. His playing and writing have grown exponentially and though bluegrass is his foundation no single genre fully encapsulates his sound — both live and on record.

Shenanigans Nite Club by Goose. This Connecticut quintet is dynamite in concert but don’t write off the group’s recorded material. Yes records remain the soft spot for many jam-heavy bands but from the get-go Goose has put a premium on solid well-crafted songs. Shenanigans Nite Club is a sharply produced collection of tunes including many that first popped up in live sets but are given fresh treatments in the studio. “Madhuvan” — love it live love it on record.

Layla Revisited (Live at LOCKN”) by Tedeschi Trucks Band with Trey Anastasio. The pandemic kept the hard-touring Tedeschi Trucks Band off of the road so band leaders Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi found creative ways to stay connected to the audience and keep their creative juices flowing. One such endeavor was the release of the meticulously engineered recording of the band’s front-to-back performance of Layla and Assorted Love Songs done at the 2019 LOCKN’ Festival. Guitarists Trey Anastasio from Phish and Doyle Bramhall II a longtime TTB collaborator joined in to help recreate this orchestrated blues masterpiece originally released by Derek and the Dominos in 1970. Layla Revisited is a brilliant re-rendering of a familiar piece of music. TTB has been playing several of the album’s songs for years as part of its regular concert repertoire. But with the songs done in sequence and with the band’s vocal prowess explosive horn section and overall dynamic firepower this return to a peerless original is fully justified.

Persona Non Grata by Exodus. These veterans of the Bay Area thrash-metal scene sound as good as ever with guitar player Gary Holt giving this record his full attention. Holt had been busy with Slayer since 2011 first subbing for Jeff Hanneman then taking on the role permanently when the guitar great died in 2013. Following Slayer’s lengthy farewell tour Holt jumped right back into Exodus the band he joined in 1981 and ultimately took control of. Persona Non Grata is aggressive angry and unforgiving. A laser focus however shapes the raw fury for maximum effect. A lot of young metal bands are circling back to a furious thrash sound so it is gratifying to hear some architects of the style sounding so masterful.

Moral Hygiene by Ministry. Al Jourgensen is another godfather of heavy-music who is back kicking ass. The guiding light of Ministry was oddly MIA through much of the Trump era given how often he turned his vitriol for the comparatively “normal” bullshit of the Bush II era into a succession of career comeback albums. Jourgensen piqued fan interest however when he appeared in 2019 as the opener for the final leg of Slayer shows. He looked and sounded maniacally terrific through a powerful set of Ministry “hits.” This follow-up of new music is manna from Ministry full of sardonic humor dire takes on current affairs and cleverly arranged and layered music. You get everything from Greta Thunberg samples and a guest appearance from Jello Biafra to a woozy and boozy cover of The Stooges’ “Search and Destroy.”

Zappa ’88: The Last U.S. Show by Frank Zappa. Frank Zappa’s 1988 tour would be his last when this spectacular 12-piece ensemble fell apart. The March 25 1988 show from Nassau Coliseum was Zappa’s final U.S. concert. And what a concert it was: the full force of this group stuffed to the gills with horns keys guitars and a Synclavier worked its way through an expansive program of songs that stretched back to Zappa’s earliest work with the Mothers of Invention. Though this performance took place more than 30 years ago it’s emphasis on the amoral scuzz coating “trusted institutions” sounds as relevant today as it did then (and interestingly enough Zappa was making the point back in 1988 in part with a then 15 year old cautionary tale about Richard Nixon). The music hardly sounds dated reminding us just how far ahead of the pack Zappa was. The only bummer here and likely a byproduct of the in-fighting among the Zappa’s offspring is that the versions of “Whipping Post” and “Stairway to Heaven” performed on this date with Dweezil Zappa sitting in have been cut and replaced with versions of the songs from other dates.

Live in the Cavern of Darkness and Live at Onkel Po’s Carnegie Hall by Green on Red. These purveyors of alt-desert-psych-Americana have not played together in years. But hopes arose when archival Green on Red concert recordings started popping up on Bandcamp. Even if this is the extent of what becomes of Green on Red’s leading lights Dan Stuart and Chuck Prophet “teaming” again it ain’t so bad revisiting these sets particularly the two culled from shows done in Hamburg Germany performed 21 years apart. Live at Onkel Po’s comes from April 1985 just as Green on Red was teeing up its masterful Gas Food Lodging album. Live in the Cavern of Darkness comes from a 2006 reunion show that saw the band sticking to a repertoire of pre-1988 material. It’s all smart rustic punk takes on different facets of our battered national dream. Like the Zappa album these Green on Red offerings stand up particularly (or perhaps alarmingly) well in today’s landscape.

As for the live music front I am grateful for every live note I heard. Still I was particularly impressed by three reunion shows. The Black Crowes reunion tour hit the Xfinity Center in Mansfield on Sept. 15 and it far exceeded expectations. The show was well scripted with brothers Rich and Chris Robinson running through their Crowes’ debut Shake Your Money Maker plus an assortment of other concert faves from the band’s catalog. The performance by the Brothers Robinson – they were teaming up with an almost entirely new lineup of musicians — made it clear that they drive the band putting to rest any quibbles about which historical configuration of the Crowes best serves the music. The brothers’ unpredictable and at times contradictory approaches to the band have somehow — over 30-plus years — worked to make the Black Crowes one of the truly great rock ’n’ roll acts of our time. It is so good neither the Robinsons nor their detractors can kill off. This show also benefited from a guest appearance by singer Peter Wolf who led the band through “Cry One More Tine” and “Looking for a Love”

The Slip’s all-too-brief reunion tour hit The Sinclair in Cambridge on Nov. 13 and was every bit as probing and soaring as this band’s shows from its late-’90s/early-’00s heyday. Guitarist and singer Brad Barr drummer Andrew Barr and bassist Marc Friedman played old gems such as “The Weight of Solomon” as well as new pieces. It was a deeply transfixing performance that should lead to more work by this band.

Shadows Fall made The Palladium in Worcester the center of the heavy metal universe on Dec. 18 with a one-off reunion that was both glorious in execution and infuriating. It was a reminder that this band for whatever reason hasn’t gotten its proper due. Formed in 1996 the group led a wave of brash young metal bands coming out of Massachusetts. The band released a string of strong albums and always delivered the goods live whether that meant facing down a club crowd or charging up a festival audience. The band sounded completely on top of its game at the reunion. What’s more opening sets by Unearth and Darkest Hour resurrected the spirit of peak Palladium mayhem.

While it was undoubtedly a leader in the video game console market it could no longer boast the virtual monopoly it held during the late Eighties. What’s more the industry was already planning to transition away from the 16-bit console market and rival manufacturers were beginning to show their hands. NEC had experienced success in Japan with the PC Engine and had already shown off the 32- bit Tetsujin while Atari had announced the Jaguar in August 1993 and was gearing up for a holiday test launch. The much-vaunted 3DO from former Electronic Arts executive Trip Hawkins was also scheduled to launch for the holiday season and had the backing of electronics giant Panasonic.

Nintendo wasn’t particularly concerned with most of these companies - at the time Sega was its biggest rival having been the first company to bring serious competition to the console market. As the two biggest players in the console market either of them could have been behind what ultimately became the Nintendo 64. The hardware was primarily engineered by Silicon Graphics Inc a huge name in movie special effects technology which had recently bought MIPS Technologies the designer of the CPUs used in its workstations.

Having developed a low-cost power-efficient version of the latest MIPS processors SGI put together a design proposal for a games console. In September 1993 the rivals had signed the contracts and made their announcements - Nintendo would partner with SGI and launch its 64-bit home console in late-1995 while Sega would use Hitachi’s 32-bit processors and launch in the autumn of 1994. Sony Nintendo’s former partner on the SNES CD-ROM project announced its intention to launch a home console of its own the following month.

Being the last to market wasn’t an unfamiliar situation for Nintendo as it had done the same with the SNES and been able to retain a substantial market share regardless. The tactic here was the same - simply put Nintendo bet on having the best technology. Project Reality as it soon became known was also an easy machine to hype. With SGI on board Nintendo Magazine System claimed that the machine had “the potential to provide graphic images such as those seen in Abyss Jurassic Park and Terminator 2”. At a time when more bits was better being a 64-bit machine was a big deal. Total emphasised that “[Sega’s] next generation machine Saturn is a 32-bit console - fairly powerful but nowhere near as fast as the Silicon Graphics hardware”.

By the time the console had received its Ultra 64 name in 1994 Nintendo had decided on an extensive advance marketing strategy working with Midway to create Ultra 64 branded arcade games and taking out advertising to encourage players to wait for the console. They needed plenty of patience as the Nintendo 64 was delayed repeatedly prior to its Japanese release in June 1996. “It’s hard to do hardware full stop and this was a totally new platform - new chipset new CPU new GPU. On top of that we were trying to make a flagship Mario game” says Giles Goddard a programmer working for Nintendo at that time. “They just wanted to get it right – there was no particular big problem that happened that caused a delay or anything.”

While working on the planned launch game Star Wars: Shadows Of The Empire Eric Johnston had a privileged position in seeing the system take shape. “I loved the N64 hardware. Mark Blattel and I had a desk at SGI during its development running it through its paces as it progressed. At the time the only machine we could simulate it on was a $250000 SGI Onyx which was a purple and black box the size of a small desk which required its own 16-amp power outlet” Johnston tells us.

Goddard also remembers this setup: “There were changes all the time basically we rarely saw actual hardware. There were two levels of emulation - the API side emulation where you could recompile your game to run on SGI hardware natively with very little changes to your code you could run either the native one or build it for the emulator. Most of the time we were developing on the native version of the game and then occasionally we’d recompile it for the Onyx to see if it still worked in the same way. We rarely saw actual N64 devices.”

64 bits

(Image credit: Rare)

The CPU was quite powerful for its day with a high clock speed of 93.75MHz for a performance of 125 million instructions per second - for comparison the PlayStation does around 30 MIPS. But did the ability to use 64-bit processing actually provide any practical advantages? “Almost none I would say” says Goddard. “I’d say it was more of a marketing thing than anything actually usable. A float is 32 bits and a double float is 64 bits and you don’t need double floats to do any kind of 3D maths usually especially back then. All games ran in 32-bit mode. 32 bits is what 4GB of memory? This thing only had 4MB” he explains.

“From memory I think the 64 bits was more marketing spiel than anything else” concurs Wetrix and Mario Artist: Paint Studio programmer Amir Latif. “It certainly didn’t have a huge amount of RAM to access and the memory bus certainly wasn’t that wide. There was a 32-bit mode and a 64-bit mode but in reality we never really touched the 64-bit mode as there were other knock-on effects (for example pointers become eight bytes instead of four).”

“There were lots of new things that were being thrown at us that we had to familiarise ourselves with” says Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie programmer Chris Sutherland. “We were previously used to coding things in assembly language so depending on the processor we were using whether it was for the Game Boy the NES or the SNES we’d be familiarising ourselves with that processor. So I suppose it was a bit of a leap in terms of moving from assembly language to C where we were programming on a higher-level language. There were lots of things to consider there and lots of new things to learn” he explains.

“There was a move to three dimensions as well which is something that we weren’t familiar with learning things with cameras and things like that"" Sutherland continues. ""We were also using different machines so previously we would be using PCs to develop with and now we were using these Silicon Graphics Indys which didn’t run Windows but they ran a version of a Unix-style operating system.”

A new way

One unique thing about the N64 was the Reality Co-Processor or the RCP. Although this chip handled the console’s graphical functions that wasn’t its only task - it was also used for audio and input/output operations. The RCP could be reconfigured towards different performance profiles using custom microcode and it had plenty of hardware features that were key to the N64’s distinct look. “In particular I liked having built-in Z-buffer trilinear mipmapping and floating point. Today few 3D game developers would even consider going without these but at the time they were new and didn’t exist on other platforms at all even expensive home PCs” says Johnston. “If you run N64 games side by side with other contemporary platforms you definitely notice the difference visually.”

Latif also remembers this visual difference: “In terms of pixel fidelity the N64 had fairly cutting-edge features especially compared to its PlayStation peer. Z-buffering antialiasing bilinear interpolation texturing perspective corrected texturing mipmap texturing environment mapping fog all of these features were missing from its competitors. Unfortunately they also came at a heavy price and the N64 really struggled to throw around too many triangles especially with some of those heavier effects turned on.”

Rare struggled with the performance balance in its early work with the machine. “There were all kinds of convoluted systems that we had to try and not use that Z-buffer so it was sorting by object and all this kind of stuff which always works to 80% but then there’s the 20% where things draw in the wrong order. There were all kinds of things we tried to mitigate that but in the end we settled on ‘let’s use the Z-buffer’' Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie artist Ed Bryan recalls. “The Z-buffer was seen as extremely expensive in terms of framerate but you couldn’t do without it as we found out” adds artist Steve Mayles. “But this wasn’t on Banjo this was when we were doing the Dream game” he says referring to the precursor to Banjo-Kazooie. “You’d be walking across a bridge and it would all look great then you’d move the camera slightly and then this massive thing would pop in front of everyone.”

Despite being industry leaders in 3D art thanks to games like Donkey Kong Country and Killer Instinct Rare’s artists also found that they needed to learn a new way of working for the new console. “With NURBS the way we did the 3D for Donkey Kong Country it was completely different to polygons so it was really another world of 3D with the triangles and the vertices” says Mayles. “There were more rules to follow really because it was real-time. With the NURBS you were making it and rendering it out and at that point it didn’t really matter what it looked like in the package but with the polygons everything had to be done exactly right or else it’d go into the game and it’d all go wrong.”

However the NURBS experience didn’t go to waste as it was used to create textures - though they were their own challenge. “Colouring everything a vertex at a time texturing everything a triangle at a time - it was a very different world to what it is now. We opted for as few textures on the characters as possible” Bryan remembers. “Which actually works well in retrospect"" Sutherland adds ""because if you have that shading then if you have a modern version which upscales it it looks kind of neat still whereas if you have a texture it just gets really blurred out.""

Memory architecture

The system’s approach to memory followed a similarly flexible model to the co-processor. Previous consoles had allocated various pools of RAM to different tasks - main memory video and audio. The N64 used a unified memory architecture allowing developers to distribute the system’s 4MB memory between tasks as they saw fit. “Up until that point everybody had to deal with banks and DMA memory between banks and that was a real pain to do that kind of stuff. Now we had basically everything under one roof which was just fantastic” says Goddard.

“You basically had three areas. You had the ROM you had the RAM and then you had the graphics memory - and when I say memory I mean texture memory and vertex memory"" Goddard continues. ""So you still had a graphics part of the memory that was separate - it was on-chip cache but it was great to have everything in RAM - you could access anything anywhere without having to worry about what area it was. That was one of the big attractions for that kind of architecture.”

Although the N64’s memory architecture was not especially fast Goddard doesn’t recall this being an issue. “It was more the size of the caches that was the problem they were quite small. It was 4K for the textures and I think something really stupid like 16 vertices. That’s where triangle stripping and all these sort of clever ways of getting the most amount of triangles out of fewer vertices was really important.” Another unusual aspect of the RAM was the ninth bit reserved for graphical functions - something Johnston was keen to exploit in other ways.

“You might know that the original in-development architecture was only 2 or 2.5MB RAM all 9-bit DRAM. The CPU only had access to it as eight bits per byte so I wrote a sketchy driver to (at some hiccup cost) use the ninth bit as extra memory. I mean hey that’s an extra 280K or so minus what the frame buffers need - enough for some cached textures or sounds” Johnston explains. “I proudly showed it off to Acorn a super-cool ace developer at Nintendo. Some time later after they’d upped the memory to 4MB I got an email saying you’re welcome and please don’t use the ninth-bit hack job in a shipping game.” Though Johnston’s hack never saw the light of day it was possibly for the best. “The RCP made really nice use of the ninth bit though for extra Z-buffer resolution and 5553 RGB+ coverage for their clever and imperfect anti-aliasing in a world where supersampling wasn’t an option” he tells us.

When it came to sound the N64 used the CPU and RCP to play back sound samples. While it offered a major jump over what was possible on the SNES it had some major disadvantages compared to its competitors. “N64 has more RAM available for the audio processor and it can load data much faster from ROM than a PlayStation can from CD” explains veteran video game musician Matt Furniss. “Most PlayStation games had CD soundtracks leaving all the available audio RAM for sound effects whereas N64 had to generate both music and sound effects. So in the end PlayStation sounds better – more sound effects higher sample rates. But N64 music could be more dynamic and seamlessly change during gameplay.”

The flexibility of the system allowed for a variety of approaches. “Cruis’n Exotica uses very large single-channel samples compressed down from the original arcade game. For Excitebike 64 we used dual-channel audio stems which would allow a little more variety in each song” Furniss explains. However he was rather fortunate to be able to do so. “Both games I worked on had large cartridge ROMs. Enough space to store all the music and effects at a sample rate and compression which sounded decent.” When asked how much space that took he draws a blank but tells us “it must have been more than most games it was unusual to handle the music as we did”.

Even then large samples could only take you so far - for example Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2 on the N64 has a reduced selection of songs each of which are formed of long repeating samples. More commonly developers would construct music from short samples of instruments as was done on the SNES - Resident Evil 2 does this. But the use of cartridges was a problem for more than sound.

The CD-ROMs adopted by Sony and Sega had the downside of slow loading and being easier to copy but allowed for plenty of presentational fluff such as FMV sequences and extensive voice acting. Some developers most notably Squaresoft found that sticking with ROM cartridges simply represented too great a constraint on their ambitions and moved to rival platforms. Other publishers were attracted by the low manufacturing cost of CDs allowing them to manufacture games at less financial risk as well as potentially offering them at a lower price.

The past and the future

Beyond the console’s internals innovation was extended to the interface of the system. The console came with four control ports as standard making larger multiplayer games the norm - a simple change that made classics of games like GoldenEye 007 and Mario Kart 64. More radical was its unusual three-pronged controller. The central analogue thumbstick provided fine control over direction and speed of movement while the quartet of C-buttons was designed for 3D camera control and the Z trigger provided a substitute for L/R depending on your grip.

“Having had the privilege to work very closely with key Nintendo leaders I got to learn from them and understand their focus on playful and surprising interactions and then the functional and simple way the hardware enables it” says Diddy Kong Racing and Dinosaur Planet director Lee Schuneman. “It’s a controller designed with both an eye to the future (3D) and connection to the past (2D) with an understanding that players and developers need time to get used to the change that was coming as 3D worlds became the norm. The reality is that the concepts from it remain to this day in all controllers. I always like that Nintendo walk their own path and design hardware to enable the games not the other way around. It’s never tech for tech’s sake.”

Of course for all of its technical grunt the N64 was defined as much by the talent of those developing for it as the system specifications. The special effects of Super Mario 64 that made the console look a step ahead of anything else were as much a showcase of ingenuity as technology. “I think a lot of the stuff we were doing was made to highlight the hardware - it wouldn’t look the same on a PlayStation” says Goddard. “It was Nintendo so they obviously had a lot of know-how a lot of willingness to experiment with ideas without having to worry about going over budget too much. It was a bit of both - the artists at Nintendo are amazing the programmers are amazing. It was the combination of having great hardware and a great team.”

“I have never approached any game development thinking about the hardware it’s always what’s the idea and let’s do everything we can to make it real” says Schuneman. “Of course along the way you discover things that maybe you can or can’t do but then you find a solution around it! Rare was (and I’m sure still is) full of great software engineers who were never satisfied with any limitation so hardware weaknesses were never a problem and just something to work around.” Mostly he remembers the people over the hardware. “The amount of world-class game designers (Miyamoto Iwata Ken Lobb all the Rare founders) that I got to interact with over those N64 years was pretty amazing in hindsight and even a prerelease Ocarina Of Time to learn from.”

As the N64 aged there were a couple of attempts at expanding its capabilities. The 64DD was a disk drive that used proprietary magnetic disks with a 64MB capacity and some capability to save data. This was actually first shown to the public at the Shoshinkai show in 1996 but was heavily delayed with little information revealed to the public. According to Latif who was working on Mario Artist: Paint Studio at Software Creations it wasn’t just the public that were left in the dark.

“I actually left the project to help start ZedTwo and work on Wetrix before Mario Artist was finished” Latif explains. “That project brings back a lot of mixed memories - it just went on for so long and at various times it didn’t feel like it was ever going to come out. During my time on the project some three to four years we never even saw prototype 64DD devkits.” The device finally arrived in Japan in December 1999 and received very little support with Doshin The Giant F-Zero X Expansion Kit and SimCity 64 being its most notable games.

Competition

However the 64DD came bundled with something that wound up being far more important – the Expansion Pak. This plug-in module doubled the RAM of the console and was supported by dozens of cartridge games. Most games used this to offer high-resolution modes but some such as San Francisco Rush 2049 included exclusive gameplay content such as extra stages. The most ambitious three were Donkey Kong 64 Perfect Dark and The Legend Of Zelda: Majora’s Mask which all required the Expansion Pak.

Artist Mark Stevenson remembers it being beneficial in terms of standard things like level size in Donkey Kong 64 but there were also more creative uses. “One thing I remember that we did use it for was that we had a lot of dynamic lighting in there which was hard to do and expensive” he recalls. “One of the engineers wrote a system whereby you’d go into a cave area and there’d be a swinging light - the first swing of that light it’d record all of the colour changes on all of the vertices in that area and then save it as data and just play it back as an animation rather than going on to calculate the lighting constantly. You’d get a little bit of slowdown when you went in but after that it was nice and smooth.”

Even with the memory boost developers did eventually find the system’s limits - something you can see in the leaked demo of Rare’s unreleased game Dinosaur Planet. “I think we were running at 15fps most of the time so clearly had pushed it too far! But as with Diddy Kong Racing (and much of the Dinosaur Planet team were from that team also) we just wanted to realise our vision and screw the technical limitations” says Schuneman.

(Image credit: Nintendo)

“I had a great moment with Dinosaur Planet when I demoed the game on a giant projection screen at Rare with ex-Nintendo Of America president Arakawa-san and it’s like this big cinematic-style game coming out of an N64... lots of applause and a happy moment for the team.” The game ultimately received a new direction and was redirected towards the N64’s forthcoming successor. “Star Fox Adventures happened"" Schuneman adds ""which was both a blessing and a curse but out of that transition a few of us (myself Kevin Bayliss and Phil Tossell) at least got to go work with Miyamoto-san and Iwata-san in Kyoto.”

Other games made similar leaps to the GameCube including Capcom’s Resident Evil Zero and Silicon Knights’ Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem. Although the Nintendo 64 was a powerful console with many advanced features it was unable to repeat the success of the SNES which did eventually become the best-selling console of its generation. The N64 sold fewer units than its 16-bit predecessor and Nintendo fell behind Sony to become a distant runner-up in the global home console market.

The N64 struggled terribly in Nintendo’s traditional stronghold of Japan where the console’s relative lack of RPGs was a real problem and it even wound up selling fewer units than the Sega Saturn. It also has fewer software releases than either of its competitors - just under 400 compared to over 1000 for the Saturn and over 4000 on the PlayStation. While it should be noted that Nintendo remained profitable throughout the N64 years judged by these measures the console does not look like a success.

Legacy

(Image credit: Nintendo)

But it’s impossible to deny the legacy of Nintendo’s console. For a start it was influential at a hardware-design level. As Schuneman pointed out every console manufacturer eventually borrowed bits of the N64 controller even if its distinctive shape wasn’t one of them and four controller ports became standard until wireless connectivity made them redundant. What’s more it’s arguable that the N64 did more than any of its rivals to advance 3D gaming. It was a small but significant step forward graphically - when compared to the blocky textures and wobbly walls of PlayStation and Saturn games N64 games generally look more solid and stable.

But more than that the hardware arrived at a time when developers were still working out how to design 3D games and the reason that the N64’s hit list is so familiar is because so many of its games provided a template for the rest of the industry to follow. It’s certainly

telling that Nintendo didn’t radically alter its designs for Mario and Zelda on the GameCube. Twenty-five years on that’s perhaps the best way to contextualise the N64’s place in history. It’s a piece of hardware that was designed by experts in 3D who didn’t just care about having it as a selling point but making it look better than anyone else did. It ran games that elevated the standards that players expected of 3D games from control schemes to inventive stage designs. Although it wasn’t the most popular platform of its day the N64 was the console that confidently signposted our way into the 3D future.

ATV

That’s because licensing deals cost money and most vehicle manufacturers have already struck such deals with game studios that promote their products in a more direct manner – like with racing sims where the vehicles act as main protagonists instead of just tools for your character to get from checkpoint to checkpoint.Howeverand snowmobile-maker Polaris is playing a different game pun intended. They’ve recently announced a first-of-its-kind partnership with EA’s Battlefield 2042 video game  thus becoming the official off-road vehicle partner of the platform.This means that players can drive the Polaris Sportsman ATV within the gameplay of Battlefield 2042 as showcased in the video below.“At Polaris we are passionate about creating products that enable possibilities for work and play in the outdoors. Our partnership with Battlefield 2042 brings that real-life passion to a virtual world to help enhance the player’s experience and ability” said Holly Spaeth director Corporate Branding and Partnerships Polaris. “As gaming grows and diversifies this partnership allows us to reach new and existing audiences with an authentic brand experience.”This partnership between the American off-road firm and Electronic Arts arrives at a very lucrative time for both the powersports and gaming industries which are expected to see continued growth in the coming years. In fact the gaming industry is estimated to reach $200 billion by 2023 whereas the powersports segment projects eclipsing $25 billion by 2027.The Polaris Sportsman range is currently spearheaded by the Sportsman XP 1000 which has a starting MSRP of $14499 and the Sportsman XP 1000 S which will set you back upwards of $16599. The latter is considered by Polaris to be the industry’s most capable ATV.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRleGVydG8uY29tL2JhdHRsZWZpZWxkL2JhdHRsZWZpZWxkLTIwNDItcGxheWVycy1zbGFtLWVhLW92ZXItYml6YXJyZS1wcm9kdWN0LXBsYWNlbWVudC1wbGF5ZXJjYXJkcy0xNzI4MDgzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Battlefield 2042 players slam EA over bizarre ‘product placement’ playercards,"Battlefield 2042 players are flaming publisher EA after they’ve noticed the addition of playercards with incredibly obvious (and borderline obnoxious) product placement.

It’s fair to say that EA DICE’s latest addition to their flagship franchise Battlefield 2042 has got off to a rocky start. Despite the advent of Season 1 on the horizon the game has become so unpopular with players that they’ve decided to revisit older games.

If that wasn’t enough to dissuade players from picking up 2042 the discovery of blatant product placement has others up in arms about the divisive game.

DICE Battlefield 2042 players will need something special from EA DICE to keep the game afloat.

Battlefield 2042 players slam EA’s approach

Product placement isn’t an alien concept in modern media but it can infringe on having a fun experience if done wrong. In the case of Battlefield 2042 EA has seemingly begun implementing adverts for brands such as Logitech.

The Logitech playercard is part of a pack that includes “2 weapon skins and an EABB Wildcat skin” according to user u/Arkonungr. It also takes up a substantial portion of the screen during a pre-game lobby.

U/VagueSomething posited that Battlefield’s marketing at least ironically fits with the game’s nightmarish tone: “You’re paying to see this ad in-game but someone else likely paid to show you this ad on their profile. At least this part of the game’s atmosphere is a dystopian nightmare like the lore claims the world is.”

“Wait until you start seeing FIFA card pack advertisements within the new maps! On buildings and all!” added fellow player u/PavlovDoes.

This isn’t the first time that the franchise has displayed ads within the game either: “2142 had advertisement billboards as well. And that was a decade ago.”

Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz and developed by EQT Exeter with Studio Bryan Hanes behind the landscape design the 700000-square-foot-plus building is part of Cathedral Square a redevelopment master plan for the block-sized archdiocesan campus around the iconic Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul. The building will offer 450000 square feet of office space on floors two through 14. Luxury residential space will span 250000 square feet on floors 15 through 34. The ground level will feature 4500 square feet of retail. The development will also include parking for 200 cars as well as a bicycle storage room. The building will be serviced by eight office elevators two residential elevators a freight elevator and a swing passenger-freight elevator within the residential component.

The building will bring vitality to a hostile anti-pedestrian block that aside from the cathedral and a few humdrum institutional buildings until recently chiefly consisted of parking lots and otherwise vacant land and was fenced-in on most sides. Instead the new building will energize the streetscape with a transparent glassed-in ground level retail and new landscaping. In the meantime the curvy setbacked bronze tower will have a notable presence on the skyline extending it further to the north.

Last year Two Cathedral Square then known under its tentative name of Cathedral Place Phase Two topped our December Countdown list with a speculative height of 685 feet. Although the building’s height has since been significantly scaled back we are still pleased with the trade-off because the city will get an exquisitely designed building that will fill a problematic gap in a central portion of the city.

Since the latest design was unveiled only recently the project is still clearly in the planning phase. As expected our site visit revealed that no demolition work has yet begun on the four-story structure that currently stands at the site nor at the adjacent parking lot.

This current status juxtaposes in stark contrast to One Cathedral Square a residential building that currently stands nearly topped out at 244 feet and 23 stories tall just to the south at 1701 Race Street. Its shorter yet still notable stature earned the building the 30th place on this year’s Countdown and construction may be finished by the time the next year’s Countdown rolls around.

A mouse mat that threatened to undermine global efforts to avert nuclear warfare. The sales photo on Etsy showed a blameless-looking rubber rectangle hand made in Leicester with a Persian rug motif. But PayPal decided that it violated international sanctions and suspended the account of the unsuspecting purchaser.

To understand the modern business model – and the contents of my consumer inbox – look no further than this “illicit” item.

A computer algorithm had decided the mat was Iranian contraband computer software suspended the customer’s PayPal account automated warnings threatened termination unless the customer could prove its provenance and customer service agents seemed powerless to apply human logic.

It was the same artificial intelligence and human apathy that forced graduates to keep funding repaid loans  informed an Ovo customer that they owed £19000 for two months of energy and allowed a 10-minute flight schedule change to scupper a honeymoon.

Add to the mix this year’s double act Brexit and Covid which gave companies two cast-iron new excuses for skirting consumer rights law. As much of the nation retreated to the sofa to work and Brexit muddied the rule book the computer was given ever greater control and customers found themselves trapped in limbo. “Kafkaesque nightmare” is a recurring phrase from our literary readers.

As always there are so many worthy contenders for an award but it’s been a pleasure to narrow them down to the following standout takes on customer service. In all cases the customer was only offered effective service after I intervened.

Most rubbish excuse

A joint gong for eBay and delivery firm UPS. When MS of Manchester sought a refund from an eBay seller for a £130 satnav that never arrived he was refused. eBay sided with the seller since tracking showed that the item had been delivered – to his rubbish bin. How could UPS have known that without a notification card MS would not think to check his wheelie bin before collection day?

Bleeding heart for empathy

Legal & General tried hard for this honour. It twice informed a grieving man that he had been bequeathed £14000 from his late sister’s pension plan before realising it had sent the forms to the wrong relative. Then it erroneously told the deceased’s father to expect £19000. The bequest was in fact intended for the grandson who in proud Scottish tradition bore the same name but a different address to his father and grandfather. The comically named “sensitive claims” department discovered it had lost the late woman’s letter of instruction and in its absence refused to discuss the legacy with her executors.

Surrealism in Whitehall

The UK government sweeps the table. Take your pick. The Department for Work and Pensions misunderstood its own rules and penalised a universal credit claimant for not applying while in an induced coma. The Home Office whose rules on residency permits are so misleading and whose stance when applicants are duly misled so intransigent that an eligible spouse was denied indefinite leave to remain and presented with a £1000 bill for NHS services.

Or there’s the Ministry of Justice’s multimillion- pound reforms to streamline the probate service. Closure of local probate offices a new online system declared unfit for purpose by legal firms and a Covid backlog have left families in legal limbo for up to nine months.

Most cunning cop-out

What’s more risky – explosives or footwear? Both score equally according to courier firm DPD. Its stance makes perfect sense. It allows customers to book a delivery for an identified item pay extra for insurance cover and then if the consignment goes missing and a claim is made it can duck a payout by declaring it’s on a list of prohibited items along with human flesh and counterfeit currency.

Vigilant customers who study delivery exclusions may be none the wiser. DPD forbids the mailing of “personal effects” while Hermes refuses to pay compensation in the event it wrecks or loses “composite items of any description” or “items which can be exchanged by themselves or with any other item for money or goods or services”.

Brexit bonus prize

WK of Cumbria’s purposeful lockdown hours were spent contesting a £111 customs charge on a £12 wall bracket. It had been omitted from a delivery from the German company Loxhome in November 2020 and sent separately in the new year. By then post-Brexit customs charges had kicked in. The duty for the bracket was applied to the entire £460 order. WK refused delivery to avoid the charges. But courier UPS returned to slip it through his letter box and by the time the Observer intervened debt collectors were pursuing him for £115.

Meanwhile a new identity was the Brexit bonus for some startled EU nationals who had been granted EU Settled Status in the UK. A Home Office computer anomaly meant that women who had lived for decades under their married surname were registered under their birth name which appears first on some EU passports. They faced losing access to services because their proof of residency rights did not match official documents.

Great escape artists

Holidays! Remember those jaunts to Mediterranean beaches in the old days? While the few who dared set their sights on sunny climes battle for refunds for cancelled trips many who played safe and booked local are also out of pocket. One reader did get as far as Cornwall only to discover that the five-star water resort he’d booked had no record of him. Booking.com reassured the family they had been rebooked – in the beguiling suburb of Uxbridge 250 miles away.

Airbnb meanwhile decided that lockdowns are not an extenuating circumstance for cancellation and refused to require hosts to refund customers whose trips were banned by government rules while deducting its 15% service fee from hosts who decided to do the right thing.

Distinguished desertion order

The high street banks can share this between them for abandoning scam victims to penury. Criminals have again been the biggest Covid winners with increasingly sophisticated strategies to access personal accounts . The good news is major banks have pledged to refund victims who were not unduly negligent. The bad is they often try their darnedest to wriggle out of it.

I’ve investigated unrefunded losses of £900000 this year and persuaded banks to return 54% including a £225000 pension pot stolen from a retired detective by a cloned investment firm.

Nationwide deserves the spotlight for failing to protect and refusing to refund a pensioner’s £70000 life savings stolen in a similarly sophisticated scam. It finally offered to refund her a year later following contact from the Financial Ombudsman Service.",,,,,,,,,

Photo courtesy GoFundMe/Quackerstown School Disrict

Dec. 25 (UPI) -- Three members of one family -- a dad and two sons -- died early Christmas Day in a house fire near Philadelphia that investigators say may have been caused by electrical issues and a dry Christmas tree. Police and fire were dispatched to the house at 1:22 a.m. Saturday in Quarterstown which is about 47 miles north of Philadelpia. Five family members were asleep on the second floor Fire Marshal Doug Wilhelm told CNN. Advertisement

Eric King 41 and his two sons Liam 11 and Patrick 8 died as well as two dogs. The mother Kristin and the family's eldest son Brady an eighth-grader escaped with minor burns and were treated and release at Lehigh Valley Hospital.

""The area of origin was a Christmas tree so we're not sure if it's because of electric or a dried up old Christmas tree"" Wilhelmtold CNN.

First responders had a tough time time entering the house due to the magnitude of the blaze the fire marshal said.

""It was too dangerous to get inside on the front side of the building with the fire"" Wilhelm told CNN. ""The front door and front window were blocked fire was advancing to the entire home at that point. It was very difficult for firefighters to make a safe entry. It took a while.""

Police Chief Scott McElree said the wooden stick-frame construction also likely helped the fire move quickly.

""A Christmas tree burns very quickly and very hot"" McElree told the Courier Times. ""When tree go dry its a violent and robust source. There is an immense amount of heat and that probably contributed.""

A GoFundMe page created in support of the King family has raised more than $200000.

""Eric and Kristin were high school sweethearts and the happiest people you will have ever met"" the post on GoFundMe said. ""They were always smiling and full of positive spirits you just couldn't help but to love them. The three boys Eric and Kristin were all a huge part of the Quakertown Youth Baseball Association and spent their days and nights at the baseball fields.""

The Quakertown School District posted on Facebook: This news is devastating for the District community and the Quakertown area at-large.

""Eric and Kristin are very active in the community and the kind of people who make this a special place to live and attend school.""

The fire also destroyed a home next door.

""I couldn't see anybody so I thought that they got everyone out but it was kind of sad"" Wilson Martinez of Quakertown told WPVI-TV. "" Really sad to realize that not everybody was saved"" said Wilson Martinez of Quakertown.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Fans and critics often compare Tom Hanks to James Stewart. After all both actors have a certain everyman quality to them. Audiences tend to trust characters Hanks plays and they want to follow him anywhere finding it easy to identify with the people he plays on screen. Such is the case with Cast Away which inspired many fans to consider changing their careers after seeing Hanks’ performance.

Tom Hanks’ ‘Cast Away’ character pointedly works for FedEx

In Cast Away Hanks plays Chuck Noland an employee for FedEx whose specialty is to maximize the company’s productivity. The character travels the world to analyze and resolve systems issues at various FedEx offices. And its during one of his many business trips that his plane goes down stranding Chuck on a deserted island.

Thematically part of the character’s arc is watching him survive in an environment completely at odds with his skill set. Suddenly Chuck’s ability to keep FedEx employees productive and on schedule feels useless. Eventually he develops processes and systems of his own that keep him alive for more than four years before eventually escaping.

The film’s release spurred a huge influx in job applications

While on the island Chuck also uses items found in the many FedEx packages that were on his plane. But he pointedly keeps one package unopened the film’s way of representing his hope for the future. All in all it’s a solid representation of FedEx perhaps one of the best bits of product placement in a movie in a long while.

And Cast Away inspired a ton of moviegoers to want to work for FedEx. According to reports the company saw job applications shoot up 30 percent after Hanks’ movie hit theaters. FedEx was intimately involved in the movie allowing access to their property and overseeing production. CEO Fred Smith even makes a cameo in Cast Away. Thankfully all the hard work on the part of FedEx seemed to have paid off.

Tom Hanks has a history of playing high-stakes professionals

Along with Apollo 13 Cast Away is also one of the first instances in which Hanks plays a high-level professional. Audiences have now gotten used to seeing Hanks play characters who are good at their job. Key examples include his performances as heroic pilot Chesley Sullenberger in Sully attorney James B. Donovan in Bridge of Spies and even mystery-solving symbologist Robert Langdon in The Da Vinci Code and its sequels.

Given this type of role is it any wonder why so many Hanks fans consider him “America’s Dad”? The actor insists on playing so many real people in his movies. And this fact certainly highlights both his willingness to take on true stories and his confidence that audiences will follow him anywhere even to a deserted island.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlYWNvbmpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8xMi8yNi9zdW1taXQtY291bnR5LXByb3BlcnR5LXZhbHVlcy10YXhlcy1sb3dlcmVkLXRocm91Z2gtY29tcGxhaW50cy84OTI2MzA0MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Summit County property values taxes lowered through complaints,"No commitment required.

To understand the full scale of this decision we have to go back a couple of weeks to when the Cowboys traveled to FedEx Field to face Washington. Before that game the Cowboys had gotten word from the Seahawks that the heated benches on the visitor's side of Washington's home field had some issues.

As a result Dallas decided to bring its own customized ""Dallas"" benches to the stadium. Naturally Washington didn't take that decision too well so it's returning the favor.

COWBOYS VS. WASHINGTON: Latest odds prediction for ""SNF""

Washington rented benches from the same company where the Cowboys got theirs — Dragon Seats — and will have them at its final three road games of the season. It may have made sense to do this for a Tuesday night game in Philadelphia where the temperature was in the 30s but the decision to lug these benches to Arlington as a measure of revenge is as comical as it is pointless.

The Cowboys play at AT&T Stadium. That stadium is located in Arlington. The temperature in Arlington on Sunday is 76 degrees and features a low of 63. So based on the weather alone Washington wouldn't need the heating capabilities of their rented benches.

Of course the funniest part of this all is that AT&T Stadium is an indoor arena. As such it's climate-controlled. So even if it was a cold day in Texas Washington would have no need for these heated benches.

NFL PLAYOFF PICTURE: Where Cowboys Washington rank in NFC

The gesture isn't so much about utility on Washington's part. It's more about flipping its rival the bird and getting some extra Washington logos on the sideline.

But perhaps Washington should focus more of its resources on winning against Dallas. They are sitting at 6-8 and will almost certainly need to win out to have a chance at one of the NFC's final wild card spots in 2021. Certainly the players and coaches had nothing to do with this decision but giving the Cowboys any extra motivation and fuel in a rivalry game certainly doesn't seem like a good idea.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiwgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZmFhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Nwb3J0cy9uZmwvY293Ym95cy9jb3B5Y2F0LWxlYWd1ZS13YXNoaW5ndG9uLXNob3dzLXVwLXRvLWRhbGxhcy1jb3dib3lzLWF0dC1zdGFkaXVtLXdpdGgtaXRzLW93bi1oZWF0ZWQtYmVuY2hlcy1ldmVuLWluZG9vcnMvMjg3LTdjOGEyMjc3LWYyYmQtNDU1OC05NjYxLTIxNzlhMzlhZTk0NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Washington brings own heated benches to Dallas for indoor game,"After Dallas brought their own heated benches to Washington two weeks ago the visiting Football Team on Sunday showed up with heated benches of their own.

ARLINGTON Texas — Who doesn't love a good rivalry?

The Cowboys will apparently settle for the standard (and non-heated) aluminum benches for Sunday night's game.

The bench drama started earlier this month when the Cowboys caught wind that Washington's heated benches were known to go off and on during a game.

So Dallas ordered their own benches Cowboys logo and all and had them shipped to Washington's FedEx Field which is decidedly not indoors and where temperatures were in the 40s.

Washington responded by ordering the same benches from the same Ohio company and bringing them on the road for the rest of the season according to ESPN.

And so on Sunday their burgundy-and-gold benches arrived at AT&T Stadium where the temperatures outside were in the 70s and the playing conditions inside were just as comfortable.

At the risk of being unprepared Washington also positioned giant cooling machines next to their custom warming benches according to ESPN's Ed Werder.

At least they'll be ready for anything.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvaG93LXRvbS1oYW5rcy1jYXN0LWF3YXktYWNjaWRlbnRhbGx5LWluc3BpcmVkLWhpdC10di1zaG93Lmh0bWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Tom Hanks' 'Cast Away' Accidentally Inspired a Hit TV Show,"Tom Hanks has starred in some of the most popular films of the past few decades. The two-time Academy Award winner carried thrillers comedies dramas and every in between. He’s even on occasion been known to voice a certain string-puppet cowboy doll much to the delight of audiences the world over. Hanks has such charisma that moviegoers everywhere flocked to see him hang out on an island by himself in 2000’s Cast Away. But most probably don’t realize that film inspired a hugely popular television show.

Tom Hanks in ‘Cast Away’ | 20th Century-Fox/Getty Images

Tom Hanks’ ‘Cast Away’ rocked the box office in 2000

Reuniting with Forrest Gump director Robert Zemeckis probably wasn’t a difficult decision for Hanks. After all that film earned hundreds of millions at the domestic box office way back in 1994. But few probably expected the filmmaker and his star to turn their attention to a story about a FedEx employee who winds up stranded on a deserted island.

Yet against all odds Cast Away became a sensation. On a reported $90 million production budget the movie earned $430 million worldwide. Hanks even received an Academy Award nomination for his performance though his co-star Wilson was snubbed for Best Supporting Volleyball.

The movie led to the creation of ABC’s hit show ‘Lost’

Of course Hollywood would want to capitalize on the success of Cast Away in some way. Plans for a TV series inspired by the Zemeckis film never truly got off the ground. However they later evolved into a pitch for a series called Nowhere according to Chicago Magazine. That seed of an idea eventually grew into what would become the hit TV series Lost.

That show followed the survivors of an airplane crash who find themselves trapped on a mysterious island. And for six seasons viewers came back week after week to learn more about the seemingly supernatural forces at play on Lost. The series — which ran from 2004 to 2010 — featured an ensemble cast that included Matthew Fox Evangeline Lilly Terry O’Quinn and Jorge Garcia.

TV shows based on Tom Hanks’ movies never really work

Perhaps it’s for the best that a Cast Away show never got off the ground. Hollywood has tried numerous times to adapt the actor’s films for TV. And that idea never worked. Shows based on Bachelor Party and Big never happened either. Even the recent Disney+ series Turner and Hooch — based on Hanks’ 1989 movie of the same name — was canceled after a single season.

Even though Hanks first shot to stardom on TV’s Bosom Buddies his movies are usually so dependent on his own on-screen charisma to exist without his involvement. Such is certainly the case in Cast Away as the movie is a one-man show for much of its runtime. And it worked out for fans of ABC’s Lost which went a radically different direction with a similar premise."

FORT SMITH -- The implementation of solar energy -- along with the expectation of cost savings -- has been spreading through city and county facilities in the River Valley.

Greenwood held a ribbon-cutting ceremony Nov. 30 for the first of two solar power plants to be used for municipal buildings. The facility is on city-owned property at 606 Jayhawker Lane and supplies electricity for 98% of Greenwood government operations in the Arkansas Valley Electric Cooperative service territory according to the city. This includes the city's Fire Station 2 Ed Wilkinson Community Pavilion and wastewater treatment plant and office.

Mayor Doug Kinslow expressed hope the second facility will be operational by spring. This will power City Hall the police and fire departments and the water plant as well as the shop buildings for the water wastewater and street departments in the Southwestern Electric Power Co. service territory.

Tom Marsh Greenwood's finance director said it's estimated that these two plants combined will save the city more than $2 million over 30 years. Kinslow said the city will be able to reinvest this money in other things in addition to reducing its carbon footprint.

""We don't have a set plan of said power savings going toward streets or anything like that but obviously the less money you spend in paying utility bills we have that much more money to operate"" Kinslow said.

Sebastian County also has been moving toward solar energy. A new solar array in Midland began operating Oct. 5 according to County Judge David Hudson supplying energy for county buildings in Greenwood powered by Southwestern Electric Power Co. including the Greenwood Courthouse and the county Road Department and EMS facilities.

Hudson estimated that another solar energy site -- in a rural unincorporated area on Arkansas 22 near Lavaca -- is nearly complete. It is expected to go live Jan. 21 and power county facilities -- such as the Fort Smith Courthouse and the county courts building in addition to the county's properties at Ben Geren Park -- in Fort Smith under Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co.

McKinstry a Seattle-based company with an office in Little Rock is managing this project Hudson said. The company guaranteed a cumulative net savings of $444906 for the county from the project over 20 years.

""In evaluating the cost of electric bills supporting all of our properties versus the cost of implementing solar and reducing those costs even with the expense of investing in the solar equipment in the solar option financially the county came out ahead by pursuing solar energy"" Hudson said. ""It was a way to help operate county government more efficiently.""

This comes after Clarksville and Alma both developed solar power facilities within the past couple of years in collaboration with outside companies.

Bill Halter chief executive officer of the Little Rock-based Scenic Hill Solar said the two solar power plants his company built for Clarksville Connected Utilities are among the largest of their kind in Arkansas. They also resulted in Clarksville being the first community in the state whose governmental operations were completely solar-powered.

These facilities one 6.5 megawatts and another 2.86 megawatts were completed in 2017 and 2019 respectively Halter said.

Alma held a ""flip the switch"" event in February for a solar array to power the city's wastewater treatment facility and a city-owned lift station. This was the first phase of a 28-year solar services agreement with Entegrity Energy Partners in Little Rock according to Mayor Jerry Martin.

Martin said it is hoped phase two of the project a solar array to power the rest of the city's municipal buildings will be up and running by the third quarter of 2022. The project was designed to offset about 80% to 85% of the city government's total electric consumption.

GREENWOOD

Kinslow said the groundbreaking for Greenwood's new solar power plant was held May 19. The city's public-private partnership with Scenic Hill Solar to build two of these facilities was announced in January after the city entered into a 30-year contract with the company the previous August.

Halter said Scenic Hill Solar will build own and operate both facilities while selling electricity to the city of Greenwood. The company is responsible for all construction operation and maintenance costs. The first project has an appraised value of about $1.5 million while the second project's is about $400000.

Greenwood's only investment for this was about $40000 for 10 acres to accommodate the first facility Kinslow said. The second plant will be on city-owned property at 850 Marymont Drive.

Marsh said Scenic Hill Solar will provide the energy the plants produce to Arkansas Valley Electric Cooperative and Southwestern Electric Power Co. as kilowatt hour credits. The kilowatt hours the city will use through the municipal buildings in the service territories of these two companies will achieve the credits against what Scenic Hill provided to them.

""During the year for the months that we have more net credit than we have use we will only receive an admin bill from Arkansas Valley and SWEPCO"" Marsh said. ""We do not receive a bill for the actual energy because it was provided to them through Scenic Hill Solar through our panels.""

The city's agreement with Scenic Hill Solar gives the city the option to purchase the two facilities after six years of operation according to Marsh.

The two plants which contain more than 2300 solar modules combined will produce more than 40.2 million kilowatt hours of electricity over 30 years according to a city news release. The electricity they will create will satisfy half the electricity consumption for city governmental operations.

SEBASTIAN COUNTY

Hudson said Sebastian County's solar energy project with McKinstry was authorized in September 2019. The cost of the project is about $2.6 million. The county made a $600000 down payment from one of its reserve accounts and financed the remaining balance of about $1.9 million over 20 years.

The county's two solar facilities will have more than 4000 solar modules combined according to specifications provided by Hudson.

The solar energy generated by these sites like the system in Greenwood will be stored and credited in coordination with either Southwestern Electric Power Co. or Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. depending on the facilities Hudson said. The county will also get credit for any excess energy these arrays generate.

However Sebastian County's solar power systems belong to the county Hudson said.

NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope launched at 7:20 a.m. EST Saturday on an Ariane 5 rocket from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana South America.

A joint effort with ESA (European Space Agency) and the Canadian Space Agency the Webb observatory is NASA’s revolutionary flagship mission to seek the light from the first galaxies in the early universe and to explore our own solar system as well as planets orbiting other stars called exoplanets.

Arianespace’s Ariane 5 rocket launches with NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope onboard Saturday Dec. 25 2021 from the ELA-3 Launch Zone of Europe’s Spaceport at the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou French Guiana. The James Webb Space Telescope (sometimes called JWST or Webb) is a large infrared telescope with a 21.3 foot (6.5 meter) primary mirror. The observatory will study every phase of cosmic history—from within our solar system to the most distant observable galaxies in the early universe.

“The James Webb Space Telescope represents the ambition that NASA and our partners maintain to propel us forward into the future” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “The promise of Webb is not what we know we will discover; it’s what we don’t yet understand or can’t yet fathom about our universe. I can’t wait to see what it uncovers!”

Ground teams began receiving telemetry data from Webb about five minutes after launch. The Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket performed as expected separating from the observatory 27 minutes into the flight. The observatory was released at an altitude of approximately 870 miles (1400 kilometers). Approximately 30 minutes after launch Webb unfolded its solar array and mission managers confirmed that the solar array was providing power to the observatory. After solar array deployment mission operators will establish a communications link with the observatory via the Malindi ground station in Kenya and ground control at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore will send the first commands to the spacecraft.

Engineers and ground controllers will conduct the first of three mid-course correction burns about 12 hours and 30 minutes after launch firing Webb’s thrusters to maneuver the spacecraft on an optimal trajectory toward its destination in orbit about 1 million miles from Earth.

“I want to congratulate the team on this incredible achievement – Webb’s launch marks a significant moment not only for NASA but for thousands of people worldwide who dedicated their time and talent to this mission over the years” said Thomas Zurbuchen associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “Webb’s scientific promise is now closer than it ever has been. We are poised on the edge of a truly exciting time of discovery of things we’ve never before seen or imagined.”

The world’s largest and most complex space science observatory will now begin six months of commissioning in space. At the end of commissioning Webb will deliver its first images. Webb carries four state-of-the-art science instruments with highly sensitive infrared detectors of unprecedented resolution. Webb will study infrared light from celestial objects with much greater clarity than ever before. The premier mission is the scientific successor to NASA’s iconic Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes built to complement and further the scientific discoveries of these and other missions.

“The launch of the Webb Space Telescope is a pivotal moment – this is just the beginning for the Webb mission” said Gregory L. Robinson Webb’s program director at NASA Headquarters. “Now we will watch Webb’s highly anticipated and critical 29 days on the edge. When the spacecraft unfurls in space Webb will undergo the most difficult and complex deployment sequence ever attempted in space. Once commissioning is complete we will see awe-inspiring images that will capture our imagination.”

The telescope’s revolutionary technology will explore every phase of cosmic history – from within our solar system to the most distant observable galaxies in the early universe to everything in between. Webb will reveal new and unexpected discoveries and help humanity understand the origins of the universe and our place in it.

NASA Headquarters oversees the mission for the agency’s Science Mission Directorate. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland manages Webb for the agency and oversees work on the mission performed by the Space Telescope Science Institute Northrop Grumman and other mission partners. In addition to Goddard several NASA centers contributed to the project including the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley and others.

The milestones were the first major events for Webb since its successful launch Christmas morning aboard a European Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana. The Ariane 5 placed the 13584-pound (6161-kilogram) observatory right on target on a course into deep space with Webb in stretched or elliptical orbit with an apogee or high point more than a million kilometers (600000 miles) from Earth.

After deploying its solar array and priming its propulsion system following separation from the Ariane 5 upper stage the spacecraft fired one of its main thrusters beginning at 7:50 p.m. EST Saturday (0050 GMT Sunday) for the mission’s Mid Course Correction 1a or MCC 1a maneuver.

The Ariane 5 rocket aimed to deploy the nearly $10 billion observatory at a velocity just shy of the speed required to reach the L2 Lagrange point a gravitationally-neutral spot nearly a million miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth four times farther than the moon’s orbit.

The launch trajectory was selected to ensure Webb could make up the speed required to enter orbit around the L2 Lagrange point rather than needing to turn around to use its thrusters for a braking maneuver. A burn to slow down would force Webb to point its sensitive optics toward the sun risking damage.

The Ariane 5 rocket placed Webb almost exactly on its planned course into deep space according to officials from NASA and the European Space Agency which supplied the launch vehicle as part of its contribution to the mission.

Webb fired one of its four hydrazine-fueled Secondary Combustion Augmented Thrusters or SCATs for 65 minutes Saturday night making up nearly all of the expected velocity shortfall needed to reach an orbit around the L2 Lagrange point.

Another burn named MCC 1b is penciled in the Webb flight plan Monday night. Keith Parrish Webb’s commissioning manager at NASA said before the launch that the MCC 1b burn might not be required depending on the trajectory analysis following the MCC 1a maneuver.

Webb controllers at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore Maryland perform ranging measurements with the spacecraft using radio signals passed between Webb and ground stations around the world. The data gives engineers information about Webb’s location and speed allowing navigators to plot future trajectory correction maneuvers. In some cases they might not be needed Parrish said.

Another mid-course correction burn designated MCC 2 is planned 29 days after launch — around Jan. 23 — to inject Webb into its halo orbit around L2.

Webb has four main SCAT engines. One redundant pair is used for the MCC 1a and 1b burns while the other redundant set is used the MCC 2 maneuver and all subsequent stationkeeping burns to keep Webb in its orbit around L2 during its science mission.

Sixteen smaller thrusters divided into eight thruster modules each with two engines are used for pointing control and to offload momentum from the observatory’s six spinning reaction wheels which steer Webb toward its science targets. The reaction wheels were activated soon after Webb’s launch Saturday.

With the MCC 1a burn out of the way Webb deployed its high-rate communications antenna shortly after 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT) Sunday according to NASA.

The Gimbaled Antenna Assembly or GAA includes Webb’s 2-foot-diameter (60-centimeter) high-gain dish antenna. The Ka-band antenna will be used to transmit at least 28.6 Gbytes of science data down from the observatory twice per day NASA said.

Ground teams released and tested the motion of the antenna during Sunday’s deployment activity.

Before the release of the Ka-band antenna Webb communicated to ground teams using a broad-beam S-band antenna at lower data rates. The Ka-band high-gain antenna can downlink data at a speed of up to 3.5 Mbytes per second.

Other steps completed on Webb’s first full day in space included the switch-on of temperature sensors and strain gauges on the telescope used for monitoring Webb’s thermal and structural parameters NASA said.

The antenna release and first mid-course correction burn set the stage for the next step of Webb’s post-launch commissioning — the deployment and tensioning of the observatory’s tennis court-sized sunshield.

The five-layer thermal barrier will keep Webb’s telescope and instruments in permanent shade allowing the optics and detectors to reach a temperature of minus 388 degrees Fahrenheit or 40 degrees above absolute zero. The super-cold temperatures are necessary for Webb’s infrared instruments to detect faint infrared light from the distant universe.

Two pallets containing the sunshield membranes will fold down from their launch position as soon as Tuesday if controllers stay on the pre-planned flight schedule. That will allow for the release and tensioning of the sunshield this weekend.

Two wings holding six of Webb’s 18 hexagonal primary mirror segments are expected to fold into place in early January building the shape of the observatory’s 21.3-foot-diameter (6.5-meter) optical surface. Then comes additional steps to align the mirror and bring it into focus all while engineers turn on and test each fo Webb’s four science instruments.

But Webb’s time-sensitive commissioning steps — the solar array deployment and first course correction burn — are now complete. Teams have more flexibility in scheduling the remaining commissioning steps over the next six months culminating in the release of the first science images some time in mid-2022.

India does not have a solar waste management policy but it does have ambitious solar power installation targets.

Solar waste — the electronic waste generated by discarded solar panels — is sold as scrap in the country. It can increase by at least four-five-fold by the next decade. India should focus its attention on drafting comprehensive rules to deal with solar waste.

The issue was not addressed in the last electronic waste management regulations in 2016. SolarPower Europe and PVCycle supported by the European Union in India and the Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy could generate over 34600 tonnes of cumulative solar waste in India by 2030 according to a report prepared by the National Solar Energy Federation of India.

Solar panels have a life of 20-25 years so the problem of waste seems distant. It is likely that India will be faced with solar waste problems by the end of this decade and solar waste will end up being the most prevalent form of waste in landfills soon.

It is therefore imperative that a policy be formulated soon.

While photovoltaics generate only about 3 per cent of global electricity they consume 40 per cent of the world’s tellurium 15 per cent of the world’s silver a substantial chunk of semiconductor-grade quartz and lesser but still significant amounts of indium zinc tin and gallium.

A holistic approach to solar energy includes not only a green and clean perspective but also resource and material management.

The two most popular module technologies in India are crystallised silicon (C-Si) and thin-film (mainly cadmium telluride CdTe) with 93 and 7 per cent market shares respectively. Both the technologies have a recovery rate of 85-90 per cent.

The market value of raw materials recovered from solar panels could reach $450 million by 2030 according to a projection by the International Renewable Energy Agency.

In other words this amount of raw materials is approximately the same as that required to build 60 million new solar panels or to generate 18 GW of electricity.

The value of recoverable materials might surpass $15 billion by 2050 which would be enough to power 630 GW with two billion solar panels. Globally it is expected that end-of-life (EoL) of solar panels will drive the solar panel recycling business in the next 10-20 years.

Then why are we not recycling more?

The large cost gap between recycling and discarding panels in landfills points to an unpleasant truth: The process generates roughly $3 in revenue from the recovery of certain materials.

Recycling a solar panel cost between $20 and $30 according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory; sending it to a landfill costs $1-2.

How are other countries handling solar waste?

The EU is clearly ahead of other regions in terms of framing and implementing waste management policies for PV waste. The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive of the EU imposes responsibility for the disposal of waste on the manufacturers or distributors who introduce or install such equipment for the first time.

PV manufacturers are solely responsible for the collection handling and treatment of modules at the end of their lifecycle according to the WEEE Directive.

Currently most of the EU member states have come up with directives for collecting handling and management of PV waste.

The UK also has an industry-managed “take-back and recycling scheme” where all PV producers will need to register and submit data related to products used for the residential solar market (B2C) and non-residential market.

While there are no federal statutes or regulations in the United States that talk about recycling there are some states who have proactively defined policies to address end-of-life PV module management.

Washington and California have come up with extended producer responsibility (EPR) regulations. Washington now requires PV module manufacturers to finance the take-back and reuse or recycling of PV modules sold within or into the state at no cost to the end-user.

In addition New Jersey and North Carolina passed legislation in 2019 to study and explore PV module management options that can help in forming future legislations.

The federal government In Australia has acknowledged the concern and announced $2 million grant as part of the National Product Stewardship Investment Fund to develop and implement an industry-led product stewardship scheme for PV systems.

It is expected that the scheme will encourage shared responsibility throughout the supply chain to manage the impacts of PV modules through their life cycle and support the development of an efficient and innovative domestic PV recycling industry.

Countries such as Japan and South Korea have already indicated their resolve to come up with dedicated legislation to address the PV waste problem.

India needs a three-pronged approach to handle the mammoth quantum of PV waste it will generate in the next 10 years.

Roadmap to resource-efficient solar energy

Strong e-waste or renewable energy waste laws: EPR for the manufacturer and developers to take responsibility for end-of-life the solar panel. PV modules were the first to be included in the EU’s WEEE regulations. It includes options for financing waste management.

Infrastructure: To bring down the cost of recycling infrastructure investment is required coordination between the energy and waste sector to efficiently handle the renewable energy waste and build more recycling plants to avoid solar panels to end up in landfills.

Founded by module makers PV Cycle offers its members regional compliance services. The United States-based PV module manufacturer First Solar has its own thin-film recycling facility.

Environmental disposal and recycling of solar waste could be part of the power purchase agreement SECI / DISCOMS / government signs with project developers.

Ban on Landfills: Solar panel waste is harmful to the environment as it contains toxic metals and minerals that may seep in the ground.

New business models incentives or issues of green certificates to be provided to encourage the recycling industry to participate more.

Research and Development: Innovation in design may have an impact on the type of waste they generate; technology advancements will be significant in reducing the impact of renewable energy waste. New panels for example use less silicon and produce less waste during the manufacturing process."

The positives that came out of Eastlake this year not only include the Lake County Captains being able to have a season but the events that the city hosted.

“The city had more events throughout the season that brought people out. We’re going to continue to work on getting some movie nights in and just build on what we’ve done this year” said Eastlake Mayor Dennis Morley. “We already have eight concerts scheduled for next year behind City Hall.”

The pandemic cancelled the Captains’ 2020 season which hurt the city and its businesses in revenue but Morley said the city was fortunate the minor league baseball team played again this year at Classic Park.

“We’re still learning and trying to bring back a lot more” he said. “We put out a survey with our residents and we’re working on some stuff. The concert we had at the stadium with the band was good. We had our 70th birthday party at City Hall.

“The car shows were really good every Thursday throughout the year and we also had the Christkindl Market” he added. “We were overwhelmed at how many people showed up. For a Sunday in December and to have 50 degree temperatures and the sun out was great.”

Another large highlight this year was the reopening of the Eastlake Senior Center.

“Our senior center was new with all the work we’ve done to reopen that” Morley said.

Seniors were able to walk through the doors of their new senior center located at 600 E. 349th St. in Eastlake Wednesday morning. (Marah Morrison -- The News-Herald).

The city recently had a meeting with the health district to learn that the coronavirus is spreading again but not as bad.

“We’re hoping we’re not going to go backwards” the mayor said.

For 2022 the city is looking forward to the opening of the Culver’s restaurant and the two Washington Elementary and Taft Elementary property developments. At Washington everything including the roads are in and the rest of the utilities and the model home will follow by February or April so it can start to sell.

“They are working on the plans for the Taft development which will be another 32 homes” Morley said. “The lakefront — we worked on the Special Improvement District (SID). We signed all the paperwork with the banks so we can start getting our residents and their contractors the payments to get that going.

“Once that happens I think more residents will see this is a reality and apply for the SID.”

The mayor said Eastlake is proud of the SID and could not have done it without all of the neighboring lakefront communities’ involvement.

“We have the biggest SID in the state and we worked hard over a few years to get that done” Morley said. “We’ve been working on the TLCI (grant) for three years. We need to get moving on that so we can get more funding to fix Vine Street and to make it more presentable throughout our cities.”

Meanwhile the city acquired Borac’s Landing in 2021 and the city plans to make that a passive park Morley said.

“I’ve been working with (Willoughby Mayor Robert Fiala) and some of the other groups to get a walking trail at least from Borac’s Landing up to the Willoughby Park and Chagrin River Park which is the biggest park used in all of Lake County to the Metroparks” he said.

In addition to Chagrin Tavern opening on the river there will be another restaurant opening right after the first of the year on the river as well Morley said. He also recently met with a new group that will be purchasing the Vineyards Shopping Center.

“They’re the fourth purchaser of that property since I’ve been mayor” he said. “We’re hoping something sticks there and we can get more businesses in there on Vine. “My goals especially are going to be to try to get the FirstEnergy property and the pier.

“If we had that pair and we get the acreage we’ve asked for we would have one of the nicest beaches in the county.”",,,,,,,,,

Giannis Antetokounmpo has established his name as of the NBA’s most prominent stars over the years. The Milwaukee Bucks player has trademarked his aggressive and physical play style and it has helped him dominate the basketball court warding off opponents. Recently Giannis found himself involved in a controversy when he used vulgarity during a game.

NBA fans on ‘r/nba’ a community dedicated to NBA news and discussion noticed what Giannis said to a rival player. Giannis and the Bucks played against the Boston Celtics when Giannis used vulgar language against a Celtics player. He mouthed the obscenity to Marcus Smart who attempted at defending the Bucks star.

Giannis breezed past the Celtics’ hurried defense and entered the paint to attempt a layup when Marcus Smart attempted a charge on him. He sustained the contact as he completed his layup and fell due to the contact. After landing Giannis told one of his teammates purportedly referring to Smart “I can’t f*cking stand that p*ssy.”

The 27-years old Greek joined the NBA in 2013 when he started his career with the Milwaukee Bucks. The Bucks drafted him in the 2013 NBA Draft as the 15th overall pick. Making his debut in the NBA in October 2013 Giannis was one of the youngest players in NBA history to achieve this feat.

Giannis led the Bucks to their NBA title win in 2021. Alongside the NBA title win the NBA named Giannis the 2021 Finals MVP. Giannis has won two NBA MVP awards in 2019 and 2020.

Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks defeat the Celtics

Giannis Antetokounmpo powered the Milwaukee Bucks past the Boston Celtics on Christmas Day. An impressive home win for the Bucks at the Fiserv Forum improved their record to 22-13. Giannis returned to NBA action after spending time under the NBA’s health and safety protocols which he entered on December 12.

This week’s WWE Main Event was taped at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee Wisconsin before Monday’s Raw.

Apollo Crews & Commander Azeez defeated Akira Tozawa & R-Truth (5:30)

This was fine when it was Truth and Tozawa working with Crews but Azeez is just ugly in every sense of the word.

At the bell as Truth sized up Azeez he realized that he hadn’t wished us all a Merry Christmas. As Truth was wishing it to everyone he hit Azeez with a comedy slap and that led to him getting nailed with a huge forearm to the head.

Truth and Tozawa actually took a lot of this one beating up Crews and looking good while doing it. But eventually Azeez came in and cleaned house before he hit a sloppy looking backbreaker on Tozawa.

It was the Nigerian Nail that finished this one but Azeez seemed to forget how you actually pin a guy in professional wrestling. The ref waited for him to ensure that both of Tozawa’s shoulders were on the mat before he counted the three in a weird sequence.

Veer Mahaan defeated T-Bar (7:29)

This was two big dudes that were both playing babyfaces both wearing face paint and both trying to get some screen time. Actually it was perfectly fine.

T-Bar has had just over a year on the main roster now and must be wondering what is next for him. Like a lot of guys in his position a move back to NXT wouldn’t necessarily be the end of the world.

The best spot was just before the commercial break when he dodged Mahaan’s charge and Mahaan got absolutely nailed on the ring post. The audio made it sound seriously nasty and Mahaan sold it well from there on in.

Apart from a rest hold it was pretty much big power move after big power move from both men. T-Bar tried to end it with a sit-out chokeslam and Mahaan unsuccessfully tried to land the Million Dollar Arm.

In the end Veer used a new finisher to get the victory reminiscent of a Sister Abigail meets a Cross Rhodes that was essentially was spinning inverted DDT. We’ll see if this becomes his go-to finisher from here on out.

Final Thoughts:

As we end 2021 we seem to have reverted back to the norm on Main Event: no new faces and a tiny pool of around six guys thrown together in various and wonderful combinations each week all trading meaningless wins and losses. Credit where it’s due Mahaan is improving but one thing’s for sure: Raw needs something right now and it ain’t him.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY2VsdGljc3dpcmUudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tL2xpc3RzL25iYS1ib3N0b24tY2VsdGljcy1idWNrcy1wcmV2aWV3LTEyLTI1LTIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Celtics at Bucks: Stream lineups injury reports and broadcast,"The Boston Celtics (16-16) will take on the Milwaukee Bucks (21-13) on the road at Fiserv Forum on Christmas Day (Saturday) while coping with one of the longest injury reports in team history due to a number of players entering the NBA’s health and safety protocols with positive COVID-19 tests over the last few days.

Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks makes a basket against the Boston Celtics in the second half at Fiserv Forum on December 25 2021 in Milwaukee Wisconsin.

LOS ANGELES – Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 36 points in his return from COVID-19 protocols powering the NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks to a 117-113 Christmas comeback win over the coronavirus-depleted Boston Celtics.

Antetokounmpo who had missed five games scored 29 points in the second half as the Bucks rallied to deny a gutsy Celtics squad that had nine players unavailable because of COVID-19 concerns and 10 unavailable counting Al Horford who cleared protocols but was deemed not yet game fit.

With the minimum required eight players in uniform — after German guard Dennis Schroder was ruled out by COVID-19 concerns earlier Saturday (Sunday Manila time) — the Celtics took it to the NBA champions early.

Behind 14 first-quarter points from Jaylen Brown they raced to a 35-22 first-quarter lead.

Brown Jayson Tatum and Marcus Smart combined for 69 points for the Celtics who led by as many as 19 and were up by 13 with 5:28 remaining.

Antetokounmpo's layup knotted the score at 111-111 with 1:29 to play.

Brown made two free throws to put Boston back on top but Bucks reserve Wesley Matthews drained a 3-pointer with 30.3 seconds remaining to put Milwaukee up by one -- their first lead of the contest.

Boston wouldn't get the lead again as Milwaukee's Khris Middleton made three free throws.

Brown missed a 3-pointer with seven-tenths of a second left and Antetokounmpo grabbed the rebound to seal the win.

A Knicks first

The five-day Christmas Day slate opened at Madison Square Garden where Kemba Walker's resurgence continued as he became the first New York Knicks player to post a triple-double on the holiday to lead the way in a 101-87 victory over the Atlanta Hawks.

Walker benched for nine games by coach Tom Thibodeau this month has poured it on in his return to the lineup.

On Thursday he had 44 in a loss to the Milwaukee Bucks but on Saturday his 10 points 10 rebounds and 12 assists made an impact in the opening game of the NBA's five-game Christmas Day slate.

""This is up there"" said Walker who received a standing ovation when he pulled down his 10th rebound in the second half to achieve his first triple-double since 2014.

""This is only my second time playing on Christmas Day. But definitely a very special Christmas definitely a very special moment to be playing at home in New York crowd going wild it was fun.""

Julius Randle scored 25 points and pulled down 12 rebounds for the Knicks who led by as many as 21 points in the wire-to-wire victory.

Walker became the seventh NBA player to record a triple-double on Christmas. The great Oscar Robertson did it four times in the 1960s and the most recent to do so was Golden State's Draymond Green in 2017.

""I just wanted to come out here and get a win"" Walker said.

John Collins and Delon Wright scored 20 points apiece for the Hawks who had eight players sidelined over COVID-19 concerns including star Trae Young.

Other games scheduled included the Golden State Warriors at the Phoenix Suns in a clash of the top two teams in the league.

It's just the sixth time the teams with the NBA's best records have met on Christmas.

The two Western Conference pacesetters have already met twice in less than a month the Suns winning in Phoenix before Golden State broke the Suns' 18-game winning streak with a victory in San Francisco.

The Suns are aiming to stretch their narrow lead in the conference and extend their 15-game home winning streak.

""This is our game to settle it"" Phoenix's Deandre Ayton said. ""It's going to be a great one.""

Later Saturday the Los Angeles Lakers host a Brooklyn Nets team whose seven COVID-19 absentees include Kevin Durant and LaMarcus Aldridge. And in the nightcap the Utah Jazz hosted the Dallas Mavericks."

""These are the very very first customers to get a Mach-E in China"" Anderson Chan Dearborn-based international communications manager for Ford told the Free Press.

The company is hosting a series of ceremonies throughout China starting in Shanghai and Beijing that highlight the deliveries because the size of public events is limited by pandemic-related restrictions he said.

Ford released a photo early Sunday of one of its first buyers in China advertising executive Jin Zhang receiving keys in Shanghai from Mark Kaufman general manager of Ford China BEV Division. BEV stands for battery electric vehicle.

Chan said Zhang fell in love with the Mustang while studying in America.

25 mall sites and counting

In China Ford has set up 25 storefront sites in major metropolitan areas for customers to buy electric vehicles directly rather than go through a traditional dealership — and more sites are planned. This storefront model in which no test-driving takes place on-site has been popular in the U.S. with Tesla. It opened its first storefront in Michigan in 2017 at Somerset Mall in Troy.

In China Ford began setting up storefronts in 2021 where customers walk in see the vehicle learn about all-electric products and place orders Chan explained.

""We will continue growing these stores in the weeks and months ahead"" he said. ""We wanted to use this as an opportunity to show how we are understanding China's customers and their desire for direct access.""

The Ford direct-to-customer stores are not standalone sites but rather located in high-traffic shopping centers that offer other global brands he said.

""We started rolling out the stores earlier this year. This initiative will continue in the year ahead. It's very much China-specific"" Chan said. ""China's customers have begun to want to access vehicles through these storefronts. So that’s what we set up.""

China has younger buyers overall that do vehicle research in advance and want the convenience of immediate access Chan said. Vehicle service still is available at dealerships.

Steep competition

Chan noted that a number of major automakers in China offer this sales model which is used by Tesla in the U.S.

China is considered not just strategically important for automakers but highly lucrative based on its young and growing population air pollution concerns and government incentives for all-electric vehicles.

The top-selling all-electric vehicles in China so far in 2021 are made by the joint venture SAIC-GM-Wuling that includes General Motors Tesla and BYD an electric vehicle maker backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported CNBC in October.

The Mustang Mach-E SUV is produced by Changan Ford a joint venture between Changan Automobile and Ford and manufactured in Chongqing China.

Governments worldwide led by China and Europe have created public policies that spur the adoption of electric vehicles in an attempt to reduce pollution that contributes to climate change.

The phrase ""Let’s Go Brandon"" took over social media In October after an NBC interview with Brown.

The gray and white structure has been closed since 2017 but now two nonprofits have taken it over and plan to turn it into a multi-use building for teens and adults.

Those groups are the Advancement Corporation and Mi Just Cause.

“It will be a multi-use facility where we will house up to 50 individuals but also provide different supportive services like employment services training services and food services out of this one location” said Derrick Knox of the Advancement Corporation.

Knox thinks offering support to people in the community will go a long way to helping curb violence in the city.

“One of the youth that was involved in the recent gun violence about a month or so ago he was in a living situation that he’s been trying to get out of. There was no place for him to go and he was really being pushed by his environment to commit violence” Knox said.

Organizers involved with this project say they will offer shelter services to men first. There will also be an emergency shelter and longer term options for people who need it.

On the second level of the building clients will have the chance to live in an apartment of their own for up to a year while receiving financial literacy counseling. The goal is to have people transition from the long-term shelter into a house of their own.

But first the work on the building has to be completed.

“So this project is going to take a lot of effort and collaboration from a lot of heping hands. We estimate that this project is going to take about $2 million for the first phase of it and upwards of $5 million before the smoke clears and we’re ready to serve all the community that we’re trying to serve” said Darren Bollinger of MI Just Cause.

There is no firm date on when the shelter will open but organizers say they’d like to see that happen as soon as possible.

But Disney has also done some more “adult” things including releasing more mature movies covering more adult topics making thrill rides aimed at older kids/teens/adults and even creating adults-only spaces on its cruise ships. And now it looks like Disney is planning on getting into a realm that is quite unique and much more “adult”…gambling.

What’s Going On?

During the earnings call for the 4th quarter of fiscal year 2021 Bob Chapek the current CEO of The Walt Disney Company said that they’re “moving toward a greater presence in online sports betting.” Chapek specifically noted that they “believe that sports betting is a very significant opportunity for the company” and that it is something they’re “keenly interested in and are pursuing aggressively.”

As you might imagine Disney has looked at things like betting and gambling differently in the past so how did we get here and what could the future hold? Let’s take a look.

How the View on Sports Betting Has Changed

According to The Hollywood Reporter the Supreme Court of the United States of America “paved the way for legalized sports betting” back in May of 2018. At that time the Supreme Court issued its ruling in a case that came before it called Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association. As Forbes notes through that ruling the Supreme Court struck down a ban on sports betting.

The Hollywood Reporter shares that just a day later after the Supreme Court’s decision in that case ESPN’s president Jimmy Pitaro (who had only been in that position for about 2 months at the time) was speaking to reporters. According to The Hollywood Reporter Pitaro sounded skeptical of ESPN playing an active role in the sports betting industry calling the potential for this involvement “interesting” “but only when it came to gambling-focused programming or segments on its TV shows.”

At the time Conner Schell (who then served as ESPN’s head of content) said it was “something that we will be thoughtful about.” The Hollywood Reporter notes that this more “conservative approach” to getting involved in the sports betting industry continued throughout Bob Iger’s time as CEO at Disney.

During a 2019 earnings call Iger even said “I do think that there’s plenty of room and ESPN has done some of this already and they may do more to provide information in coverage of sports…But getting into the business of gambling I rather doubt it.”

According to the Orlando Sentinel Disney once even “helped bankroll a ‘No Casinos’ campaign in 2018” in Florida.

Now it appears the tone and focus of the Disney company and their feeling toward sports betting/gambling has changed. As noted above Bob Chapek (the current Disney CEO) has indicated that sports betting is an area they’re now “keenly interested in and are pursuing aggressively.”

Since the Supreme Court’s decision in 2018 sports betting has spread throughout the U.S. Forbes notes that “32 states and Washington D.C. have launched legal markets and the industry is on fire and flush with cash.” In the first half of 2021 alone Americans bet around $24 billion (yes billion with a “b”) with legal sportsbooks. This translates to around $2 billion in gross gaming revenue.

According to Macquarie Research cited by Forbes the sports betting industry is expected to produce about $30 billion in revenues (from an estimated $400 billion in total wagers) by 2030.

And it looks like media companies want a bit of the action. Forbes shares that companies like Fox and Sports Illustrated have “already cut deals with sports betting companies.”

So what makes Disney’s involvement so unique? Well as we noted above Disney is typically known for its family-friendly focus something that gambling and betting strays from (at least in some people’s opinions). What makes things even more interesting is that Disney doesn’t have gambling on its cruise ships. It seems to be an activity Disney has pulled away from in the past but is now jumping toward (at least in the sports betting area). It’s a unique space for Disney to get into since it’s one they’ve since kept themselves out of.

What Disney is Saying Now

So just how has Disney changed their tune? Well as we noted above during the earnings call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 (the transcript for which can be found here) Bob Chapek noted that they would be “moving toward a greater presence in online sports betting.” Chapek noted that given Disney’s “reach and scale [they] have the potential to partner with third parties in this space in a very meaningful way.”

Following Chapek’s initial comments one individual specifically asked for more details about Disney’s/ESPN’s potential involvement in this space. Chapek said that they think sports betting is a “very significant opportunity” and that the whole thing is driven by the consumer. Chapek noted that the industry is “driven by the consumer particularly the younger consumer that will replenish the sports fans over time and their desire to have gambling as part of their sports experience.”

Chapek noted that these younger consumers want more of a lean forward-type of experience something more interactive. According to Chapek as Disney focuses on following consumer interest they “necessarily have to seriously consider getting into gambling in bigger way.” He shared that he considers ESPN to be the perfect platform to get into this industry.

What about the Disney brand and its reputation for being family-focused? Chapek addressed that too. According to Disney’s CEO they’ve “done substantial research in terms of the impact to not only the ESPN brand but the Disney brand in terms of consumers’ changing perceptions of the acceptability of gambling.” Chapek said that there’s a “very significant installation” and that “Gambling does not have the cache now that it had say 10 or 20 years ago.”

But it’s not an area they enter without any concerns. Chapek said that they have “some concerns as a company about our ability to get in it without having a brand withdrawal.” But based on the research they’ve done Chapek said that it appears this issue might not be one to really be concerned about. Chapek shared that their research has shown “It actually strengthens the brand of ESPN when you have a betting component and it has no impact on the Disney brand.”

According to Chapek “to go after that demographic opportunity plus the of course not insignificant revenue implications that is something that we’re keenly interested in and are pursuing aggressively.”

During an interview with CNBC Chapek shared that they feel the sports betting option “really adds something material we believe to that proposition as the new younger audience wants to be a little bit more engaged in the outcome of the game.”

Chapek also shared that it also adds a more “interactive a more gaming component to it as well so less of a sit back and more of a lean forward type of experience.” According to Chapek Disney feels that certain sports rights coupled with the “benefits” that they’re “working on building into the sports viewing process really will you know take ESPN and reinstate it as a big growth business for [them.]”

So it seems the research they’ve done has made Disney feel they can enter the space without significant impact to their brand while still allowing them to capitalize on the potential revenue available in that gambling space.

What’s Different Now?

What’s changed recently to make companies like Disney and others view sports betting and gambling differently? Well a lot of things apparently.

According to The Hollywood Reporter changes in consumer habits is one piece of the story. They note that “gamification” has become more common throughout various apps and media. The Hollywood Reporter also shares that “ESPN+ like other streaming services is all but certain to add gamification functionality in the future as it seeks to grow engagement and its subscriber base.”

Another big thing is that major sports leagues have gotten on board when it comes to sports betting. The NFL announced that FanDuel DraftKings and Caesars would be its signature sports betting partners. It later shared that BetMGM PointsBet and WynnBET would be “authorized sports betting partners” for the season.

As for the NBA they’ve previously revealed a deal with DraftKings and FanDuel. According to The Hollywood Reporter “The MLB NHL UFC and other leagues have also signed betting deals.”

As one gambling historian told The Hollywood Reporter when you have the major sports leagues and state governments on board “it is hard to take a moral stance against being involved with gambling.”

One individual who spoke with Forbes shared a similar reasoning. Daniel Dienst executive vice chairman of the Authentic Brands Group shared that “Gambling sports wagering in particular has moved out of [the vices] world” and is now just “part and parcel to the culture of how people engage with sports.”

We’re also in the middle of an interesting financial situation that might be impacting things. Forbes notes that the Walt Disney Company “reported earnings under Wall Street’s expectations. Additionally the company has been financially impacted and continues to be impacted by COVID-19. But a bright spot is sports.” ESPN+’s subscriber numbers increased by 66% over the fiscal year and “90% of the most-watched broadcasts on Disney’s owned TV networks last year were sports events.” Disney has also made a rights deal with NFL that will start in 2023.

While sports has been an area of brightness there are still gaps in the financial sphere to make up for. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 ESPN advertising revenue was “flat” compared to the same period from the previous year. Gambling could help Disney access new revenue streams however and potentially reach/keep their younger audience.

Disney may have started exploring the waters already. The Wall Street Journal shared that ESPN was reportedly “in discussions to explore a potential brand licensing deal with Caesars Entertainment or DraftKings that could be worth $3 billion.”

Sports-betting rules in Florida are also in a state of transition. The changes in Florida could have an impact on Disney’s potential future services and their view on sports betting overall. According to the Orlando Sentinel earlier this year Florida lawmakers voted to legalize sports-betting across the state. But they also specified that they would give “the Seminole Tribe exclusive control over this new billion-dollar market.”

Other sports-betting companies didn’t exactly appreciate that deal (as you might have expected). DraftKings and FanDuel have been asking Floridians to “pass a constitutional amendment that would let other companies compete for your gambling dollars.” According to the Orlando Sentinel Disney hasn’t funded their campaign to open sports-betting in Florida to other entities but “the company clearly wants in on the gambling market it long opposed.”

But things with Florida’s law have now changed. The Orlando Sentinel notes that the new law legalizing sports betting was struck down by a U.S. District Court Judge in November. Despite that outcome a new gambling oversight board passed as part of some new laws that coincide with Florida’s compact with the Seminole Tribe on gambling is moving forward. In December Florida Governor Ron DeSantis appointed 3 members to the Florida Gambling Control Commission.

The compact that was signed between Florida and the Seminole Tribe allows the tribe to add sports betting to their casinos and gives them a monopoly on that (along with some other things). The compact allowed sports betting to be set up by the Seminole Tribe via an app so people could gamble from their smartphones. But federal law requires that the bets be made on tribal grounds. The Seminole Tribe argued that since the servers that would process the bets would be on Seminole lands it could pass that requirement. The court did not agree and struck down the entire compact. Despite this according to the Orlando Sentinel Governor DeSantis has said he “believes most of it to remain in effect.”

The Seminole Tribe is appealing the ruling so the outcome of that situation could impact things in the future.

As The Hollywood Reporter notes Disney also has a small stake in DraftKings through its acquisition of Fox which gives it another reason to potentially be interested in this area.

What Could the Sports Betting Look Like?

If Disney does get involved in the sports betting industry what would that look like? As The Hollywood Reporter notes Fox Corp. has its own betting platform (Fox Bet) which is something Disney doesn’t have. Some sources have told The Hollywood Reporter that Disney has reportedly been in talks with some betting operators to set up a partnership.

There are many operators in this space but BetMGM Caesars and DraftKings are reportedly seen as frontrunners in terms of a potential partnership with Disney.

Could Disney/ESPN ever host wagers directly? Forbes notes that during an investor conference in September Chapek was asked this question. Chapek said that there’s “a long way between imbedding into ESPN as a business model and licensing out.” Chapek said “Let’s just say that our fans are really interested in sports betting. Let’s say that our partners with the leagues are interested in sports betting so we’re interested in sports betting.”

What Problems Could Disney Face?

It seems the view on sports betting has changed for many and Disney is clearly interested in getting involved in the industry. But it won’t come without its own challenges.

One is potential oversaturation. According to The Hollywood Reporter one analyst Neil Begley has said that Disney and ESPN have strong advantages in the field given that they have “broad distribution and rights holdings.” But he said that the sports betting industry could be a “free-for-all among several of the big media groups and there is risk of oversaturation which could dilute the opportunity.”

Begley also noted that the gambling could become an issue given Disney’s family-friendly image a topic we discussed a bit above based on the research cited to by Bob Chapek. Chris Lencheski chairman and CEO of the strategic advisory firm Phoenicia Sport & Entertainment has noted however that Disney won’t be the one entering the sports betting world ESPN will. Drawing that line can help some differentiate and keep the effects of gambling from spilling over to Disney’s image.

But even if image isn’t an issue Disney faces other challenges. Hal Vogel CEO of Vogel Capital Management has noted that sports betting is a field where there’s already a lot of competition. Disney is already starting from behind several others who have entered the field so that’s something they’ll have to deal with.

Disney will also have to handle having both sports reporting and sports betting tied to ESPN and Vogel notes that could eventually lead to conflicts of interest.

What’s Next?

Ultimately there’s a lot to consider here. Disney will have to balance its family-friendly brand identity with this new more adult activity over at ESPN. What will the sports betting look like? Who will Disney partner with? How will the company handle their involvement in the industry in the future? Will it end up obtaining the revenue Disney desires? Much remains to be seen but it will be interesting to follow Disney as they enter this unique space.

The gray and white structure has been closed since 2017 but now two nonprofits have taken it over and plan to turn it into a multi-use building for teens and adults.

Those groups are the Advancement Corporation and Mi Just Cause.

“It will be a multi-use facility where we will house up to 50 individuals but also provide different supportive services like employment services training services and food services out of this one location” said Derrick Knox of the Advancement Corporation.

Knox thinks offering support to people in the community will go a long way to helping curb violence in the city.

“One of the youth that was involved in the recent gun violence about a month or so ago he was in a living situation that he’s been trying to get out of. There was no place for him to go and he was really being pushed by his environment to commit violence” Knox said.

Organizers involved with this project say they will offer shelter services to men first. There will also be an emergency shelter and longer term options for people who need it.

On the second level of the building clients will have the chance to live in an apartment of their own for up to a year while receiving financial literacy counseling. The goal is to have people transition from the long-term shelter into a house of their own.

But first the work on the building has to be completed.

“So this project is going to take a lot of effort and collaboration from a lot of heping hands. We estimate that this project is going to take about $2 million for the first phase of it and upwards of $5 million before the smoke clears and we’re ready to serve all the community that we’re trying to serve” said Darren Bollinger of MI Just Cause.

There is no firm date on when the shelter will open but organizers say they’d like to see that happen as soon as possible.

But Disney has also done some more “adult” things including releasing more mature movies covering more adult topics making thrill rides aimed at older kids/teens/adults and even creating adults-only spaces on its cruise ships. And now it looks like Disney is planning on getting into a realm that is quite unique and much more “adult”…gambling.

What’s Going On?

During the earnings call for the 4th quarter of fiscal year 2021 Bob Chapek the current CEO of The Walt Disney Company said that they’re “moving toward a greater presence in online sports betting.” Chapek specifically noted that they “believe that sports betting is a very significant opportunity for the company” and that it is something they’re “keenly interested in and are pursuing aggressively.”

As you might imagine Disney has looked at things like betting and gambling differently in the past so how did we get here and what could the future hold? Let’s take a look.

How the View on Sports Betting Has Changed

According to The Hollywood Reporter the Supreme Court of the United States of America “paved the way for legalized sports betting” back in May of 2018. At that time the Supreme Court issued its ruling in a case that came before it called Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association. As Forbes notes through that ruling the Supreme Court struck down a ban on sports betting.

The Hollywood Reporter shares that just a day later after the Supreme Court’s decision in that case ESPN’s president Jimmy Pitaro (who had only been in that position for about 2 months at the time) was speaking to reporters. According to The Hollywood Reporter Pitaro sounded skeptical of ESPN playing an active role in the sports betting industry calling the potential for this involvement “interesting” “but only when it came to gambling-focused programming or segments on its TV shows.”

At the time Conner Schell (who then served as ESPN’s head of content) said it was “something that we will be thoughtful about.” The Hollywood Reporter notes that this more “conservative approach” to getting involved in the sports betting industry continued throughout Bob Iger’s time as CEO at Disney.

During a 2019 earnings call Iger even said “I do think that there’s plenty of room and ESPN has done some of this already and they may do more to provide information in coverage of sports…But getting into the business of gambling I rather doubt it.”

According to the Orlando Sentinel Disney once even “helped bankroll a ‘No Casinos’ campaign in 2018” in Florida.

Now it appears the tone and focus of the Disney company and their feeling toward sports betting/gambling has changed. As noted above Bob Chapek (the current Disney CEO) has indicated that sports betting is an area they’re now “keenly interested in and are pursuing aggressively.”

Since the Supreme Court’s decision in 2018 sports betting has spread throughout the U.S. Forbes notes that “32 states and Washington D.C. have launched legal markets and the industry is on fire and flush with cash.” In the first half of 2021 alone Americans bet around $24 billion (yes billion with a “b”) with legal sportsbooks. This translates to around $2 billion in gross gaming revenue.

According to Macquarie Research cited by Forbes the sports betting industry is expected to produce about $30 billion in revenues (from an estimated $400 billion in total wagers) by 2030.

And it looks like media companies want a bit of the action. Forbes shares that companies like Fox and Sports Illustrated have “already cut deals with sports betting companies.”

So what makes Disney’s involvement so unique? Well as we noted above Disney is typically known for its family-friendly focus something that gambling and betting strays from (at least in some people’s opinions). What makes things even more interesting is that Disney doesn’t have gambling on its cruise ships. It seems to be an activity Disney has pulled away from in the past but is now jumping toward (at least in the sports betting area). It’s a unique space for Disney to get into since it’s one they’ve since kept themselves out of.

What Disney is Saying Now

So just how has Disney changed their tune? Well as we noted above during the earnings call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 (the transcript for which can be found here) Bob Chapek noted that they would be “moving toward a greater presence in online sports betting.” Chapek noted that given Disney’s “reach and scale [they] have the potential to partner with third parties in this space in a very meaningful way.”

Following Chapek’s initial comments one individual specifically asked for more details about Disney’s/ESPN’s potential involvement in this space. Chapek said that they think sports betting is a “very significant opportunity” and that the whole thing is driven by the consumer. Chapek noted that the industry is “driven by the consumer particularly the younger consumer that will replenish the sports fans over time and their desire to have gambling as part of their sports experience.”

Chapek noted that these younger consumers want more of a lean forward-type of experience something more interactive. According to Chapek as Disney focuses on following consumer interest they “necessarily have to seriously consider getting into gambling in bigger way.” He shared that he considers ESPN to be the perfect platform to get into this industry.

What about the Disney brand and its reputation for being family-focused? Chapek addressed that too. According to Disney’s CEO they’ve “done substantial research in terms of the impact to not only the ESPN brand but the Disney brand in terms of consumers’ changing perceptions of the acceptability of gambling.” Chapek said that there’s a “very significant installation” and that “Gambling does not have the cache now that it had say 10 or 20 years ago.”

But it’s not an area they enter without any concerns. Chapek said that they have “some concerns as a company about our ability to get in it without having a brand withdrawal.” But based on the research they’ve done Chapek said that it appears this issue might not be one to really be concerned about. Chapek shared that their research has shown “It actually strengthens the brand of ESPN when you have a betting component and it has no impact on the Disney brand.”

According to Chapek “to go after that demographic opportunity plus the of course not insignificant revenue implications that is something that we’re keenly interested in and are pursuing aggressively.”

During an interview with CNBC Chapek shared that they feel the sports betting option “really adds something material we believe to that proposition as the new younger audience wants to be a little bit more engaged in the outcome of the game.”

Chapek also shared that it also adds a more “interactive a more gaming component to it as well so less of a sit back and more of a lean forward type of experience.” According to Chapek Disney feels that certain sports rights coupled with the “benefits” that they’re “working on building into the sports viewing process really will you know take ESPN and reinstate it as a big growth business for [them.]”

So it seems the research they’ve done has made Disney feel they can enter the space without significant impact to their brand while still allowing them to capitalize on the potential revenue available in that gambling space.

What’s Different Now?

What’s changed recently to make companies like Disney and others view sports betting and gambling differently? Well a lot of things apparently.

According to The Hollywood Reporter changes in consumer habits is one piece of the story. They note that “gamification” has become more common throughout various apps and media. The Hollywood Reporter also shares that “ESPN+ like other streaming services is all but certain to add gamification functionality in the future as it seeks to grow engagement and its subscriber base.”

Another big thing is that major sports leagues have gotten on board when it comes to sports betting. The NFL announced that FanDuel DraftKings and Caesars would be its signature sports betting partners. It later shared that BetMGM PointsBet and WynnBET would be “authorized sports betting partners” for the season.

As for the NBA they’ve previously revealed a deal with DraftKings and FanDuel. According to The Hollywood Reporter “The MLB NHL UFC and other leagues have also signed betting deals.”

As one gambling historian told The Hollywood Reporter when you have the major sports leagues and state governments on board “it is hard to take a moral stance against being involved with gambling.”

One individual who spoke with Forbes shared a similar reasoning. Daniel Dienst executive vice chairman of the Authentic Brands Group shared that “Gambling sports wagering in particular has moved out of [the vices] world” and is now just “part and parcel to the culture of how people engage with sports.”

We’re also in the middle of an interesting financial situation that might be impacting things. Forbes notes that the Walt Disney Company “reported earnings under Wall Street’s expectations. Additionally the company has been financially impacted and continues to be impacted by COVID-19. But a bright spot is sports.” ESPN+’s subscriber numbers increased by 66% over the fiscal year and “90% of the most-watched broadcasts on Disney’s owned TV networks last year were sports events.” Disney has also made a rights deal with NFL that will start in 2023.

While sports has been an area of brightness there are still gaps in the financial sphere to make up for. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 ESPN advertising revenue was “flat” compared to the same period from the previous year. Gambling could help Disney access new revenue streams however and potentially reach/keep their younger audience.

Disney may have started exploring the waters already. The Wall Street Journal shared that ESPN was reportedly “in discussions to explore a potential brand licensing deal with Caesars Entertainment or DraftKings that could be worth $3 billion.”

Sports-betting rules in Florida are also in a state of transition. The changes in Florida could have an impact on Disney’s potential future services and their view on sports betting overall. According to the Orlando Sentinel earlier this year Florida lawmakers voted to legalize sports-betting across the state. But they also specified that they would give “the Seminole Tribe exclusive control over this new billion-dollar market.”

Other sports-betting companies didn’t exactly appreciate that deal (as you might have expected). DraftKings and FanDuel have been asking Floridians to “pass a constitutional amendment that would let other companies compete for your gambling dollars.” According to the Orlando Sentinel Disney hasn’t funded their campaign to open sports-betting in Florida to other entities but “the company clearly wants in on the gambling market it long opposed.”

But things with Florida’s law have now changed. The Orlando Sentinel notes that the new law legalizing sports betting was struck down by a U.S. District Court Judge in November. Despite that outcome a new gambling oversight board passed as part of some new laws that coincide with Florida’s compact with the Seminole Tribe on gambling is moving forward. In December Florida Governor Ron DeSantis appointed 3 members to the Florida Gambling Control Commission.

The compact that was signed between Florida and the Seminole Tribe allows the tribe to add sports betting to their casinos and gives them a monopoly on that (along with some other things). The compact allowed sports betting to be set up by the Seminole Tribe via an app so people could gamble from their smartphones. But federal law requires that the bets be made on tribal grounds. The Seminole Tribe argued that since the servers that would process the bets would be on Seminole lands it could pass that requirement. The court did not agree and struck down the entire compact. Despite this according to the Orlando Sentinel Governor DeSantis has said he “believes most of it to remain in effect.”

The Seminole Tribe is appealing the ruling so the outcome of that situation could impact things in the future.

As The Hollywood Reporter notes Disney also has a small stake in DraftKings through its acquisition of Fox which gives it another reason to potentially be interested in this area.

What Could the Sports Betting Look Like?

If Disney does get involved in the sports betting industry what would that look like? As The Hollywood Reporter notes Fox Corp. has its own betting platform (Fox Bet) which is something Disney doesn’t have. Some sources have told The Hollywood Reporter that Disney has reportedly been in talks with some betting operators to set up a partnership.

There are many operators in this space but BetMGM Caesars and DraftKings are reportedly seen as frontrunners in terms of a potential partnership with Disney.

Could Disney/ESPN ever host wagers directly? Forbes notes that during an investor conference in September Chapek was asked this question. Chapek said that there’s “a long way between imbedding into ESPN as a business model and licensing out.” Chapek said “Let’s just say that our fans are really interested in sports betting. Let’s say that our partners with the leagues are interested in sports betting so we’re interested in sports betting.”

What Problems Could Disney Face?

It seems the view on sports betting has changed for many and Disney is clearly interested in getting involved in the industry. But it won’t come without its own challenges.

One is potential oversaturation. According to The Hollywood Reporter one analyst Neil Begley has said that Disney and ESPN have strong advantages in the field given that they have “broad distribution and rights holdings.” But he said that the sports betting industry could be a “free-for-all among several of the big media groups and there is risk of oversaturation which could dilute the opportunity.”

Begley also noted that the gambling could become an issue given Disney’s family-friendly image a topic we discussed a bit above based on the research cited to by Bob Chapek. Chris Lencheski chairman and CEO of the strategic advisory firm Phoenicia Sport & Entertainment has noted however that Disney won’t be the one entering the sports betting world ESPN will. Drawing that line can help some differentiate and keep the effects of gambling from spilling over to Disney’s image.

But even if image isn’t an issue Disney faces other challenges. Hal Vogel CEO of Vogel Capital Management has noted that sports betting is a field where there’s already a lot of competition. Disney is already starting from behind several others who have entered the field so that’s something they’ll have to deal with.

Disney will also have to handle having both sports reporting and sports betting tied to ESPN and Vogel notes that could eventually lead to conflicts of interest.

What’s Next?

Ultimately there’s a lot to consider here. Disney will have to balance its family-friendly brand identity with this new more adult activity over at ESPN. What will the sports betting look like? Who will Disney partner with? How will the company handle their involvement in the industry in the future? Will it end up obtaining the revenue Disney desires? Much remains to be seen but it will be interesting to follow Disney as they enter this unique space.

With last year’s celebrations a bit bleak (and this year too) I’ve been reflecting over the last few months about family. I think due to the pandemic a lot of people have also reprioritized what they value.

In fact according to the Pew Research Center when they asked nearly 19000 adults across 17 advanced economies the meaning of life and what they valued – “Family” was the top answer.

“In 14 of the 17 advanced economies surveyed more mention their family as a source of meaning in their lives than any other factor” according to the study. “Highlighting their relationships with parents siblings children and grandchildren people frequently mention quality time spent with their kinfolk the pride they get from the accomplishments of their relatives and even the desire to live a life that leaves an improved world for their offspring.”

In the U.S. the top values chosen were “Family” the first choice followed by “Friends” “Material well-being” “Occupation” and “Faith.”

Have you thought about what you value the most? Also maybe it’s the time of year where we can think about other people’s values too.

Also I think we have to support our communities especially the arts museums and local attractions that have been hit hard by the pandemic.

With family coming first I have to let you know that a big part of mine is the Northeast Ohio Parent editorial and design team which consists of staff and freelancers. These colleagues of mine deserve recognition for their hard work – and they got it with many awards this year including last month when the team received eight Parent Media Association national awards.

We want to thank you too readers. I’ve seen many of your faces at events or on social media. The support you have provided has truly made a difference.

In 2022 I want to make sure we are touching on issues you think are important. Feel free to email me your ideas at [email protected]. I know for you family comes first too. We want to make sure that we are providing resources that help you and yours.

Environmental & Mechanical Engineering)/Image Source: Rice University

Rice University researchers have been awarded $1.3 million by the Office of Naval Research through the Defense Research University Instrumentation Program to develop the world’s first 3D printed smart helmet for military use. For the development of the helmets the team will use industrial-grade 3D printers.

The task force includes the labs of materials scientist Pulickel Ajayan civil and environmental engineer and Rice Provost Reginald DesRoches mechanical engineer Marcia O’Malley chemist James Tour and Veeraraghavan.

The 3D printed Smart Helmet program led by principal investigator Paul Cherukuri executive director of Rice’s Institute of Biosciences and Bioengineering aims to modernize standard-issue military helmets by 3D-printing a nanomaterial-enhanced exoskeleton with embedded sensors to actively protect the brain against kinetic or directed-energy effects.

Rice will use Carbon’s L1 3D printer to create a military-grade helmet that incorporates advances in materials image processing artificial intelligence haptic feedback and energy storage. The L1 printer allows for rapid prototyping which simplifies the process of incorporating the sensors cameras batteries and wiring harnesses required by the program.

“Current helmets have evolved little since the last century and are still heavy bulky passive devices. Because of advances in sensors and additive manufacturing we’re now reimagining the helmet as a 3D printed AI-enabled ‘always-on’ wearable that detects threats near or far and is capable of launching countermeasures to protect soldiers sailors airmen and Marines. Essentially we’re building J.A.R.V.I.S.” – Paul Cherukuri Executive Director of Rice’s Institute of Biosciences and Bioengineering

J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a fictional character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film franchise.

The FlatCam a system developed by co-investigator and electrical and computer engineer Ashok Veeraraghavan and his colleagues that incorporates sophisticated image processing to eliminate the need for bulky lenses as well as Cherukuri’s Teslaphoresis a type of tractor beam for nanomaterials that could help create physical and electromagnetic shields inside the helmets will be used in the Smart Helmet program.

Cherukuri added “A smart helmet task force has been assembled from some of the finest minds at Rice to tackle the challenge of creating a self-contained intelligent system that protects the war fighter at all times. We’ve got a lot of innovative tech in university labs that has never seen the light of day. We’re simply developing that technology into a device that gives the men and women protecting our country a real chance at coming home safe and sound. This is for them.”

At its launch the model quickly made waves with its “Titanium Virtual Armor” aesthetic influenced by the world of virtual reality and the animé genre Mecha. Now G-Shock is doubling down on the former of these two themes with the launch of the Virtual World collection trio of watches that showcase a striking virtual reality theme.

The new collection includes the GA2100VB-1A GA700VB-1Aand GA900VB-1A each taking a base design from one of three popular G-Shock references currently being produced — the GA2100 GA700 and GA900. While each of the models is similar to previous designs produced by the Japanese brand they are nonetheless distinct in their colorways and inspirations mixing dark elements with electric blues purples and pinks all aiming for a futuristic look likely to appeal to younger digital-native customers.

The colorway is most reminiscent of so-called “bisexual lighting” (it’s a real thing I promise) particularly popular in film and television over the past few years or so and likely best known as the color style in HBO’s Euphoria (see below). While best known by this name the unique colorway finds its roots within expansive Gen-Z digital spheres some of which include the virtual reality spaces from which the watches draw their primary inspiration. from. That G-Shock has taken note of this somewhat niche colorway speaks not only to the Virtual World’s intrigue but further to the watch’s target demographic which likely skews younger and within these digital communities.

Outside of the eye-catching colors each of the watches is a true G-Shock at its core with a built-tough case design featuring hard resin and carbon core guard structure and packed with plenty of useful functions that vary by watch but include alarms chronographs countdown timers and more.

Windows 10 or Windows 11 will be as clean as ever and you’re free to configure the operating system to fit your needs.

Usually you might see some prompts in the Windows 11 or Windows 10 “Out of Box” experience to help you tweak Windows to the way you want it. That could be for gaming productivity or even video editing. Yet even with those options we still have our own suggestions for top settings that you can change on your new laptop.

Display Scaling

At the top of our list is the display scaling of your laptop. If you have a laptop with a high-resolution screen (usually higher than 1920 x 1080) then you might want to consider changing the scaling values. By default the scaling might be set very high to around 150%. This is to make things look bigger on your screen. But to fit more items on your screen and increase your multitasking you can lower your scaling. We suggest a value around 100% or even 125%.

You can change the scale of the display at any time by right-clicking on the desktop and choosing Display Settings. Then look for the scale section and choose the appropriate value. Your screen will flash and reset to the new value but you’ll have to accept the change by logging out and logging back in.

Touchpad gestures

Feeling busy? Windows 11 and Windows 10 laptops have gesture support. With this you can move your fingers on the Touchpad in certain ways to accomplish common tasks on your laptop. This can help you save time by making it easier to open search Task view show the desktop switch apps open notification center and more. Note though that gestures only work if your laptop has a Microsoft Precision Trackpad. Most modern laptops do so it should not be an issue.

To change and customize the gestures go to Bluetooth & devices then choose Three-and-four-finger touch gestures. Make sure it’s turned on. After that head back to Bluetooth & devices and choose Touchpad followed by Advanced Gestures. From here you can tweak things to your own liking.

Windows’ annoying suggestions and privacy app notifications

From time to time in Windows you might see suggestions in your Start Menu or in the Notification Center. Many people see this as “ads” but it’s just Microsoft suggesting the right apps for you to download or use on your PC. This could be for Microsoft Edge or another app like OneNote. To help keep you keep control of your laptop we suggest turning off this feature.

On Windows 11 you can do this by clicking Windows Key + I on your keyboard. Then head to System followed by Notifications. From there you will want to scroll all the way down and uncheck the boxes for Offer suggestions and get tips and suggestions. While you’re here you also can turn off notifications for individual apps as you see fit. This ensures that only apps you want will notify you.

In addition to the above we also suggest going to the Privacy and Security section of Windows 11’s settings. Them under there choose General. And then toggle all the switches to Off. Windows will now no longer suggest you stuff you don’t want to see.

Fast Startup

In Windows 10 and Windows 11 there’s a feature known as Fast Startup. This is a feature that’s supposed to reduce the time your PC has to spend booting up but it does have some caveats. When Fast Startup is enabled your PC doesn’t do a regular shutdown. Rather it saves its state and goes into a mode of a mix between hibernation and shutdown.

This can cause compatibility issues if you’re dual-booting operating systems. It also means that games apps and other processes you were running will stay in the background each time you power off your PC.

It’s kind of like keeping your car in idle. If you prefer a “clean start” then disable fast startup. The difference between a fast startup and a regular boot is usually just a few seconds.

To do this in Windows 11 and Windows 10 type in Power in the Windows 11 Start Menu and pick the Power and Sleep Settings result. Then scroll down to Additional Power Settings. Pick the Choose what the power button does option. Then you’ll have to click Change settings that are currently unavailable and toggle the checkbox for Fast startup to off. End by clicking Save changes.

Pin folders to your Start Menu and remove suggestions in Start

Next up is a way to get into your files more quickly. You might notice in Windows 11 that quick links to your favorite folders are gone from the Start Menu. Well you can actually bring these back. This is under the Personalization > Start > Folders settings in Windows 11 .

From here you can bring back the quick links to Settings File Explorer Documents Downloads Music Pictures or Videos. This helps ensure that you can get to these folders without jumping into the File Explorer manually.

In addition to this we also suggest turning off Windows 11’s automatic suggestions. This is the area that appears under your Start Menu. Go to Personalization > Start and then choose the option for Show recently opened items in Start Jump Lists and File Explorer to off. Above that keep the toggle for Show recently added apps to On. You’ll no longer see documents in your Start Menu and will only see recently added apps. It should make your Start Menu look clearer.

Bengaluru: Dr. C. N. Ashwath Narayan IT – BT Skill Development and Higher Education Minister has emphasised the importance of turning farmers into micro entrepreneurs claiming that due to technological penetration such as broadband and mobile usage the next generation of farmers in rural areas will be digital-savvy.

The Minister has made the remark during the first session of the mega agro event of Central India ‘Agrovision’ in Nagpur on Friday December 24. “There is a need to create farmers ‘micro entrepreneurs’ and re-imagine the agriculture value chain from their perspective” he said.

“In this context we must consider how to boost yields productivity and direct market linkages” he added.

When it comes to the usefulness of technology in agriculture he informed that the new technology can provide real-time advice on the inputs needed for certain crops as well as near-accurate weather forecasts.

He further said that today novel technology can provide real-time advisory on inputs required for respective crops near-accurate weather forecast post-harvest machines can sort 18 tonnes of fruit into different grades in less than 3 hours enable soil testing and reporting in less than 30 minutes and AI & Machine Learning can be used to estimate actual crop harvested and assess damage due to natural calamities.

In the last 11 months more than Rs. 5000 crore has been invested in agri-tech firms the Minister added.

Our mantra should be “local efforts global benefits.” Focusing on post-harvest solutions at the District or Taluk level for example can increase farmers’ revenue by 20 per cent” he noted.

The Minister went on to say that each startup can adopt five to ten villages in a district to raise farmer awareness of technology intervention. The Minister on the other hand stated that ten times more start-ups are required because the sector is falling behind despite increased investment.

Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Union Minister for Surface Transportation Nitin Gadkari were present for the event.",,,

The photos epitomize the raw speed of what was the world’s fastest subsonic jet built by San Diego-based Convair a division of General Dynamics.

Original color imagery of the Convair 990 series is rare and of the American 990 even rarer.

Some years back Airline Ratings discovered and had scanned a small cache of color factory shots of CV880s and CV990s but there was precious little of the American Airlines 990s.

This black and white photo is a classic shot of the American Airlines 990 and Mr. Vienne has done a magnificent job in colorizing it.

Convair pursued American Airlines’ business by guaranteeing an enhanced 880 would beat the competition coast-to-coast by 45 minutes.

American’s chief C.R. Smith was taken by the speed. He wanted a faster jet to “beat the pants” off Texas-based Braniff Airlines which had ordered the domestic 707 with the bigger intercontinental engines for its flights. Braniff marketed it as “The Jet with The Big Engines”.

American’s plan was to use the Convair jet for the first class only “Blue Streak” service and configure American’s 707s for all economy. American purchased 25 of what was essentially a new aircraft from Convair but the aircraft’s radical changes were not made clear to the General Dynamic’s board.

Problems with the aircraft now called the 990 surfaced almost immediately on test flights and the aircraft was unable to meet its speed and fuel burn guarantees despite a host of modifications.

The 990 needed to gulp fuel to reach its speed guarantee.

When the production run finished with just 102 880s and 990s built GD had written off $4.16 million per plane – more than they sold for.

Any possibility of further sales of the Convair jets was dashed when Boeing announced its three-engine 727 tri-jet in 1959.

Suddenly a three-engine jet would basically do the same mission as a four-engine model and be far cheaper per passenger on fuel burn.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZncvbmFtZS9yb2JlcnQtcGF0dG9uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMyMDMyNzAy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Patton Obituary (1922 - 2021) - Las Vegas NV - Star-Telegram,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/dfw/name/robert-patton-obituary?id=32032702 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZncvbmFtZS9yb2JlcnQtcGF0dG9uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMyMDMyNzAy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGV0aW1lcy10cmlidW5lL25hbWUvam9obi1icmFkbGV5LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMyMDAxNzA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Bradley Obituary (2021) - Carbondale PA - Scranton Times,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/thetimes-tribune/name/john-bradley-obituary?id=32001707 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGV0aW1lcy10cmlidW5lL25hbWUvam9obi1icmFkbGV5LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMyMDAxNzA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Purchases through our links may earn us a commission.

Sure you could go out and get a tattoo of a butterfly on your arm or your leg but do you know where it would look even better? On your lower back. That’s right. I’m talking about tramp stamps the trashy Monster Energy-drinking dirt bike-riding forgotten sibling of tattoo locations.

Popularized in trailer parks and any other areas with high mullet concentrations the tramp stamp has largely fallen out of popularity as it’s developed a certain negative connotation among more “high-class” circles. But you know what? I say we bring the tramp stamp back to the mainstream. So call up your local tattoo artist throw away your former stigmas and get ready because in this article we’re talking about tramp stamps.

You could go with a classic tramp stamp tattoo: a butterfly a heart your ex-boyfriend’s name. But if you want to separate yourself from all of those other beautiful people with lower back tattoos it’s time to get creative. And if you’re getting a tramp stamp you’re already very clearly a reckless person.

Why not go full tilt and get something provocative or ridiculous? Yeah your mom and dad may not approve and judgemental people are going to crack jokes at your expense but screw them. Getting a wacky tramp stamp is your way of saying “I’m trashy and extra but you’re just going to have to deal with it.”

If the last two paragraphs have convinced you that tramp stamps are going to make a comeback then it’s time to start considering what you’re going to get inked on your lower back. It’s a tough decision. It’s going to be on your skin for the rest of your life and the whole world is going to see it every time you wear your favorite crop-top. But to get you thinking critically about what kind of tramp stamp you want here are a few ideas:

“Insert Coins In Slot”

This one is an absolute classic. What’s funnier than pretending your buttcrack is a coin slot in a vending machine? I’ll tell you what: nothing. Nothing is funnier. If anyone sees your lower back tattoo and doesn’t immediately laugh their ass off then that person has no sense of humor.

Not only is getting “Insert Coin In Slot” tattooed above your buttcrack hilarious but it’s also functional. Who knows? Maybe you’ll end up collecting a few dollars in loose change from people who appreciate your body art. And while tattoos are typically pretty expensive this is one tattoo idea that might end up being profitable.

Diglett

If you’ve never played Pokemon or watched the anime series then this probably isn’t the tramp stamp tattoo that you want. However if you are a fan of the iconic card game and series then I strongly suggest getting Diglett inked right above your pooper.

Imagine it: you go to the beach with some new friends you go to the bathroom and swimming gear and your friends see the adorable face of Diglett popping up from the waistline of your swimsuit. Incredible.

Now I fully support getting any of 898 Pokemon tattooed on your lower back; however I think we can all agree that Diglett is probably the best option. Wait a second. Would Dugtrio be better? Is three better than one? It’s hard to say.

Skydiver

Imagine that the space between your buttcheeks is the Grand Canyon. Now imagine someone in a helicopter skydiving from thousands of feet above the Earth straight into the Grand Canyon (or in this case your butt). What am I getting at here? You should get a tramp stamp of a skydiver hurtling toward your buttcrack at terminal velocity.

Perhaps your skydiver hasn’t deployed their parachute yet or perhaps they already have. Perhaps your skydiver is in the middle of trying to deploy their parachute but it isn’t working causing them to fall in a panicked death spiral all the way down to where the sun don’t shine. The choice is yours.

The Cocoa Puffs Logo

I don’t think I want to explain this too much. If you get it you get it. The logo for a brown chocolatey cereal located right above your bum. Alright I may as well just say it. It’s a poop joke. You’re never too old for a good poop joke. And you’re definitely never too old to get a poop joke tattooed on your body for the rest of your natural life.

Now this tattoo could go one of two ways legally. Maybe General Mills sees your tattoo after you post it on your Instagram or TikTok and thinks it’s hilarious decides to make you their official Cocoa Puffs spokesperson and pays you extravagant sums of money.

The other option however is that General Mills is not so thrilled with your new tattoo and decides to hit you hard with a defamation lawsuit that leaves you in debt until the day you die. So while getting this tattoo would be a work of comedic genius it’s also a little bit risky.

Flying Bats

Where do bats live? They live in caves. You know where this is going. Call up your tattoo artist right now and have them permanently ink a bunch of bats flying out of your butt and onto your lower back. Or would it be even better if they were flying into your butt? I’ll leave that decision up to you.

Now the type of bat that you choose to get tattooed is also up to you. You could go with a colony of cute bats (like the adorable Egyptian fruit) or if you’d rather put people off with your tramp stamp you could get a more hideous variety (such as the horrifying Hardwicke’s woolly bat).

Danny DeVito

Danny DeVito is one of the most iconic and instantly recognizable actors of all time. Well known for his masterful performances in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest L.A. Confidential and of course his portrayal of Frank Reynolds on It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia Danny DeVito’s adorable face is an image that will immediately inspire happiness and chuckling.

What better place to put his beautiful face than right above your tushy? And by getting a Danny DeVito tramp stamp you’d be paying homage to one of the greatest actors of the modern era.

Plus you could snap a photo of your amazing new DeVito-inspired tramp stamp and get it trending on Twitter and maybe Danny DeVito himself would see it. Next thing you know you’re on a private jet flying to DeVito’s mansion in Malibu to spend a few days with the famous actor and his family. If that’s not a reason to get this tramp stamp I don’t know what is.

Belly Button

Who’s never thought about how cool it would be to have a second belly button? Well you’ve already got one on the front of your body. Why not get one on the back as well? So when people see your lower back they’ll have a brief moment of confusion and think that they’re looking at your stomach when in fact they’re looking at your back. Hilarious!

This tramp stamp is particularly good for belly dancers. With two belly buttons you’ll essentially be doubling your belly dancing capabilities. And everyone knows that a good belly dancer is just about the most erotic thing on Earth.",,,,,,,,,

Inefficiencies in the form of heavy battery packs and low power densities have long limited not just the range and performance of EVs but the very forms they can take — there’s a reason Tesla started with a Roadster and not a Cybertruck. But steady advancements in power systems over the past few years — alongside skyrocketing demand for larger electrified vehicles which cater to the US market — has led to a watershed moment in 2021: the emergence of EV pickups and SUVs.

Yes we all know the Model X exists and Tesla “did it first” — spare me your tweets — however the sheer number and variety of new pure EV pickup and SUV models either ready to hit the showroom floor or in active development is staggering compared to just a few years ago. Let’s take a look at some of this year’s standouts.

GM is betting big on its proprietary Ultium battery technology investing $35 billion in self-driving and EV technologies through 2025. The company has also announced that it intends to sell 30 EV models by the end of 2025 and EVs exclusively after 2035 with the 1000 horsepower GMC Hummer EV serving as its vanguard offering.

Jonathan Ernst / reuters

The Hummer EV has been a surefire hit since its debut last October. More than 10000 potential buyers had placed down payments on the $112000 Hummer Edition 1 by last December. Similarly the Hummer’s EV SUV variant revealed in April had its pre-orders sell out in minutes — not bad for a vehicle that won’t actually hit the streets until Fall 2023. Deliveries for the Hummer EV pickup are slated to begin this month. There have even been rumblings about adapting the Hummer EV frame and power system to military applications though no firm decisions on that proposal have yet been made.

Hummers are only the start. In April GM confirmed that its second EV model will be an electrified Silverado. We still don’t know a whole lot about the Silverado beyond that it will leverage GM’s Ultium battery tech that the company is aiming for a 400-plus mile range and that the EV pickup will offer four-wheel steering which shortens turn radius’ at low speeds and increases cornering stability at high speeds — especially when towing loads.

We’ll have a full accounting of the Silverado’s capabilities once it makes its official debut during GM’s CES 2022 keynote address. What’s more GM teased its third upcoming EV in July — a full-size GMC pickup according to CNBC. Virtually nothing else is known about it at this time not even if it will use the existing GMC Sierra branding. Hopefully we’ll get some more hints in the new year.

Not to be outdone the Stellantis Group (formerly FCA and umbrella company to Chrysler Jeep Dodge Fiat Alfa Romeo Maserati and a host of others) announced in July that it too will be investing $35 billion towards its electrification efforts through 2025 and will have 55 electrified vehicles (40 BEVs 15 PHEVs) available in the US and European markets by the end of that year. What’s more Stellantis is working on an all-electric Ram EV to compete with the Silverado and Ford F-150 Lightning though the Ram isn’t expected to be released until 2024. For its part in 2021 Jeep showed off a slick-looking Wrangler BEV concept in March released its “light hybrid” Wrangler Sahara 4XE in May and debuted its PHEV Cherokee 4XE in September ahead of the vehicle’s 2022 release.

Ford also had a year worthy of honking its own horn about starting with the February release of the Mustang Mach-E. The EV was met with a bit of trepidation to start but cemented its position with the release of the performance-focused GT edition. In all Ford had sold more 21000 Mach-E units through this past October despite a handful of recalls for loose bolts and “deep sleeping” software bugs. That’s not bad for a first-year crossover SUV working to get past deeply ingrained customer nostalgia but the Mach-E’s numbers are nothing compared to the hype Ford’s upcoming F-150 Lightning EV has garnered.

The company’s F-150 electrification efforts have hardly been an industry secret but when Ford debuted the Lightning on May 19th (or May 18th if you were watching President Biden’s speech) America’s car-buying public just about lost its mind with nearly 45000 people signing up to preorder the EV pickup within the first 48 hours.

More than 44500 reservations in less than 48 hours...and counting. The future is here: https://t.co/pbgGgnTVrS #F150Lightning pic.twitter.com/mpAztdfXZX — Jim Farley (@jimfarley98) May 21 2021

Interest in Ford’s upcoming light hybrid Maverick pickup has been no less rampant. The Detroit News reported in August that more than 100000 people had allegedly signed up to preorder the mini-truck a large portion of which were California residents. Granted those folks weren’t obligated to place a down payment so whether all those pre-orders translate into actual sales — or folks just decide to restomod their existing ICE Fords with the eluminator system instead — remains to be seen.

Some of the biggest headlines in the 2021 EV truck space came from stellar startup Rivian. While competitors like Lordstown Motors found themselves critically low on cash and the subject of Justice Department fraud investigations Rivian has already hit its first production milestone: actually producing vehicles (despite having to push its initial delivery window from July to September). But that’s not the half of it.

This year the company also announced plans to install 10000 charging stations across North America by 2023 unveiled a membership plan for owners offering both Roadside and off-Roadside Assistance as well as exclusive OTA software updates and outlined its Remote Care program which would offer remote diagnoses and on-site repairs for the electric trucks. The startup has big plans for the future as well. It announced plans to invest $5 billion in a second US-based production plant and is reportedly eyeing the UK as the site for its first international battery facility.

Some of those future plans will involve partnerships with other companies such as Amazon — which owns a 20 percent stake in Rivian purchased 100000 vehicles from the startup in 2019 and has already begun making deliveries in San Francisco and Los Angeles with them — but they won’t include Ford. Despite investing half a billion dollars in the EV startup two years ago Ford announced in November that the two companies will no longer collaborate on an upcoming EV. Looks like that rumored electric Lincoln will likely stay dead for the time being.

On the other end of the headline spectrum is surprisingly Tesla. Despite the company’s massively profitable year the development of its Cybertruck has been slow going. While CEO Elon Musk announced in January that “volume production” of the EV SUV will begin in 2022 it’s increasingly looking like that will happen later in the year — after Ford’s F-150 Lightning and GMC’s Hummer EV hit the roads both of which debuted well after the Cybertruck did.

Of course American automakers are far from the only ones getting in on the EV game. Mercedes announced in April that its EQB compact SUV is nearly ready for production and will go on sale in the US next year. Its “Sustainer” delivery van concept however might take a bit longer to reach the market. Hyundai on the other hand unveiled its Ioniq 5 SUV in February with plans to release it this winter alongside promises that its Genesis line of vehicles will go entirely electric by the middle of this decade. Meanwhile Kia’s Niro EV continues to be a low-key sleeper hit.

We’ve seen much hype and grandiose promises about EV pickup trucks and SUVs over the last few years but 2022 will be the year when everything comes out in the wash. Consumers will finally be able to see these vehicles on the streets in their neighborhoods and likely breathing down their necks while stuck in traffic rather than just on a showroom floor or livestream presentation stage. This is a huge opportunity for automakers to further evangelize the benefits of battery electrics over their internal combustion predecessors — this time using America’s favorite type of vehicle.

Immediately the engine began running more quietly and putting out more power.

The new fuel was tetraethyl lead. With vast profits in sight – and very few public health regulations at the time – General Motors Co. rushed gasoline diluted with tetraethyl lead to market despite the known health risks of lead. They named it “Ethyl” gas.

It has been 100 years since that pivotal day in the development of leaded gasoline. As a historian of media and the environment I see this anniversary as a time to reflect on the role of public health advocates and environmental journalists in preventing profit-driven tragedy.

Lead and death

By the early 1920s the hazards of lead were well known – even Charles Dickens and Benjamin Franklin had written about the dangers of lead poisoning. When GM began selling leaded gasoline public health experts questioned its decision. One called lead a serious menace to public health and another called concentrated tetraethyl lead a “malicious and creeping” poison.

General Motors and Standard Oil waved the warnings aside until disaster struck in October 1924. Two dozen workers at a refinery in Bayway New Jersey came down with severe lead poisoning from a poorly designed GM process. At first they became disoriented then burst into insane fury and collapsed into hysterical laughter.

Many had to be wrestled into straitjackets. Six died and the rest were hospitalized. Around the same time 11 more workers died and several dozen more were disabled at similar GM and DuPont plants across the United States.

Fighting the media

The auto and gas industries’ attitude toward the media was hostile from the beginning. At Standard Oil’s first press conference about the 1924 Ethyl disaster a spokesman claimed he had no idea what had happened while advising the media that “Nothing ought to be said about this matter in the public interest.”

More facts emerged in the months after the event and by the spring of 1925 in-depth newspaper coverage started to appear framing the issue as public health versus industrial progress. A New York World article asked Yale University gas warfare expert Yandell Henderson and GM’s tetraethyl lead researcher Thomas Midgley whether leaded gasoline would poison people.

Midgley joked about public health concerns and falsely insisted that leaded gasoline was the only way to raise fuel power. To demonstrate the negative impacts of leaded fuel Henderson estimated that 30 tons of lead would fall in a dusty rain on New York’s Fifth Avenue every year.

Industry officials were outraged over the coverage. A GM public relations history from 1948 called the New York World’s coverage “a campaign of publicity against the public sale of gasoline containing the company’s antiknock compound.” GM also claimed that the media labeled leaded gas “loony gas” when in fact it was the workers themselves who named it as such.

Attempts at regulation

In May 1925 the U.S. Public Health Service asked GM Standard Oil and public health scientists to attend an open hearing on leaded gasoline in Washington. The issue according to GM and Standard involved refinery safety not public health. Frank Howard of Standard Oil argued that tetraethyl lead was diluted at over 1000 to 1 in gasoline and therefore posed no risk to the average person.

Public health scientists challenged the need for leaded gasoline. Alice Hamilton a physician at Harvard said “There are thousands of things better than lead to put in gasoline.” And she was right. There were plenty of well-known alternatives at the time and some were even patented by GM. But no one in the press knew how to find that information and the Public Health Service under pressure from the auto and oil industries canceled a second day of public hearings that would have discussed safer gasoline additives like ethanol iron carbonyl and catalytic reforming.

By 1926 the Public Health Service announced that they had “no good reason” to prohibit leaded gasoline even though internal memos complained that their research was “half baked.”

The rise and fall of leaded gasoline

Leaded gasoline went on to dominate fuel markets worldwide. Researchers have estimated that decades of burning leaded gasoline caused millions of premature deaths enormous declines in IQ levels and many other associated social problems.

In the 1960s and 1970s the public health case against leaded gasoline reemerged. A California Institute of Technology geochemist Clair Cameron Patterson was finding it difficult to measure lead isotopes in his laboratory because lead from gasoline was everywhere and his samples were constantly being contaminated.

Patterson created the first “clean room” to carry on his isotope work but he also published a 1965 paper “Contaminated and Natural Lead Environments of Man” and said that “the average resident of the U.S. is being subjected to severe chronic lead insult.”

In parallel by the 1970s the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency decided that leaded gasoline had to be phased out eventually because it clogged catalytic converters on cars and led to more air pollution. Leaded gasoline manufacturers objected but the objections were overruled by an appeals court.

The public health concerns continued to build in the 1970s and 1980s when University of Pittsburgh pediatrician Herbert Needleman ran studies linking high levels of lead in children with low IQ and other developmental problems. Both Patterson and Needleman faced strong partisan attacks from the lead industry which claimed that their research was fraudulent.

Both were eventually vindicated when in 1996 the U.S. officially banned the sale of leaded gasoline for public health reasons. Europe was next in the 2000s followed by developing nations after that. In August 2021 the last country in the world to sell leaded gas Algeria banned it.

A century of leaded gasoline has taken millions of lives and to this day leaves the soil in many cities from New Orleans to London toxic.

The leaded gasoline story provides a practical example of how industry’s profit-driven decisions – when unsuccessfully challenged and regulated – can cause serious and long-term harm. It takes individual public health leaders and strong media coverage of health and environmental issues to counter these risks."

This represents around 61% of its year-over-year growth in transaction volume.

This the report says has shown the strength of Airtel’s digital-first model and its distribution of more than 5 million banking points allowing it to scale up rapidly.

The growth in transaction volume has been sustained by a widespread pandemic-fueled switch to digital payments.

Growth is also spurred by new digital product offerings allowing for UPI-based payments bill and utility payments mobile and DTH recharges and its set of retail solutions.

The report says Airtel has been one of the fastest-growing banks. It now has more than 115 million users around India and over 8 million merchants.

The company’s goal is to add more digital inclusion for users.

“Airtel Payments Bank is able to offer its solutions to both the urban digital and the rural underbanked customer” said Anubrata Biswas CEO of Airtel. “Our products are user-need focused and designed to bring millions of users in the ambit of digital banking.”

PYMNTS reports that Airtel Africa got a $200 million investment for its Airtel Mobile Commerce unit from the Qatar Investment Authority.

Airtel Africa had a valuation of $2.65 billion. It’s listed on the London Stock Exchange and has been working to bring telecommunications services to Africa.

The new investment will see QIA take a minority stake in Airtel Mobile Commerce which operates several Airtel Africa mobile money operations.

The new capital will be used by Airtel Africa to bolster its asset monetization strategy and the company might go public in the next four years.

Airtel Africa also plans to use the new funding for debt reductions network enhancements and sales infrastructure.

Already the move to remote work and digital commerce has reshaped how people handle retail shopping cryptocurrency B2B payments and cross-border transactions.

The seismic shift began last year when COVID-19 caused in-person card payments to decline by 11.7 billion transactions or 13% from 2019. Simultaneously online and in-app payments rose by 8.7 billion transactions or 24% according to data the Federal Reserve released in December.

Pressure to improve the speed accuracy and security of payments increased pushing crypto closer to the mainstream. Now central banks around the world — including China — are flirting with the launch of their own digital currencies.

Fintechs are enabling many of these new payment innovations and in some cases they're directly challenging traditional financial services providers. In others fintechs are partners instead.

After announcing that his Los Angeles home had been broken into Mr. Sturridge said in a video at the time that he would “pay whatever” to get his missing dog back offering “20 Gs 30 Gs whatever” as a reward without specifying the currency.

Shortly after that video was posted Foster Washington of Los Angeles found the dog Lucci and returned him to Mr. Sturridge according to court records. But Mr. Washington 30 said he had never been paid and in March he filed a lawsuit for breach of contract.

On Tuesday Judge Curtis A. Kin of the Los Angeles County Superior Court issued a default judgment awarding $30000 in damages to Mr. Washington.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIxL2RlYy8yNS9kYW5pZWwtc3R1cnJpZGdlLW9yZGVyZWQtdG8tcGF5LTIyNDAwLXRvLXJhcHBlci13aG8tZm91bmQtaGlzLWxvc3QtZG9n0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3dvcmxkLzIwMjEvZGVjLzI1L2RhbmllbC1zdHVycmlkZ2Utb3JkZXJlZC10by1wYXktMjI0MDAtdG8tcmFwcGVyLXdoby1mb3VuZC1oaXMtbG9zdC1kb2c?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Daniel Sturridge ordered to pay £22400 to rapper who found his lost dog,"The former Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has been ordered to pay £22400 to a man who found his lost dog.

The footballer said his pomeranian named Lucci was stolen from a house in Los Angeles in 2019 and he offered a reward for its safe return.

Foster Washington a rapper known as Killa Fame shared pictures on social media and helped reunite Sturridge with his pet but said he was not paid.

A Los Angeles court has now ordered Sturridge to pay Washington $30000. Court documents show a default judgment was given meaning Sturridge did not respond to the complaint.

Washington said he felt “let down” by Sturridge. “Hopefully he pays up and doesn’t try to appeal it” he said.

“I’m excited about it I’ve been fighting this case for over a year I can’t believe it’s over. When we found the dog I thought my life was going to be better.”

Washington added he had yet to arrange the payment with Sturridge.

Sturridge 32 said he was “grateful” Lucci was back with his family and claimed he had paid a reward to a “young boy who found my dog”.

Writing on Twitter on Saturday he said: “On Christmas Day to have to relive the events of a robbery is shameful. Other people are trying to benefit for their own personal gain. Thank you to the young boy once again. This was 2 1/2 years ago and a crazy 24hrs. I’m very grateful lucci is back with our family. Love to all.”

In July 2019 Sturridge who now plays for Perth Glory in Australia’s A-League said thieves had broken into a house in west Hollywood California and taken a number of bags in addition to his dog.

He posted a video showing a broken glass door at the property and said: “Somebody’s broke into the house in LA took my dog from the house. Listen whoever knows who broke into my crib I’ll pay you anything. I’m dead serious.

“I wanna know what’s went on. I wanna know why they’ve took my dog. I wanna know why they’ve took bags from upstairs.

“How can you break into a house in LA and take somebody’s dog? Are you crazy? You’ve come into a house to take a dog?

“Yo somebody please find my dog. I’ll pay anything I’m dead serious. I want my dog back man.”

In a separate post he offered “20 30 grand” although it was not clear if he meant dollars or pounds."

As a teen he earned his first Academy Award nod for 1993’s What’s Eating Gilbert Grape. But despite the success of that film and 1996’s Romeo + Juliet the actor’s breakthrough role was still ahead of him. And he once acknowledged just how much the 1997 release of Titanic changed his life.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet at the 1998 Golden Globe Awards | HAL GARB/AFP

Leonardo DiCaprio was a rising star in the mid-1990s

Despite the movie star he’d become DiCaprio’s first few roles weren’t on the big screen. Instead he was mostly known for television. The actor appeared in episodes of The New Lassie The Mickey Mouse Club daytime soap Santa Barbara and the 1990-1991 Parenthood series. Then finally he landed a main role on the hit sitcom Growing Pains for its seventh and final season.

The same year he joined that show DiCaprio made his film debut in 1991’s Critters 3. That direct-to-video horror sequel is a fairly inauspicious place for the actor to start his movie career. But it didn’t take long for Hollywood to take notice. By the mid-1990s DiCaprio was a full-blown teen idol. And that status was only cemented further when he shared the screen opposite Kate Winslet in James Cameron’s Oscar-winning epic Titanic.

The actor felt a shift after ‘the Titanic’ phenomenon

Although he was already a star Titanic — once the highest-grossing movie of all time — DiCaprio was suddenly in the spotlight like never before. And according to Esquire that level of fame wasn’t something he was necessarily ready for.

“It wasn’t the era of penetrating Internet paparazzi that we have now. But my name wasn’t me anymore. I was sort of this thing. Kate felt it too. But a lot of the attention was on me because of the teenage girls who repeatedly went to see the movie. I had the blond hair and I was Jack Dawson this heroic figure. So I set up everything in my personal life to rebel against that image in order to strip it down. I had a lot of fun stripping it down. But ultimately that knocked me a few rungs down the ladder.”

DiCaprio soon would make deliberate efforts to change his image with his choice of film roles. After 1998’s The Man in the Iron Mask he starred in movies like 2000’s The Beach and mixed in some smaller films Celebrity and Don’s Plum. Needless to say the actor’s reputation would greatly change over time.

Leonardo DiCaprio’s career has grown beyond ‘Titanic’

Any lingering doubts about DiCaprio’s acting ability and range was shut down by the early 2000s. His work with Steven Spielberg in Catch Me If You Can in particular is often cited as one of his career-best performances. And his run of three straight movies with Martin Scorsese — Gangs of New York The Aviator and The Departed — elevated him to one of the most respected actors of his generation.

In fact by the time DiCaprio won his first Academy Award for The Revenant many fans felt the victory was overdue. With other hits like Inception The Wolf of Wall Street and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood DiCaprio isn’t just an Oscar-winning powerhouse but one of the few A-list actors capable of drawing an audience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzEyLzI2L2ludmVzdGluZy01MDAtZWFjaC1tb250aC1pbnRvLXRoZXNlLTItZXRmcy1jb3VsZC1zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investing $500 Each Month Into These 2 ETFs Could Set Your Kids Up for Life,"These high-growth sectors can make the most of your money.

Did you know that the average tuition at a private college is more than $38000 per year? Over a four-year program that could run you more than $152000 just in tuition costs. While public schools can be more affordable they still cost many thousands of dollars per year too. Saving money and investing it as soon as your child is born can help make these expenses much more manageable in the future.

And a great option for this type of investment is a high-growth emerging sector where your child will grow alongside some promising up-and-coming stocks. Although it may be difficult to pick winners in rapidly changing industries that's where exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can do the work for you. A couple of top ETFs suitable for long-term investors are the Global X Telemedicine & Digital Health ETF (EDOC 2.21%) and the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ 0.16%).

Below I'll show you how contributing $500 each month to one of these funds could grow your portfolio to more than $1 million and set your child or children up for life.

High growth can lead to major returns

A key reason these ETFs are great options for long-term investors is the future growth the telehealth and robotics sectors hold. Analysts from Fortune Business Insights project that the global telehealth market will be worth more than $636 billion by 2028 expanding at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 32% until then.

Teladoc Health (TDOC 4.18%) is one of the stocks in the Global X Telemedicine & Digital Health ETF and it is coming off a quarter where its telehealth visits increased (even as global economies started slowly recovering from the pandemic) demonstrating inelastic demand for these types of services. Other top healthcare companies in the fund include Cerner Tandem Diabetes and UnitedHealth Group.

The artificial intelligence (AI) robotics market is in its earlier growth stages and is worth just $6.9 billion today. But researchers at Markets and Markets estimate it will grow to a value of over $35 billion by 2026 with a higher CAGR of more than 38%. The robotics ETF includes chipmaker Nvidia robotic surgery pioneer Intuitive Surgical and AI-based consumer credit disruptor Upstart.

Knowing which stocks will be ubiquitous in five or 10 years is a challenge because so much can change in rapidly growing sectors. And that's where ETFs like Global X Telemedicine and Global X Robotics can make the decision-making process easier for investors as their holdings will evolve with the industry.

How a $500 investment each month can grow to $1 million

Starting early is key to long-term investing especially if your goal is to build up a robust nest egg for your child by the time they reach early adulthood. These ETFs likely aren't going to grow at 30% each year over the long term. But even if they can average annual growth rates between 10% and 15% that's enough to generate significant savings over their first 18 to 25 years. Here's how your portfolio might look under these circumstances if you started investing every month since when they were born:

Age of child Annual Return 18 20 25 10% $302784 $382848 $668945 12% $382720 $499574 $948818 15% $552128 $757977 $1642037

If you invested $500 each month for 25 years that would be a total contribution of $150000. That alone would almost be enough to pay off the tuition at a four-year private college program. But parents know that there are many more expenses to consider beyond just tuition including housing transportation and school supplies. Plus a strong savings account can allow your child to invest in income stocks that generate recurring dividends. That's why you always want to make the most of your investment and maximize it.

Through the power of compounding your $150000 investment could be worth nearly 11 times that amount if you averaged an annual rate of return of 15%. At 12% your portfolio would be a little under the $1 million mark at close to $949000 and be worth more than six times your contributions. Either way by investing and staying the course you could accumulate significant gains over the years to secure your child's financial future.

Set your child up for life by buying and holding these ETFs

Year to date neither of these two funds has performed particularly well. The telehealth ETF is down 16% while the robotics fund is up just 10%. By comparison the S&P 500 has risen more than 28%. But over the long term the outlook remains strong for these sectors and investors shouldn't get discouraged by short-term returns especially when looking at a much longer trajectory and with the focus being on building up your child's savings. The markets and these ETFs may not always generate positive returns every year but that doesn't mean the strategy is a failure.

As the companies in these funds continue growing their sales and strengthening their bottom lines it's inevitable that their share prices will recover and these ETFs will look a whole lot better. Investing in technological advancement is a sound strategy for the long haul and can help set your child up for life."

Satire and parody many argued need foils of real-world respectability. And Donald Trump the GOP's new lodestar has pretty much dispensed with the conventions of political decorum. But while postured propriety may have lost its luster in the political realm it remains alive and well in the private sector making Corporate America's blunders all the more visible.

2021 saw endless gaffes and gaucheries from powerful American corporations. Some were caught red-handed in embarrassing and nefarious schemes never meant for the public eye. Others waged embarrassing public relations offensives that earned unintended blowback. To critical onlookers all of the failed contrivances stand together as one big comedy of terrors.

Here are the private sector's top ten fuck-ups of 2021:

10. Ozy Media's co-founder impersonates YouTube executive in meeting with Goldman Sachs

In February executives from Ozy a digital media company whose financial practices have been widely scrutinized were closing in on a $40 billion cash injection from Goldman Sachs when they held a videoconference to hammer out the details of the deal. As The New York Times' Ben Smith would later go on to describe the Feb. 2 meeting was a bizarre mix of technical difficulties and deception.

During the meeting Alex Piper the head of unscripted programming for YouTube Originals was supposedly having technical difficulties on Zoom so all parties switched over to teleconference. Once the switch was made Goldman's executives heard from a man apparently impersonating Piper who gave a rapturous review of Ozy's management. After circling back with YouTube Goldman quickly realized that the man they'd heard from was Samir Rao the co-founder and chief operating officer of Ozy itself.

After Ozy's CEO admitted to the incident multiple board members reportedly pushed Rao to take a leave of absence. Ozy also lost its seed funding and saw resignations from former chairman Marc Lasry and co-founder Carlos Watson.

9. Basecamp bans employees' political discussions

Tech bros are notorious for their professed love of ""free speech"" – but the managers at Basecamp didn't even bother to pretend.

In April the web software company's leadership formally prohibited any and all ""societal and political discussions"" in internal company chat rooms calling such communications ""a major distraction"" from productivity in the workplace. CEO Jason Fried and co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson reportedly announced the policy in a blog post according to The Verge and later held an hours-long all-hands meeting that left several employees ""in tears"" over the company's decision.

The conflict reportedly arose in part from a ""long-standing company practice of maintaining a list of 'funny' customer names"" some of which include those of Asian and African descent. Additionally the company's longtime head of strategy reportedly questioned the existence of white supremacy.

Hours after the company's ban was announced at least 20 employees – over a third of Basecamp's entire workforce – resigned in protest.

8. Citizen places $30000 bounty on wrongfully accused arson suspect

In May as Los Angeles was struggling to contain a 1200-acre fire in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood Citizen the ""public safety"" app that gives users real-time crime alerts thought it might help out. Early into the containment effort investigators had ruled the fire an arson. So Citizen put out a $30000 bounty to help locate the suspect offering cash payments to any user with information about who might've started the fire.

According to VICE Citizen CEO Andrew Frame led a ""citywide app-fueled manhunt"" directing his employees to continue upping the ante on the bounty as users struggled to identify the arsonist. ""FIND THIS F*CK"" Frame told his employees over Slack. ""LETS GET THIS GUY BEFORE MIDNIGHT HES GOING DOWN.""

After Citizen identified Devin Hilton a homeless man as the suspected arsonist circulating Hilton's photo to roughly 861000 users law enforcement authorities shortly arrested Hilton and later found they had scant evidence to charge him with anything.

The sheriff who questioned Hilton said Citizen's manhunt was ""potentially disastrous.""

After Hilton was eventually released Citizen apologized: ""Once we realized this error we immediately retracted the photo and reward offer. We are actively working to improve our internal processes to ensure this does not occur again. This was a mistake we are taking very seriously.""

7. Better.com CEO fires 900 employees over Zoom before Christmas

Earlier this year things at online mortgage originator Better.com seemed to be going well – at least on paper. The company had significantly raised its profile after announcing back in May that it would go public via an SPAC merger. And last month Better revealed that it would be receiving a $750 million cash injection from investment management company SoftBank.

But on December 8 CEO Vishal Garg did something that according to reports few employees expected. Citing issues with ""the market"" and ""productivity"" Garg laid off 9% of his entire workforce just before the holidays in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic over Zoom.

Facing a maelstrom of criticism from employees who were given a month's pay and three months of benefits the executive only felt inclined to apologize for the way he handled things.

""I failed to show the appropriate amount of respect and appreciation for the individuals who were affected and for their contributions to Better"" Garg said.

""I blundered the execution.""

6. AT&T bankrolls far-right One America News Network (OANN)

AT&T the world's largest telecommunications company has apparently been central to the success of one of the most corrosive news channels in America.

In October a Reuters investigation found that AT&T has been the financial life force of One America News Network (OANN) a far-right news channel known for peddling baseless – and downright dangerous – conspiracies theories about the pandemic and the 2020 election.

According to OANN founder Robert Herring Sr. the far-right network was originally inspired by AT&T executives who wanted to monetize a conservative news network. AT&T has also reportedly disbursed roughly $57 million in monthly fees to OANN since 2013 and at one point sought to buy the channel for $250 million.

Shortly after the report AT&T said it's ""never had a financial interest in OAN's success and does not 'fund' OAN."" (And we should probably trust AT&T on this point since the company is squeaky clean otherwise.)

5. Howard Schultz uses Holocaust analogy to describe Starbucks' mission

In November as Starbucks employees in Buffalo New York were organizing to hold a historic union vote management threw out a series of Hail Marys in a bid to squash the effort. One of these counter-offensives came in the form of an appearance from billionaire Howard Schultz Starbucks' former chairman who sallied over to Buffalo to vaguely dissuade pro-union workers from unionizing.

In front of hundreds of baristas Shultz expressed that Starbucks is ""not a perfect company"" saying: ""We listen. We learn. We get better together."" Schultz a Jew then thought it wise to invoke a Holocaust metaphor by recounting a story once told to him by a rabbi.

Referencing blankets shared by prisoners at Nazi concentration camps Schultz said ""So much of that story is threaded into what we've tried to do at Starbucks – is share our blanket.""

4. Amazon executive claims company is ""the Bernie Sanders of employers""

Starbucks isn't the only company that sufficiently embarrassed itself during a union effort. Back in March Amazon was also in the midst of waging a comprehensive – and ultimately successful – campaign to defang a union effort led by warehouse workers in Bessemer Alabama.

At the time Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont long a crusader of labor rights announced that he'd be speaking in Birmingham to offer support for the union drive. But Dave Clark the CEO of the company's worldwide consumer vertical found Sanders' impending presence a tweetable offense.

""I welcome @SenSanders to Birmingham and appreciate his push for a progressive workplace. I often say we are the Bernie Sanders of employers"" Clark tweeted but that's not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace.""

The very next day stories of Amazon workers having to pee in bottles to meet efficiency demands began making the rounds online. Amazon immediately denied any reports of this happening and later apologized for denying them.

3. ExxonMobil lobbyist caught in Greenpeace ""sting"" operation

It isn't often that you get to see a corporate lobbyist caught with their pants down. But this year thanks to Greenpeace we saw just that.

Back in July Unearthed an environmental news team run by Greenpeace UK led an undercover ""sting"" operation against two Exxon lobbyists to gain better insight into the dark art of oil lobbying. Posing as corporate headhunters Unearthed ensnared Keith McCoy (a senior director for federal relations at Exxon) and Dan Easley (a former Exxon White House lobbyist) asking them questions about their experiences laundering the company's interests through the federal government.

McCoy and Easley soberly remarked on the many ways in which Exxon has effectively shut down meaningful climate action even describing oil industry trade groups like the American Petroleum Institute as the company's ""whipping boys.""

""Did we join some of these 'shadow groups' to work against some of the early efforts [at regulation]? Yes that's true"" McCoy said during his interview. ""But there's nothing illegal about that. You know we were looking out for our shareholders.""

After the report Exxon CEO Darren Woods claimed that McCoy and Easley's remarks were ""entirely inconsistent with the way we expect our people to conduct themselves."" (And he's not entirely wrong; if you're trying to hide the fact that your business depends on the earth's destruction you'd want your lobbyists to be a bit more discreet about it.)

2. Reddit comes to GameStop's rescue

Back in January of this year GameStop – a video game retailer that had been struggling financially years before the pandemic – was facing certain death. Major institutional investors on Wall Street like Melvin Capital had put down massive short positions on the stock and so the company's downfall seemed like a self-fulfilling prophecy. That is until a brigade of Reddit investors entered the picture.

Seeing that Wall Street was shorting the company Reddit users from an amateur retail investing forum known as ""r/wallstreetbets"" led an offensive against the institutional bigwigs collectively pouring millions of dollars into GameStop. The effort caused GameStop's stock to skyrocket by over 2000% trapping Melvin in a shortsqueeze. (This means that Melvin was forced to buy GameStop's stock to cover its losses – a move that caused the stock to rise even more.)

Things got so chaotic that billionaire investor Leon Cooperman went on CNBC to deliver an unhinged screed about Reddit's ""attack"" on wealthy people saying that ""fair share is a bullshit concept. It's just a way of attacking wealthy people. It's inappropriate and we all gotta work together and pull together.""

In the end Melvin lost around 53% of its assets ($4.5 billion) as a result of the affair and had to be bailed out by another asset manager.

1. Facebook changes its name amid a devastating whistleblower scandal

This year Yahoo Finance selected Facebook as the ""Worst Company of the Year"" – and for good reason.

In September with help of The Wall Street Journal ex-Facebook employee Frances Haugen began leaking a trove of damning internal documents which reveal that Facebook is both aware of its harmful impacts on Americans and has done next to nothing to mitigate them.

Thousands of documents leaked by Haugen show that the company systematically prioritizes profit over combating hate and misinformation a lapse that directly fomented the Capitol riot according to The Washington Post and has led to genocidal violence abroad. In an interview with ""60 Minutes"" Haugen claimed that Facebook established a program known as Civic Integrity designed to combat misinformation. However this program was dissolved ahead of the 2020 election which she said was a ""betrayal of democracy.""

By the end of October Facebook facing perhaps more public scrutiny than any company in modern history changed its name to ""Meta"" to reflect its sudden interest in developing the Metaverse a hypothetical 3-D version of the Internet.

In a market dominated by China this 101-year-old U.S. company stands out. Its pumps impellers and pump parts don’t corrode. They’re not mass-produced but crafted one at a time to customer specifications. And they come with a guarantee of customer satisfaction.

Tell us about your yourself. Where are you from?

I’m from Basking Ridge New Jersey. I graduated from Lehigh University in Bethlehem Pennsylvania and have an MBA from Pace University in New York as well as a postgraduate degree from Pace.

Wow lots of degrees! How did you get into the pump business?

I was a manager for U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh for a number of years and an opportunity came along to buy a decades-old company in my home state of New Jersey with a reputation for quality and durability. So I purchased SIMS Pump in the early 1990s.

Where is SIMS based?

SIMS Pump is headquartered in Hoboken New Jersey across the Hudson River from New York City.

Tell us a little bit about the company’s long and storied history and its evolution over the years. Where does the name “SIMS” come from?

SIMS Pump was founded in 1919 by Admiral William Sims and his brother with the invention of the SIMS pump valve for reciprocating pumps. It started in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn and eventually moved to downtown Manhattan and then to Hoboken as it steadily grew. From the beginning it offered a guarantee of complete customer satisfaction unheard of in those days and a rarity even today. It’s part of what distinguishes us.

In the first four decades that followed SIMS provided maritime and other industries with valves of bronze stainless steel and monel a nickel alloy. But the inherent “clattering” of the reciprocating pump valve caused by the pump rotator pounding against the disk led to our first big breakthrough – the invention of one of the first composites on the market. In 1945 the Simsite® disk made its debut for use in reciprocating pumps.

Recognizing that conventional metallic centrifugal pumps were subject to electrolysis corrosion erosion and cavitation when used in corrosive services like seawater wastewater sewage and chemicals SIMS developed and patented in 1955 the first Simsite® impellers and casing rings.

The success of these products led to the development in 1985 of complete Simsite® pumps which won numerous awards and received approval from – among others – the U.S. Navy which remains a big customer. In addition to marine and Navy applications SIMS provides pumping solutions for companies municipalities and cities around the world for many different services and applications.

In 1995 for example we designed the largest composite vertical turbine pump in the world – two of them! – for Potomac Electric Power in Virginia. More recently we designed and built a two-stage horizontal split case pump for a BP refinery in the Midwest.

Okay what is Simsite® and why is it so special?

Simsite® is a patented carbon fiber structural composite manufactured exclusively by SIMS. It’s 100 percent machined and utilizes a tridimensional weave affording outstanding mechanical properties. SIMS pumps impellers casing rings and other parts never corrode in seawater wastewater sewage or river water and have excellent corrosion resistance for many chemical applications as well. Because SIMS products are completely machined from solid blocks of Simsite® they aren’t subject to internal voids cracks or imperfections like cast or molded products.

The proof is in the pudding and one very large Simsite® impeller and casing ring set was installed in a main circulating pump in 1965 and ran continuously until 2020 when it was sent back to our factory for reconditioning. It was designed and engineered for 14000 gallons per minute of seawater and lasted 55 years in seawater service without a hitch!

Impressive! How many patents does the company hold?

SIMS Pump has four patents: two on structural composites (Simsite®) one on stabilizing bushings for all rotating equipment and one on a packing cartridge to seal pumps.

What distinguishes SIMS from other pump makers?

SIMS does not manufacture “standard pump products.” Our products are custom-engineered for the customer's operating point making that point the best efficiency point and thereby increasing reliability durability and performance.

For technically challenged readers like me please explain the basics of how a pump works and what “impellers” are.

Impellers are the “heart” of the pump. That’s why we design engineer and machine each impeller specifically for the customer’s use making it much more efficient and reliable than standard products and eliminating both mechanical and hydraulic balance problems as well as radial loading issues.

We read something about a unique product you built for Halliburton the “Halliburton pump.” Tell us about that.

The 8x6x13 chemical pumps designed for Halliburton were machined from a solid block of Simsite® structural composite and installed on vessels used in the oil industry. The pumps are an integral component in deepwater acidizing systems designed specifically for a set of performance specifications set forth by Halliburton with a capacity of 1800 GPM at a head pressure of 120 FT at 1750 RPM driven by a 150-HP hydraulic motor.

The liquid pumped is 33 percent hydrochloric acid which is forced into rock formations with greater pressure than the rock can withstand causing the rock to fracture. The Simsite® pump was designed to take the abuse not only from the hydrochloric acid but also from outside elements – hence the beefy design. Our pumps were chosen for this application because of the liquid being used in the process. Simsite® won’t corrode like conventional metallic pumps.

Is the maritime industry your most important market?

The maritime market is our largest but as previously noted we also serve the power generation waste-water chemical and defense markets.

Do you have a presence overseas? How important are international markets for SIMS?

We sell products worldwide. International markets are very important for us.

We see that many SIMS products are U.S. Navy-approved. How big is the military business for SIMS vs. the commercial side?

The military market is an extremely important part of our business and accounts for 35 to 40 percent of our overall sales.

Where is the biggest growth coming from?

The largest growth we see is in the wastewater business.

How has COVID affected your business and how have you adapted? Is business getting better or worse?

COVID has definitely impacted our business negatively but we’ve been able to continue operating successfully. One advantage lies in the fact that our products are value-added and must be requested and specified by Engineering or Maintenance Departments and not through standard Purchasing Departments. Most Purchasing Departments only look at “low price” and don’t consider reliability longevity efficiency and durability so engineered products like ours must be specified in order for Purchasing to select them. That’s given us a leg up.

You announced recently that you would accept cryptocurrency as payment for SIMS products thereby becoming one of the first companies to do so. Give us the scoop on that. Has anyone taken you up on your offer?

We see cryptocurrency as the future and therefore we accept cryptocurrency. So far no company has offered to pay in crypto but we like to be on the cutting edge.

What’s your vision for SIMS Pumps? Where would you like to see it in say five years?

Simsite® products are just starting to become recognized in the seawater wastewater and corrosive markets and we see huge growth in sales in the next five years. Despite the fact that we’ve been operating globally for decades many companies are just starting to become aware of Simsite® products and technology. Just like carbon fiber bicycles are becoming more popular our Simsite® products are becoming more well-known.

The goal is to have shipowners chief engineers port engineers maintenance engineers plant managers and engineering companies specify Simsite® impellers and casing rings in their centrifugal pumps.

So is that your biggest challenge right now? Visibility raising awareness of the Simsite® brand?

That’s important but the biggest challenge for SIMS Pump and any other company manufacturing value-added engineered products is to compete with low-priced imports being dumped all over the world from China India and other low-cost producing countries. Although these low-priced products are not comparable with superior value-added products they are low-priced and with the smart phone computer and digital market place many purchasing people just look at low price. They don’t consider value longevity durability efficiency ROI or quality. Superior products must be driven requested or specified from maintenance operations and engineering.

The first time a pump has to be overhauled because of any failure the company has lost money. Low price does not mean low cost. It usually means high cost as a result of maintenance repair and downtime!

Okay tell us about some of your extracurricular activities.

I play classical piano chess and take Tae Kwon Do blackbelt classes which helps me deal with the many stresses in life as well as relax.

What’s a typical day like for you?

Most days are consumed with a focus on increasing sales and engineering superiority for our excellent products.

How would you describe your management style?

I focus on improving the strengths of each person and we have a great team!

Is the third time the charm?,"Editor’s Note: This story was originally published on March 17 2021. Read more of CT Mirror’s “Best of 2021” stories here.

The interstate highways that were jackhammered through Hartford six decades ago may have increased vehicular mobility but they did so at great cost to the fabric of the city. Now a new plan — a mix of previous efforts along with new ideas — aims to remedy that.

Decades ago the construction of I-91 cut Hartford off from the Connecticut River. I-84 isolated the North End from downtown and consumed a large swath of land and many historic buildings including the majestic Hartford Public High School campus. The interchange of the two highways laid waste to part of the central business district.

East Hartford wasn’t spared; its massive “mixmaster” interchange occupies an area the size of downtown Hartford.

The placement of the highways has been criticized almost since they were built. In the past decade two strategies emerged to remediate the damage. One developed by state transportation officials proposed taking I-84 through the North Meadows and over a new bridge. The other put forward by U.S. Rep. John Larson would put both highways in an elaborate series of tunnels.

Neither of those concepts is moving ahead. The state abruptly pulled the plug on its process in 2019 to do a broader regional mobility study. Larson’s idea which garnered some praise but considerable criticism as unworkable and dauntingly complicated never gained traction.

Now a third idea a hybrid that uses parts of the first two plans has emerged and is being presented to civic and business officials neighborhood groups and others.

Is the third time the charm?

The new plan is part of a regional planning effort called Hartford 400 initiated by the iQuilt project in Hartford. It envisions a roughly triangular ring road around the downtown with some tunneling but much less than Larson proposed and new connections to East Hartford.

The preliminary cost estimate is $17 billion over a period of 15 years.

For that investment:

The I-84/I-91 and “mixmaster” interchanges would be removed freeing more than 150 acres of prime urban land for development in both towns.

I-91 would be capped through downtown Hartford. The cap above the highway would carry a new avenue bordered by new development on one side and new parkland on the other — effectively a 1.5 mile extension of Riverside Park. Thirteen downtown streets would connect to the new “River Road.” Through-traffic on I-91 would take the existing highway; local traffic would use River Road to access downtown.

The decaying 1940s-era river dikes would be repaired. This is considered essential lest Hartford risk a Katrina-like disaster.

The portion of I-84 from Union Station to the Bulkeley Bridge — now an elevated curve dropping into a 200-foot-wide trench — would no longer be needed once the interchange is moved. Morgan Street would be restored as an urban avenue connecting Main Street to the riverfront. The North End would no longer be walled off but connected to the rest of the city.

A seven-mile linear park an increasingly popular amenity and economic development draw in cities across the country would be built from Bloomfield along the little-used Griffin rail line to downtown and then to East Hartford.

Three new bridges would be built across the Connecticut River dispersing traffic bottlenecks.

The goal would be growth. Planners think with better organized transportation and housing the Connecticut Valley could add half again to its population (of about 1 million) without increasing sprawl adding pollution or damaging the region’s New England character.

The plan is being well received notably by Larson who praised it as “brilliant” in a recent interview saying it meets all of his infrastructure goals. He said he plans to put the Hartford 400 plan forward as part of the Biden administration’s proposed $2 trillion infrastructure program that is expected later this year. With the Biden plan coming and New England Democrats heading key Congressional committees Larson sees “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”

“We’ve got to be ready” he said.

Gov. Ned Lamont and transportation commissioner Joseph Giuletti presumably would have to sign off as well and neither has been heard from yet. Larson said he would be shocked if they didn’t support the proposal.

Broader Vision

The progression to Hartford 400 began about two decades ago with efforts to replace the 2.5-mile series of viaducts that carry I-84 through much of Hartford. About 80 percent of the 1960s-era roadway was built on bridge stanchions that had a projected 50-year lifespan.

The state Department of Transportation considered simply repairing the viaducts as they stood. But a citizen’s group the Hub of Hartford formed and said in so many words if you’re going to repair the highway why not undo some of the damage it did to the city?

The DOT got behind the idea. The viaducts were repaired to extend their use and in 2012 the department initiated a public planning process to determine the future of the highway.

The planners determined that bringing the highway down to or slightly below grade level was the best way to replace the viaduct system. It would allow city streets to cross the roadway reconnecting the North End and Asylum Hill to the rest of the city.

But that didn’t solve the congestion problem. I-84 was built to carry 55000 vehicles a day but by that time was carrying 175000. Add the 100000 on I-91 and the interchange of the two interstates was the worst bottleneck in the state and the second worst in New England according to the American Transportation Research Institute.

So in 2016 then-DOT Commissioner James Redeker initiated a study of the I-84/I-91 interchange looking for a way to reduce the congestion.

Then in the winter of 2016-17 seemingly out of the blue came Larson’s tunnel plan. The Congressman had for several years been trying to get federal funding to repair the river dikes which the Army Corps of Engineers determined were in an “unacceptable” state of repair after a 2013 inspection.

Meeting with engineers about the dikes in the spring of 2016 Larson wondered if the traffic congestion problem couldn’t be solved with tunnels with the rock from boring the tunnel going to shore up the dikes — two birds with tons of stone. He said more meetings followed culminating in the tunnel proposal.

The concept called for an east-west tunnel running four miles from Flatbush Avenue in Hartford under the southern tier of the city and the river to the Roberts Street area in East Hartford. A north-south tunnel would run two miles from the North to the South Meadows. They would meet at a large cloverleaf intersection under Colt Park which would add four to six miles of tunnels.

That would be at least twice the five miles of tunnels created in Boston’s Big Dig.

Larson asked DOT highway engineers to study his proposal. They did. They didn’t think it would work. The issues were cost the complexity of an underground interchange and local traffic.

The idea — it was never crystalized to a formal plan — was that the tunnels would carry through-traffic while existing roads and bridges would become boulevards for local traffic.

The problem there was that most of the peak highway traffic — more than two-thirds at rush hour — is local going to or from Hartford and East Hartford. So tens of thousands of cars would have to use the boulevards likely increasing rather than lessening congestion.

The solution the DOT planners preferred was a “northern alignment” which would bring I-84 on a new connector capped in residential areas through the Clay Arsenal neighborhood to the city’s North Meadows to which the I-84/I-91 interchange would be relocated. I-84 would then go over a new bridge and reconnect to the existing highway in East Hartford.

Larson didn’t think this plan went far enough to recapture the river and continued to promote the tunnel concept. The DOT which likes to stay on the powerful Congressman’s good side pulled back the I-84 study in 2019 and replaced it with a three-year regional mobility study saying the region’s infrastructure needed a “holistic approach.” So the momentum stopped.

But wait.

iQuilt

In 2007-08 the folks at the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts initiated an urban design process to better connect downtown Hartford’s arts and cultural institutions and make the area more inviting for pedestrians and bicyclists.

They hired Doug Suisman a Hartford native and scion of a prominent local family. Though Suisman was — and is — an internationally-known urban planner in Los Angeles he had always kept in close touch with his hometown. He proceeded to design the iQuilt a loose-footed network of public spaces some new and some restored running from the river to Bushnell Park and the Capitol. A nonprofit the iQuilt Partnership was created to execute the plan.

The “green walk” has made downtown — almost unconsciously — a more pleasant place to walk. By 2018 this central iQuilt project with features such as Travelers Tower Square and the Bushnell Park promenade was almost complete. The board and staff decided to keep the iQuilt effort going.

“A region should have an ongoing organization that’s a steward of the public realm” Suisman said in a recent interview. The question was how to go forward.

Suisman recalled that Hartford was nearing its 400th anniversary in 2035. Using that as a timeframe the group backed with a grant from the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving created a visioning project for the Connecticut River Valley: what did the region want to be in 2035 and how might it get there?

The first step was to review almost 100 plans that had been done in the region over the years from the Bradley Airport expansion Riverfront Recapture the Hartford Line and the I-84 Project all the way back to the construction of the Bulkeley Bridge in 1908 — “everything we could find” Suisman said.

They were “looking for commonalities” Suisman said areas of agreement. Working in tandem with the Hartford Planning & Zoning Commission which was preparing its plan of conservation and development also focused on 2035 they found “a lot of consensus” in the region on five broad goals: equity economic growth arts and culture environmental sustainability and mobility.

On the latter the highways were still a sticking point.

After studying the plans Suisman concluded that the DOT and Larson had much the same goals but different approaches. It was about then that the DOT determined that the I-84/I-91 interchange had to be moved. In Suisman’s mind that changed everything — “It was a big deal.”

Instead of repairing a road it opened the door to reimagining the whole system. “We asked ‘What happens if you move the interchange? How can we figure this out as an economic development project?’”

Synthesis

Suisman saw strengths in both the DOT and Larson plans so over 18 months he created a hybrid a synthesis of the two. One point of the triangular plan as with the two earlier plans is the Flatbush Avenue access to I-84 in the western part of the city. Suisman’s plan uses a tunnel from that point to take I-84 to the Charter Oak Bridge and then over it to reconnect with the existing highway in East Hartford.

The plan also uses the “northern alignment” road which Suisman dubs I-891 from Flatbush along part of the I-84 corridor then through the North Meadows and over a new bridge to East Hartford. The third leg of the scalene triangle is the capped I-91.

Suisman and the consulting engineer Foster Nichols solve the daily downtown bottleneck by dispersing the traffic. Instead of a huge downtown interchange there are two smaller interchanges north and south of downtown. The northern I-891 route has five ramps to downtown. The river road atop I-91 connects to 13 downtown streets. In addition to the new bridge for I-891 Suisman envisions two more traffic bridges south of downtown connecting the Coltsville and Brainard field areas to East Hartford.

Does the region need three new bridges?

The bottleneck coming from the east is caused by limited options he said. For example people coming west from Pratt & Whitney and Goodwin College have to use the highway. More bridges disperse traffic and better connect the South Meadows industrial area to Pratt and other East Hartford businesses.

“Look at Pittsburgh” said Suisman who has worked there. Sometimes called the City of Bridges Pittsburgh claims 446 bridges so many that bridges are part of the skyline.

If all goes according to plan the Coltsville bridge will connect to a new neighborhood in East Hartford. The construction of the river dikes freed floodplain land in East Hartford for development Suisman said but instead much of it was used for the massive mixmaster interchange. Removing it — just leaving a capped connector from the new northern bridge to Route 2 — opens a remarkable 130 acres of prime riverfront land for development. Suisman imagines an area called MidTown a river-oriented mid-rise neighborhood surrounding a park.

The plan isn’t just about cars. It encourages active transportation — biking and walking — and accommodates the city’s new transit options. The multi-modal home run would be a connection to North Atlantic Rail the proposed New York to Boston high-speed rail line which planners hope to bring through Hartford.

Watch This Space

Suisman’s renderings of development on both sides of the river somewhat suggest Chicago’s Lake Shore Drive with its waterfront parks roadway and mid-rise buildings. Lake Shore is the product of a well-known 1909 Chicago city plan by architect and planner Daniel Burnham who famously said “Make no little plans.”

Hartford 400 is no little plan. It might take 15 years to build and define the region for 100 years. Of course the original interstate highway plan was also big.

“We have to get it right this time” Larson said.

Much depends on the passage of Biden’s infrastructure bill. Larson stressed that funding would be separate from the normal federal funding for state transportation projects. He said the project could be built in stages if need be.

But the initial response is positive.

“We showed it to 58 people last week and have not received a single negative comment” said Jackie Mandyck executive director of the iQuilt Partnership.

One audience member was veteran planner and consultant Toni Gold who’s been involved with the Hub of Hartford Riverfront Recapture and any number of other Hartford initiatives. She is not an easy sell.

The city will spend about $1 million over the next two years of federal COVID-19 relief funds in what could be the first steps toward creating a long-contemplated convention and visitors bureau aimed solely at Hartford. The relief funds are targeted for efforts to spur economic recovery from the pandemic.

The effort — being tentatively referred to as “Destination Hartford” — will be coordinated by the Capital Region Development Authority the quasi-public agency that oversees the running of the Connecticut Convention Center which opened in 2005 on the city’s riverfront.

The Connecticut Convention Center in Hartford seen from East Hartford.

“We know we have to step up our game” Michael W. Freimuth CRDA’s executive director said. “It’s harder and harder right now. There are a lot of people out there trying to book events a lot of events that aren’t as big and glorious as they once were. You’ve got to get more of them to get some ‘critical mass’ going.”

The idea is to better connect conventioneers with what is going on in the city and not just downtown but throughout the neighborhoods. That means getting discount tickets to everything from ballgames at Dunkin’ Donuts Park to special exhibits at the Wadsworth Atheneum.

“If there’s a neighborhood festival or there’s a restaurant out in a far end of the city” Freimuth said “we can work on a special transport out and let them enjoy something like the First & Last restaurant on the tail end of Maple Avenue.”

The effort aims at moving beyond just reacting to visitor needs but being out in front with options and a plan for making them happen.

Freimuth said conventioneers and other visitors to Hartford want to step out of the convention center and know there is a wide array of entertainment options.

“Conventioneers really want to walk outside and be someplace” Freimuth said. “They are not all into getting on buses and driving an hour.”

Losing money

Hartford’s convention center business much like competing venues regionally and nationally took a huge hit in the pandemic.

In the fiscal year 2019 there were 167 events according to CRDA. That fell to 105 events in fiscal 2020 because the convention center lost the last three months as the pandemic took hold. There were no events in fiscal 2021.

Connecticut Convention Center and the Hartford Marriott Downtown left in Hartford.

This fiscal year there are 64 events on the calendar compared with 70 that were projected. Bookings again got underway in September with ConnectiCon mixed martial arts and academic-related expos.

This year’s events are predominantly family events dancing and religious groups CRDA said. Event promoters remain concerned about attendance and exhibitors having their products available the agency said.

CRDA is projecting a loss of nearly $6 million for the Columbus Boulevard venue this fiscal year double what it normally sees.

Typically operating losses are offset by tax revenue generated by convention center events. But the pandemic cut deep so the rest of the $6 million will largely be offset by other COVID-19 relief funds.

The city sees the $1 million as a good use of its relief funds to recover from the pandemic and jump-start the local economy.

“So we think a big part of our ability to recover and to support local businesses and restaurants that are here — and want to be here — is to drive activity at the convention center” Thea Montanez the city’s chief operating officer said. “We need feet on the street right? Many of our larger employers — their employees are still working from home — and so that has certainly impacted feet on the street.”

A cornerstone of the effort would be visitors to Harford “to experience the city the whole city because of our diversity” Montanez said.

“We have to figure out ways when visitors are coming here they are easily able to connect with all the assets that we have” Montanez said.

A new initiative aims to make Hartford more of a destination for conventions by tying together attractions in the city from museums to restaurants to the Hartford Yard Goats.

Making Hartford the focus

The idea of a convention and visitors bureau focused on Hartford had been percolating for a year or so before the pandemic struck.

Even before COVID-19 it was clear the Connecticut Convention Center was facing increased competition including from new convention and event venues at the state’s casinos.

A consultant’s report in fall of 2019 recommended the formation of a new convention and visitors bureau focused on Hartford.

The organization should have a consistent state-funded operating budget of between $3 million and $5 million annually that would showcase the city an effort now sorely lacking Chicago-based Johnson Consulting said in its report.

“This effort will significantly enhance the penetration of citywide events and provide a consistent resource for selling the destination” the report said.

The former Greater Hartford Convention & Visitors Bureau which had a heavy focus on the city has gradually morphed into the Connecticut Convention & Sports Bureau with a statewide focus.

Freimuth said there was a push to seek financing for such a state-funded bureau but it fell to the sidelines once the pandemic hit.

The new effort would likely start small with the addition of one or two positions at the convention center to focus solely on Hartford plus funding to build the framework for making stronger connections between the city’s attractions the convention center and event visitors.

If successful the effort could be used to argue for a larger state-funded organization Freimuth said.

Rebuilding the convention business in Hartford won’t be easy for multiple reasons including making sure there are enough hotel rooms in the city to draw the bigger events.

An aerial view of the city of Hartford looking south. At center bottom is Constitution Plaza. I-91 and the Connecticut River are on the left. The Connecticut Convention Center can be seen at upper left.

The pandemic also took a big bite out of the hospitality industry. City and state officials in Hartford scrambled to find an alternative to keeping at least part of the Hilton hotel on Trumbull Street when it appeared it could close by the end of the year.

Last week the state approved an $11 million state-taxpayer backed loan to convert the upper floors of the Hilton to apartments and renovate the lower floors for a DoubleTree hotel.

Freimuth said the new marketing effort is another piece of the puzzle to bring the city’s convention business back from the pandemic.

“COVID layered on a whole new dimension but this is a moment to be a little more aggressive a little more Hartford smart” Freimuth said. “It really needs to be punched up. Right now it’s more reactive than pro-active and pitching.”

Hall Senior Activity Center enjoyed a pair of holiday activities recently.

A holiday fun day was held Dec. 14 at the center followed by a shopping trip in the afternoon. On Dec. 16 visitors participated in an ugly sweater contest and were treated to the center's annual Christmas lunch.

Guests at the Dec. 14 morning party played a number of games including deciphering a list of Christmas song titles written with emojis answering a list of holiday trivia questions and unscrambling holiday words. The top three scorers in each game were awarded prizes. Winners could select from cookies turnovers or cinnamon rolls for their prizes. Christmas scratch-off cards were distributed and those whose card revealed a ""Nice"" were given prizes while holders of ""Naughty"" cards received nothing.

The final prize was awarded to the winner of a guessing game. A large jar of Hershey's Kisses sat on a table at the side of the room and guests were invited to guess how many Kisses were in the jar. Mary Griffin won the prize with her guess of 500 since the jar contained 509 candies. She was given a pillow with a snowman design and a snowman doll.

Refreshments of punch cheese and crackers cocktail sausages cookies and candy were served.

Members of the First Assembly of God Church entertained visitors by singing gospel songs and Christmas tunes in the half hour just before lunch. Entertainers were vocalist Margo Thomas Sharon Vaughn on guitar Jerry Yingst on guitar and his wife Charlene Yingst on the piano.

On Dec. 16 guests began arriving at midmorning as refreshments of punch cookies and candy were again available. Several were attired in colorful holiday sweaters as an ugly sweater contest was on the calendar. Most of the patrons present who had earlier signed up for a secret Santa gift exchange opened gifts from their unknown benefactors.

Entrants in the sweater contest were asked to stand up and introduce themselves then each one present was given a ballot to vote for his or her choice. Almost everyone agreed there were really no ugly sweaters so winners were actually awarded ""best"" sweater prizes although their sashes read ""Ugly"" ""Uglier"" and ""Ugliest.""

LaVonda Augustine was winner of the sweater contest with her sweater reading ""Feliz Navidad"" and featuring a south of the border theme. Chili peppers adorned a Christmas palm tree and Santa was reclining under the tree wearing a sombrero and strumming his guitar.

Juanita Whiteside was the second-place winner with a colorful reindeer on her sweater sporting a red nose Christmas hat and sweater and a pair of sparkly glasses. Mary Griffin took third place with her red green and white striped sweater adorned with snowflakes and a pair of llamas wearing holiday hats and scarves. Each winner received a badge and a sash.

Tables were covered with holiday tablecloths and decorated with potted poinsettias. Each place setting featured a Christmas napkin a reindeer made from candy canes and an assortment of Hershey Kisses. More holiday candies were strewn down the center of each table.

Whiteside presented center director Melissa Provence and assistant director Cheryl Waeltz with cash gifts just before lunch. Money was collected from center patrons to show appreciation for the welcoming atmosphere and all the services the ladies offer to guests.

Christmas lunch was served at 11:30 with the menu including glazed ham with pineapple sweet potato casserole broccoli and cheese casserole a roll and pecan cobbler.

In the afternoon several met again and made a road trip to eat at the Hiwasse Diner and view the Bentonville Heart Lites display.

Happy Holidays! We are celebrating a very dear tumultuous season - awards season - and the current wave of critics prizes has left us with some very exciting developments. It’s perhaps not the biggest shock that Jane Campion’s austere sensual Western The Power of the Dog has become such a critical darling. It’s the first time in nearly two decades that one of Campion’s phone is in serious consideration but the film’s remarkable showing with awards bodies and the sheer number of Best Director wins she’s accrued are both tremendously deserved and given the overall trajectory of her career something of a surprise.

Releasing her first film since 2009’s Bright Star (and after showrunning the acclaimed series Top of the Lake for two seasons) Campion’s favor with the Academy and critics at large has shifted wildly over the years. As rapturously as The Piano was received her 1996 bold purposefully hard-edged adaptation of Henry James’s The Portrait of a Lady scuttered a lot of that goodwill and as abrasive as that film is I can’t for the life of me understand why this torpedoed her prestige reputation so badly...

I’m happy for the folks saying The Power of the Dog is a new peak for Campion but anyone saying it’s a return to form hasn’t been paying attention. Maybe I’m waving my pom-poms in a small dedicated corner but I’m happy to wave ‘em here and now.

Before The Portrait of a Lady even begins in earnest Campion disarms us in the opening credits. Multiple New Zealand women discuss their favorite things about kissing in voiceover while the production credits are listed. When the opening credits begin in proper they become a montage of young women posing for the camera and dancing in a glade while the pan flutes of Wojciech Kilar’s score serenade them. It’s an unusual decision an ode to the Isabel Archers of today as well as a fairly enticing dry run for many of the film’s aesthetic strategies. Stuart Dryburgh’s camera will remain fleet and mobile and gloriously attentive to the faces and bodies of the actors inside his impressive compositions while Veronika Jenet’s editing keeps a tight hold on emotion and atmosphere disrupting the camera’s ostentatious visual rhythms as often as she maintains them.

Without warning the montage gives way to the actual film shifting from a pan of the title written on a girl’s hand to a close-up of our intrepid heroine Isabel Archer (Nicole Kidman) as insects and birds drone around her zooming in on her tear-stained face as her eyes dart in every direction sometimes even spiking the camera. Her privacy is soon shattered in two ways. Cinematically by the cut of the edit moving into a medium shot that reveals she’s sitting on the branch of a tree that’s very close to the ground while the rest of the tree shields her from the sun. Physically by the approach of a man who we will learn is an artistocrat named Lord Warburton (Richard E. Grant). He seems a bit shell-shocked when he finally talks to her reassuring her that if she doesn’t want to live at a particular house he owns she wouldn’t have to even if it is perfectly safe. He jokes that some people don’t like moats and Isabel desperate for any note of validation or kindness to give the man says she likes a good moat which becomes the signal he needs to reaffirm that he has been touched for life by her and will remain favorable to her should she change her mind. This in turn becomes her signal to leave departing from what turns out to be a very sizable garden hosting a small intimate gathering and storming into a mansion without talking to anyone. Well she talks to the dog and hoists him up in a fantastic canted shot before she fully retreats.

James’s novel contextualized this encounter with sixteen prior chapters of introduction characterization and buildup all of which is completely expunged from Laura Jones’s screenplay. Still at what point in Isabel’s conversation did you intuit that the soft-spoken man she was talking to was a suitor she had rejected moments earlier? Were you keyed into this through performance? Lensing? Direction? Dialogue? Silence? All and none of the above? Throughout The Portrait of a Lady Campion drops us in the beginnings middles and ends of complex interpersonal relationships and asks us to catch up to the histories of the people on screen while attuning to scene-specific emotional beats and the thick air of storied not entirely knowable lives that clings to every character. It takes no time to become familiar with the color temperament and ambition of these figures yet the mysteries they hold remain as proudly hidden as they want.

Speaking of mysteries I should take a moment to establish the key relationships that the early sections of The Portrait of a Lady are built upon. Isabel Archer is a young American woman who’s been living with her American aunt Mrs. Touchett (Shelley Winters) and English uncle Mr. Touchett (John Gielgud) for several months now. Isabel’s time spent living and traveling in Europe has given her a level of freedom she’s always desired allowing her to cultivate eccentricities and ideas she’s eager to test against the world while still presenting herself as an independent traveler rather than a potential bride for the men she meets. This desire for freedom is the primary reason she turned down Lord Warburton’s proposal as well as an earlier proposal from an American heir named Caspar Goodwood (Viggo Mortenson) though her friend Henrietta (Mary Louise Parker) fears Isabel’s headstrong desires will soon lead her into an unhappy marriage. The Touchett’s son Ralph (Martin Donovan) is a frequent companion of Isabel’s though his consumption prevents him from traveling Europe as fully and regularly as she does. Ralph also harbors a deep love for his cousin that he’s elected to keep to himself knowing her attitude about marriage.

Isabel’s life takes two sudden and near-simultaneous turns about 20 minutes into the film. Mr. Touchett has become gravely ill and is expected to die soon. Ralph persuades his father to allocate part of his inheritance to Isabel so that she can have enough financial freedom to be truly independent the rest of her life - provided she never know Ralph orchestrated this of course. News of Mr. Touchett’s illness also summons an old friend to visit and comfort him American expatriate Madame Serena Merle (Barbara Hershey) who takes an immediate and mutual fascination with Isabel after she walks in on this unexpected guest playing Schubert on the Touchett’s grand piano. The sudden inheritance of a great fortune and her newfound kinship with Madame Merle ultimately places Isabel in the attention of another wealthy American widower Gilbert Osmond (John Malkovich) an unpleasant often nasty recluse who spends all his time curating an art collection and preparing his daughter Pansy (Valentina Cervi) for marrying the kind of rich man he wants her to marry.

Even this is only enough setup for the first hour before we get two time jumps a handful of new characters and some old ones with new designs on Isabel and the world she inhabits. For all its glades of women and excision of the novel’s first quarter The Portrait of a Lady is a fairly straightforward adaptation of James’s narrative on a structural level even as it imposed new ideas on the material. I don’t say this to make a dichotomy between the fidelity of Laura Jones’s script and Campion’s direction smearing her iconoclastic fingerprints all over the novel. Adapting James for the screen has proven a difficult enough proposition that Jones’s success at translating the novel for the screen is a genuinely remarkable feat. The script ensures all of James’s structural gambits lush emotions opaque mysteries and period-specific idioms play on film while leaving ample room for a talented visually inventive director to fill in all the interiority atmosphere and unspoken motivations of Portrait’s characters and their environment.

There’s certainly nothing in the novel to justify the feverish hallucinatory black-and-white short film in the middle of the movie that depicts Isabel’s falling in love with Osmond as she travels an exotic desert locale. Nor is there anything to prepare for the number of canted shots Dryburgh uses though they like his languid camera movements and attention to every flicker of the actor’s faces communicate a lot about Campion’s characters and deepen our responses to them intellectually and emotionally. The audiovisual richness endowed by every artist involved gives The Portrait of a Lady lucid perverse textures while preserving its most trenchant mysteries and critiques with fine-honed ingenuity. One could easily view its overwhelming craft choices as something wild and untamed and maybe it is but Portrait’s choices equally florid and claustrophobic have a very clear origin point guiding them.

Enter Jane Campion who honors Henry James’s The Portrait of a Lady while filling her interpretation to the brim with her own thematic and artistic experiments. I can’t think of a film of hers that’s this sprawling this stuffed with characters and locales that all feel like central narrative engines whenever they appear. Campion is entirely disinterested in James’s juxtaposition of American values against the backdrop of European aristocracy. Meanwhile her feminist sensibilities and ideas on autonomy and responsibility are different from James’s in key ways as much a reflection of “modern” theory as her own fascinations. Isabel’s initial attraction to Osmond feels like a masochistic impulse rather than a duped innocent. For all Isabel miscalculates how dangerous Osmond is Campion and Kidman repeatedly convey a protagonist who would rather be pushed against even punished than given the room to spread her wings the way she says she craves. As sympathetic as her plight undoubtedly is Campion neither makes Isabel a pitiful object of abused Victorian morality or an anachronistic femininity worthy of a modern viewer’s scorn. Instead The Portrait of a Lady is a prickly insightful character study of a woman torn between thriving within a patriarchal system and letting it crush her.

It helps that the cast rises tremendously to the occasion. Kidman achieves a layered paradoxical blend of intrepid unlikely fortitude and tear-stained despair nearly a decade before Birth gave us that opera scene. She stands by Isabel’s impulsiveness and intellectual curiosity while carving out unique vibrant relationships to her scene partners. Barbara Hershey’s Madame Merle may be an even more fascinating creation and yet another example of Campion’s naked fascination with fierce complicated and self-destructive women. Blessed with the film’s most memorable introduction and tragic exit her pauses are as voluptuous with history and purpose as any of her dialogue or expressions. Merle is both the woman Isabel aspires to be and the walking tomb that her most masochistic impulses will lead her towards and Hershey negotiates this with an emotional legibility and presence of self that’s just astounding to witness. Martin Donovan’s observant lovesick Ralph is just as magisterial a characterization as either of these women and Campion’s marvelous scope makes even the most tertiary actor register as concentrated three-dimensional interpretations.

Best of all I think is that The Portrait of a Lady’s many hard charismatic stifling edges all speak to Campion’s talents as a conductor and a collaborator. Everyone here is clearly working within her designs but also smudging their own fingerprints alongside hers. This is as much Nicole Kidman’s Portrait as it is Campion’s as much Dryburgh and Patterson’s and Hershey’s and Kilar’s. I love that this story of one intrepid woman’s fatal miscalculation is also the story of a whole team of artists marshaling such a bold singular modern-yet-period vision of one of the most famous pieces of 19th century literature. We don’t get that every day even in projects specifically designed to reinvent classics or test their audience’s ideas about what they’re watching. The Power of the Dog will never be my favorite Campion film and if it brings her her long-deserved Best Director Oscar I’ll never say a word against it. But nomination #2 shouldn’t have been a long time coming and to revisit any of her works is to know for a fact how long and how creatively she’s been challenging what cinema can do.

The diminutive animal named Hannah has been commissioned by Okayama Prefectural Police to search for missing persons and investigate crimes and will begin her two-year stint as a ""sniffing investigator"" in January 2022. She is Okayama Prefecture's first toy poodle police dog.

The 6-year-old Hannah is about 24-centimeters tall and weighs around 2.5 kilograms. Her shiny amber fur and round eyes make her an adorable addition to the force.

Hannah and her owner Masae Inoue are seen together at the Okayama Prefectural Police's forensic science center in Kita Ward Okayama on Dec. 1 2021. (Mainichi/Kazuki Iwamoto)

Hannah was trained by Masae Inoue a 45-year-old resident of the prefectural town of Misaki. Inoue had also been training Hershey a male Labrador retriever as a police dog since 2018. And Hannah grew up watching Hershey. The Labrador was a quick learner and he passed the police test after constant training. Since then several times a week Hershey has been working on improving his skills by sniffing and tracking footprints in a nearby park.

About two years ago during a break in Hershey's practice Inoue tried the same training with Hannah just for fun and the toy poodle was able to do every task. Hannah is said to learn quickly and Inoue commented that the toy poodle ""watched Hershey's movements and learned them on her own.""

At a November 2021 screening session Hannah passed on the first attempt. Inoue said that she lacked confidence going into the trial but ""Hannah wasn't nervous and we were able to perform as usual."" Unlike Hershey who passed the test after training with a professional Hannah passed after training only with Inoue. ""She has a lot of pride so I guess she thinks she deserves it"" Inoue said with a laugh.

Regarding Hannah's new role in 2022 Inoue worries ""She is a sensitive dog so she may get overwhelmed by all the different places and situations."" On the other hand Inoue also has high hopes that Hannah's high sensitivity will allow her to sniff out smells carefully.

Hannah looks up at her owner Masae Inoue at the Okayama Prefectural Police's forensic science center in Kita Ward Okayama on Dec. 1 2021. (Mainichi/Kazuki Iwamoto)

""There are things she can do because she is small. I hope she will be able to search narrow places and out-of-sight areas"" Inoue said.

Tamotsu Omori deputy chief of the prefectural police's forensics division also expressed hope that Hannah's adorable appearance will allow her to work in places where large dogs cannot.

At the commissioning ceremony held at Okayama Prefectural Police headquarters in Kita Ward Okayama police chief Shigetomi Higaki handed over the letters of appointment to some 25 instructors whose dogs passed the November screening including Inoue.

Thirty-four dogs were commissioned that day most of them large dogs such as German shepherds and Labrador retrievers. According to the forensics division most police dogs used to be German shepherds which are also used as military dogs. At this year's screening dogs that are popular as pets including Belgian Malinois and Jack Russell terriers also passed the test.

""The widening variety of dog breeds being kept as pets may be one of the reasons why there is a greater range of breeds being commissioned as police dogs"" a division representative said.

According to the company HP will use the new facility to house around 1800 employees. “The office space was coming up Prestige Metropolitan and signed at Rs 75 per sqft. The lease is for 15 years” an HP official told TO on condition of anonymity.

Prestige Metropolitan is a 5 lakh sq ft Grade A Premium office development located on Chennai's main arterial road mount road. “The new office for HP will see it moving away from multiple locations in Chennai and consolidating in Prestige Metropolitan. The office is under fit-outs and will be operational between March and June next year” the HP official said.

The company at present is undergoing major restructuring which includes streamlining headcounts globally. The technology firm currently employs 55000 employees globally and expects restructuring plans to save $1 billion by 2022.

Following the Covid-19 outbreak last year top Indian cities have seen a significant rise in large office space transactions. Bengaluru the IT capital of the country recorded the highest number of office deals in 2021.

Some of the large deals closed recently in Bangalore alone include Cisco 2700000 sqft Prestige Cessna and Byju's renting 293000 sq ft in PrestigeTech Park. This was followed by Collins Aerospace leasing 275000 sq ft in Northgate SEZ in the city.

NVIDIA’s recent testing revealed that two BlueField-2 data processing units achieved 41.5 million input/output operations per second (IOPS) – more than four times the IOPS of any other DPU.

Using conventional networking protocols and open-source software the BlueField-2 DPU achieved record-breaking performance. It obtained greater than 5 million 4KB IOPS and more than 20 million 512B IOPS for NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) a standard means of accessing storage media using TCP networking one of the fundamental internet protocols.

It enables even better storage performance leveraging the popular RoCE network transport option to boost AI big data and high-performance computing applications.

BlueField outperformed both as an initiator and a target in testing simulating real-world storage setups with different storage software libraries and workloads. InfiniBand the recommended networking architecture for many HPC and AI applications is also supported by BlueField.

Methodology of Testing

BlueField’s 41.5 million IOPS is more than four times the previous world record of 10 million IOPS obtained utilizing proprietary storage options. This performance was obtained by connecting two fast Hewlett Packard Enterprise Proliant DL380 Gen 10 Plus servers one serving as the application server (storage initiator) and the other as the storage system (storage target).

Each server was outfitted with two Intel “Ice Lake” Xeon Platinum 8380 CPUs running at 2.3GHz resulting in 160 hyperthreaded cores per server and 512GB of DRAM 120MB of L3 cache (60MB per socket) and a PCIe Gen4 interface.

To accelerate networking and NVMe-oF each server was outfitted with two NVIDIA BlueField-2 P-series DPU cards each with two 100Gb Ethernet network ports for a total of four network ports and 400Gb/s wire bandwidth between initiator and target which were linked together using NVIDIA LinkX 100GbE Direct-Attach Copper (DAC) passive cables. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) was installed on both systems.

Both SPDK and the regular upstream Linux kernel target were evaluated for storage system software using the default kernel 4.18 and one of the most recent kernels 5.15. Three storage initiators were tested: SPDK the regular kernel storage initiator and the SPDK FIO plugin. FIO and SPDK were used for workload creation and measurement. I/O sizes were tested using 4KB and 512B common medium and small storage I/O sizes respectively.

The NVMe-oF storage protocol was tested at the network transport layer with both TCP and RoCE. Each setup was evaluated with total bidirectional network usage with 100% read 100% write and 50/50 read/write workloads.

The study also found the following BlueField DPU performance characteristics:

Testing with smaller 512B I/O sizes yielded better IOPS but lower-than-line-rate throughput whereas testing with 4KB I/O sizes yielded higher throughput but lower IOPS statistics.

100% read and 100% write workloads yielded comparable IOPS and throughput. However 50/50 mixed read/write workloads delivered more extraordinary performance by simultaneously leveraging both directions of the network connection.

Using SPDK resulted in faster performance than kernel-space software but at the expense of increased server CPU use which is expected given that SPDK operates in user space with continual polling.

Because of frequent storage enhancements introduced by the Linux community the current Linux 5.15 kernel performed better than the 4.18 kernel.

DPU Storage Performance that Sets Records Enables Storage Performance with Security

In addition to quick storage access BlueField enables hardware-accelerated encryption and decryption of both Ethernet storage traffic and storage media preventing data theft or exfiltration. It offloads IPsec at up to 100Gb/s (data on the wire) and 256-bit AES-XTS at up to 200Gb/s (data at rest) lowering the risk of data theft if an adversary has tapped the storage network or if physical storage devices are stolen sold or disposed of incorrectly.

Customers and leading security software vendors are leveraging BlueField’s recently updated NVIDIA DOCA framework to run cybersecurity applications – such as a distributed firewall or security groups with micro-segmentation – on the DPU to improve application and network security for compute servers lowering the risk of unauthorized access or data modifications on storage attached to those servers.

San Diego Convention Center Area Transportation

A car isn’t necessary for this part of town. Going without will help save on the steep parking prices hotels in all price ranges charge.

As mentioned above San Diego Airport is reachable by surface streets in a matter of minutes or a three-mile walk (most people drive).

Several hotels in the area offer shuttles to and from the airport. In addition taxis and ride-shares can take you anywhere in the downtown San Diego area and beyond that you need to go.

A more convenient method of transportation is the MTS Trolley which has two stops in front of the San Diego Convention Center and stops in Little Italy Fashion Valley Old Town San Diego and now heads as far as UTC near La Jolla.

Nearby dockless scooter and bike rentals offer a fun way to explore San Diego and there are plenty of designated parking spaces for your rental car.

Vacation Rentals Near San Diego Convention Center If you’ve decided that a vacation rental near San Diego Convention Center is more appropriate for your situation I prefer Marriott Homes and Villas because they vet the properties and only use those with professional management. However VRBO has the most availability. BROWSE VACATION RENTALS

Where to go to safely check card balances,"Did Santa bring you a gift card this Christmas?

Year after year gift cards have been one of the most popular holiday gifts and 2021 was not an exception.

According to the National Retail Federation's annual holiday survey gift cards were the second most popular gift of the holiday season with 46% of shoppers planning to buy an average of three or four cards this year. Holiday spending on gift cards was expected to total $28.1 billion the highest since $29.9 billion in 2018.

And with supply chain challenges shipping delays and shortages more cards were expected to be placed in stockings than in past years.

►Gift card deals:The best gift cards on sale that make perfect last-minute gifts: Adidas Amazon Disney+ and more

But when consumers will redeem the plastic cards or digital codes is another matter. According to a Bankrate.com poll from July 51% of U.S. adults have more than $15.3 billion in unused gift cards vouchers and store credit. This adds up to an average of $116 per person in gift cards.

Use your Christmas gift cards ASAP

The rule of thumb with a gift card? Use it before you lose it.

The Federal Trade Commission recommends using the card as soon as you can. It also advises treating gift cards like cash and using them early to get full value.

Another good reason to use the cards sooner rather than later: the risk that the retailer or restaurant goes out of business.

While gift cards are often accepted after businesses file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in many cases they quickly become worthless. Sometimes there's little or no warning before a business closes.

“I generally tell people if they have gift cards in their wallet use them yesterday"" Melissa Jacoby a bankruptcy law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill previously told USA TODAY.

The Bankrate poll found 29% of adults have let at least one gift card expire 27% have lost at least one and 21% lost out because a business closed permanently before they used at least one card.

Check gift card balances (carefully)

It's important to go to the actual retailer or card website and to confirm you are at the right place before entering any information. If you're not careful you can wind up at a website that appears to be legitimate but could steal your gift card balance making it worthless.

USA TODAY has rounded up the sites to check the most popular store restaurant and credit card gift cards. This list is current as of Dec. 24. Another way to check balances is with store apps and some retailers like Target allow you to add gift cards to app wallets.

Tips for using gift cards

If you received a gift card here are some tips to get the most out of them:

The fine print: Read the card's terms and conditions. Pay close attention to whether the card is redeemable only at a certain store or location.

Fees: Some state laws bar service fees and expiration dates on store gift cards but the rules on cards branded with the name of a credit card company are stricter. These cards cannot expire for at least five years and cannot have a service fee deducted unless it has not been used in 12 months.

Bonus cards: It's holiday gift card promotion season a time when select restaurants and stores give bonuses with gift card purchases. If you receive a bonus gift card sometimes called bonus bucks most of these will expire. Check terms.

Protect your card: Some gift cards can be registered as credit cards on websites listed on the card which can protect them against theft or loss. Also take photos of the front and back of the card or write down card details as some companies will replace lost or stolen cards if you can provide specifics. Save receipts with card information too.

(Olivia Vanni / The Herald)

Local businesses urged deputies to act saying homelessness vandalism and drug use are rampant at Airport Way and Highway 99.

EVERETT — Sheriff Adam Fortney is boosting law enforcement’s presence on the southern outskirts of Everett city limits in response to frustrations from local business owners who say the area is plagued by crime homelessness and drug abuse.

The focal point of the effort is the intersection of Airport Road and Highway 99 where one side of the street is patrolled by Everett police and the other belongs to the sheriff’s office. Typically two deputies handle calls in the vicinity. Now several times a week dozens of law enforcement officers will be assigned to the area in a partnership with Everett police indefinitely according to the sheriff’s office.

Local businesses have complained about people breaking into cars damaging property defecating openly and injecting or smoking illegal drugs in broad daylight.

“We’ve had a lot of crime issues in that area and have dealt with some of the heavy drug use transients and it’s really taxed the area businesses” said Tyler Johnson a property manager of the Mariner Square business park on a recent episode of Fortney’s podcast.

Johnson and others who work and live nearby have praised Fortney’s decision to bolster law enforcement there.

“It was nice to hear that the cops were starting to step up their patrols” said Jimmy Loyd a manager for Bud Hut a marijuana dispensary at 11603 Highway 99. “Especially on this one stretch. Because we see a lot of it daily.”

According to a map hosted by LexisNexis about 300 crimes were reported within a mile of the intersection. Most often the crimes were car prowls thefts thefts of a motor vehicle and vandalism.

Others question whether underlying issues can be addressed by cracking down on people who in many cases are struggling with addiction and homelessness. Some advocates say such patrol efforts can saddle destitute people with low-level charges — and make it even harder for them to get off the streets.

“Persecuting the unsheltered and the homeless is not a great big thing to be proud of. It’s inhumane” said Leslie Brown a former police captain who helps provide food and basic necessities to folks experiencing homelessness in the county. “Until this sheriff and this community starts to understand that this is a public health crisis and not criminality then things will continue as they are.”

But Fortney has said the patrol emphasis strategy which he calls Operation Clean Streets provides “accountability with compassion.” For years before he was elected he was a night shift patrol sergeant at the agency’s South Precinct which includes the intersection in question.

“Sometimes when law enforcement talks about proactive policing or stepping up patrols and things like that we get tagged with ‘You just want to lock everybody up.’ That’s not what we want to do” the sheriff said on the Dec. 7 episode of his podcast. “If we can fix human beings in the process that’s a better solution than locking people up. But we’re not going to shy away from the enforcement component.”

‘Clean Streets’

The sheriff’s office began heightened patrols earlier this year at Airport and Highway 99 but scaled back the approach in late summer due to staffing shortages according to a recent news release.

In the initial six-month period the agency reported calls for service fell by 30% for a set of crimes the sheriff’s office focused on within the emphasis area.

When authorities kicked off Operation Clean Streets on Dec. 8 more than a dozen people were arrested including theft suspects and alleged drug dealers according to the sheriff’s office.

Deputies seized more than $1600 believed to be related to drug deals and recovered a stolen vehicle two stolen guns 215 grams of meth 30 grams of heroin 133 fentanyl pills and 10 grams of MDMA the news release stated. Nearly 30 vehicles previously tagged for removal were impounded.

A missing 16-year-old was also found.

Seven people were referred to the sheriff’s Office of Neighborhoods which includes social workers. All declined services said spokesperson Courtney O’Keefe.

That night a trailer housing the county’s incident command and communication center was positioned in a Home Depot parking lot where officials worked with regional crime task forces social workers and the Everett Police Department. A heat-sensing drone was deployed to monitor deputies’ safety as they patrolled O’Keefe said.

Snohomish County’s LEAD program is also in the mix. The diversion strategy allows law enforcement to refer someone who would otherwise be arrested to a caseworker who can connect that person with resources. The majority of the participants are homeless.

LEAD’s goal is to “avoid arresting people” Snohomish County Prosecutor Adam Cornell told The Daily Herald earlier this month. “It provides them services to address their behavioral or mental health issues.”

‘Fighting back’

Meanwhile tension has grown between law enforcement local residents and a loosely organized volunteer group that distributes food clothes and other goods.

Andrew SanAgustin secretary of Alderbrook Village West’s homeowner association said he calls the police on abandoned cars and people using drugs several times a month. He has called on the volunteer “mutual aid group” too.

“We’re calling the police because we want to get on their radar” SanAgustin said. “The police are our allies as far as I’m concerned.”

Recent block watch alert emails from the HOA have called mutual aid volunteers “enabling” and said the neighborhood is “fighting back.” One told residents to “protect yourselves your property neighbors and especially our children by necessary and legal means” linking to information on state gun laws.

The patrol emphasis SanAgustin said has had a “delightful” effect.

Luisana “Lu” Hernandez who helps give out food and essentials at mutual aid events accused business owners and law enforcement of “prioritizing property and criminalizing poverty.” Businesses have been calling police not only on people who are homeless but also activists who are trying to help said Hernandez a member of a county advisory group that examines law and justice issues.

“Anyone paying attention understands that feeding people is crime prevention” Hernandez wrote in a statement.

A week after the first patrol emphasis mutual aid volunteers gathered again in the strip of grass between the Home Depot parking lot and the pavement of Highway 99 handing out slices of pizza from 18-inch Costco pies.

Nichole Ahrnkiel 42 came for the free lunch. She used to live on the surrounding streets. Now she’s staying nearby with her mother.

“This is what I know. This is where my friends are” she said. “We’re people. We have to take up space somewhere.”

She understands concerns of local businesses she said but the people who loiter there aren’t major criminals.

“They’re petty thieves and small-time drug dealers” she said.

She recalled being arrested on an outstanding warrant and coming back to find her tent dismantled and her possessions gone.

“You lose everything” she said. “You come back with nowhere to be. You just got to start over again.”

‘Somebody has to do something’

After the day’s patrol emphasis ended Dec. 8 normal staff patrol deputies were called to Bud Hut for a robbery around 11 p.m.

A man walked into the store and demanded cash from the till said Loyd the store’s manager. The robber said he had a gun and threatened to shoot the on-duty employee if he didn’t hand over the money.

The culprit got away with about $900 cash and $1500 worth of product Loyd said.

“It’s scary to be a business on that strip right now” said Beth Thomas operations manager for Bud Hut’s five stores.

Like other business owners near city limits she’s hopeful police will get troublemakers off the highway whether to a jail or to an addiction treatment center.

“I just don’t know where these people are going to go” Thomas said. “It’s definitely going to be a fight but somebody has to do something about it.”

Other arrest reports detailed a series of petty crimes Dec. 8.

One homeless man 34 was arrested for investigation of misdemeanor assault following a fight outside of Fast Eddies Valero gas station according to one arrest report. One person suffered minor injuries in the scuffle the report says.

At the same gas station two more men were arrested in an alleged drug deal according to two more arrest reports. One of them admitted to a deputy that he traded a bottle of tequila and $9 for three fentanyl pills the records say.

At the Wendy’s restaurant next door a sheriff’s sergeant arrested a 50-year-old man on a drug-related warrant out of Texas. The sergeant reported the man was carrying a sleeping bag and a black duffle bag with wet clothes food and 20 hypodermic needles inside.

‘Catch and release’

Robert Smiley who runs The Hand Up Project and does regular outreach in the neighborhood estimated that 70 to 80 homeless people live near the Home Depot.

Many of them he said will be caught in a “catch and release” cycle.

And for those ready to ask for help there are challenges too. Synthetic drugs on the street require longer detox times than what’s available through most programs Smiley said.

“The pills stick with them longer and nobody’s set up for it” he said.

The focal point of the emphasis patrol is inside the southeastern boundary of the county’s most racially and ethnically diverse zip code 98204.

Tien Lam 45 is among those living in tents in the woods near the intersection of Airport and 99.

“We have friends” Lam told a reporter motioning to others gathered around him in the Wendy’s parking lot on a recent Wednesday afternoon. “We have food.”

He took a bite of a Bánh mì sandwich from a Vietnamese restaurant in a strip mall down the street. Lam said the cops know him by name. He has been homeless in and out of jail for a decade he said.

Court records show most of his past felony and misdemeanor convictions are related to drugs. A deputy who arrested Lam in April 2020 reported that he was well known to law enforcement south of Everett.

At the time he was charged with possession of a controlled substance with intent to manufacture or deliver but was acquitted by a jury in May 2021 records show.

Lam said he’s tried to get off the streets. He has called 2-1-1 a hotline that connects people with food shelter and other basic necessities. But Snohomish County is grappling with a shortage of emergency and low-income housing units.

And Lam hasn’t been able to shake his addiction.

The drugs make him feel warm he said.

“It’s cold out here.”

She is hopeful the marketplace won’t close and that the remaining tenants will survive.

An Oahu retail complex developed as an Asian shopping mall nearly 25 years ago in Mapunapuna is slated to become a Home Depot store.

The owner of what was once known as Moanalua Ethnic Village originally anchored by Asian grocery store 99 Ranch Market is working to convey its leasehold stake in the complex to the giant home improvement retailer in a move to end a financial struggle brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.

Honolulu Warehouse Co. which owns the marketplace buildings intends to sell its property to Home Depot which would convert the main building at 1151 Mapu­napuna St. into a 124310-­ square-foot store connected to a 10000-square-foot garden center according to the plan.

An adjacent two-story office building is also part of the tentative deal.

If the sale is realized more than 30 tenants would be displaced and a site that initially gathered retailers of Asian products in an industrial neighborhood drawing good consumer foot traffic would be turned into a fourth Oahu store for Home Depot.

The late Hiroshi Koba­yashi who led Honolulu Warehouse redeveloped a warehouse built in 1968 into Moanalua Ethnic Village in 1998 and operated the anchor tenant until closing 99 Ranch Market in 2007.

Now the complex which once had a U.S. Post Office and a bank along with what was billed as Hawaii’s largest Asian market is largely a collection of food-court restaurant tenants mixed with a handful of kiosk businesses a couple full-service restaurants and several serv­ice providers including a paintball supply store dry cleaner nail salon and gymnastics center.

More than a dozen vacant tenant spaces also exist in the center that used to be more popular with consumers.

Stacey Lau manager of 99 Local Mix Plate a roughly 20-year tenant in the complex said Honolulu Warehouse informed tenants several months ago that a shutdown might happen as part of a pending property sale that was not imminent at the time.

“We don’t know what’s going on” she said Wednesday adding that it would be difficult to relocate the eatery under present conditions with harshly reduced sales amid the pandemic.

“It’s been slow” Lau said. “It’s been less than half the sales that we usually make.”

Beth Madlangbayan owner of Kusina Korner Filipino Food said survival has been extremely challenging given that customer revenue has plummeted as costs for food maintenance and other expenses have risen.

“The last two years has been really horrible” she said. Still Madlangbayan is hopeful the marketplace won’t close and that the remaining tenants will survive.

Honolulu Warehouse representatives did not respond to Honolulu Star-Advertiser requests for comment about the conversion plan.

The company informed the state Department of Transportation of its plan a few months ago because the agency owns a portion of the marketplace parking lot below an H-1 Freeway on-ramp. Massachusetts-based RMR Group owns the bigger balance of land under the marketplace.

Earlier this month the state Board of Land and Natural Resources approved a request from Honolulu Warehouse to assign the state land lease to Home Depot.

Norman Cheng an attorney with local law firm Starn O’Toole Marcus &Fisher representing Honolulu Warehouse said during a recent BLNR meeting that the marketplace now known as Moanalua 99 used to be a big draw when the grocery store was open but that the owner is now in dire straits because of closures and tenant rent delinquencies after COVID-19 emerged last year.

“Really to be frank my client is on the verge of bankruptcy” Cheng said.

Hiroshi Kobayashi died a year ago and his wife Yumiko heads the company.

In a July letter to DOT Cheng said Honolulu Warehouse’s expected financial loss each month was $150000 and that the deal with Home Depot represents a lifeline.

Home Depot spokeswoman Margaret Smith said the Atlanta-based retailer can’t say whether it will establish a new store on Oahu where the company has outlets in Iwilei Pearl City and Kapolei.

“It’s still very early days so I can’t confirm if we’re bringing a new store yet or not” she said in an email.

Abelaamo Sulu a longtime marketplace customer who used to be fond of big lobsters from 99 Ranch Market’s seafood department that today is partially occupied by a Mediterranean food purveyor said he will miss what remains of the marketplace if the Home Depot deal goes through.

“This is a good place” he said. “Good food.”"

Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Pie de foto Este producto se popularizó tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial cuando los países intentaban reconstruirse y escaseaba la comida.

Con más de ocho décadas en el mercado la marca de carne enlatada Spam registró ventas récord en el 2021 por séptimo año consecutivo.

El buen desempeño de la empresa fue destacado por Jim Snee presidente de Hormel Foods compañía estadounidense propietaria de la marca en una conferencia de prensa para inversionistas tras la publicación de los resultados del grupo una vez finalizado el periodo de octubre.

El producto lanzado en 1937 se hizo muy popular entre sus clientes por ser relativamente barato y tener una larga vida. Durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial fue distribuido por toneladas y se usó para alimentar tanto a las tropas estadounidenses como a los civiles europeos de las naciones aliadas.

Spam también fue altamente consumido los años posteriores al conflicto cuando muchos países intentaban reconstruirse y los alimentos escaseaban.

Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Pie de foto Las recetas con Spam alrededor del mundo son variadas. En la foto arroz con piña y Spam.

Con el paso del tiempo este producto se convirtió en sinónimo de un ingrediente barato en Occidente pero se vio como un ¨manjar¨ en la región de Asia-Pacífico lo que explica en parte el éxito de la marca en los últimos años.

El Spam fue llevado a Corea del Sur por el ejército estadounidense durante la Guerra de Corea en la década de 1950 como un intento de abordar la falta de alimentos durante el conflicto. Sin embargo el producto fue tan absorbido por la cultura surcoreana que se convirtió en uno de los platos favoritos del país: el ""budae jjigae"" o ""estofado militar"".

Durante el Año Nuevo Lunar se vende en emporios y supermercados como un artículo de lujo en un empaque especial utilizado por los coreanos como obsequio.

Esta comida enlatada también tiene un gran mercado en el estado de Hawái donde se encuentra en el menú de varios restaurantes del archipiélago. Allí se consume en el desayuno con huevos y arroz. También en otros platos de arroz frito o como una especie de sushi el ""Spam musubi"".

De la lata a los correos electrónicos

Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Pie de foto El producto es considerado un ¨manjar¨ en algunos países asiáticos.

La popularidad que ganó después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial la convertiría años más tarde en sinónimo de la bandeja de correos electrónicos no deseados.

La razón según el etimólogo Graeme Donald la relación se remonta a un sketch del grupo de humor británico Monty Python de la década de 1970 en el que una pareja va a un restaurante donde cada elemento del menú tiene como ingrediente el Spam. Aunque la mujer deja claro que no le gusta la comida enlatada el asistente repite con voz chillona: ""Spam Spam Spam Spam ..."" mantra repetido a coro por un grupo de vikingos que también están en escena.

El uso de la palabra como sinónimo de mensaje molesto y no deseado comenzó como una broma entre los usuarios de Internet pero rápidamente se volvió universal como informó la estación de radio estadounidense NPR en una entrevista con Finn Brunton autor de Spam: A Shadow History of the Internet ( ""Spam: una historia secreta de internet¨).

El reciente éxito de la marca ahora presente en más de 80 países motivó a Hormel Foods a estudiar una expansión de su catálogo de productos de la familia Spam que debería llegar a los estantes en 2023 dijo Snee en la conferencia de inversores.",,,,,,,,,,,,

However executives are encouraged by the demand outlook for the remainder of the year.

During first-quarter 2024 earnings conference calls hotel industry executives said middle-income travelers are more employed today and earn wages that are higher than pre-pandemic levels. At the same time affluent travelers aren't slowing down either.

Pre-pandemic the leisure segment for some companies was their most rate-sensitive segment but many notice today that guests who are traveling for leisure are less concerned about the price.

""I think the entire industry has benefited from that segment being less price-sensitive. It has always been our thought that over time we would revert towards more normal behavior with a greater ability to drive rate with our corporate customers as we achieved stronger occupancies midweek and the ability to drive rate with leisure customers around compression nights in markets where demand was strong"" said Justin Knight CEO Apple Hospitality REIT. ""We are assessing what we're seeing right now.""

For many companies leisure travel has been resilient year to date through April and an ongoing strength in group business is shown through stronger booking pace in key markets such as Nashville New Orleans and San Antonio.

For more commentary on first-quarter performance and demand outlook across various publicly traded hotel companies and real estate investment trusts read below.

Bryan Giglia CEO Sunstone Hotel Investors

""As we look ahead into 2024 we are encouraged about the outlook for the year which benefits from our recent investments and begins to pave the way for the next layer of growth in the portfolio. Comparable portfolio group room revenue pace for the rest of the year is up approximately 9% with broad-based strength across Boston D.C. Orlando Long Beach and Wailea. Transient booking patterns remain short term but the recent week-over-week pickup from May and June is exceeding that of last year.

""While it remains early we are encouraged by what we are seeing in our group booking activity for 2025 with improving convention and citywide calendars in many of our markets. ... We were very pleased to close our acquisition in San Antonio last month.""

...

""While we cannot control when leisure demand will accelerate we can continue to work with the resorts to build a base of group business and control costs so that we can maximize profitability when it does.

""Our efforts are showing in stronger bookings at these resorts with group room nights pacing nearly 13% higher for the remaining quarters of 2024. We knew coming into the year that the first few months would have challenged top-line growth.""

Geoff Ballotti President and CEO Wyndham Hotels & Resorts

“What we're seeing is that middle-income guest is more employed. We look at their wages and their savings. They're higher than they were back in pre-COVID levels. Their home prices are up their stocks are up their deposit levels are stable and they're in good shape.

“We look at consumer confidence that's obviously growing. If you look at the monthly inside report I think consumer sentiment is up significantly from 65% to close to 80% from last March to this March. We look at length of stay and we are continuing to see longer lengths of stay by a couple hundred basis points versus where they were before things slowed.

“Booking windows we look at daily and they continue to tick up. We talked about our trends looking out to Memorial Day weekend and into May. But our booking windows are similarly up 7% to last year from 19 to 21 days now. Cancellation rates are steady and drive-to which is about 90% of our domestic demand continues to chug along. People are driving further than they were pre-COVID and we think it'll continue to be the No. 1 vacation preference this summer.”

Michele Allen Chief Financial Officer Wyndham Hotels & Resorts

“Cruise and inexpensive air travel to destinations like Mexico and the Caribbean opened back up while domestic leisure and drive-to hotels experienced demand declines especially along the coast.”

Chris Nassetta President and CEO Hilton

“As we look to the rest of the year we continue to expect systemwide RevPAR growth of 2% to 4% with the U.S. towards the low end of the range and continued strength in international markets. We expect positive RevPAR growth across all major segments led by group performance at or above the high end of the range business transient around the midpoint and leisure transient towards the lower end of the range. For the full year group position is up 13% versus last year.”

Jeff Donnelly CEO DiamondRock Hospitality Group

""Looking ahead we believe our resorts are positioned to deliver better results in the second half of 2024. The difficult comparisons in South Florida and the Keys have been lapped and we expect the remaining resort markets will follow suit by the end of the year. We recognize high interest rates and inflation are placing pressure on consumer spending but these same pressures should drive incremental preference for domestic travel over international travel and drive-to destinations over fly-to destinations.""

...

""We are most positive on the group outlook for 2024. We believe our strong volume of business on the books is a competitive advantage. At the end of the quarter we had 85% of our budgeted full-year group revenue on the books representing a 14% increase over the same point in 2023.

""Looking at the quarterly breakdown our group revenue was up 10% in [the first quarter] and pace is up approximately 5% in [the second quarter] and over 15% in the third and fourth quarters.

""Looking at just our big-box hotels our group pace for 2024 is up 16% or about 200 basis points better than our total portfolio. The most notable performers of our Renaissance Worthington up 32% the Hythe up over 25% Chicago-Marriott up 22% the Westin Fort Lauderdale up 19%; and Washington D.C. up 15%.

""Looking ahead to next year at the end of [the first quarter] our big-box room-night pace for 2025 is flat with 2024 with time to go.""

Jon Bortz Chairman and CEO Pebblebrook Hotel Trust

“We also continue to be encouraged by our current group in total pace. Our group pace for quarters two through four shows group room nights ahead of the same time last year by 8.5% and group revenue ahead by 10.2%. With transient revenue pace up by 3.9% our total room-night pace is ahead by 7.9% and our total revenue pace on the books is ahead by 7.1%. [The third quarter] continues to represent the quarter with the largest pace advantage followed by [the fourth quarter] on a percentage basis. Nevertheless given the slower in the month for the month and in the quarter for the quarter booking trends we've been experiencing we remain cautious about the second half due to this normalization of the group booking window as well as the softening macroeconomic environment.”

Tony Capuano President and CEO Marriott International

“Once again we saw RevPAR growth across all three of our customer segments group leisure transient and business transient. Group which comprised 24% of global room nights in the first quarter was again the strongest customer segment. Compared to the year-ago quarter group RevPAR rose 6% globally. Full-year 2024 worldwide group revenues were pacing up 9% year over year at the end of the first quarter with a 5% increase in room nights and a 4% rise in average daily rate. Leisure transient accounted for 42% of worldwide room nights in the quarter. Globally both leisure demand and ADR growth have remained remarkably resilient driving leisure RevPAR up 4% year over year. Business transient which contributed the remaining 34% of global room nights in the first quarter had a 1% increase in RevPAR.”

Sourav Ghosh Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Host Hotels & Resorts

""We are still outside the primary booking window for July Fourth but thus far we are encouraged by strong bookings in San Diego Houston and New York. Business-transient revenue per available room was 5% above the first quarter of 2023 driven by an increase in rate and room nights as business-transient demand continued its slow and steady recovery. Seattle Boston and San Francisco led room-night growth and both New York and Boston are within 2% of pre-pandemic demand.

""Turning to group. Revenue per available room was up 4% in the first quarter driven by room-night growth in San Diego San Francisco Orlando and Maui. Notably group room-night volume reached 96% of the first quarter of 2019 levels led by corporate and SMERF [social military education religious and fraternal] groups.

""For full-year 2024 we have 3.6 million definite group room nights on the books representing a 17% increase since the fourth quarter and putting us ahead of same time last year. Group rate on the books is up 4% and total group revenue pace is up 7% over the same time last year.

...

""We continue to be encouraged by the ongoing strength of group business as evidenced by strong pace [lingering] booking windows and double-digit citywide room night pace in key markets such as Nashville New Orleans San Antonio Seattle and Washington D.C.

...

""Turning to our revised outlook for 2024. The midpoint of our guidance continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth.

Our expectations for the year are driven by improvements in group business a gradual recovery in business transient softer short-term leisure transient demand and a continued evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. At the low end we have assumed slow group pickup and softer leisure transient demand. And at the high end we have assumed a faster recovery at our Maui resorts and increased group pickup.""

Jim Risoleo President and CEO Host Hotels & Resorts

""We're not seeing a real slowdown in the affluent customer. There has been a rotation that we talked about last year with respect to an international inbound versus international outbound imbalance. That is still occurring. I think over time that will right itself and correct itself.

""I think going back to Orlando for a moment the Four Seasons in the quarter we've had an ADR of over $2000. So people ... still want to go to Orlando they still want to stay at the Four Seasons. And what we have working against us a bit is a strong dollar. It's not weakening. It will likely weaken once rates start to come down and that's keeping the international traveler away from the United States right now. I mean there was a fairly significant uptick in the first quarter.

""As we all try to wrap our head around the soft leisure demand — we talked a lot about weather in three states: Arizona Florida and California and it was meaningful. I mean we lost group business at the [Phoenician] over the course of the Waste Management Open because of the rains.

""Now we dug into this a little more. And we tried to answer the question where do these people go? I mean the demand didn't just disappear. People just stay home. We found out that as an example the international outbound to the Caribbean in the first quarter was 135% of where it was in 2019 levels and RevPAR in the Caribbean was up 17%.

""So it's just a longer way of saying that our belief is that the consumer the affluent consumer is still healthy. They're still spending money. They're still prioritizing experiences over goods. And we're just not seeing the reset back.""

Justin Knight CEO Apple Hospitality REIT

""We've commented for some time that pre-pandemic leisure was our most rate-sensitive segment. And we've been incredibly pleased and I think the entire industry has benefited from that segment being less price-sensitive. It has always been our thought that over time we would revert towards more normal behavior with a greater ability to drive rate with our corporate customers as we achieved stronger occupancies midweek and ability to drive rate with leisure customers around compression nights in markets where demand was strong.

""We are assessing what we're seeing right now. And as I highlighted there is some variance from market to market. What we've seen overall is to the extent there has been a pullback in some markets on weekends from an occupancy standpoint. It's been largely offset or more than wholly offset by a pickup in midweek business. And that's a trend we feel very comfortable with. When we look at overall profitability of our business and how we historically split business between business travelers and leisure reversion to more normal behavior with stronger performance midweek would from an overall profitability standpoint be a favorable shift for us.""

Liz Perkins Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Apple Hospitality REIT

""Looking day-over-day leisure travel has been relatively resilient year to date through April. While weekend occupancies were down over 2% for the first quarter compared to the first quarter 2023 this was driven mostly by the declines in March related to the unfavorable calendar shift and we saw a rebound in April with weekend occupancies up over 5%. Weekday occupancies were flat for the first quarter with the negative drag from the Easter holiday. Business travel continued to improve steadily in April with weekday occupancies up over 2% led by improvement on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday nights.

""We have been pleased to see steady improvement in midweek occupancies an area where we continue to have meaningful upside relative to pre-pandemic levels. And weekend occupancies have remained relatively stable indicative of continued strength in leisure demand.

""Forward bookings remained strong and we are optimistic that increased occupancy in the second and third quarters will better position us to drive incremental rate growth.""

...

""We were pleased with April overall when we look at the day-of-week trends for the full month seeing growth in both weekday and weekend occupancies and RevPAR it was heavily weighted particularly from a growth rate perspective on the first two weeks of the month. But as we round it out towards the end and potentially had cleaner weeks to look at we saw continued strength in midweek demand. And one of the trends I think that we may see and may be experiencing is some normalization between a pickup in midweek potentially offsetting some leisure on the weekend. When we look year to date we're slightly positive driven by that midweek demand and some weak softening on the leisure side. But overall the midweek growth is resulting in a positive result.""

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

RESERVE – In 2019 DSC Dredge LLC a world leading manufacturer of cutter suction dredges located in St. John the Baptist Parish signed a memorandum of understanding with Deep Diggers Ltd Bangladesh with a project focus of providing an engineering design and component package.

Deep Diggers Ltd imported all the dredge components from DSC including the Caterpillar diesel engine dredge pump gearbox cutter assembly winches hydraulic system and lever room and controls. All steel fabrication including the hull side pontoons ladder and spuds were built by Deep Diggers at their facility in Chattogram Bangladesh. Deep Diggers installed all the DSC supplied components including the complete hydraulic and electrical systems. After a year building and countless manpower hours the two companies are proud to announce the successful launch of two 18” Shark Class dredges. DSC provided Product Support for 30 days onsite to help commission the two new dredges and provide crew training in operations and maintenance.

A video of the launch accompanying this announcement is available by clicking here.

Director of International Dredge Sales at DSC Dredge Charles Sinunu commented “Deep Diggers Chairman Gauhar Siraj Jamil and his directors had the wisdom and confidence that they could produce quality dredges with the support from DSC. I expected some challenges with the first build but everything went very smoothly. We have proved the concept to ourselves and to the local market. We look forward to a very long relationship with Deep Diggers.”

The 18” Shark Model SH-10300-200-56D has the advantage to dig to 17m (56 ft) below the surface deeper than most of the dredges in Bangladesh. The dredges built in Bangladesh will use the same advanced components as DSC dredges built in the USA including variable displacement-load sense and variable displacement-closed loop systems. They are powered by a single Caterpillar C32 diesel engine rated 1125 hp and features a 200 hp cutter drive.

With the advanced DSC hydraulic system and fuel-efficient Caterpillar engine this dredge will have a very low cost of operation which means more profits for the dredge contractors in Bangladesh. This is a game changer for their industry.

One of the Deep Diggers Directors Mr. Omar Sharif (Tuhin) stated “We were pleased to partner with the premier dredge manufacturer from the USA DSC Dredge. I have known Charlie Sinunu for more than 15 years and we always hoped that we could find a project together. Now as one of the Directors of Deep Diggers and the local representative of DSC we can build as well as service all DSC dredges in the country. We are factory trained and pride ourselves on providing 24/7/365 service to all DSC clients in Bangladesh. We look forward to building many more dredges in the future with DSC.”

DSC Dredge President and CEO Bob Wetta commented “I am extremely proud of the finished product with all of the setbacks of COVID in 2020 the Deep Diggers manufacturing team stayed diligent in bringing this dredge to life. We look forward to the future and what it holds for our collaboration.”

DSC is a global leader in the dredge manufacturing industry engineering superior customized dredging solutions to meet specific application needs while continuing to exceed customer expectations.

Since the late-1960s the luxury sedan has been the manufacturer’s flagship car for the domestic market and from 1997 to 2007 it was powered by the company’s only series-production V12.

Before we delve into the details about the twelve-cylinder  let’s get to know the car it was intended for. It all started in 1967 when Toyota introduced a new full-size luxury sedan that was built to celebrate 100 years since the birth of its founder Sakichi Toyoda.The embodiment of Japanese culture and engineering excellence the Century became the vehicle of choice for members of the royal family high-ranking government officials and the country’s most illustrious businessmen. It was continuously improved for the next 30 years getting its first major redesign in 1997.By that time Toyota had grown into one of the biggest names in the automotive industry and no expense was spared for the development of the new Century. In appearance it was not as lavish as a Maybach or a Rolls-Royce . However it was just as flawless comfortable and high-tech.Unlike the first generation which was based on an existing model (the Crown Eight) this variant was designed from scratch and almost every component was specifically conceived for it. While the body featured nothing particularly impressive things were different under the hood.Engineers were tasked with developing a smooth-running and efficient unit that would also deliver an unprecedented level of reliability. So rather than building on the successful recipe of the Lexus LS400’s 1UZ-FE V8 they cooked up Japan’s first mass-produced V12.At first glance the 5.0- liter all-aluminum 48-valve quad-cam mill is nothing special yet Toyota made a name for itself by over-engineering the heck out of its powerplants and this one was no exception.The reinforced block was designed with a 60-degree angle between the two banks and was fitted with forged steel fully counterweighted crankshaft held in place by six-bolt mains. The architecture of both the block and the crank was inspired by the silky-smooth 1UZ-FE’s race-derived bottom end. The conrods were asymmetric and made from forged steel while the pistons were constructed from aluminum alloy.To further improve smoothness and efficiency the cylinder heads came with slant-squish combustion chambers iridium spark plugs and Toyota’s VVT-i (Variable Valve Timing-intelligent) technology.In many ways this engine was a combination of two six-cylinders that shared a common crank. It had dedicated left and right bank intake manifolds independent throttle bodies and fuel injection systems. Each bank was controlled by a separate enabling the 1GZ-FE to completely shut down one of the banks in case of a major failure and continue to run on the other six cylinders.However this unit was bombproof and never broke down. In fact it turned out to be one of the most reliable ever produced because it was tuned to deliver far less power and torque than it was capable of.When it was released Japanese manufacturers were still abiding by the gentleman’s agreement of the mid-1970s that limited output to 276 hp. That being said the 1GZ-FE was rated at – yes you guessed it! Exactly 276 horses. At 355 lb-ft (481 Nm) the maximum amount of torque it could send to the rear wheels was good for a V12 that wasn’t built for a sportscar. Moreover it was attainable at 1200 rpm so the 4520-lb (2050 kg) of the Century was by no means sluggish.What the engine lacked in terms of power it more than made up in terms of smoothness. In a previous article  I discussed how the 1UZ-FE was put to the test by the Top Gear crew during a 1990 episode: a glass filled with water was placed on top of the valve cover and the liquid barely moved when the engine was revved up to its limit. Well according to Toyota the Century’s V12 exhibited 10% less vibration than the LS400’s V8 which is quite amazing.The powerplant showed its true potential once Japanese petrolheads began to swap it into their custom rides. Because of its dual-ECU design it was a pain in the behind to modify but eventually people began to develop custom setups. In many cases the twelve-cylinder was bored out fitted with 2JZ internals and custom heads (among other goodies) and could easily spit out between 500 and 600 hp.Of course some didn’t settle for three digits and proceeded to add a twin-turbo kit to the mix. One such speed addict is Kazuhiko “Smokey” Nagata the founder of the Japanese tuning company Top Secret and the man behind arguably the most famous Mk IV Supras of all time. Equipped with a pair of HKS GT 2835 turbochargers the Top Secret Supra’s thoroughly modified 1GZ-FE produces no less than 1000 hp. You can see the insane car in action below in a video posted on YouTube by That Racing Channel.Officially it was only used in a JDM luxury sedan and it was grossly capped in power for increased reliability and smoothness. However the 1GZ-FE was an engineering masterclass that in my opinion deserves more recognition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoZXNlLXNtYWxsLWNhcnMtaGF2ZS1pbnNhbmVseS1wb3dlcmZ1bC1lbmdpbmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Small Cars Have Insanely Powerful Engines,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoZXNlLXNtYWxsLWNhcnMtaGF2ZS1pbnNhbmVseS1wb3dlcmZ1bC1lbmdpbmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3RlY2hvYnNlcnZlci5pbi9uZXdzL2VudGVycHJpc2UtaXQvaGV3bGV0dC1wYWNrYXJkLXJvbGxzLW91dC1pbmRpYW4tZXhwYW5zaW9uLXBsYW4tbGVhc2VzLTEtOC1sYWtoLXNxZnQtb2ZmaWNlLXNwYWNlLWluLWNoZW5uYWktMjU5MjExL9IBkwFodHRwczovL3RlY2hvYnNlcnZlci5pbi9uZXdzL2VudGVycHJpc2UtaXQvaGV3bGV0dC1wYWNrYXJkLXJvbGxzLW91dC1pbmRpYW4tZXhwYW5zaW9uLXBsYW4tbGVhc2VzLTEtOC1sYWtoLXNxZnQtb2ZmaWNlLXNwYWNlLWluLWNoZW5uYWktMjU5MjExLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hewlett Packard rolls out Indian expansion plan leases 1.8 lakh sqft office space in Chennai – Tech Observer,"Making fresh inroads in the Indian market the US technology major Hewlett Packard had leased 1.8 lakh sqft office space in Chennai to consolidate and expand its operation in the city.

The original Veyron just scrapes its way into this list with an 8.0-litre W16 quad-turbocharged engine that churned out a mammoth 1001hp and 1250Nm allowing the hypercar to go from 0-100kph in just 2.5 seconds (claimed). These numbers were impressive when the Veyron was introduced and continue to impress to this day.

Tesla Model S Plaid - 1020hp (2021)

If the regular Model S from Tesla wasn't enough to give you the visceral thrill you were after the brand’s recently revised Model S Plaid will certainly change that. With just over 1000hp on offer and an official kerb weight some 200kg lesser than that of a Porsche Taycan Turbo S the Plaid can go from 0-100kph in a claimed 1.99 seconds. Whilst this may only be achievable in the most ideal conditions these are still some eye-watering numbers.

Lucid Air - 1126hp (2022)

The 2022 Lucid Air certainly earns it's keep within this list yet achieves it with no tailpipe emissions lithium-ion batteries and twin-electric motors. Lucid will sell you a slightly less performance-oriented model if you're simply looking to do your part for the planet. However this is the version to have if you want to keep company with other 1000hp cars. Choose the more potent version and it goes from 0-100kph in 2.5 seconds with a restricted top speed of 350kph.

Impressive stuff for a four-door saloon aimed at the luxury end of the market. Just as relevantly the Air can manage up to 537km between recharging halts and rapid charging ensures you can be ready to go in 30 minutes.

Aston Martin Valkyrie - 1176hp (2021)

It didn’t take Aston Martin long to shift all 150 road-going Valkyrie cars as customers clamoured for the V12-engined hypercar each selling for an impressive £2.8 million (around Rs 27.99 crore). With 1176hp it’s easily the most powerful car the company has ever produced and the quickest too. Aston says the car can lap the Silverstone Grand Prix track in the same time as a current Formula 1 car thanks to huge amounts of downforce that allow for high cornering speeds.

The 6.5-litre V12 petrol engine puts out 1014hp while the electric motor adds another 162hp to the mix. To build these engines Aston sought help from Cosworth for the V12 and Rimac for the electric motor and combined them to offer over 1hp/kg thanks to the car’s 1030kg weight.

Zenvo TSR-S - 1193hp (2021)

Having previously taken the guise of the lesser-powered (if you can call it that) 'TS1 GT' which made its debut in 2016 the TSR-S takes itself just that little bit more seriously and incorporates a revised and even brawnier powertrain producing 1193hp along with some seriously impressive active aero. With a twin-supercharged 5.8-litre V8 sitting just ahead of the rear-axle the TSR-S is able to complete the 0-100kph dash in as little as 2.8 seconds and go on to hit a limited top speed of 325kph.

Having only manufactured around five units per year previously the TS1 GT derivative never seemed to catch on as a viable alternative to other mainstream options available at the time.

Bugatti Veyron Super Sport - 1200hp (2010-2011)

The Veyron may have been usurped by the Chiron now but Bugatti’s original hypercar remains the most recognisable and the Super Sport was its ultimate incarnation. Its 1200hp was some 199hp more than the standard Veyron and pushed top speed up to 431kph while the 0-100kph sprint remained unchanged at 2.5 seconds.

Only 25 Super Sports were made. It’s also worth considering that the engine could drain its 100-litre tank in less than eight minutes if driven flat out.

Mercedes-AMG One - 1248hp (2022)

The idea of a Formula 1 car for the road has never really been realised but Mercedes-AMG gets closer than most with its Project One. Using an F1-derived hybrid power set-up the Project One comes with a 1.6-litre V6 petrol engine and four electric motors to deliver up to 1248hp.

Electricity isn’t just for the quadruple motors either as the Project One's turbocharger is electrically powered to get the most out of every drop of fuel. As a result the Mercedes covers 0-100kph in less than 2.5 seconds and doesn’t stop till 350kph is registered on the speedo. Only 275 units have been given the go ahead for production. It’s been quite a while since Lewis Hamilton unveiled the concept car named Project One at the Frankfurt motor show in 2017. But we hope to finally see customers getting deliveries in 2022.

NextEV NIO EP9 - 1379hp (2016)

The NextEV NIO EP9 has recorded a 6min 45.9sec lap of the Nürburgring Norschleife putting it just half a second behind a Lamborghini Aventador LP770-4 SVJ on very sticky tyres. So the EP9 is the quickest EV so far around this track and very quick in corners as well as in the straight line.

It does help when you have 1379hp or 1-megawatt on call from the NextEV’s four electric motors. Just as vitally the EP9 comes with active suspension and aerodynamics that generate 2.5-tonnes of downforce at 240kph to come close to matching a Formula 1 car.

Koenigsegg Agera RS - 1379hp (2017)

The Koenigsegg Agera RS is a derivative of the Agera with power and output dialled up to eleven! Weighing in at 1395kg the hypercar is powered by a 1379hp (1-megawatt) 1280Nm 5.0-litre twin-turbo V8. The most impressive thing about the Agera RS was its top speed record for a production car which it took from the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport after it recorded a two-way average speed of 447.2kph. With this record Koenigsegg also took the record for the highest speed ever recorded on a public road previously held by Mercedes-Benz since 1938 when a highly modified W125 Grand Prix car managed 431kph on a closed stretch of the Autobahn.

Bugatti Chiron - 1500hp (2016)

Questions were raised by many over how the Chiron would trump the Veyron when Bugatti launched the new model. But a leap of 300hp (over the Veyron Super Sport) to come up with 1500hp was still a surprise. That’s a lot of power needed to hit its 420kph top speed. Interestingly this is electronically limited as standard tyres will not be able to cope with more. A modified Chiron however currently holds the production car world speed record cracking 490.48kph in 2019.

While that top speed is attention-grabbing it’s what the 8.0-litre quad-turbo W16 engine does that's entertaining. Nought to 100kph in 2.4 seconds isn’t as quick as some but the Bugatti just keeps forcing its way forward with no let up before it butts into its 400kph limiter like a bull annoyed at being held back by a gate. It’s a demonstration of just how powerful the Chiron is.

Koenigsegg Regera - 1520hp (2016)

Koenigsegg is unapologetic about not chasing ever larger numbers from its turbocharged 5.0-litre V8 motor. It reckons that’s plenty and instead sought better throttle response with smaller turbos. This is possible thanks to the engine making 1115hp on its own and any lag from the turbos is filled in by the 710hp electric motor giving a combined 1520hp.

So the Regera is a hybrid hypercar that has a 410kph top speed reined in by an electronic limiter. It can also cover 0-100kph in 2.8 seconds and sprint from rest to 300kph in 10.9 seconds. All of this is managed without a traditional gearbox as the Regera uses the Swedish firm’s Direct Drive transmission that helps keep weight down to 1590kg compared to the Bugatti’s Chiron heft at 1995kg. The Ragera’s production was capped to just 80 units.

Koenigsegg Jesko - 1622hp (2019)

Revealed at the 2019 Geneva motor show the Jesko is the Swedish carmakers newest model that aims to claim the top-speed record. The Jesko uses a twin-turbocharged 5.0-litre V8 engine that churns out 1622hp and 2177Nm of peak torque. The engine is mated to a unique multi-clutch 9-speed transmission which will allow for a theoretical top speed of 531kph (330mph) in its top-speed set-up.

Koenigsegg also plans to sell the car in two different configurations – one for track use and one to maximise on-road top speed (the Jesko Absolut).

Hennessey Venom F5 - 1842hp (2020)

Hennessey describes the Venom F5 as ‘America’s Hypercar’. That’s about as fair a description as you can get before the numbers begin to boggle your brains. It’s easily done when you consider this sleek looking machine packs a 7.6-litre twin-turbo V8 with 1842hp. This is enough for a claimed 0-100kph of less than 3.0 seconds 0-300kph in under 10 seconds and 0-400kph needing less than half a minute.

Another consequence of the Hennessey’s huge power output is a top speed of 484kph (claimed). Only 24 Venom F5s are planned for production.

Rimac Nevera - 1941hp (2021)

Rimac had already made its mark with the Concept One electric hypercar. Each of the eight battery-powered cars were capable of 0-100kph in 2.5 seconds courtesy of its 1241hp. But that’s not enough for this Croatian firm so it’s come up with the Nevera with 1941hp from its two front and two rear motors.

The company is planning to build 150 models of the zero emissions car that's able to dash off 0-100kph in 1.85 seconds and carry on to 415kph thanks to new liquid-cooling for the battery packs. Fully charged they offer a range of 549km as tested under WLTP conditions.

Lotus Evija - 1999hp (2020)

Having previously only ever manufactured cars that were massively capable through the bends Lotus's new Evija is a far cry from Elises and Exiges of old. With four 500hhp electric motors sending power to each wheel individually Lotus has created the most powerful road-going production car to date. Although Lotus draws attention to the fact that the Evija is not simply a one-trick pony its straight line credentials are certainly noteworthy. 0-300kph happens in just nine seconds although a top speed is yet to be confirmed.

Production of the Evija will be limited to just 130 units and Lotus also claims the car will deliver around 346km of range on a full charge (WLTP). However if the boundaries of its performance are even remotely explored you'll likely get nowhere near that.

While the world takes notice of China’s visible and massive Naval expansion the U.S. Navy has quietly been powering up its own fleet of new warships by surging along with the construction of a new generation of high-tech heavily armed DDG 51 Flight III Destroyers.

The Navy has now formally “launched” the first of its ultra-modernized more capable “Flight III” DDG 51 variants the soon-to-be USS Jack H. Lucas. The ship is a small yet crucial element of a broader service warship upgrade and expansion which seeks to help the Navy pursue and sustain maritime warfare superiority.

The U.S. Navy has as many as twenty new destroyers now in various stages of construction an extremely significant yet lesser-known fact of great relevance to the future of maritime war. The number of destroyers now being built by the Navy is itself quite significant. Yet of even greater significance is the fact that many of the emerging Navy Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51 destroyers are new far more capable Flight III DDG 51 configurations.

The Flight III destroyers integrate a new Aegis Radar Baseline 10 air-and-missile defense technology intended to integrate air and missile defense with ballistic missile defense into a single operational system. The most defining element of the Flight IIIs is its new AN/SPY-6 radar a new application that enables ship commanders to locate and discriminate multiple approaching threats at one time. Using a high-efficiency high power-density conducting material known as Gallium Nitride the AN/SPY-6 can amplify high-power signals at microwave frequency Raytheon and Navy developers explain. The SPY-6 radar is explained by developers as a technology that can detect threats one-half the size and twice as far away as most existing radars. There are at times different figures or metrics regarding the exact dimensions of the system’s sensitivity. One Navy program manager once told The National Interest that SPY-6 is 35-times more powerful than previous radar.

Some of the newer technical characteristics of the SPY-6 include integrated hardware and software engineered with common interfaces. The new components called TI 16 for “Technical Integration” enable the Aegis radar to add next-generation weapons such as electronic warfare (EW) applications or lasers as they become available.

The DDG Flight III’s are also being built with the same Rolls Royce power turbine engineered for the DDG 1000 but are designed with some special fuel-efficiency enhancements. Radar works by sending a series of electromagnetic signals or “pings” at the speed of light which bounce off an object or threat and send back return-signal information identifying the shape size speed or distance of the object encountered. Analyzing the speed frequency range and variation of the return signals enables radar operators to develop a rendering or precise “picture” of what a specific threat may be. More sensitive radar such as SPY-6 will therefore enable ships to see smaller objects at greater distances and provide a higher degree of detailed information about objects at times effectively distinguish threats from one another or from non-threatening objects. The SPY 6 can distinguish approaching enemy anti-ship missiles close to the surface from less relevant objects and also track higher-altitude ballistic missiles on the same system. Given this scope the SPY 6 radar systems streamline otherwise disparate fire-control technologies; the SPY 6 can cue short-range closer-in interceptors as well as longer-range ballistic missile interceptors such as an SM-3.

The DDG 51 Arleigh Burke-class Guided Missile Destroyer (DDG 51) is a multi-mission guided-missile destroyer designed to operate offensively and defensively independently or as units of Carrier Strike Groups Expeditionary Strike Groups and Surface Action Groups in multi-threat environments that include air surface and subsurface threats.

These ships will respond to Low-Intensity Conflict/Coastal and Littoral Offshore Warfare scenarios as well as open ocean conflict providing or augmenting power projection forward presence requirements and escort operations at sea.

Huntington Ingalls Industries is currently constructing four other DDG 51 class ships including the future USS Frank E. Petersen Jr. (DDG 121) and USS Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee (DDG 123) in the Flight IIA configuration and the future USS Ted Stevens (DDG 128) and USS Jeremiah Denton (DDG 129) as Flight III ships.

There are a total of 20 DDG 51 class ships under contract at both new construction shipyards.

You can get stories like this one straight to your inbox every Thursday morning by subscribing here.

If you didn’t know semiconductor chips were important before the pandemic you do now.

Also known as “microchips” these little bits of tech form the brains behind new cars phones computers gaming consoles and countless other products we rely on everyday (which are now all abruptly in short supply).

Now IBM and Samsung have unveiled a new microchip design that promises radically faster more efficient chips — and a big upgrade to all of our tech that relies on them.

The challenge: Semiconductor chips contain tiny gates called “transistors” that control the flow of electricity. This is what allows a traditional computer to process information using a binary on/off code. (If a gate’s open that’s a “1.” If it’s closed that’s a “0.”)

To make faster more powerful computers we need microchips with more transistors but to keep the chips well micro we’ve had to keep packing more and more transistors into the same area.

We’re now hitting a wall in the amount of transistors we can pack onto a microchip.

The end of the line: In 1975 semiconductor pioneer Gordon Moore famously predicted that we’d be able to double the number of transistors on microchips every two years and that projection — “Moore’s Law” — proved accurate for decades thanks to heroic efforts by engineers.

We’re now hitting a wall in the amount of transistors we can pack onto a microchip though. Making them smaller is just becoming physically impossible — the ones we have today are so small that 1000 of them laid end-to-end are only the width of a human hair.

“The fact is when they’re talking about building physical entities like semiconductors and transistors you can only go so small” Robert Sutor chief quantum exponent at IBM told Electronic Products.

“Atoms have a certain size and you’re approaching the almost atomic molecular distances at this point” he continued. “You’re limited by that.”

IBM and Samsung have unveiled a new microchip design that promises radically faster more efficient chips.

The idea: IBM and Samsung’s new design stacks transistor components vertically on a microchip with electricity flowing up and down rather than the traditional horizontal design with electricity flowing from side to side.

They call their approach “Vertical-Transport Nanosheet Field Effect Transistor” (VTFET) and they say it could not only allow for more transistors on a microchip but also make the flow of electricity through them more efficient.

https://youtu.be/OF3Zwfu6Ngc

Compared to today’s standard transistor design (called FinFET) devices with VTFET chips would have a “two times improvement in performance or an 85 percent reduction in energy use” according to IBM.

That means batteries could last way longer (or be much smaller) and computers could produce much less waste heat which impacts performance and requires loud fans to keep the system cool.

In other words: smartphone batteries that last a week rather than a day.

“Scaling silicon is not the only way to get lower power and better performance.” Valeria Bertacco

The bigger picture: IBM and Samsung haven’t said when they plan to start producing chips with the stacked transistor design so we don’t know when they might actually start showing up in your phone or watch but it typically takes a few years to go from the drawing board to figuring out how to mass produce chips and building devices capable of using them.

However the stacked design and more densely packed transistors are not the only ways we’re going to keep computer power growing in the decades to come.

“Scaling silicon is not the only way to get lower power and better performance” Valeria Bertacco director of the University of Michigan’s Applications Driving Architectures research center told EE Times in 2019. “It was just the easiest way until 10 years ago.”

Replacing silicon with other materials such as graphene might unleash big upgrades in performance too.

Another way is to specialize microchips for specific tasks and divide the computer’s labor.

“Hardware customized for particular domains can be much more efficient and use far fewer transistors enabling applications to run tens to hundreds of times faster” MIT researcher Tao Schardl told MIT News in 2020.

More efficient software and better algorithms could also allow progress to continue even if transistor numbers don’t keep increasing. Replacing the semiconductor materials such as silicon in microchips with other materials such as graphene might unleash big upgrades in performance too.

Then there’s the ultimate game-changer: quantum computers which aim to do away with transistor-laden microchips entirely. Instead they encode information in entangled particles that can represent 1s 0s or both simultaneously which dramatically increases the computer’s potential processing power.

But today’s silicon microchip electronics aren’t going to be replaced by quantum versions or even graphene any time soon so in the near-term we’ll have to rely on clever new designs to grind out another round of Moore’s Law improvements.

This comes after a difficult few weeks where the coin saw a 33% drop. That came after bitcoin hit an all-time record on Nov. 10 surging to $69000.

The coin has seen some strife since then dropping to around $45000 to $48000 a cutting-out of around $23000 of its value.

The end of this year has seen the coin rallying though – it’s up 4% in the last two days and 8% in the last week.

These developments have also been good for other cryptos with the Coin Market Cap top 10-listed digital assets mostly trading well including ether up 1% in the past 24 hours and cardano up 4% in the day and 16% for the week. In addition Ripple XRP had gotten a 1.3% boost for the day and 11.4% for the last week.

The news prompted Bloomberg report saying that if the coin went up a bit more there could be major gains. The study said the $53000 to $55000 mark was important because it would give the coin a way to test its strength. That could lead to another rally.

The report says bitcoin’s current $51000 is above price levels that analysts have said could’ve sent the coin’s value plummeting.

Meanwhile Binance has been fined 8 million lira or $750000 in Turkey for reportedly not complying with regulations there.

Reports say President Recep Tayyip Erdogan seems to be looking at regulations as a way forward.

The president said the country was ready to regulate bitcoin and could send the law “without delay” to parliament.

Digital Transformation particularly post-pandemic is pervasive and fast accelerating. It is a business imperative for maintaining competitive parity in today's digital economy. As an innovation ecosystem partnerships and integrated customer experiences become increasingly important leaders need to move quickly to stay relevant.The choices - and investments - they make today will define in part how they will compete in a fast-moving global market.Our recent Institute for Business Value study highlighted that nearly 6 out of 10 Indian CEOs expect cloud computing to deliver results in the next 2-3 years and 45% of CEOs in India expect AI/machine learning to deliver results in the next 2-3 years.Another report from IBM Institute of Business Value asserted that organisations in India can increase the revenue impact of cloud to 13x (at par with their global counterparts) by combining their journey to cloud with enterprise transformation focusing on operational enablers (workforce skills processes and extended intelligent workflows and cybersecurity).The following trends in 2022 will further make Hybrid Cloud and AI all-pervasive in the industry.As organisations progress their hybrid and multi-cloud journeys their focus will shift towards determining which workloads go where. Today they are evaluating the migration of more mission-critical complex workloads as they embrace modernization. In the year ahead they will need to take inventory of their IT environments to select which workloads and applications are best suited for the cloud and which should remain on-premises. This will require companies to establish a hybrid cloud architecture that is open by design which avoids vendor lock-in and affords seamless interoperability and portability between environments.An important factor leading to the acceleration in adoption of a hybrid and multi-cloud approach is the need to mitigate vendor concentration risk as cyberthreats grow. Data protection is critical and enterprises will need to prioritize security designed on an open architecture with a single point of control. The aim is to gather a holistic view of threats and proactively mitigate attacks. Focus on cybersecurity as a systemic control is no longer only a business continuity issue - it is fast becoming a Board level topic that requires a robust plan with quarterly reviews and updates.Data Governance is another critical piece. According to the IBM Institute of Business Value 'Unlock the business value of hybrid cloud' in India report 74 percent of the respondents consider their ability to run governance and compliance tools across multiple clouds and industry-related regulatory compliance as important or extremely important to the success of their digital initiatives.For instance adhering to compliance and security requirements is pivotal for highly regulated industries such as the financial services sector and government agencies for example.This has led to the shift towards the adoption of specialised clouds that have in-built regulatory controls. Organisations will increasingly leverage industry-specific platforms to help them balance innovation with stringent compliance protocols. The right platform - with built-in controls - will help them to innovate ahead of the market without being out of regulatory compliance.Virtual assistants became a critical tool for large organisations and governments during the pandemic. In 2022 consumers will witness more personalised and fully realized interactions with their preferred retailers and service providers as AI assumes a bigger impact on the customer care journey particularly with increasing digitally connected consumers.AI will play a key role in helping businesses achieve sustainability benchmarks through greater measurement data collection and carbon accounting as well as improved predictiveness and greater supply chain resiliency. Predictive maintenance that reduces the need to replace parts and equipment AI that analyses satellite imagery of storms and wildfires and other such innovations will play a critical role in preparing companies to better meet their sustainability agenda.As stewards of an organization's digital infrastructure CIOs in 2021 were tasked with moving their workforces remotely managing new types of security concerns as a result and making sense of the explosion of data produced by modern applications monitoring solutions and increased use of digital channels by employees and consumers.Not only did these conditions create a ""pressure cooker"" for businesses interested in adopting automation technologies but it also intensified interest around becoming more proactive in turn increasing interest in applying AI to better predict IT issues which has led to an area called AIOps. AIOps allows an organisation's IT teams to proactively manage complex workplace environments through automation potentially saving hundreds of thousands of dollars that could have been lost.In 2022 AIOps will allow IT teams to quickly and confidently diagnose problems faster than they could manually freeing them from laborious time-intensive tasks to focus on delivering higher-value work for the organisation. AIOps will also enable these IT teams to identify patterns in data that could ultimately indicate a potential issue could occur getting ahead of IT issues before they happen.We believe these trends have an enormous potential to accelerate an organisation's business growth and improve people's lives through access to more reliable and better goods services and information.(Sandip Patel is Managing Director IBM India)",,,,,,

The workshop was conducted by Master Chef Meghna Shukla where she demonstrated the cooking methods of various millet products and recipes. Dr Amar Singh Azad was also present on the occasion.

Ayurveda & nature cure expert Guru Manish Founder of Shuddhi Ayurveda & Co Founder of HIIMS said “Apart from attending the unique Cookery Workshop the participants also got an opportunity to hear the views of various experts buy organic millets and enjoy the taste of dishes made from millets. Overall it was a great chance to rediscover the miraculous coarse grains and it’s health benefits.”

The HIIMS campus is located on the Chandigarh-Delhi highway behind Jugraj Dhaba in Derabassi and is the first integrated medical sciences hospital to have got the prestigious NABH accreditation the hospital’s expertise lies in India’s time tested Ayurveda & panchkarma therapies.

Besides general information about the coarse grains the main food and dishes prepared from them were also explained in detail at the workshop. Chef Meghna who had come from Indore said “Millets are miracle grains as these are rich in nutritious value. Not only did visitors learn about recipes based on millets but also became aware about the benefits of millets if these are made part of one’s regular diet.”

The Patients who have shown remarkable improvement at HIIMS were also present at the event.

Chef Meghna taught some recipes in her basic session which showcased preparation of Indian main course food items. The advanced session’s topic was preparation of multi-cuisine snacks. The participants also relished savoring the delicious preparations.

Guru Manish said that millets are more beneficial than wheat and rice not only to stay fit but also to avoid many diseases. The millets include cereals like Kangni Sawan Kodo Kutki Bajra Ragi Chana Jowar and Maize. Millets are rich in calcium phosphorus iron protein and minerals. The kind of wheat that is being consumed today is genetically modified.

Instead if nutritious millets are included in the diet the problem of diabetes can be reduced in a week or two and blood pressure can also come under control within two to four weeks. Even cancer patients can get benefits in two to four months.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hardware Recap

The GTi11 is a 168 x 120 x 39mm (6.61 x 4.72 x 1.54 inches) actively cooled mini PC and the review model has an i5-1135G7 Intel Tiger Lake quad-core 8-thread 2.50 GHz Core processor boosting to 4.20 GHz with Intel’s Xe Graphics.

The review model also includes a 500GB M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe Gen 3.0 SSD drive initially with Windows 10 Pro installed but now successfully upgraded to Windows 11 Pro two sticks of 8GB DDR4 3200 MHz memory a soldered WiFi 6 (or 802.11ax) Intel AX201 chip and dual 2.5Gb Ethernet ports.

The specifications list four of the USB ports as 3.0 so I retested them on Ubuntu using a Samsung 980 PRO PCle 4.0 NVMe M.2 SSD housed in an ‘USB to M.2 NVMe adapter’ (ORICO M2PAC3-G20 M.2 NVMe SSD Enclosure) and reconfirmed that the front two USB ports are actually 3.1 (USB 3.2 Gen 2×1 i.e. 10 Gbit/s) see for example Bus 02 Port 1 Dev 12:

and that the rear ports are 3.0 (USB 3.2 Gen 1×1 i.e. 5 Gbit/s) see for example Bus 04 Port 3 Dev 5 :

The other point of interest is that the front ‘Type-C’ port is actually a Thunderbolt 4 port which I reconfirmed using the same Gen 4.0 NVMe SSD but housed in my JEYI Thunderbolt 3 M.2 NVMe Enclosure:

and that when ‘used’ as a USB ‘Type-C’ port it also runs at USB 3.1 speed see Bus 02 Port 1 Dev 11 :

and can support video output through ‘Alternate Mode’:

Review Methodology

When reviewing mini PCs I typically compare their performance against some of the more recently released mini PCs. I now review using Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS and test with a selection of commonly used Linux benchmarks together with Thomas Kaiser’s ‘sbc-bench’ which is a small set of different CPU performance tests focusing on server performance when run on Ubuntu. I also compile the v5.4 Linux kernel using the default config as a test of performance using a real-world scenario. Finally I use ‘Phoronix Test Suite’ so that I can benchmark with the same set of tests on Windows for comparison purposes.

Prior to benchmarking I perform all necessary installations and updates to run the latest version of the OS. I also capture some basic details of the device for the OS.

Beelink GTi11 Ubuntu installation Issues

After shrinking the Windows partition in half and creating a new partition I installed Ubuntu on Beelink GTi11 using an Ubuntu 20.04.3 ISO as dual boot. The first issue was that the Ethernet ports were not recognized on the LiveUSB:

This is likely due to the ports being 2.5Gbps so the installation had to be completed using WiFi and once installed the Ethernet ports worked successfully.

The second issue was there was no audio either from HDMI or when attaching an external speaker or headphones to the 3.5mm audio jack. Even after installation this issue still existed:

The ‘dmesg’ gave a pointer as to how to fix the HDMI audio:

and HDMI audio could be successfully fixed by adding snd_intel_dspcfg.dsp_driver=1 as a GRUB2 kernel boot parameter:

however this did not resolve the headphone issue.

There are also some BIOS errors being reported in the ‘dmesg’ although the significance of which has not been determined:

Another previously encountered issue where one of the benchmarks requires compiling its code with the -march=native option occurred again as the compiler packages failed to recognize the ‘tigerlake’ architecture of this CPU using the default 9.3.0 versions and the solution was to install and use the later 10.3.0 versions of ‘gcc’ and ‘g++’:

Finally the latest pre-release version of Mangohud was required in order to successfully monitor the game Grand Theft Auto V which otherwise would crash when toggling logging on and off.

Ubuntu Performance

After installation and updates a brief check showed working Wi-Fi Bluetooth and Ethernet with the exception of audio as mentioned above.

The key hardware information under Ubuntu 20.04.3 is as follows:

I then set the CPU Scaling Governor to ‘performance’ and ran my Linux benchmarks for which the majority of the results are text based but the graphical ones included:

and the latter can be directly compared to when run in Windows using the OpenGL render:

I also ran PassMark PerformanceTest Linux:

which similarly can be directly compared to the results from when it was run on Windows:

For the same set of Phoronix Test Suite tests the results were:

The complete results together with a comparison against other recent mini PCs are:

The results show an improvement in the integrated GPU performance compared with older mini PCs and the capability of which will be explored further below.

Video playback with browsers & Kodi

Video playback was reasonably successful with only Firefox dropping frames for 4K 60 FPS videos however none were dropped when the quality was set to 1440p:

I also attempted playing an 8K 60 FPS video in YouTube in both Firefox and Chrome however neither were as successful as Windows with both stalling and dropping frames continuously:

Finally I played some videos in Kodi of various formats all of which played without issue until I tried 8K 30 FPS and 8K 60 FPS which switched to using software decoding resulted in frame skipping and stuttering:

Beelink GTi11 Ubuntu Gaming

Similar to my earlier Windows testing I benchmarked three games under Steam (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Grand Theft Auto V and Shadow Of The Tomb Raider) at both 1080p and 720p using default settings in both CS:GO and GTA V and with the graphical preset of ‘lowest’ in the built-in benchmark of SOTTR. The average FPS results were as follows:

Interesting CS:GO on Ubuntu out-performed Windows quite significantly:

GTA V showed similar performance but SOTTR was slightly worse on Ubuntu.

Thermals

The Beelink GTi11 uses active cooling and running a stress test on Ubuntu saw the CPU temperature rise to a peak of 85°C and then drop to an average around 75°C for the duration of the test:

During the stress test with an ambient room temperature of 26.7°C the top of the device did not get hot to touch however due to its reflective surface it was difficult to measure the actual temperature other than indicative readings of a maximum being around 42°C. The fan whilst audible was not excessively loud when it ramped up to its maximum even though it measured at times up to 50 dBA on my sound meter next to the device.

If the CPU frequency is monitored during the stress test it can be seen that it started at 3800 MHz then was immediately thermal throttled to an average of 3300 MHz:

Networking

Network connectivity throughput was measured on Ubuntu using ‘iperf’:

Power Consumption

Power consumption was measured as follows:

Powered off (shutdown) – 0.9 Watts

BIOS – 19.3 Watts

GRUB boot menu – 18.7 Watts

Idle – 11.1 Watts (Windows) and 8.8 Watts (Ubuntu)

CPU stressed – 42.0 Watts (Windows ‘cinebench’) and 41.3 Watts (Ubuntu ‘stress’)

Video playback* – 17.9 Watts (Windows Edge 4K 60 FPS) and 43.4 Watts (Ubuntu Chrome 4K 60 FPS)

*The power figures fluctuate notably due to the fan so the value is the average of the median high and median low power readings.

Beelink GTi11 BIOS

Powering up the mini PC and hitting the F7 key results in a boot menu that includes access to the BIOS. The BIOS is unrestricted as can be seen from the following representative pictures:

Two of the most frequently used BIOS options: ‘Wake on Lan’ and ‘Ac Power Lost Policy’ are easily accessed from the ‘Boot’ tab in the BIOS:

Further Observations

Whilst the Beelink GTi11 was impressive under Windows the GPU performance under Ubuntu is somewhat disappointing in comparison. Coupled with this are the Ubuntu installation and headphone audio issues. Given the device includes a license for Windows 10/11 Pro which also includes WSL2 installing Ubuntu is probably only for the really determined and when absolutely needed.

Thanks again to Beelink for providing the GTi11 for review. It retails on Banggood at around $610 for the current i5/16GB/500GB configuration and $820 for the i7/32GB/500GB configuration.

Intel Alder Lake Core i3-12300 & Core i3-12100 Quad-Core CPUs Destroy AMD Zen 3 Quad Cores Core i5-12400 Wins In Perf/$ Against 5600X While Running Efficiently and Cooler

The Intel Non-K lineup is more intended for standard and more cost-effective gaming setups. They don't necessarily offer the higher overclocking capabilities or the higher clocks (and higher TDP) as the unlocked SKUs but they do offer lower TDPs and are a perfect fit for OEMs and their pre-built options. As such Intel is expected to launch at least 19 non-K variants of its 12th Gen Alder Lake-S Desktop CPU family. We have already covered the detailed specs of the lineup in this post.

Intel Non-K Alder Lake-S Core i5 CPUs

The Intel Core i5-12400 will feature a 6 core and 12 thread design and will comprise only of Golden Cove (P-Cores). The chip will feature 18 MB of L3 cache & clocks will be rated at 3.00 GHz base and 4.6 GHz boost. The CPU will come with 65W TDP and it will be very interesting to see how these chips fare against AMD's Ryzen 5 5600X as they are aiming at the same segment. The Intel Core i5-12400 for $210 US while the F variant of the 12400 will hit store shelves for $180 US.

Intel Non-K Alder Lake-S Core i3 CPUs

Lastly we have the Core i3 lineup which includes the Intel Core i3-12300 and i3-12100. Both CPUs come with 4 cores and 8 threads (4 Golden Cove cores). The clocks are maintained at 4.4 GHz and 4.3 GHz boost for the chips respectively. They also pack 12 MB of L3 cache and every chip below the i5-12600 features the UHD730 graphics while the higher-end chips feature the UHD770 iGPU. The Core i3-12100 will retail for $140 US for the standard and $110 US for the F variant while the 12300 will retail for $150 US.

For testing the Intel Alder Lake Core i5 and Core i3 CPUs were tested on an ASRock Z690 Phantom Gaming 4 motherboard along with Apacer NOX DDR4-4266 (8 GB x 2) memory. The AMD platform used for comparison only had the motherboard changed to ASRock X570 Taichi while the rest of the specs such as graphics card (RX 6800 XT Taichi) and cooling remained the same.

Intel Alder Lake Non-K Core i5 & Core i3 Synthetic CPU Performance Benchmarks

First of all we have to talk about synthetic benchmarks starting with the Intel Core i5-12400. The i5 chip comfortably sits above or on par with the Ryzen 5 5600X with PBO enabled. The average perf gain is about 5% which isn't a lot but considering that this chip is around 50-55% lower in price ($180 vs $299) than the AMD part that alone is a huge win in the synthetic performance segment.

The Intel Core i3 parts are compared to the Ryzen 3 5350G which is the only 4 core and 8 thread Zen 3 part it can be compared to and here the Core i3 CPUs totally outclass Zen 3 even with the same number of cores and threads. We are talking gains of up to 26% and on average they are at 20%. it is a massive improvement over Intel's Comet Lake parts and a fantastic lead over AMD's Zen 3 chips.

Intel Alder Lake Non-K Core i5 & Core i3 Gaming CPU Performance Benchmarks

Moving over to gaming benchmarks the Intel Core i5-12400 and the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X trade blows with one another. AMD wins 3 tests and Intel wins 3 tests but we also have to remember AMD's chip is using PBO and costs much more. On the Core i3 front these entry-level chips outclass every other CPU designated at the segment. Once again the gains are up to 50% and that's something that will get budget gamers really excited about.

Intel Alder Lake Non-K Core i5 & Core i3 CPU Power Consumption

For several years AMD has been the king of efficiency with its bleeding-edge 7nm chips. This spree has come to an end as not only the high-end chips but the lower-end chips utilizing Intel's 10 ESF process nodes offer better efficiency. The Intel Core i5-12400 consumes 73W at max load while the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X with PBO consumes 119W of power. The Intel Core i3 chips do consume slightly more power at 61-64W versus the AMD Ryzen 3 5350G's 52.6W but you are also getting an average 30-40% performance uplift.

Intel Alder Lake Non-K Core i5 & Core i3 CPU Temperatures

Finally we have the temperatures where the Intel Core i5-12400 runs at a cool 58C versus the 86C on the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X. The Core i3's run slightly warmer than the Core i5 chip at up to 62C but that's much lower than the 68C of the Ryzen 3 5350G. There are also latency numbers provided in the charts below.

In addition to these Vietnamese Voz forums have also published some early Intel Core i5-12400 CPU performance impressions and also tested the chip with the boxed CPU cooler which ends up with the chip running at around 70-80C at maximum load.

2 of 9

The chips look like a fantastic upgrade from an older 14nm platform and even those who might be running an older Zen platform and want to upgrade to something new. Intel's Non-K lineup has the potential to shake things up in the entry-level and mainstream segment just like the K-series chips did in the high-end segment. The Intel Alder Lake Core i5 and Core i3 CPUs will come with the new Intel boxed cooler which features a fancy new design and is fully compliant with the LGA 1700 socket. Aside from that Intel will also debut its H670 B660 and H610 motherboards at CES 2022 which will bring the price of the Alder Lake further down & will carry both DDR5/DDR4 memory support.

AMD’s absence in the entry-level CPU market will soon take its toll once ‘locked’ 12th Gen Core i3 and i5 CPUs will be announced.

Over at Chiphell a leaker “热心市民描边怪” published a series of reviews featuring quad-core Intel i3-12100 and i3-12300 processors. A third review features Core i5-12400 which is a 6-core part. Each of those SKUs represents the cheapest Alder Lake-S lineup which is to be announced in early January. The review features qualification samples of the three SKUs: QYVQ QYVR QYHW QTVM each likely to represent near-identical performance to the retail samples.

Interestingly there were two qualification samples of the i5-12400 CPU the C0 and H0 revisions. The latter should be based on the new Alder Lake desktop die which lacks Efficient cores while the C0 is a cut-down version of existing high-performance desktop chips. There is no performance difference between the two dies but there are some changes in terms of power consumption and heat generation. However those are small and as the reviewer claims so this should have no impact on the decision making which 12400 version to grab (in case Intel releases both models to the market).

Alder Lake CPUs can have a lead in gaming performance by up to 33% over the AMD lineup. AMD processors in quad-core space are mainly based on Zen2 “Renoir” microarchitecture with Zen3 “Cezanne” APUs being hardly available for the DIY market. However even the AMD Zen3 APUs such as 5350G can barely catch up in synthetic tests the reviewer claims. This situation is unlikely to change till AMD releases its Renoir-X series which lacks integrated graphics. The Core i3 12100/12300 CPUs should cost around 800 to 900 RMB (125-141 USD) which does not account for an H610/B660 motherboard.

The Core i5-12400 hexa-core CPU might launch two variants. The H0 which uses a full die without Efficient cores offers lower temperature and lower power consumption however it does not offer higher performance the reviewer claims. This CPU will compete directly with Ryzen 5 5600G desktop APU with 5600X clearly offering better performance in some games but not necessarily in synthetic tests.

Intel’s 12th Gen Core non-K lineup is to be announced during CES 2022 press conference on January 4th. The new 65W CPU series are to be accompanied by a launch of the B660 and H610 mid-range and entry-level motherboards.

The conflict follows passage of a US law that bans virtually all imports from Xinjiang in response to concerns over the use of forced labor and other human rights abuses against an ethnic minority.

The semiconductor giant told suppliers earlier this month to avoid any products from the region in order to comply with the restrictions.

But following public outcry in China the chipmaker on Thursday expressed regret for the comments in a statement posted on Weibo the Chinese social media platform.

“Our original intention was to ensure compliance with American laws” Intel said. “We apologize for the trouble caused to our respected Chinese customers partners and the public.”

President Joe Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act into law on Thursday and Intel’s apology drew a skeptical response from the White House.

“We believe the private sector and the international community should oppose the PRC’s weaponizing of its markets to stifle support for human rights” said White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki.

“We also think that American companies should never feel the need to apologize for standing up for fundamental human rights or posing repression.”

A statement from Intel’s US staff made clear the company would follow US law.

“On December 23 we issued a statement in China to address concerns raised by our stakeholders there regarding how we communicated certain legal requirements and policies with our global supplier network” Intel said.

“We will continue to ensure that our global sourcing complies with applicable laws and regulations in the US and in other jurisdictions where we operate.”

The pressure on Intel comes as US companies grapple with the new sanctions which ban the import of all goods from the region unless companies offer verifiable proof that production did not involve forced labor.

The speed of policy tightening from the Federal Reserve has ramped up starting this month as the central bank tries to slow down the highest inflation levels in nearly 40 years.

The Fed will now cut its support by a pace of $30 billion per month as opposed to $15 billion. It also tentatively plans to hike interest rates three times in 2022 beginning sometime after March.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

This is scaring some investors who worry what the stock market will look like without an ocean of liquidity from the Fed and a zero-interest rate zero-alternative environment.

Investors are right to worry — but they shouldn't worry just yet says Lance Roberts the chief strategist at RIA Advisors.

Roberts broke down in a recent commentary that early rate hikes aren't what tend to tank stocks. Rather it's hikes later on.

""The risk is not the initial rate hike the second or even the third for stocks. It is the point where the increase in rates causes something to break either in the economy credit markets or a change in bullish psychology"" Roberts wrote. ""Secondly without exception rate-hiking campaigns led to a negative outcome. Furthermore the negative impact occurred at consistently lower levels.

""So while Fred [Imbert] is right that stocks rose 7% in 1999 after the Fed hiked rates in 2000 when the Fed finished hiking rates the stock market fell nearly 50% over the next two years"" he continued referencing an excerpt from a CNBC journalist he'd cited in his commentary.

Below Roberts displays the relationship between some market drops and the top of rate hike cycles.

One of the biggest consequences of rate hikes Roberts said is the reduction of share buybacks that it causes.

Share buybacks — when a company buys its own shares potentially boosting its price and earnings per share — have been responsible for more than 40% of the market's return over the last decade Roberts said citing data from Bloomberg.

Without share buybacks he said the S&P 500 would currently be around 2800 instead of above 4700.

""Historically the reversal of Fed policy to a tighter regime slows stock buybacks and tempers stock market returns"" he said showing the relationship in another chart.

""With the Fed on deck to start tightening policy heading into 2022 there is a significant risk that buybacks will slow. Such was the case when the issuance of cheap debt provided the funding for many of these repurchases"" Roberts said.

With valuations high Roberts said the market is particularly vulnerable to a pullback. In the commentary he laid out a number of threats currently face the market many of them related and stemming from monetary and fiscal policy decisions:

Tighter monetary policy and high valuations Less liquidity globally as Central Banks slow accommodation Less liquidity in the economy as the previous monetary injections fade Higher inflation reduces consumption Weaker economic growth Weak consumer confidence due to inflation Flattening yield curve Weaker earnings growth Profit margin compression Weaker year-over-year comparisons of most economic data

The bigger picture

Roberts makes a compelling case about initial rate hikes and their delayed effect on stocks at least during the last few market cycles.

But with valuations at their highest since the dot-com bubble anything could derail the market at any given point in time as he also points out.

One threat he didn't point out is the Omicron wave of COVID-19. Stocks sold off on Monday this week as new cases continued to rise. Investors have since seemed to forget about it and cases could soon peak but if the situation continues to worsen and cities and states restrict business activity investors could be more inclined to take profits.

In terms of economic growth President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion Build Back Better package failing to gain the approval of West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin put a dent in projections. Goldman Sachs moved down their GDP forecast for next year on the news.

Many strategists agree with Roberts' cautious outlook and see dismal returns ahead. Bank of America's Savita Subramanian and Stifel's Barry Bannister are two examples.

Right now the best-case scenario for stocks seems to be one in which COVID cases fall inflation cools off rate hikes and tapering don't trip up the economy or the market and consumers continue their strong spending.

That's a lot of boxes that need checked and perhaps not all of them need to occur for stocks to continue to do well. But investors might do well to plan for the heightened downside risk in the market at the moment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbmFuY2lhbG1pcnJvci5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNi8xNzAtZGVsaXN0ZWQtZnJvbS1tYWpvci11LXMtc3RvY2stZXhjaGFuZ2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,170 delisted from major U.S. stock exchanges,"What Are Cookies

Given the widespread global presence of this ingredients producer for food cosmetics and consumer products industries scrutinizing the trends in international revenues becomes imperative to assess its financial strength and future growth possibilities.

In the current era of a tightly interconnected global economy the proficiency of a company to penetrate international markets significantly influences its financial health and trajectory of growth. For investors the key is to grasp how reliant a company is on overseas markets as this provides insights into the durability of its earnings its ability to exploit different economic cycles and its overall growth capabilities.

Being present in international markets serves as a counterbalance to domestic economic challenges while offering chances to engage with more rapidly evolving economies. However this kind of diversification introduces challenges like currency fluctuations geopolitical uncertainties and varying market trends.

Upon examining IFF's recent quarterly performance we noticed several interesting patterns in the revenue generated from its international segments which are commonly analyzed and observed by Wall Street experts.

ADVERTISEMENT

The company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $2.9 billion marking a decrease of 4.2% from the year-ago quarter. We will next turn our attention to dissecting IFF's international revenue to get a clearer picture of how significant its operations are outside its main base.

Trends in IFF's Revenue from International Markets

Europe Africa and Middle East accounted for 33.7% of the company's total revenue during the quarter translating to $977 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of +2.38% with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $954.31 million. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year Europe Africa and Middle East contributed $876 million (32.4%) and $1.07 billion (35.4%) to the total revenue respectively.

Story continues

Of the total revenue $374 million came from Latin America during the last fiscal quarter accounting for 12.9%. This represented a surprise of +1.47% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $368.57 million to the total revenue. In comparison the region contributed $372 million or 13.8% and $364 million or 12% to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters respectively.

Greater Asia generated $682 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter constituting 23.5% of the total. This represented a surprise of +2.6% compared to the $664.7 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively in the previous quarter Greater Asia accounted for $646 million (23.9%) and in the year-ago quarter it contributed $688 million (22.7%) to the total revenue.

Revenue Projections for Overseas Markets

The current fiscal quarter's total revenue for International Flavors as projected by Wall Street analysts is expected to reach $2.82 billion reflecting a decline of 3.9% from the same quarter last year. The breakdown of this revenue by foreign region is as follows: Europe Africa and Middle East is anticipated to contribute 33% or $928.14 million Latin America 12.7% or $358.47 million and Greater Asia 23% or $646.47 million.

For the full year a total revenue of $11 billion is expected for the company reflecting a decline of 4.1% from the year before. The revenues from Europe Africa and Middle East Latin America and Greater Asia are expected to make up 33.8% 13.1% and 23.6% of this total corresponding to $3.72 billion $1.44 billion and $2.59 billion respectively.

Key Takeaways

The dependency of International Flavors on global markets for its revenues presents a mix of potential gains and hazards. Thus monitoring the trends in its overseas revenues can be a key indicator for predicting the firm's future performance.

In an environment where global interconnections and geopolitical skirmishes are intensifying Wall Street analysts keep a keen eye on these trends particularly for firms with overseas operations to adjust their earnings predictions. Moreover a range of other aspects including how a company fares in its home country significantly affects these projections.

At Zacks we place significant importance on a company's evolving earnings outlook. This is based on empirical evidence demonstrating its strong influence on a stock's short -term price movements. Invariably there exists a positive relationship -- an upward revision in earnings estimates is typically mirrored by a rise in the stock price.

Boasting a remarkable track record that's been externally verified the Zacks Rank our unique stock rating system leverages changes in earnings projections to function as a reliable gauge for predicting short-term stock price movements.

International Flavors bearing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) is expected to mirror the broader market's movements in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The earnings report which is expected to be released on November 7 2022 might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand if they miss the stock may move lower.

While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.

Zacks Consensus Estimate

This ingredients producer for food cosmetics and consumer products industries is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.30 per share in its upcoming report which represents a year-over-year change of -11.6%.

Revenues are expected to be $3.03 billion down 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.

Estimate Revisions Trend

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.93% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for International Flavors?

For International Flavors the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.13%.

On the other hand the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.

So this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that International Flavors will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter it was expected that International Flavors would post earnings of $1.42 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.54 delivering a surprise of +8.45%.

Over the last four quarters the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

International Flavors doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

According to a snapshot of reservations on the books as of Dec. 15 hotel reservations for the week after Christmas easily beat last year’s totals. But the reservation numbers also beat those from the winter of 2019/2020 which was on pace to set economic records before the pandemic took hold in March.

The Chamber/Bureau’s report includes reservations made by Dec. 15 at 18 lodging properties in the area. The report says that around 90% of hotel rooms or more were reserved for each day starting Dec. 27 through New Year's Eve. That number peaks on Wednesday with 99% of rooms reserved.

Those numbers don't include last-minute travelers who made their plans after Dec. 15. Tourism officials have said that visitors during the pandemic have made arrangements closer to when they expect to travel rather than weeks or months in advance as they might have in previous years.

Last weekend the reservation numbers hovered around 80% roughly the same number as what’s on the books for the first few days of the Sundance Film Festival which starts Jan. 20.

Many of those who are in town already can be found on the streets and on the slopes.

Park City Mountain Resort owner Vail Resorts reported earlier this month that the number of season passes sold was up 47% compared to 2020 and up 76% compared to 2019.

It is unclear how many of those new passholders are coming to PCMR. Mike Goar the resort’s COO said on Wednesday that the resort has been “popular” as it always is on weekends and during the holiday season. He said on-mountain staffers are working to make it safe for the crowds to ski and ride.

“Patrol and mountain safety and our other employees are out monitoring guests and making sure we have extra people on the busier trails etc.” he said.

But with limited terrain open before the recent storms and the natural geography of the resort many riders are funneled into few runs especially at the end of the day. Goar said the crowds do not present a safety issue.

“Our ski instructors are fantastic about getting their classes getting their students through areas that sometimes are more congested than other portions of a ski slope” Goar said.

On Saturday PCMR reported 7 inches of snow had fallen in the previous two days with more in the forecast. 100 of its 348 trails were open as were 26 of its 43 lifts including the recent additions of the Quicksilver Gondola Iron Mountain Express and Timberline lift.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vbmljaGVnYW1lci5jb20vdmFsaGVpbS1tb3VudGFpbi1iaW9tZS11cGRhdGUtZWFybHktMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Valheim Mountain Biome Update Coming in Early 2022,"Coffee Stain Publishing and developer Iron Gate have released the final 2021 development blog confirming the Valheim mountain biome update is coming in early 2022.

While the much larger Mistlands biome is coming for awhile now the Valheim mountain biome update is coming early 2022 providing a smaller but more immediate chunk of new content.

Iron Gate notes in the dev blog that the Mountain biome update is getting “more and more complete” and that it is on track for a release sometime early next year.

Bradley W. Parks / OPB

Some students returning to in-person school this year hadn’t been in a physical classroom since March 2020. They were returning to new schools with new teachers and classmates all while dealing with the trauma of living through a pandemic.

Schools had to deal with a multitude of problems — from students struggling with mental health to academic gaps and behavior problems. In Portland Public Schools Oregon’s largest school district officials report increased fights and Title IX reports among staffing shortages and other problems exacerbated by the pandemic.

At the same time PPS has been increasing its emphasis on restorative justice through a plan implemented during the 2019-20 school year — the same year that was upended halfway through by the coronavirus pandemic. Restorative justice practices are used to deal with discipline and conflicts with a focus on building relationships and community as a way to repair harm as an alternative to punishment. In PPS the restorative justice team responds to race-based incidents “as needed.”

PPS officials are seeing an increase this year in requests for the district’s restorative justice services — as schools reach out for help responding to school conflicts through training prevention efforts or responsive practices to help build community.

“Last year…we may have had 40 requests for services for the whole school year” said Char Hutson the program manager for restorative justice at PPS.

“This year we’re close to 50 or 60 requests just for fall term.”

Despite the increased demand for the district’s restorative justice team staffing levels and lack of buy-in from administrators have created a patchwork of restorative justice across the district. Some schools have their own restorative justice staff members others rely on the district’s six-person team where each member is assigned to several schools.

Restorative justice response at Roseway Heights

At Northeast Portland’s Roseway Heights Middle School some students staged a walkout in November demonstrating against what they said was a lack of action from school staff and administrators to rein in a range of behavior problems from sexual harassment to racial slurs to violence. The walkout led to fights outside of the school. After that school staff received some training on restorative justice.

Daniel Jacobs teaches seventh grade social studies at Roseway Heights.

“We’re doing more introductory lessons on it and it’s been used… the biggest thing is being able to start helping build classroom community individually” Jacobs said.

“But… if we’re talking about really implementing it with fidelity it’s going to take a lot more time and a lot more resources and a lot more dedication from the district.”

After the walkout the district brought in additional staff and set aside time for more support for students. The district also mentioned prioritizing racial affinity groups and LGBTQ affinity groups for students to have safe spaces as well as a goal to increase BIPOC school staff.

But Jacobs said these and other changes come back to the need for more concrete changes at the school and district.

“Saying you’ve implemented something is only the first step it needs to be systematic it needs to be implemented with fidelity and it needs to have an actionable plan that can actually support students” Jacobs said.

Jacobs also connected these issues to current labor shortages facing PPS and districts around the state and country. When counselors and other non-classroom staff have to step in to substitute or cover for a teacher those staff are unable to provide support to students who need it.

As school administrators were dealing with the fallout from the walkout and fights Anh Le was hoping for a response to incidents that happened to another student group months before — at the same school. Le has a third grader at Rose City Park Elementary School but he’s connected to both Rose City Park and Roseway Heights through his role as co-president of Hội Phụ Huynh (HPH) the parent group connected to the district’s Vietnamese Dual-Language Immersion program. That program includes both Rose City Park and Roseway Heights.

That’s how Le learned that in September Roseway Heights students and staff in the VDLI program were called racial slurs.

“It broke my heart” Le said of hearing about what happened.

In the last two years increases in hate incidents directed at Asian-Americans prompted his group and parent groups at Rose City Park and Roseway Heights to have conversations about race and equity to make sure all students are respected.

“For our Asian kids we’re fighting another pandemic...some parents are just afraid to send their kids to school” Le said.

After the racist incident towards the VDLI students Le said parents weren’t immediately notified. During a meeting with school administrators Le said he felt administrators were trying to minimize what happened.

Le didn’t feel like administrators had the student take responsibility for their actions and he said a couple of weeks later a similar incident happened.

“Things happen but to me I see the failure of PPS from the administrative side” Le said. “You have to have a certain protocol when things happen...to protect our kids because we send our kids to school not to be abused.”

HPH requested a restorative justice process for parents and school administrators but months later he said the groups still haven’t met.

“We want them to be accountable for our kids and at the end of the day it benefits the whole community not only our kids because we are part of the community” Le said.

A message OPB sent to PPS officials late Thursday Dec. 23 wasn’t immediately returned.

Across the district there are inconsistencies when it comes to restorative justice efforts — both in who does the work and who asks for it.

81 schools 6 district staff assigned to restorative justice work

Hutson’s district-wide team of six restorative justice specialists cover all 81 schools in the district. They are assigned to cohorts of schools as part of school support teams under the district’s area senior directors.

“Because we have a lot of schools we have to create this system where it was somewhat manageable but realistically it’s not manageable” Hutson said.

Hutson said there aren’t enough specialists to go around but that the team is “strategic.”

In addition to those district specialists a few individual schools have school-based restorative justice coordinators. McDaniel High School with a student body of more than 1300 students and one school-based staffer dedicated to restorative justice is a model school Hutson said.

“There’s this value that the principal administration sees in this work” Hutson said. “Therefore they were able to manage their budget to hire an RJ coordinator for their school.”

Hutson said last year there were four other schools that had restorative justice specialists in-house.

With Roseway Heights Hutson said it was the coordinator at McDaniel High who helped out at the school after the incidents in November. But Hutson said McDaniel’s coordinator was in contact with the district specialist assigned to the school.

“We’re just waiting for the request” Hutson said. “We’re waiting to be asked to come in.”

That’s another wrinkle in PPS’ restorative justice system — school administrators have to ask for Hutson’s team’s help. That leads to a system where some schools might see more of Hutson’s team than others.

“Some schools will have more RJ support as far as the implementation work other schools won’t and it’s because although we’re managing all these schools we’re only responding as requested” Hutson said.

“So it’s not one of those things where it’s a mandated practice and there’s an actual budget and funding for a school to hire a coordinator.”

Whether an administrator “buys-in” to restorative justice might depend on how long they’ve been in the district. Hutson recalled a 2013 restorative justice training PPS administrators received through Resolutions Northwest. She said administrators who received that training or saw that training practiced in their school may be more likely to want to implement efforts in their school.

“So that buy-in was there” she said.

But not every current PPS administrator was around then.

For Hutson to manage the number of schools in the district there are a couple of categories schools fall under — and whether the district’s restorative justice practices are proactive or reactive to a specific incident.

Some schools are focus schools where the district restorative justice team has dedicated time over one year to provide coaching and training. The team members sit in on school climate meetings and prep the school on how to deploy restorative justice practices. Some schools develop peer-to-peer restorative justice groups and train students in mediation.

“Our focus schools are our schools where we are intentional in implementing RJ” Hutson said.

“That means we are focusing on prevention.”

The district currently has 10 “focus sites” this year.

The rest of the district is considered “responsive” schools. Those are schools that are expected to request the district’s restorative justice services through a screening tool.

At the same time difficult school conditions and challenging student behaviors this fall have turned focus schools into responsive schools.

“We still have to be reactive because of what’s happening right now with COVID and with distance and hybrid learning and kids not coming to school and the trauma from all of this” Hutson said.

For Rose City Park parent Le the school could be better at both preparing for and responding to race-based incidents.

“Based on what I’ve seen in my situation they are not proactive and they’re doing a horrible job at reactive” Le said.

Hutson said the influx of requests for services this year has shown her that school officials know the team is available and that her team has been effective at helping schools overcome conflicts.

But the district’s restorative justice team is spread thin. Hutson would love to see each school have its own restorative justice coordinator with partnerships between other organizations that work with students. She envisions a system that supports all students including those who have been pushed out by exclusionary punishment steps as well as those who want to expand their knowledge of restorative justice.

“So that we’re really shifting from this punitive way of how we respond to either discipline or how we respond to our students who do get suspended or expelled and need to reenter…” Hutson said.

“For me that vision is not just helping a student be accountable it’s supporting kids when they are pushed out and it’s supporting kids who want to come back and do RJ or take it to post-secondary education and experience.”

Before the pandemic Hutson said she started working to make her case and bring her vision to life. But similar to everything COVID-19 changed things. So until restorative justice is implemented and mandated district-wide Hutson is ready for calls from school administrators.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vamFsb3BuaWsuY29tL2Zvcm1lci1vbHltcGlhbi1taWdodC1oYXZlLXN0YWdlZC1hLXBsYW5lLWNyYXNoLWZvci12aWUtMTg0ODI3MjEzM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Olympian Might Have Staged A Plane Crash For Views,"From eating laundry detergent pods to entering the world of pay-per-view boxing bouts the ridiculous antics from clout-chasing YouTubers seem to know no bounds.

English view video Is The Subaru WRX The Most Fun Daily Driver For Under $30000?

The video in question was posted this week on the personal YouTube channel of Trevor Jacob and simply titled “I Crashed My Plane.” Jacob was a snowboarder on the US Olympic Team at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi Russia. Nowadays he operates Adventured. Adventured is an online platform where users can offer adventure experiences and services like learning to shoot with a Navy SEAL or skydiving with Trevor Jacob.

At the vlog’s start Trevor Jacob states that he’s going to fly a 1940 Taylorcraft to Mammoth Lakes California to paraglide snowboard and spread the ashes of Johnny Strange his late best friend. And it being YouTube he ends this opening statement with an impromptu endorsement for the video’s sponsor Ridge Wallet.

After a quick montage showing takeoff Jacob talks to the camera to give a quick update and flash Strange’s ashes on camera again. Shortly afterward the aircraft’s engine cuts out. He opens the door a few times seemingly contemplating jumping or not. Then he finally decides to leave the plane with a camera in hand.

The plane crashes into the terrain. Jacob lands in an area with thick brush and suffers a few minor cuts. Jacob hikes his way to the crash site and spends the rest of the day trying to get help. Eventually he’s able to flag down a couple of farmers driving a truck on a dirt road. The video concludes with Jacob driving to Mammoth days later where he finally scatters Johnny Strange’s ashes and goes paragliding.

I don’t have any experience as a pilot outside of Microsoft Flight Simulator so I’m not going to speculate if Jacob spent enough time looking for a place to land the plane. However a few weird things stand out in the video.

First Jacob is wearing a skydiving harness. Throughout the video he mentions that he never flies without a parachute. After Jacob lands collects himself and surveys his surroundings he says “Where the hell am I going to land a freaking plane? I’m gonna die. That’s why I always freaking fly with a parachute.” Justifying his decision to abandon the plane to himself and viewers. Though there are several other videos where Jacob is flying and not wearing a harness.

In one of tho se videos he describes narrowly avoiding a plane crash because his dog repeatedly jumped into his lap during a takeoff. Despite including footage of the plane lifting off the runway during the flight  the video doesn’t have any footage of his dog being aggressive or obstructive in the cockpit.

Second the 1940 Talyorcraft BL-65 is fitted with three cameras in the crash video. There is the cockpit camera that Trevor Jacob jumps with as well as cameras on the plane’s wing and tail. It seems strange to thoroughly document this routine flight to your own hometown.

Third why did Trevor Jacob begin the video with the flight? If the video was meant to honor Johnny Strange and scatter his ashes  why not begin filming at Mammoth? Coincidentally t he most-viewed video on Jacob’s channel in the past eight years is also about Johnny Strange.



Earlier this year Trevor Jacob posted a documentary-style video titled “My Best Friend Died BASE Jumping” that currently has over 2.8 million views . Johnny Strange was an accomplished adventurer who by the age of 17 climbed the Seven Summits the highest mountains on each of the seven continents. In 2015 Strange died at 23 years of age in a wingsuit jump accident in Switzerland. The video is a tribute to Strange but is framed around a visceral recounting of the fatal jump featuring eyewitness testimony and GoPro footage of the jump.

I can’t say whether or not if Trevor Jacob intentionally crashed a plane and tied it to the subject of his most-viewed video in almost a decade just to garner views. I just don’t want staging plane crashes to become the next viral trend on YouTube.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmaS5mci9lbi9hZnJpY2EvMjAyMTEyMjUtZGlzZ3JhY2VkLWV4LXByZXNpZGVudC1qYWNvYi16dW1hLXNwZW5kcy1jaHJpc3RtYXMtYXQtaG9tZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disgraced ex-president Jacob Zuma spends Christmas at home,"South Africa politics

This week Zuma was given leave to appeal a Pretoria High Court ruling that he return to jail because the medical parole granted him less than two months into his 15-month sentence for contempt of court was unlawful.

Zuma was jailed in July after refusing to give testimony to corruption investigators a ruling which sparked violent protests claiming over 350 lives.

For a man wearing a prisoner’s orange jump suit only five months ago former President Jacob Zuma now appears to have the wind in his sails.

Zuma is spending Christmas at his super-secure home Nkandla.

That security along with a number of luxury features were provided from the public purse during his nine-year presidency.

The gates to his residence were manned by veteran fighters of the liberation war against the apartheid regime and by personnel of the South African Police Service.

""Glorious years""

Supporters gathered there on Christmas Eve to celebrate what they call his ""glorious years at the helm.""

They say his presidency advanced the economic standing of black South Africans but complain that this trend is now being reversed.

His detractors within the party refer to his tenure as ""nine wasted years"" and maintain that much of the economic malaise can be ascribed to corruption that has become endemic within the ANC.

President Cyril Ramaphosa and the ruling party’s top echelon is considering a request by the ANC leadership in Zuma’s home province of KwaZulu/Natal to come out openly in support of the disgraced former president.

Proud father

Zuma also celebrated the election of his son Duduzane as chairperson the ANC branch in Durban possibly a first step on the way to become a Council president in the future.

WATCH: Former President Jacob Zuma congratulates his son Duduzane Zuma for being elected as chair of his branch in Durban. He told his son that ""we all started there"" and ""ended somewhere up."" This is in apparent reference to the fact that Duduzane wants to lead the ANC. @IOL pic.twitter.com/Uah9GSfOFf — Sihle Mavuso (@ZANewsFlash) December 21 2021

The Supreme Court of Appeal did not set a date for the next hearing.

It is expectd that Zuma's counsel will argue that the time he spent on medical parole will count as time served making him eligible for the ordinary parole prisoners may receive after serving a third of their sentence.

Kenvue said on Monday that Johnson & Johnson plans to offer its remaining stake in Kenvue over 189.3 million shares to Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan in exchange for its debt. The debt-for-equity exchange is worth about $3.75 billion based on Kenvue’s closing share price of $20.54 on Friday. The shares will then be sold by the banks.

Johnson & Johnson first announced that it was splitting its consumer health business into a standalone company in 2022 to focus on its pharmaceutical and medical device divisions. In May of 2023 Kenvue started trading independently on the New York Stock Exchange with Johnson & Johnson owning about 90% of its stock. Through the rest of the year Johnson & Johnson offloaded its stake in the new company in waves until it was left with just 9.5% of its shares.

After the deal Johnson & Johnson will not owe any stock in Kenvue. Kevnue produces and sells top brands like Tylenol Listerine Neutrogena Zyrtec and Band-Aid. In 2023 the company generated $15.4 billion in revenue.

The company had about 22000 employees by the end of 2023 according to its annual report. But it’s currently cutting 4% of its workforce or about 900 roles as part of a cost-reduction initiative meant to save the company $350 million.

Video Transcript

Let's talk about Ken View now Marine not as the dramatic of a move but again a move that is worth noting here up just about a half of a percent now.

The company on the move after Johnson and Johnson saying that's going to sell its remaining 9.5% stake in the company just a year after Johnson and Johnson spin off.

And Jem when you take a look at this move exactly what this means.

Ultimately here in the longer run we had the stock.

The stock had been under pressure ahead of the open year but now it looks like we are trading just slightly to the upside.

Yes this is a stock.

When it split off from from Excuse Me from Johnson and Johnson there were high expectations but it's pretty much sunk since that spin off.

Now this was an expected move.

J and J was expected to get rid of its remaining shares about 10% of the company 182.3 million and this is done through a secondary offering.

It's important to note that this is not that the company itself can view is not going to get any money from the sale.

Now I do have a market reaction by Bloomberg Intelligence here and you can see that's today's price action.

Let me just put a max chart so you can see what it's done since that first trade.

Not a lot of green there uh from inception.

But I do have this uh from Bloomberg Intelligence.

The exit of J JJ and J is 9.5%.

Can you stake uh via a debt for equity stock that enables leverage to be reduced as initially planned?

Removes share overhang.

So this was something that was already planned?

Um the fact that it has been executed.

Now just uh it's kind of like a potential share overhang that is in the rearview mirror and we'll have to see what comes of it.

Uh but here's another thing that uh intelligence is noting they're facing second quarter headwinds.

This is Ken View.

They have yet to prove execution fixes can reverse US market share losses.

And so the key to achieving growth growth with Sanofi's consumer health spin off next quarter.

Fourth quarter or later.

That's going to add competition as well.

So just lots of moving parts here in the in the biotech sector",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9kd2F5bmUtam9obnNvbi13aWZlLWxhdXJlbi1oYXNoaWFuLXNpbmctdG9nZXRoZXItbW90aGVycy1kYXktdmlkZW8tODY0Nzc3MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dwayne Johnson Wife Lauren Hashian Sing Together in Mother's Day Video,"Dwayne Johnson isn't the only one in his household with musical chops.

On May 12 the Moana actor shared a Mother's Day tribute to his wife Lauren Hashian alongside a video of the pair singing excerpts from two Sam Cooke tracks: ""Bring It On Home to Me"" and ""Nothin' Can Change This Love.""

""One human here is illuminated today on Mother’s Day because she is blessed from the heavens above with kindness empathy compassion beauty and an abundance of musical talents that can only be God given with the voice and harmonies of an angel — all while being the greatest mama in the world to our babies"" began Johnson 52.

""The other human here ruins songs by making up vulgar lyrics followed by a very sinful laugh while confidently singing in keys that don’t exist — and upon being questioned about song structure he’ll simply insist 'We make up the rules'"" he joked. ""And I’m quite sure there’s tequila in his energy drink can.""



""Happy Mother’s Day @laurenhashianofficial. Mimi & Aja too. #playitagainSAM 🥃"" Johnson concluded.

Johnson and Hashian began dating in 2007 and later welcomed daughters Jasmine 8 and Tiana 6 before going on to tie the knot in 2019. (The Jungle Cruise actor is also dad to 22-year-old daughter Simone Johnson with ex-wife Dany Garcia.)

Hashian who is a musician previously showed off her vocal talents last Thanksgiving when she joined Johnson and musician Eric Zayne for a little session at the piano.

In a clip shared by Johnson on Instagram Zayne played the piano as Hashian sat on a chair next to him and they both belted out the lyrics to Billy Joel's ""Just the Way You Are"" with the actor joining in as he leaned over the top of the grand instrument.

""A lil’ Thanksgiving tickling of the ivorys with the two beautiful voices and talents of @laurenhashianofficial & @ericzayne and me just making up lyrics to an all time classic @billyjoel"" Johnson wrote.



Hashian is equally fond of her ""amazing man"" having posted a sweet tribute to the actor earlier this month in honor of his birthday alongside a photo of Johnson holding their girls.

""I do not want to let this birthday go by without saying the gratitude I feel to spend each birthday with you just gets more special and more sentimental every year … to have so many years under our belts"" she began. ""And yet also feel so many new things are just beginning in our lives especially as our little girls are just taking this world by the reigns and making each day so FULL of Life! Discovery! Laughter! And Love!""

Hashian went on to thank Johnson ""for the endless blessings you bring to our world"" as well as for being their family's ""leader"" for his ""love"" for his ""desire for growth"" for his ""inspiration"" and for his ""big strong hugs.""

""Thank you for how you root us give us a beautiful foundation to stand on and keep us safe and warm in your energetic embrace. I LOVE YOU YSHSOAG! The day you were born is a true celebration!!! WE LOVE YOU!!!"" she concluded.

But Budowich argues in the suit filed Friday in United States District Court for the District of Columbia that he’s been cooperating with the committee and that he has been denied due process after not receiving a copy of the J.P. Morgan Chase subpoena or enough time to look over it according to Fox News.

“Mr. Budowich has not been afforded the opportunity to review the subpoena at issue in order to ascertain the extent or scope of information and records requested” his lawsuit says.

“Moreover the Select Committee has dispensed with all procedural rules failed to accord due process and neglected to provide formal notice” it continues.

Budowich already handed over “more than 1700 pages of documents” and “roughly four hours of sworn testimony” to the committee.

He told Fox News on Friday that included in the records he already provided to the committee were bank transactions and text messages connected to his consulting role with the group that promoted the rally.

While being deposed Budowich answered questions on “his involvement in the planning of a peaceful lawful rally to celebrate President Trump’s accomplishments” according to the suit.

Budowich was deposed by the committee on Wednesday in Washington DC. The same day mail from JPMorgan Chase was delivered to his California home notifying him the institution would be complying with the subpoena Fox News reported.

A spokesman for former President Trump said he has cooperated with the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol but is seeking to block his bank records from the panel.

Taylor Budowich - who according to his Twitter profile is the director of communications for Trump and his Save America PAC - revealed in a lawsuit filed Friday that he has provided the panel with more than 1700 pages of documents and has delivered roughly four hours of sworn testimony after being subpoenaed by the committee in November.

According to the panel's subpoena Budowich ""solicited a 501(c)(4) organization to conduct a social media and radio advertising campaign to encourage people to attend the rally on the Ellipse"" on Jan. 6 which was being held in support of Trump and his claims of election fraud.

The committee said it has a reason to believe that Budowich funneled roughly $200000 from one or several undisclosed sources to finance the campaign.

Budowich on Friday filed a lawsuit against the committee its members and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in an effort to block JPMorgan Chase from having to hand over his banking information to the committee as requested in a subpoena his bank received.

The Trump spokesman is claiming that the panel ""lacks the lawful authority to seek and to obtain"" the bank records contending that he will ""suffer irreparable harm by having a third party involuntarily produce his private and personal financial information.""

The lawsuit points to his cooperation with the committee as a reason his bank should not have to hand over his financial records.

It says the documents he provided to the committee were ""sufficient"" to identify transactions made between Dec. 19 2020 and Jan. 31 2021 in connection to the rally at the Ellipse.

The lawsuit also says Budowich answered questions at his deposition ""concerning payments made and received regarding his involvement in the planning of a peaceful lawful rally to celebrate President Trump's accomplishments.""

""Despite Mr. Budowich's continuing cooperation with the Select Committee upon arriving home from his deposition before the Select Committee in Washington D.C. Mr. Budowich had a notice from his bank that he had until 5:00 p.m. the next day Christmas Eve to respond"" the lawsuit reads.

""The Select Committee's deceptive tactics to ambush Mr. Budowich and deprive him of a meaningful opportunity to object to the production of personal financial records demonstrates a lack of good faith by the Select Committee"" the lawsuit continues.

The Trump spokesman also took issue with the timing of the bank subpoena. The lawsuit says he received a letter dated Dec. 21 from JPMorgan Chase on Dec. 23 at 7 p.m. Eastern time that said it was going to produce documents requested in the subpoena unless Budowich provided the bank with ""documentation legally obligated it to stop taking such steps"" by Dec. 24 at 5 p.m. Eastern time.

The lawsuit says the committee ""refused to extend the deadline for when JPMorgan could produce documents and Mr. Budowich could file this lawsuit to object"" despite the banks being closed nationwide for the holiday weekend.

""Government should not be a weapon that's freely used against political opponents and private citizens--but it seems like this Democrat-led Congress is intent on codifying that precedent"" Budowich said in a statement on Friday regarding the lawsuit.

He also claimed that the committee did not provide him or JPMorgan Chase with ""a copy of the actual contents of the subpoena.""

The Hill reached out to the select committee for comment.

Budowich is the latest individual to take legal action against the select committee. Far-right radio host Alex Jones and former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows have both filed lawsuits against the committee and Pelosi.

Trump sued the committee and the National Archives in October after President Biden waived executive privilege for Trump White House records the panel had requested for its investigation.

Akuapem Youth from the Eastern Region and Jasikan based Buem SC from the Oti Region were all present to showcase their talents while Serial Callers Association Marathon SC from Sakumono and Kotobabi CAC all took part. Ashaiman had Wanted FC from Tsinagbe and Zenu Ahotor Fun Club with Lashibi based Group FC and Lashibi United joining the home teams Klagon All Stars and Royal Sportive for the one-day event.

The host Klagon Royal Sportive emerged victorious on the day after beating Lashibi United 4-1 on penalties. Both teams played to a goalless draw in a end to end game on Saturday evening at the Klagon school park in Tema.

Royal Sportive and Lashibi United were both unbeaten throughout the competition and showed lots of quality to book their tickets to the final. The Champions could have buried the game in the first half after missing a few scoring chances that came their way.

Lashibi United grew stronger after the break but could not match the tactical prowess of Royal Sportive who kept misfiring. The game would finally be settled through spot kicks with Royal Sportive converting five while Lashibi United scored once. Buem SC finished third and were very unfortunate to lose on penalties to the Champions in the semi-final having dominated the game from the blast of the whistle.

As part of Ahotor FM’s Corporate social responsibilities the one-day event saw Royal Sportive’s young goalkeeper Joshua Lagah crowned the best player after his heroics in the semi-final and final having saved 4 penalties while Buem SC’ Daniel Opare was also adjudged the Most Discipline Player. All the 12 teams were presented with a set of jersey and football while the top three teams received extra jerseys each with two Footballs and cash prize for the Champions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5cG9zdC5jby51ay9uZXdzL25vcnRoLXdhbGVzLW5ld3MvZ2FsbGVyeS8yNi1wYXdlc29tZS1waG90b3MteW91ci1wZXRzLTIyNTY0ODU10gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHlwb3N0LmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvbm9ydGgtd2FsZXMtbmV3cy9nYWxsZXJ5LzI2LXBhd2Vzb21lLXBob3Rvcy15b3VyLXBldHMtMjI1NjQ4NTUuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,26 pawesome photos of your pets looking festive for Christmas Day,"Our pets are helping us to get into the festive spirit after what has been a difficult year for many people

Many people are in the festive spirit and ready to celebrate Christmas with their loved ones - for some for the first time in a long time due to the pandemic.

However the recent announcement of restrictions coming into force from Boxing Day has left many people feeling like a Grinch and fears surrounding the new ""highly transmittable"" Omicron Covid variant has left many older people feeling lonely this year.

But one thing remains the same our pets and their ability to put a smile on our faces and with the help of some festive decorations and cute costumes they're putting smiles on the faces of thousands of others out there.

From Tomato Sauce flavoured Simba Chips to trying to bring back Chocolate Log South Africans have had some bad food heartbreaks this year.

HP Sauce was also hard to find this year.

With alcohol bans to blame Marmite was also in short supply earlier in the year.

We may be right in the throes of the festive season but some South Africans may still be mourning the discontinuation of favourite food items that did not survive 2021 or food shortages they had to endure this year.

This year saw a number of leading snacks and treats go on the production line for a final time in South Africa while some were at times hard to find.

These are some of the food items that were discontinued this year or were in short supply.

The All Gold Tomato Simba Chips

Under the SaveYourFlavour hashtag this year chip makers PepsiCo which owns the Simba and Lays brands asked customers to choose their favourite flavour between three of their iconic ones; Cheese and Onion Salt & Vinegar and Tomato Sauce. Failing to get enough votes the Tomato Sauce flavour faced the cull. But it was not without many lamenting the loss.

So Nestle's Chocolate Log and Simba's All Gold Tomato Sauce flavour are going to be discontinued?I wish I could buy every favourite to keep them on the shelves but alas all things come to an end eventually. pic.twitter.com/fNX1bewCcY — Natalie (@NatAlleyCat) August 1 2021

This is how South Africans voted for their favourite flavour

1. Cheese and Onion: 539 298 | 4499%

2. Salt and Vinegar: 195 460 | 3700%

3. Tomato Sauce: 110 623 | 1801%

When the company confirmed its discontinuation of the Tomato Sauce flavour it said South Africans have changed their taste preferences over time and are moving away from sweet salty creamy and tangy favourites. It said customers are now moving towards braai flavours such as Shisanyama Chilli Biltong and Chakalaka.

In the same crisps category stock levels of Lays and Simba chips are currently low following frost damage to some potatoes. The harsh weather conditions this year caused a potato supply disruption that has left PepsiCo which owns Lays and Simba with limited capability to deliver some flavours and packet sizes.

""We experienced disruptions in our potato supply due to frost conditions affecting crop yields. Whilst those issues are largely behind us we were left with very low inventory levels entering peak season festive demand with constrained supply as a result"" John Stevenson senior vice president for South Africa foods & beverages at PepsiCo Sub-Saharan Africa told the Business Insider South Africa this week.

Chocolote Log

South African's hearts broke a second time when an attempt to bring back Chocolate Log flopped. South Africans are so obsessed with Nestle’s Chocolate Log that they drew up a petition to bring it back over a year since it was discontinued. In October Nestle said it took note of the petition and although it did not promise it would bring back the chocolate with a creamy marshmallow on a crisp wafer it always listens to its customers.

The petition demanded that Nestlé must return ""the GOAT of chocolate"" or greatest of all time because the world needs ""[t]he creaminess of the marshmallow stuffed with caramelized wafer all coated in glazed sweet chocolate"".

The HP Sauce

HP Sauce lovers had a tough year in 2021 after the much-loved UK condiment disappeared from shelves last year. This came following the end of a distribution contract between Kraft Heinz which owns HP sauce and PepsiCo-owned Pioneer Foods which held the licence to sell the sauce in the country.

Although retailer Pick n Pay managed to bring back the sauce it had scant supply of the product.

The popular brown sauce is named after London's Houses of Parliament. Every year 28 million bottles of the sauce are consumed. With a distinct taste the sauce is tomato-based with molasses and malt vinegar derived from barley.

A shortage of Marmite

Every time South Africa experiences a Marmite shortage it becomes clear just how much they love the the yeast-derived spread. Around June this year consumers reported that they could not find Marmite on shelves. It was not the first time customers had to face such a shortage. Last year supply grew thin too following alcohol bans that disrupted the supply of brewer's yeast from AB-Inbev. The spread is made from a concentrated extract from that byproduct of making beer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZ3VpbHR5ZWF0cy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNi9ncmVhdC1sdW5jaGFibGVzLXNob3J0YWdlLTIwMjEtZXhwbGFpbmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Great Lunchables Shortage of 2021 explained,Build a Trojan Horse out of Kabobbles and show us your horse-powered lunch! #BuiltToBeEaten pic.twitter.com/P4SIZyxn33,,,,,,,,,

Kroger may seem like a grocery chain that's too big too fail but could 2022 bring detrimental change to this food giant? September of 2021 saw the grocer's shares drop by 9.1% per Reuters. Executives have attributed wastage discounts and the global supply chain disruption to these falling numbers. ""Consistent with many retailers we experienced supply chain constraints and increased warehouse and transportation costs during the quarter"" Kroger chief financial officer Gary Millerchip said in a call with shareholders adding that higher supply-induced costs are expected to persist well into the new year.

Ronald Fong president of the California Grocers Association pointed to a different concern about grocery stores' futures in light of the closure of two Kroger-run stores in Long Beach California. Both stores per a city mandate had been obligated to pay workers an extra $4 an hour in ""hero pay"" during part of the pandemic (via Los Angeles Times). ""You are mandating a 30% raise essentially putting grocers in a position to make some difficult decisions"" Fong told the publication. ""Every single company is worried about this."" Kroger is one of multiple grocery chains that might not survive 2022 but the store's fate is of course not yet certain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsYWNrZW50ZXJwcmlzZS5jb20vYmlnLXJhdC1nb2VzLXZpcmFsLXBlZXJpbmctb3Zlci10dXJrZXlzLWluc2lkZS1hdGxhbnRhLWFyZWEta3JvZ2Vycy1tYXJrZXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big Rat Goes Viral Peering Over Turkeys Inside Atlanta Area Kroger's Market,"An employee at an Atlanta area Kroger’s supermarket took on a big rat who made its debut and hopped all over frozen turkeys and other trimmings in a refrigerated case.

According to the Daily Dot a TikToker named @dblack15 posted the now viral video with more than 5 million views of the infectious disease carrying rodent taking a peek at the frozen foods while perched on a freezer before diving in and jumping around apparently trying to find good food to gnaw on.

While the view for the rat was a good one with plump turkeys for the picking for the rest of us watching the video it’s revolting.

The rat jumped from case to case from turkeys to frozen meat all while an employee tried unsuccessfully to trap the rat in a trash can. Not sure that would even work but he gets an “A” for his effort to salvage the situation. With a fitting song called ‘Who Want Smoke?’ featuring G Herbo Lil Durk & 21 Savage playing on the video it’s safe to say that the damage is done since the video has gone viral.

A Kroger’s spokesperson has confirmed the location as 3479 Memorial Dr Decatur GA 30032.

Commenters had a field day giving their take on the situation.

“Publix would never” said one viewer.

“Nah he just works there inspecting the turkey to make sure they haven’t expired. He should ge a raise” quipped another.

Although viewers made light of the situation it certainly isn’t a laughing matter.

In fact just last month we reported that Ricardo Land a TikToker who posted a video of a herd of rats flooding the fast-food Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen chain at 409 8th St. SE in D.C.’s Eastern Market got fired from his delivery job for exposing the restaurant when some agile critters were seen creeping up a wall inside the kitchen.

Since the video took flight on social media the health department shut the facility down citing “health code violations.”

UPDATE: Kroger’s has reached out to BLACK ENTEPRISE with a statement on the matter.

“This video is disturbing and we have taken quick action to remediate the situation including thoroughly cleaning and sanitizing the store and partnering with a local pest company.” – Kroger Spokesperson",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9icml0aXNoLWNvbHVtYmlhL211c2hyb29tLWV4cGVydC0xLjYyODgyODPSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuNjI4ODI4Mw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How an amateur scientist became one of B.C.'s top wild mushroom experts,"The first thing you notice when spending time with Paul Kroeger is that very little escapes his eye.

From garbage on the street to a child's footprints embedded in concrete or plants and animals in and around his neighbourhood the 65-year-old Vancouver man notices it all.

""Something a lot of people are lacking is the power of observation"" he said. ""It's a great thing to be able to go anywhere and observe and interpret what you see and notice things.""

A lifetime of curiosity has led Kroeger a self-described citizen scientist to become one of the leading authorities on wild mushrooms in B.C. a place where there are at least 3000 species.

He's helped write numerous books on mushrooms and helps the province's poison control centre identify mushrooms that people have ingested. All this is from his unique ability to recognize mushrooms where they grow.

""I had enough of a personal interest in it and a drive and a liking for being alone in the woods"" he said. ""I put in a lot of field work and saw a heck of a lot of mushrooms so I began to recognize mushrooms so that there weren't that many other people that were at a similar ability.""

'We go to Paul'

""Fungiphiles"" like Kroeger are about as plentiful as the species themselves. Scientists have determined that fungi are more closely related to animals than plants. They can be hard to find look weird serve as delicious and nutrient-rich food and also play a critical role in ecosystem health.

""The diversity is mind-boggling"" said Shannon Berch a retired research scientist with the B.C. Ministry of Environment who has worked on several studies with Kroeger.

Berch says Kroeger's life-long passion means he has developed a deep knowledge of fungi making him a special citizen scientist.

""When professional mycologists have questions about the diversity of mushrooms here we go to Paul and we ask because he just has that encyclopedic knowledge"" she said.

Kroeger got hooked on searching for mushrooms and learning as much as he could about them when he moved to Vancouver in the early 1970s from Penticton with his parents and three siblings.

He grew up traipsing around the woods trying to identify plants and animals for fun but in Vancouver he was impressed with the size and abundance of mushrooms that he began coming across.

""When I came to the coast I was just blown away by how many mushrooms there were"" he said.

It's a fungi fiesta! 🍄<br>Today we are celebrating the official publication date of 'Mushrooms of British Columbia' by Andy MacKinnon and Kem Luther! Congrats to two very fungis..<br>Learn more and order here: <a href=""https://t.co/HaOmQz0JYY"">https://t.co/HaOmQz0JYY</a><br>Thank you and happy foraging! <a href=""https://t.co/EidqKtQNoa"">pic.twitter.com/EidqKtQNoa</a> —@RoyalBCMuseum

Kroeger bought mushroom field guides published by the Royal B.C. Museum and spent hours searching for the species out in the wild.

In 1979 the Mycological Society of Vancouver was formed and he became a prominent member organizing excursions and research projects among like-minded enthusiasts.

'People just love to search'

""One thing that's really appealing about mushrooms is a search function"" he said. ""People just love to search and that's why kids love Easter egg hunting hide and seek. I think we have an innate urge to seek.""

Despite lacking any formal post-secondary education Kroeger is a regular in UBC's botany department where he does lab research. He says he has made a living ""although not a terribly rich one"" by working on research projects and acting as a consultant.

""I sort of fell into being useful because I just happened to have the skill and the background to be able to recognize the mushrooms"" he said.

In recent years his name has been in the news most often accompanying stories about the rise in B.C. of the most poisonous mushroom in the world the so-called death cap mushroom. It's an invasive species that looks ordinary but can be fatal if ingested. One person in B.C. has died from the mushroom in the past five years.

B.C.'s poison control centre has used Kroeger as a consultant for decades to help identify samples sent in by people who are worried they their children or pets have ingested something dangerous.

Kroeger cautions people against eating wild mushrooms but is pleased that a new generation of mushroom seekers is eager to learn and is curious about finding them in the wild.

""It's a good thing to think of it as a great excuse to get outdoors and into really nice habitats"" he said.

""[To] really appreciate the natural world you have to have some inkling of its complexity and there's no better way to get that than to try and learn all the neighbouring organisms that are around you.""",,,,,,

While the last quarter of the year has been a very good one for stocks overall there hasn't been much holiday cheer for smaller companies.

As of December 21 with a handful of trading days left in 2021 the benchmark S&P 500 index has climbed 7.9% in the fourth quarter but the small-cap Russell 2000 has gained just 0.1%. The smaller and more economically-sensitive companies that make up the Russell 2000 index have been hit hard by fears about the new COVID-19 variant as well as projections of higher interest rates.

Congress is leading an investigation into Live Nation's role in the deadly Astroworld Festival tragedy that occurred at NRG Park in Houston on Nov. 5.

HOUSTON -- The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform announced Wednesday it is leading an investigation into Live Nation's role in the deadly Astroworld Festival tragedy that occurred at NRG Park in Houston on Nov. 5.

A letter was sent to the president and chief executive officer of Live Nation Michael Rapino requesting information regarding the tragic events that resulted in the deaths of 10 concertgoers.

RELATED: Astroworld Festival victims' deaths ruled as accident due to asphyxiation medical examiner finds

""This a horrifying way to die and absolutely preventable. Their families and our community deserve answers to make sure this never happens again"" said Congressman Kevin Brady. ""I pushed for this Congressional investigation to hold the concert promoters and organizers accountable identify the causes and make sure families no longer have to wonder if their child friend or loved one will come back from a concert alive.""

""Live Nation Entertainment was the concert promoter reportedly responsible for 'planning staffing putting up money securing permits finding vendors communicating with local agencies' for Astroworld Festival"" said the letter signed by Reps. Carolyn B. Maloney James Comer Kevin Brady Al Green and Bill Pascrell Jr.

According to reports rapper Travis Scott took the stage at 9 p.m. and approximately 20 minutes later medical staff responded to the first reports of injuries.

""Recent reports raise serious concerns about whether your company took adequate steps to ensure the safety of the 50000 concertgoers who attended Astroworld Festival"" the representatives wrote. ""For instance reports indicate that security and medical staff were inexperienced or ill-equipped to deal with mass injuries. Some attendees stated that the placement of barricades made it difficult to escape. Experts have stated that Astroworld Festival organizers failed to heed warning signs.""

The House oversight committee asked that the information regarding the roles and responsibilities for the festival security planning and the steps Live Nation took after being made aware that law enforcement had declared the event a ""mass casualty"" be released by Jan. 7 2022.

Live Nation released the following statement Wednesday afternoon:

""We are assisting local authorities in their investigation and will of course share information with the Committee as well. Safety is core to live events and Live Nation engages in detailed security planning in coordination with local stakeholders including law enforcement fire and EMT professionals. We are heartbroken by the events at Astroworld and our deepest sympathies go out to the families and friends of the victims.""

WATCH: 'Got to get out' Witness recalls trying to stop Astroworld show

'We got to get out of here.' Ayden Cruz is one of the people seen trying to stop the Astroworld show. He describes the harrowing things he saw.

Scott's attorney Ed McPherson gave ABC Houston affiliate KTRK an interview back in November saying the Astroworld production team would have ""absolutely"" stopped the show had the Houston Police Department requested it.

McPherson also said that Scott could not really see what was taking place past the stage. In the interview McPherson pointed out that performers have music and producers in their earpieces. In addition stage lighting makes it almost impossible for performers to see into a darkened audience arena.

""We are deeply saddened by the deaths that occurred at Astroworld Festival and are committed to investigating what went wrong to inform possible reforms that could prevent future tragedies"" the representatives said of the investigation.

On Dec. 9 Scott sat down with radio and TV personality Charlamagne Tha God and gave his first interview regarding the tragedy.

Scott has maintained that he did not know about the fatalities or injuries at the time.

He was asked minutes into the nearly one-hour long interview when he knew that things went horribly wrong.

""It wasn't really until minutes into the press conference that I found out exactly what happened. Even after the show you're just hearing things"" Scott began. ""But I didn't know the exact details until minutes before the press conference. And even at the moment you're like 'Wait. What?'"" Scott continued. ""You just went through something and it's like 'What?'""

""So you didn't know people had actually passed away?"" Charlamagne asked.

""No. Until minutes before"" Scott said. ""The thing is people pass out. Things happen at concerts. But something like that. It's just like...""

WATCH: Travis Scott says he never heard fans' screams for help

Travis Scott spoke for the first time on the Astroworld Festival tragedy that killed 10 of his fans in an interview with Charlamagne Tha God.

Houston police officers and firefighters responded to reports of a ""mass casualty event"" by 9:38 p.m. according to HFD Chief Sam Pena.

The concert however continued until Live Nation stopped it at about 10:10 p.m.

The tragedy at Astroworld Festival follows a long line of other tragic events and safety violations involving Live Nation. Live Nation has been fined or sued numerous times over safety issues at previous events including other incidents involving surging fans or stampedes.

Not only does Scott face hundreds of lawsuits but production on his hard seltzer line has been put on hold for now according to Scott's partner Anheuser-Busch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudWVzbm93LmNvbS9oYWxsLW9mLWhvbm9yLTIwMjEtamltbXkta29wbGlrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hall Of Honor 2021: Jimmy Koplik,"Start Me Up: Jimmy Koplik at the time vice president of Delsener/Slater Enterprises announces the Rolling Stones’ “No Security” tour date for the Hartford Civic Center which they played March 28 1999.

Connecticut Nice

Veteran concert promoter Jimmy Koplik always kills them with kindness

Jimmy Koplik braced himself for the punch. It was the 1980s and Koplik the veteran concert promoter was chatting with Graham Nash backstage before a Crosby Stills & Nash show in Springfield Massachusetts.

David Crosby appeared in the dressing room recognized Koplik and charged at him.

“I was sitting there talking with Graham one of the nicest human beings who ever lived” Koplik said. “Thankfully he got between us to stop it. I was never going to hit David Crosby. You don’t hit an artist; you’ll be out of the business. I was just going to cower and take whatever beating I was going to get.”

It’s one of many colorful stories shared by Koplik one of the true pioneers among concert promoters. He’s part of the 2021 class of the VenuesNow Hall of Honor our publication’s version of a lifetime achievement award in the live entertainment industry.

See: VenuesNow 2021 Hall Of Honor

The backstory with David Crosby is that he never forgot about Summer Jam West a show set for Aug. 3 1974 at Ontario (California) Motor Speedway. Crosby Stills Nash & Young was to headline a blockbuster bill with The Beach Boys Joe Walsh Jesse Colin Young and The Band but the show was canceled.

Long story short Neil Young was hanging out in England with actress Carrie Snodgress his girlfriend at the time and he didn’t want to come back to the U.S. to play the gig. Everyone knows CSN is a totally different group than CSNY. Koplik promoting the show with Shelly Finkel his business partner at the time scrapped the event. To recoup their investment they sued all four members of CSNY for $50000 apiece a lot of money in those days.

They all paid up except for Crosby whose argument was that he was willing to perform at the racetrack and shouldn’t have to reimburse the promoters.

“We never really patched things up” said Koplik now president of Live Nation Connecticut and Upstate New York.

The Crosby incident stands out because those who know him best never had a cross word to say about Koplik over his 53 years in the business. He may be the nicest concert promoter who ever lived. Call it Connecticut Nice for the longtime state resident.

“Jimmy is a lovely human being” said Jonny Podell a former agent who booked every Allman Brothers Band show over their 45 years as a touring act. Koplik a huge fan of the group promoted 57 of those dates. “He always gave you an honest conversation. There were plenty of times I would call Jimmy and say ‘I’ve got this show here’s the price what do you think?’ (He’d say) ‘Nah I don’t think it’s gonna happen Jonny.”

“He was able to do that without me getting cantankerous because I didn’t like to be told no” Podell said. “He knew his market. That’s how he’s still thriving after all these years in this business. He’s able to say no and he’s usually right.”

Koplik 72 has thrived long enough to promote roughly 15000 concerts since the late 1960s. It’s a mind-boggling number and just a guess he said. All told his longevity passion for live music and a steady demeanor have paid off for “Mr. Connecticut” as he’s affectionately known in the industry.

He’s long overdue for recognition said the colleagues Koplik has worked with spanning seven decades.

“Jim is a legend and a visionary who always put the artist’s interests first” said Don Law a legendary promoter himself in Boston. “He’s been an enormously popular figure in the music business.”

Rob Light Creative Artists Agency’s managing partner worldwide chief and head of the music department met Koplik in the late ‘70s when Koplik promoted shows at Toad’s Place the iconic club in New Haven Connecticut.

At the time Light had just started as an agent with ICM and drove up to New Haven a lot to cover shows.

“The first thing I noticed about him and he’s never lost it is he was a music lover first and a businessman second” Light said. “I’m the same way and felt a kinship toward him. When you start as a music fan and then make it your business you have a foot up on everybody else.”

His colleagues point to Koplik’s even keel. He’s a mild-mannered person entrenched in a volatile business fraught with clashing egos and one-upmanship over deal points between agents artists and promoters taking risk.

“From all the time I was an agent in the Northeast which was 25 years I don’t ever remember ever having a fight or either of us raising our voice in a conversation” Light said. “I can promise you that’s not true of many promoters.”

Those positive traits go a long way said John Huie an agent with CAA Nashville. “Jimmy has it in spades” he said.

Charlie Brusco’s relationship with Koplik goes back to 1975. Brusco an artist manager with Red Light Management in Atlanta remembers Koplik helping him build the career of The Outlaws when they broke through nationally in part through his strong relationships with FM radio stations such as the old WPLJ in New York that bled into Connecticut.

At the time Brusco was their manager.

“Jimmy’s been a solid guy in a business where it’s tough to remain that way” Brusco said. “He was one of those guys that made you feel good about being on the road and on his home turf. The minute I told an artist it was a Jimmy Koplik show smiles would come over their faces.”

In turn Koplik always has a smile on his face to prove his point with kindness said fellow promoter Louis Messina president and CEO of Messina Touring Group/AEG Presents.

Koplik and Finkel played supporting roles as co-promoters with Messina when he was held hostage by some wiseguys financing a 1974 Led Zeppelin concert in West Palm Beach Florida. But that’s another story.

“Jimmy’s such a gentleman” Messina said. “He’s Clark Kent.”

Koplik may be the man of steel but on occasion he’s been felled by kryptonite.

Over the course of his lengthy career Koplik has experienced many profitable events and some noteworthy flops. Take the first show he promoted for example as an Ohio State University student in Columbus Ohio.

In the summer of 1968 Koplik was head of Students for Kennedy for the state of Ohio a group stumping for presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy. He set up bus rides to Indiana and Kentucky for Democratic primaries.

After RFK’s assassination Koplik and Jerry Lemler his best friend from high school took a giant leap. Lemler went to college in Tennessee and knowing Koplik’s love for rock music he suggested they become concert promoters.

“He had a much bigger set of balls than I did but it sounded like fun” Koplik said.

Back then the concert biz was wide open and ripe for young entrepreneurs like Koplik to carve a niche in the business. The only agency he had ever heard of was William Morris so he went to New York and met with a young agent named David Krebs who went on to manage Aerosmith and AC/DC.

“He sold me Steppenwolf” Koplik said. “It was a $3500 guarantee. I remember it well. I went home and sold my bar mitzvah stock which was AT&T at the time put up the deposit and did my first concert.”

The late 1968 show at Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Columbus marked Koplik’s first important business lesson taught by brothers Michael and Jules Belkin a pair of savvy Cleveland promoters.

“Magic Carpet Ride” Steppenwolf’s second single was out at the time and would peak at No. 3 on Billboard’s pop chart. Koplik saw dollar signs and thought he would make a lot of money.

As it turns out that wasn’t the case.

“They tried to destroy me right away by putting The Doors in for two shows the next day (at the same venue) and Peter Paul & Mary who were big at the time for the following day” he said. “What should have been a sellout became a break-even show.”

*****

After licking their wounds Koplik and Lemler signed a deal with the Belkins to co-promote shows for three years in Columbus.

The die was cast. Koplik eventually plunged into concert promotion as a full-time job.

There were some forks in the road along the way.

Koplik grew up in Westchester County New York and planned to be a dentist like his father. In the 1960s Ben Koplik was a “Park Avenue dentist” in New York City with a star-studded list of patients that included Broadway actors Liza Minnelli Robert Morse and Charles Nelson Reilly.

Ben also served as team dentist for the NFL’s New York Jets. As a teenager Jimmy got to sit on the Jets bench for home games at Shea Stadium and rub elbows with the likes of future Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Namath.

“I was aware of the entertainment world at a very young age but it had nothing to do with why I went into the business” Koplik said. “My love of rock music is really how I got started. I became a music fanatic in 1964 when the Beatles came out.”

Ben told Jimmy he would always have a space reserved in his office for when Jimmy became a full-time dentist.

Jimmy completed 37 of the 40 required hours of science courses but he couldn’t get past organic chemistry and gave up on becoming a dentist. He turned to pre-law and it was during that period he began promoting concerts.

Koplik’s career took off after partnering with Finkel in the early ‘70s. Up to that point they had been competitors in Connecticut. After one year of juggling law school with his side job Koplik became a full-time promoter.

Together Koplik and Finkel produced the biggest concert in U.S. history the 1973 Summer Jam at Watkins Glen that drew an estimated 600000 at the New York racetrack.

The two were partners for more than 25 years before selling their business to SFX Entertainment in 1998 as part of the consolidation of regional promoters into one entity that evolved into Live Nation.

“I have two philosophies of friendship and they seem to have stood the test of time” Finkel said. “One over time you know who your friends are; and two when your back’s to the wall do you two stick together? Those two criteria for Jim and I come up with aces.”

*****

These days Koplik still books a few shows in Connecticut including the new Hartford HealthCare Amphitheater the retrofit of a minor league ballpark in Bridgeport (see sidebar). His son Jeremy handles most of those responsibilities out of Live Nation’s Connecticut office at the Toyota Oakdale Theatre in Wallingford.

“We have a deal; if the artist is over 70 years old I get to book it” Jimmy said. “If they’re under 70 he books it. I was disappointed to see that Kevin Cronin was only 69 so he promoted REO Speedwagon last summer the opening show in Bridgeport.”

Jeremy has been with Live Nation for 20 years after working there part-time as a college student. The younger Koplik set his sights at an early age on being a promoter. He grew up hanging out backstage at concerts and those experiences became a part of his daily life.

“At my bar mitzvah I remember there was a video asking me what I want to do when I grow up and I said ‘I want to take over my dad’s company and fire him’” he joked. “It’s not even a business so to speak. It’s what I’ve known.”

Jeremy competes hard as a promoter to get the best deal and doesn’t accept agreements so easily Jimmy said.

“Jeremy really has moved the business up much better than I could have” he said. “He loves it. You’ve got to live the business and he does. He’s a better booker than me; he does better deals than I would make.”

Looking ahead Jimmy Koplik still loves what he does and enjoys watching Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino continue to reshape the concert industry. He points to Rapino building business that doesn’t rely solely on ticket sales. It’s expanded to premium seats sponsorships and the exploding non-fungible ticket technology Koplik said.

“It’s not the same business I grew up in” he said. “I study what Michael does; he’s brilliant. I’ve got another year and a half on my contract and if I’m lucky enough and still want to do it and if Michael’s OK with it I want to stay involved.”

In 2020 the arena was ranked No. 45.

The ranking – which does not include sporting events - covers the period from mid-November 2020 through mid-November 2021. Arenas – like many venues and stadiums – did not host games and events as a result of coronavirus pandemic restrictions many of which went into effect in March 2020. The first major ticketed event at the arena since the beginning of the pandemic came on July 23 2021 when WWE Friday Night SmackDown came to town.

The magazine’s ranking is by tickets sold. Gross amounts range widely depending on the specific shows being held. Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse sold 117383 tickets for shows during the period evaluated which covered about 20 events – though several were free.

This month Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse has 21 dates with scheduled events – 15 were hockey and NBA games while six included family events concerts and a comedy show. Barring Covid cancelations or postponements the Harlem Globetrotters are scheduled for two games Tuesday Dec. 28 and Trans-Siberian Orchestra is set to play Thursday Dec. 30.

The first big event scheduled in the arena in 2022 is Disney on Ice set for Jan. 7-16.

Bridgestone Arena in Nashville topped the ranking with 336227 tickets sold.

Ten people died after a crowd surge at Jenner’s longtime boyfriend Travis Scott’s Astroworld Music Festival in Houston Texas. The ""Sicko Mode"" rapper has faced a lot of backlash in recent weeks for not stopping the show as the situation in the crowd became deadly. Jenner and her sister Kendall were reportedly there at the time. However both he and Jenner who are expecting their second child together noted in the past that he was completely unaware of how bad things had gotten in the crowd from his vantage point on the stage.

On Christmas Eve the Kylie Cosmetics CEO shared an image of her mom Kris Jenner clad in a red gown for Christmas. The image is the same one that Kris used to promote her latest cover of ""Jingle Bells"" which she did in conjunction with daughter Kourtney Kardashian and her fiance Travis Barker.

TRAVIS SCOTT HIT WITH LAWSUIT BY FAMILY OF 14-YEAR-OLD KILLED AT ASTROWORLD

""merry christmas eve"" Kylie captioned the image of her mom from what appears to be the 1980s.

The post promoting her mom and sister’s work marks the first time she’s posted since the Astroworld tragedy. Meanwhile Scott continues to deal with the consequences of the concert. In addition to being the subject of several lawsuits stemming from the victims of the incident it was announced earlier this month that a Congressional committee is launching an investigation into what happened at the festival.

The House Oversight and Reform Committee sent a letter Wednesday to Live Nation Entertainment Inc.'s president and CEO Michael Rapino asking for information about the company’s role in the music festival specifically Scott’s performance that resulted in the death of 10 people.

Webb's primary imager will help it see some of the oldest light in the universe.

KOUROU French Guiana Dec. 25 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- With the liftoff of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope from French Guiana today humankind is one step closer to seeing the universe in a whole new light with help from a camera built by Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT]. The instrument will be key in giving the telescope its first glimpse of celestial light.

The Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) is Webb's primary imager and one of the most sensitive infrared cameras ever built. As the telescope sets itself up in space NIRCam will help align Webb's intricate array of mirrors. It will then take science images throughout the entire mission.

""NIRCam's journey is over two decades in the making and seeing it lift off into space on Webb was the culmination of many years of hard work with Marcia Rieke and our University of Arizona partners"" said Alison Nordt Lockheed Martin's space science and instrumentation director who led development of NIRCam. ""Webb will rewrite the science books of how we understand our universe and to have Lockheed Martin-built technology help advance the future of space imaging is an honor.""

The Lockheed Martin and University of Arizona team designed built and tested NIRCam out of the company's Advanced Technology Center in Palo Alto California.

How to Look at the Universe's Oldest Light

Webb is designed to peer at the universe's oldest light which scientists believe occurred around 13.5 billion years ago. As the universe expands those light waves that were once visible have now shifted into the infrared spectrum.

This light is incredibly far away and extremely dim which is why Webb requires large mirrors – along with NIRCam's ultra-precise optics – to see it.

Before that can happen NIRCam's first job is to sense incoming infrared light and take images that will help the telescope's systems properly align its 18 primary mirror segments. This is critical to ensuring Webb provides crystal clear images once it enters science mode.

The Technology Behind NIRCam

For Webb's mirror alignment in early 2022 NIRCam senses what's called a ""wavefront"" or an ideally perfect sphere of light particles emitted from any luminescent object. When those particles encounter another object – in this case the telescope's optics – they become distorted.

NIRCam measures those distortions with nanometric accuracy and that data is then used to advise how Webb's mirrors must adjust. This iterative process is done until the telescope's mirrors are properly aligned.

With Webb traveling more than 1 million miles from Earth into space NIRCam must function with extreme precision and stability in temperatures as cold as -400°F. In fact the telescope needs frigid temperatures to ensure infrared radiating off the observatory doesn't overwhelm the images.

To enable operations in such extreme conditions Lockheed Martin developed a new technique for bonding NIRCam's optical lenses to their mounts. The innovative method ensures the cold and launch vibrations don't cause shifts in alignment of NIRCam's lenses.

After more than a decade of meticulous engineering and rigorous testing the team delivered one of the most capable infrared instruments ever created and NIRCam was fully integrated onto Webb in 2014.

Now the telescope gets situated for a decade of ground-breaking observations to shape how we see space for years to come.

More About the Mission

The Webb Space Telescope is the world's newest premier space science observatory. It will solve mysteries in our solar system look beyond to distant worlds around other stars and probe the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it. Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners – the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency – and industry participation from many companies including Lockheed Martin.

The silhouette of the supersonic jet is enveloped in blue plastic and attached tail first aboard a large trailer bed in Marana Arizona according to images taken by Aldo Boccaccio and published by The Drive.

Skunk Works' X-59 quiet supersonic testbed jet spotted on a trailer heading to Texas:https://t.co/iZdnLYguqg — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) December 23 2021

The X-59 QueSST is an experimental aircraft that is being developed by Lockheed Martin for the American space agency NASA. Lockheed Martin was awarded the contract to develop a quiet supersonic plane in 2016 since then the project has made significant development.

Skunk Work’s facility at the United States Air Force’s Plant 42 in Palmdale California has been working on the plane since 2018.

The current plan is to transport the X-59 to Lockheed Martin’s Texas plant which is famed for housing the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter production line for structural testing before returning it to Palmdale for the initial round of flight testing.

As EurAsian Times previously reported the disruptive noise and trembling produced by planes flying faster than the speed of sound are still major roadblocks to commercial supersonic aircraft. Although the sonic boom is only experienced briefly it is really produced indefinitely as long as the aircraft is flying at supersonic speeds.

Depending on when the supersonic plane passes through the region various people will hear the thunderous impact at different times and at different points along the flight path. As a result the United States and a number of other countries have put a ban on such flights in their air space.

The X-59 and the QueSST program’s objective is to examine the technology that could greatly decrease the sound and felt impact of sonic booms on planes traveling faster than the speed of sound as the name implies.

X-59 QueSST Design

The X-59 is an innovative design that makes extensive use of components from other Lockheed Martin aircraft in order to keep the design as basic and low-cost as possible.

“Landing gear from an Air Force F-16 fighter a cockpit canopy from a NASA T-38 trainer a propulsion system part from a U-2 spy plane and a control stick from an F-117 stealth fighter is among the repurposed parts to be used on NASA’s newest airplane” according to NASA.

The X-59’s structure according to Lockheed Martin would considerably reduce the decibel level of a sonic boom reaching the ground. The plane will take to the skies as part of a mission to gather data on silent supersonic flight and evaluate public reaction to supersonic “thumps.”

The success of this concept could pave the way for commercial supersonic flights which would substantially reduce the amount of time it takes to travel long distances.

The firm’s demonstrator model is a single-engine plane with a length of 28.7 meters and a wingspan of 9 meters. The plane has an extended nose that reduces noise levels. The X-59 is driven by F414-GE-100 turbofan engines that were specifically designed to be used on the plane.

By 2025 the plane is projected to meet International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) requirements. The pandemic however has caused delays in the project The EuraAsian Times had earlier reported.

Representatives from Skunk Works claimed earlier this year that just about 10% of the design is completely new. At the same time the company further stated that this plane was used to test new sophisticated manufacturing techniques such as the large single-piece composite skins on the wings.

One of the more remarkable aspects of the design is the pilot’s total absence of forward sight. Rather the X-59’s pilot will employ a remote vision system known as the eXternal Vision System (XVS) to “see” through feeds from an array of forward-facing high-resolution cameras.

This design enables the aircraft’s complete front end to be more tuned for sonic-boom-mitigating supersonic flying.

Development Timeline

In February 2016 NASA awarded Skunk Works a Lockheed Martin division a $247.5 million contract for a preliminary design of the X-59. The goal was to have the plane pre-designed by 2020 and delivered by 2021.

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic however had caused the flight testing to be delayed.

Skunk Works was chosen in April 2018 to develop build and test the X-59 and in November of that year the first parts for the X-59 began to be manufactured. The study findings and concept for the quiet supersonic passenger airliner were presented in June 2019. NASA and Skunk Works concluded the critical design evaluation for the X-59 in September of that year.

Additionally the airplane was lifted away from the jig support system in late October of this year. This technology which works similarly to scaffolding ensures that all of the aircraft’s hardware is correctly installed during the production process.

According to NASA’s official timeline the X-59 will make its first flight by next year. Initial flight testing is projected to last nine months and stretch into 2023. The initial flight testing will demonstrate things like the basic airworthiness of the aircraft.

During the Community Response Study phase which will occur between 2024 and 2026 and include flights over numerous American cities the public will be asked for feedback. People on the ground will be notified of X-59 flights via push notifications and reactions will be collected.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3Qvd291bGQtY2hpbmFzLWotMjAtb3ItcnVzc2lhcy1zdS01Ny1maWdodGVyLXdpbi1kb2dmaWdodC0xOTg0MzfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Would China's J-20 or Russia's Su-57 Fighter Win a Dogfight?,"While the Su-57 has excellent aerodynamic design the Russian jet is far less stealthy than the Chinese Chengdu J-20 let alone American stealth aircraft such as the F-22 or the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. While neither the J-20 nor the Su-57 is particularly stealthy compared to American fifth-generation fighters the Chinese aircraft places more emphasis of radar cross-section reduction measures than the Russian jet.

In terms of sensors it is unclear which aircraft is more advanced—it is clear however that the Russians and Chinese have completely different concepts of operation. The Su-57 was never designed as a genuine stealth aircraft and has a sensor suite designed to neutralize Western stealth aircraft. The Russians are hoping the Su-57’s sensor suite—which includes N036L-1-01 L-band radar arrays—will alert its pilots to the general vicinity of enemy fifth-generation stealth fighters such as the Raptor.

Russia and China are both developing next-generation fifth-generation fighters as they struggle to challenge American dominance of the international system. However the two great powers are taking somewhat differing approaches to developing these new next generation machines. Those differences are driven by a number of factors including threat perceptions and requirements as well as access to technology and financial resources.

In terms of overall kinematic performance the Su-57 is likely a superior performer compared to the Chinese J-20. With its three-dimensional thrust-vectoring capability and ample thrust the Su-57 is likely to have excellent low speed high angle of attack maneuverability even with the current Saturn AL-41F1 afterburning turbofans which are rated at 32500lbs thrust each. The Russian jet should also have very good supersonic performance—with some degree of supersonic cruise capability even with the current AL-41F1 engines. However once the Su-57 receives its second stage Saturn izdeliye 30 engines which are expected to deliver roughly 28000lbs of dry thrust and 42000lbs of afterburning thrust the PAK-FA should be able to achieve kinematic performance—including supersonic cruise and maneuverability—roughly on par with the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. Indeed as one now retired military official with extensive fifth-generation fighter experience had told me sometime ago: “Performance-wise it certainly looks to compete with the Raptor.”

While the Su-57 has excellent aerodynamic design the Russian jet is far less stealthy than the Chinese Chengdu J-20 let alone American stealth aircraft such as the F-22 or the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. While neither the J-20 nor the Su-57 is particularly stealthy compared to American fifth-generation fighters the Chinese aircraft places more emphasis of radar cross-section reduction measures than the Russian jet. The Su-57 has numerous obvious radar cross section hotspots including its rounded electro-optical sensor ball—which shows no effort at faceting—its moveable leading edge root extensions where the leading edge flaps meet the outboard portion of the wing its engine inlet design and a host of other problem areas. In short the Russians consciously chose not to emphasize stealth in the Su-57 design.

By comparison the J-20—which seems to have been heavily based on F-22 and F-35 technology—makes much more of an effort at especially frontal radar cross-section reduction. While some analysts make the spurious argument that canards are not compatible with stealth there are plenty of American stealth aircraft concepts and technology demonstrators that have use such aerodynamic features including Northrop Grumman’s proposal for the Naval Advanced Tactical Fighter and Lockheed Martin own early Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) —which eventually evolved into the F-35—development work. That being said the J-20 does have some obvious radar cross-section hotspots particularly toward the rear of the airframe.

Nonetheless the Chinese have incorporated advanced stealth features such as faceting for the J-20’s electro-optical/infrared targeting sensor (EOTS) housing—liberally borrowing concepts from the F-35. Moreover the J-20 also similarly works to conceal its electro-optical/infrared distributed aperture sensors (DAS)/missile warning system (MWS) in a similar manner to the F-22 and F-35 designs. The Chinese jet also incorporates F-35-style diverterless inlets which somewhat compromise aerodynamic performance but are more conducive to stealth and ease of manufacture and maintenance. Overall the Chinese J-20’s airframe shaping is far more conducive to stealth than the Su-57 air vehicle design.

The Chinese aircraft likely falls well behind the Su-57 in terms of raw kinematic performance—both in terms of maneuverability and high-speed supersonic performance. The problem the Chinese face is that Beijing lacks a jet engine that can adequately power the J-20. Right now the J-20 seems to be powered by the Russian-made Salyut AL-31FN engines which provide roughly 32500lbs of afterburning thrust each. However some reports suggest that the Chinese are fitting early production J-20 aircraft with Chinese-developed thrust vectoring WS-10G copies of the AL-31FN. A more powerful and suitable indigenous 40000lbs thrust class WS-15 is under development but it is not clear when the Chinese will be able to consistently mass produce that engine. Theoretically with the new engine the J-20 should be able to cruise supersonically—but even then it will probably lack the Su-57 maneuverability.

In terms of sensors it is unclear which aircraft is more advanced—it is clear however that the Russians and Chinese have completely different concepts of operation. The Su-57 was never designed as a genuine stealth aircraft and has a sensor suite designed to neutralize Western stealth aircraft. The Russians are hoping the Su-57’s sensor suite—which includes N036L-1-01 L-band radar arrays—will alert its pilots to the general vicinity of enemy fifth-generation stealth fighters such as the Raptor. Tactical fighter-sized stealth aircraft must be optimized to defeat higher-frequency bands such the C X and Ku bands as a matter of physics. Those aircraft show up on radar operating at longer frequency wavelengths such the L-band however the track is not precise enough to engage a target with a missile.

However the L-band radar—part of the N036 Byelka radar suite—narrows the search area down so that the Su-57 can scan a smaller volume of space with its X-band N036-1-01 and N036B-1-01 active electronically scanned array apertures. The radar is further augmented with the 101KS Atoll electro-optical targeting system and the L402 Himalayas electronic countermeasure suite which would help further refine a track from the L-band radar. The idea is that a focused search by the Su-57’s other sensors would result in a weapons quality track to engage a fifth-generation fighter such as a F-22. It’s a good theory but it is far from certain that it would work in practice.

The J-20 however is probably not designed as a dedicated air superiority fighter like the Su-57 is. Its concept of operations seems to be based on American ideas about how to operate a fifth-generation fighter aircraft. Not much is known about the specifics of the J-20’s avionics and sensor suite but the Chinese jet seems to incorporate an active electronically scanned array a chin mounted EOTS a passive infrared/electro-optical DAS 360-degree spherical camera system and passive antennas for an advanced electronic support measure suite similar to the F-35’s AN/ASQ-239 system. The J-20 also seems to incorporate advanced datalinks integrated avionics and a cockpit with a display similar to that found on the F-35. Indeed the J-20 likely has avionics that are broadly comparable to that found on the F-22 and F-35 but which are not quite as refined as their American counterparts.

The J-20 has a sensor suite similar to the F-35 because it is likely designed primarily as a long-range strike aircraft intended to threaten American bases and maritime assets in the Pacific. It would also likely have a role in disrupting American air operations during wartime by attacking U.S. aerial refueling tankers and airborne assets such as the E-3 AWACS E-8 JSTARS or E2D Hawkeye and other similar support aircraft with long-range air-to-air missiles using its combination of speed and stealth. It is probably not designed to directly engage American fifth-generation fighters such as the F-22 or F-35 except in self-defense. By contrast the Russian Su-57 is a dedicated air superiority machine that is designed to hunt down American fighters such as the F-22 and F-35—where it is successful or not is another question.

The bottom line is that the Russians and the Chinese had different requirements and design priorities that led them to make different tradeoffs when developing their respective fifth-generation fighters.

The answer may surprise you.

Now is a good time to look at the evolution of stealth starting with the Lockheed Martin F-117 Nighthawk . That aircraft was retired in 2008 but would the F-117 still be useful today?

The answer is that against most mid-range threats like Iran absolutely. But against higher-end threats like Russia or China not so much. Technology has advanced since engineers first dreamed up the F-117 “stealth fighter” concept.

Developed in the 1970s and declared operational in complete secrecy in 1983 the F-117 ushered in a new era that would enable the United States to dominate warfare for decades to come. Ironically the equations that ultimately enabled the United States to develop the Nighthawk have their origins in the Soviet Union with a paper titled Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction . An obscure Russian scientist by the name of Pyotr Yakovlevich Ufimtsev wrote the paper in 1962. While the Soviet Union more or less dismissed Ufimtsev’s work as being wildly impractical Lockheed Skunk Works engineer Denys Overholser saw potential in the Russian physicist’s equations.

Overholser’s work resulted in a concept that many at the Skunk Works—including the legendary Kelly Johnson—derisively called the Hopeless Diamond. But soon it became apparent that the ungainly diamond shape was incredibly effective at reducing an object’s radar cross section. As such the Pentagon immediately awarded Lockheed a contract to develop a demonstrator called the Have Blue as part of its Experimental Survivable Testbed (XST) program. The Pentagon was forging ahead full steam to defeat the Warsaw Pact’s increasingly potent air defenses at the time. That was because it was increasingly apparent that NATO air forces would suffer horrific losses if the Cold War turned into World War III.

Lockheed was successful in developing the ungainly Hopeless Diamond design into a barely flyable design thanks to then new fly-by-wire technology. The resulting aircraft which used a faceted design to defeat enemy radar—and resembled a subscale version of its F-117 successor—first flew in December 1977. While both of the prototypes were destroyed the Have Blue program was a stunning success. As such the Air Force decided to go ahead with the development of the follow-on F-117.

The F-117 first flew in 1981 and eventually entered service in 1983. Lockheed was able to develop an operational aircraft quickly as the company built the jet out of existing components already in use on other planes. The fly-by-wire controls came from the F-16 while the engines were non-afterburning versions of the F/A-18A’s General Electric F404 turbofans. Additionally unlike later stealth aircraft the F-117 was constructed using conventional aerospace aluminum—which made building the jet easier. Lockheed ultimately built a total of fifty-nine F-117As and five YF-117As developmental prototypes.

The F-117 made its debut in secret over Panama in 1989 but its performance was lackluster. However the F-117 performed spectacularly well over Iraq during the first Gulf War in 1991. It also served in several subsequent conflicts including the second Gulf War during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. The Air Force ultimately retired the Nighthawk in 2008 as a cost saving measure as the service struggled to pay for the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. At the time the Air Force claimed that with the advent of the air superiority-oriented Raptor—and eventually the F-35—meant it no longer needed the F-117.

During its time in service only one F-117—flown by Lt. Col. Dale Zelko—was lost over Yugoslavia in March 1999 during Operation Allied Force. Zelko’s experience over Kosovo was the first inkling that the wider public had that stealth aircraft were not invincible nor are they invisible to radar and infrared. Military and national security professionals have never had such illusions but during the 1990s many grew overconfident in the capabilities offered by low observable aircraft. But stealth is mere delayed detection and tracking—the idea is one releases their weapons before the enemy is aware of you. Stealth is not a magical cloak of invisibility.

But the Air Force had always known that stealth aircraft are not invisible or invincible. In fact during Operation Desert Storm contrary to popular belief U.S. Army AH-64 Apache gunships made the first air raids on Iraq rather than the F-117. Those attack helicopters had one mission—that was to eliminate Iraqi low frequency early warning radars operating in the VHF and UHF-bands. Those radars can detect and track stealth aircraft like the F-117 which are designed to operated against radars operating in the C X and Ku-bands. The Apaches cleared a path for the stealth fighters to proceed to their targets deep inside Iraq undetected.

Subsequent stealth aircraft like the F-22 and F-35 are also designed to operate against high-frequency fire control radars. The concept behind fifth-generation fighters—which in some ways are the direct successors to the F-117 tactical stealth attack aircraft—is that they operate with the enemy potentially knowing that something is present in their air space. The enemy just can’t do anything about their presence however—putting it basically—or so the theory goes. But despite its public stance the Air Force has never operated its stealth aircraft without the presence of Navy electronic warfare aircraft like Prowler or jammers.

Stealthy strategic bombers like the B-2 however are designed to operate more like submarines—that is they operate without their presence being noticed. The massive bombers are optimized for “broad band all-aspect” stealth which means they are able to remain unnoticed even in the presence of low frequency radars by hiding in the background noise and clutter. But even then the Pentagon didn’t fully anticipate how quickly the Russians and Chinese would develop low frequency radars with performance to threaten even the B-2. “We've had the ability to map our threats in real time in the B-2 for a while with our Defense Management System (DMS)” said an Air Force official. “But the growth in the EW [electronic warfare] spectrum wasn't reasonably anticipated and thus precipitated an upgrade into a new DMS.” But even the B-2 is not going to be able keep pace with the evolving threat that’s why the new Air Force LRS-B will be optimized to defeat those low frequency systems.

But the Air Force official’s statement also highlights why the F-117 is no longer relevant in the ultra high-end fight. Not only is the subsonic light bomber optimized to defeat high frequency radars it also does not have the ability to map out threat emitters and manage its signature in real time like the F-22 and F-35. Nor does it have the performance to survive when it is detected and confronted.

But that’s the real advantage of the F-22 and F-35 over not only the F-117 but also the Russian PAK-FA and Chinese J-20 and J-31. The F-117 was entirely dependent on an autorouter to map out its course to avoid threats before each mission. Both the F-22 and the F-35 have the ability to map out threats in real time and are equipped with pilot vehicle interfaces that can make sense of that information for the pilot. In that respect the Joint Strike Fighter is head and shoulders above the Raptor thanks to years of technological advancements.

Multiple Air Force and industry sources confirm that the Raptor has a lower radar cross-section over a wider range of frequencies than the F-35 (as the Air Force maintained for nearly a decade till 2014) but the newer aircraft is far better at managing its signature thanks to an incredibly advanced electronic warfare suite. That is likely why retired Air Combat Command commander Gen. Mike Hostage told Breaking Defense : “The F-35 doesn’t have the altitude doesn’t have the speed [of the F-22] but it can beat the F-22 in stealth.” The operative word there is can. As current ACC commanderGen. Hawk Carlisle told National Defense Magazine: The F-35 has much better “passive capability to determine who’s out there [and] its ability to manage its own signature.”

Ultimately it’s the pilot vehicle interface the United States has developed over the decades at great expense that affords it the edge over Russia and China’s upstart programs—as Carlisle himself told me a few years ago at the Pentagon. Nonetheless the United States will have to keep developing new technology to stay ahead.

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

The Brundidge City Council attended a safety meeting for city employees before going into regular session at 1 p.m. on Tuesday.

The council worked from a short agenda that included a review of the city’s financials and recognition of Saint Paul A.M.E. Church and Cemetery by the Alabama Historical Commission.

Brundidge Mayor Isabell Boyd said the commission has announced that the church and cemetery have been approved for listing on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage.

The Alabama Register is the state’s official listing of historic architectural and archaeological landmarks.

Boyd said the Alabama Register recognizes Alabama’s historic places and encourages their continued preservation.

“Listing in the state register is an honorary designation” Boyd said. “Saint Paul is to be congratulate for this recognition and this honor.”

The council welcomed members of the staff of the Tupper Lightfoot Memorial Library and the Chris Rodgers family to the council meeting.

The city’s library was the recipient of a Lowe’s “100 Hometowns” initiative that commemorated the home improvement company’s 100th birthday. The Tupper Lightfoot Memorial Library was the recipient of one of the 2021 grants and used the funds to enclose an open walkway between the library’s two buildings.

Theresa Trawick library director told the council that as the grant recipients concluded their projects Lowe’s is giving more meaning to the season by transforming each grant recipient into a Hometown Secret Santa.

Each “Santa” received $2000 in gift cards to purchase gifts for another deserving community member.

Trawick said the library staff gave much consideration to the needs of individuals and families in the community.

“The Chris Rodgers’ home was heavily destroyed by fire in November and the family is in the process of trying to recover from the loses they suffered” Trawick said. “The library staff wanted to assist them in their recovery efforts with the grant funds from a ‘Hometown Secret Santa.’”

On behalf of his family Chris Rodgers expressed appreciation to Lowe’s for making the grants available to his family and the other 99 grant recipients who also benefitted.

“We are so blessed to have people think about us and what all we lost in the fire” Rodgers said. “We thank everybody at the library for thinking of us. Now we will be able to buy things that we need so we’ll have a better Christmas. We just thank everybody.”

The actor has been posting behind-the-scenes photos from the Season 3 production and his latest one involves some pretty fun before-and-after photos that prove the actor's ability to look sharp at a moment's notice.

Naps are a privilege in this hectic world and since working long hours makes it harder to get a good night’s sleep as naturally as one might desire random naps end up being vital to catch up on some ZZZs. Rob Lowe posted some pictures to his Instagram of just such a 40-winker on the way to work — don’t worry he wasn’t driving — as well as a follow-up photo of him in Owen's firefighter gear posing in front of a 126 engine. And he cleans up quite nicely as evidenced below:

A post shared by Rob Lowe (@roblowe) A photo posted by on

The photos are pretty incredible given that Rob Lowe looked so completely comfortable and zonked the hell out during his commute only to be ready to take on fictional fires soon after. Even though it's not clear how much time passed between the before and the after we'll assume it was like 30 seconds such is Lowe's prowess and mastery.

It’s important to note that Lowe’s dog Daisy is included in all three photos and she too looked pretty zonked in the first photo as opposed to the last two. Seeing how well the Parks and Recreation alum can clean up before and after arriving on set is impressive though his four-legged friend's skills are nothing to scoff at.

Meanwhile Season 3 of 9-1-1: Lone Star is right around the corner. From the looks of Rob Lowe’s photos it seems like showrunner Tim Minear’s comments from earlier this year proved to be true regarding the cliffhanger that the 126 is permanently shut down. Depending on what episode was being filmed when the photo was taken the 126 crew will apparently soon-ishly be together again. First though the upcoming season will kick off with an ice storm similar to what Texas actually went through towards the start of 2021.

Angel vets Julie Benz and Amy Acker are set to guest star in Season 3 of 9-1-1: Lone Star in multiple episodes though separately. It will definitely be interesting to see what happens and how their characters will interact with everyone else on the series.

Rob Lowe’s Instagram is always filled with pretty amazing content from 80s throwbacks to sobriety milestones. His latest from the set of the Fox drama just shows that he is like any other human being in need of energy before a long filming day. With 9-1-1: Lone Star returning just after the new year starts my fingers are crossed for Lowe continuing to bring the content to keep fans interested! Hopefully Lower has been able to rest more peacefully during the show's filming hiatus for the holidays.

(0:55)

Open Extended Reactions

The Detroit Lions are signing quarterback Jared Goff to a four-year $212 million contract extension that includes $170 million guaranteed sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Monday.

The deal makes the 2016 No. 1 pick the highest-paid player in franchise history.

The $53 million average annual salary in Goff's new deal makes him the second-highest-paid quarterback in the NFL behind only the Cincinnati Bengals' Joe Burrow ($55 million).

Jared Goff past two seasons Over the past two seasons Jared Goff ranks top four in the NFL in passing yards passing touchdowns TD-to-interception ratio and first-down rate. NFL RANK Pass yards 9013 2nd Pass TD 59 T-3rd TD/INT 3.1 2nd 1st-down pct. 38% 4th -- ESPN Stats & Information

Detroit has now rewarded three of its star players this offseason with over $444 million in contract extensions to Goff wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and offensive tackle Penei Sewell.

St. Brown received a four-year $120.01 million deal and Sewell signed for $112 million over four years. With those massive deals in place the Lions are aware that the standards in Detroit have been raised.

""We've got a lot of work to do"" Goff told ESPN in April. ""The expectations are high but internally our standards are raising and our expectations are raising and we've got goals and things we want to do. It's not like we're going to show up and start winning again.""

Goff 29 has flourished in three seasons with the Lions since he was acquired in a trade that sent quarterback Matthew Stafford to the Los Angeles Rams.

Last season he threw for 4575 yards with 30 touchdowns and 12 interceptions as he led the Lions to two playoff victories in a single postseason for the first time since 1957 and Detroit collected its first division title in more than three decades. The Lions reached the NFC Championship Game for the first time since 1991.

Over the past two seasons Goff has helped the Lions win 21 games a franchise record for most victories in any two-season span. Their 12 wins in 2023 also tied for the most wins in a season in franchise history which was set in 1991.

In three seasons in Detroit Goff has passed for 12258 yards and 78 touchdowns with just 27 interceptions.

As Goff was preparing to enter the final year of his current contract he repeatedly expressed his interest in remaining in Detroit and kept a businesslike approach while trusting his agent to reach the deal.

""I've been doing it for nine years now and I'm kind of used to it. I obviously appreciate my teammates' support but it's been easy"" Goff told ESPN in April. ""Just focus on what matters and trying to get better and trying to help our team win games advance further than we did last year and hopefully be the last team standing at the end. That's all I'm thinking about.""

ESPN and NFL.com reported the news on Monday afternoon with sources indicating $170m of the contract is guaranteed. His current contract was due to expire at the end of the 2024 season and the new deal would make Goff the highest-paid player in Lions history.

The former No 1 overall pick arrived in Detroit as part of the trade that sent Matthew Stafford to the Los Angeles Rams in 2021. Goff was not expected to be a star with the Lions after a number of mediocre seasons with the Rams but he was named to the Pro Bowl in 2022 and last season he led Detroit to the NFC championship game for the first time since 1991. In his three seasons with Detroit the 29-year-old has thrown 78 touchdowns and only 27 interceptions. He ranks second in the NFL in total yards (9013) and touchdown to interception ratio (3.1) over the last two seasons.

Lions general manager Brad Holmes had indicated in February that the team were keen to tie Goff to a long-term deal.

“I’ve always had belief in Jared” said Holmes. “You guys have always heard me. I don’t know what more needs to be said from a leadership or performance standpoint”

The Lions a longtime punchline in the NFL have become a force to be reckoned with in the NFC North in the last few seasons and also signed offensive tackle Penei Sewell and wide receiver Amon-Ra St Brown to long-term deals this offseason.

Goff’s average salary of $53m under the deal would put him second only to Joe Burrow ($55m) among NFL quarterbacks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwMTIwOTA4LWxpb25zLXVwZGF0ZWQtc2FsYXJ5LWNhcC1hZnRlci1qYXJlZC1nb2Zmcy1ydW1vcmVkLTIxMm0tY29udHJhY3QtZXh0ZW5zaW9u0gGHAWh0dHBzOi8vc3luZGljYXRpb24uYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FtcC8xMDEyMDkwOC1saW9ucy11cGRhdGVkLXNhbGFyeS1jYXAtYWZ0ZXItamFyZWQtZ29mZnMtcnVtb3JlZC0yMTJtLWNvbnRyYWN0LWV4dGVuc2lvbi5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lions' Updated Salary Cap After Jared Goff's Rumored $212M Contract Extension,"Cooper Neill/Getty Images

The Detroit Lions are giving quarterback Jared Goff a lofty extension after he led them to the NFC championship game in 2023.

The Lions are reportedly signing Goff to a four-year $212 million contract extension ESPN's Adam Schefter reported Monday.

According to Schefter the deal includes $170 million guaranteed and makes him the highest-paid Lions player in franchise history.

Before the new deal with Goff the Lions had a team salary cap of $257.166 million per Over The Cap but with an added $53 million annual salary to give to Goff that number will be around $279.84 million.

Detroit had $26.008 million in available cap space before the deal and is now left over with $5.308 million.

Goff's extension comes after one of the best seasons of his career. In 2023 the former No. 1 overall pick had 4575 passing yards and 30 touchdowns—the second most of his career. He led Detroit to its first NFC championship game since 1991 and gave fans hope that there is plenty more success to come.

Part of his success was due to having an outstanding target in Amon-Ra St. Brown who had career-highs with 1515 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns last year. The Lions rewarded St. Brown with a four-year $120 million deal earlier this offseason making him the highest-paid receiver in the league.

Goff's $53 million average annual salary makes him the second highest-paid quarterback in the NFL just behind Cincinnati Bengals star Joe Burrow who makes $55 million per year.

Goff 29 was set to become a free agent in 2025 but will remain with Detroit for the foreseeable future after his extension.

The Lions have had a resurgence thanks to Goff St. Brown and other key players and they're looking to continue blossoming in 2024. Last year Detroit reached the playoffs for the first time since 2016 and advanced past the wild-card round for the first time since 1991 when they reached the NFC Championship.

The 2023 season also saw the Lions claim the NFC North title for the first time in 30 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saW9ucy1xYi1qYXJlZC1nb2ZmLWFncmVlLTIxNTUwMzU5Ni5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lions and QB Jared Goff agree on $212M 4-year extension with $170M guaranteed AP source says,"Lions and QB Jared Goff agree on $212M 4-year extension with $170M guaranteed AP source says

The Detroit Lions have looked in vain for a playoff-winning quarterback for decade after decade.

When the search ended with Jared Goff under center the franchise was determined not to let him get away.

The Lions and Goff agreed to a $212 million four-year contract extension according to a person familiar with the situation.

The person told The Associated Press on Monday that the deal includes $170 million in guarantees and spoke on condition of anonymity because the terms were not announced.

Goff ended the Motor City’s misery in January helping the Lions earn two playoff victories in one postseason for the first time since winning the 1957 NFL title.

He led the franchise to its first postseason win in 32 years beating the Matthew Stafford-led Los Angeles Rams in an NFC wild-card game and to a victory over Tampa Bay before losing at San Francisco in the NFC championship game.

Lions general manager Brad Holmes acquired Goff and a pair of first-round picks for Stafford three years ago from the Rams his former team.

The 29-year-old Goff who was entering the final year of his deal will be under contract in Detroit through the 2028 season.

He has given the Lions a lot of reasons to keep him around.

Goff didn't get down emotionally even when the Lions won just three games in his debut year with them in 2021 and followed up the next season with a 1-6 start.

“He’s the captain of the ship” Detroit center Frank Ragnow said. “He’s as steady as it gets.”

Goff who is from Novato California starred at California before the Rams drafted him No. 1 overall in 2016. He helped the Rams reach the Super Bowl in his third season and they traded him away two years later and went on to win an NFL championship with Stafford.

Outside of the Lions’ organization Goff was viewed as a stopgap quarterback when he was acquired as a castaway.

The three-time Pro Bowl player has been much more.

He was effective during the 2022 season lifting Detroit to eight wins over its final 10 games. He also played well during much of the Lions' breakthrough season in which they won their first division title in three decades and ended an NFL record nine-game postseason losing streak that had dragged on since the 1991 season.

Goff threw 383 consecutive passes without an interception a mistake-free run that trailed just two players in NFL history before throwing a pick last September. He finished the 2023 regular season ranked No. 2 in yards passing and fourth with 30 touchdowns including five that matched franchise and personal records in rout against Denver.

In postseason wins over the Rams and Tampa Bay he completed 74.3% of his passes for 564 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions. Goff threw for 273 yards and a touchdown at San Francisco falling one win short of lifting the Lions to their first Super Bowl.

“He’s as accurate as any quarterback I’ve seen” 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said.

The agreement with Goff is the latest investment Detroit has made in keeping key players in the hopes of contending for championships in 2024 and beyond.

Less than a month ago the Lions signed their All-Pro players to deals that keep them under contract for the next five seasons.

Wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown signed a four-year contract extension worth more than $120 million with $77 million in guarantees and offensive tackle Penei Sewell was retained with a four-year $112 million deal.

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

LAPLACE — With insurance claims and home repairs taking precedence over family traditions this Christmas season Apostle Renita Graber knew it would take something big to reinspire joy in the hearts of those impacted by Hurricane Ida.

Victorious Life Family Worship Center was decked out in dazzling lights Monday evening during the first “Christmas to Remember” toy giveaway and festival. Organized with support from Toys for Tots and numerous community donors the free event included a large-scale toy distribution carnival-style rides Christmas music food unlimited hot cocoa and plenty of sweet treats.

“We are always a church that responds to the needs of the community. Last year we gave away 1000 toys. That was good but the need is more than giving away toys” Graber said. “Because this area had such great devastation people are focused on getting back into their homes. We wanted to stand in the gap and fill it with hope. Since families’ focus is not on Christmas and toys we want to supply it for them. In spite of the devastation we wanted to spread cheer and spread love to the people.”

In addition to local businesses and individual donors members of the church stepped up financially to make the festival a success.

Leona Stephens has been a member of Victorious Life Family Worship Center since its inception. She believes it is important for the church to step up and be a beacon of hope regardless of what situations are impacting the community.

“Before the church even got started my kids were involved in a youth group. Now they’re grown and two of them have their own businesses so we want to give back. We want to do what we were instructed to do here on Earth: give love and make sure everybody is good at this time of year” Stephens said. “People are losing their homes and losing their lives. Once we display the love of Christ then people can start doing the same thing. It’s a domino effect. It’s a great atmosphere around here every Sunday regardless of if it’s Christmastime. We do a lot of things for the community and it’s important to us to keep the community close-knit where everyone is looking out for each other.”

Church member Tawanda Thomas added that it was important to keep this event free so everyone in the community had access to Christmas cheer.

“Oftentimes at a festival parents will have to tell their children ‘You don’t need that’ because they can’t afford it. We wanted to take that burden away. At this festival you don’t need money to buy things. People are here with four or five kids. We want them to enjoy it” Thomas said.

She added that wrapping the church in Christmas lights was a symbolic reminder that Jesus asked the church to be the light of the world. Thomas was pleased to see many new faces around the church during the Christmas festival.

San Diego Convention Center Area Transportation

A car isn’t necessary for this part of town. Going without will help save on the steep parking prices hotels in all price ranges charge.

As mentioned above San Diego Airport is reachable by surface streets in a matter of minutes or a three-mile walk (most people drive).

Several hotels in the area offer shuttles to and from the airport. In addition taxis and ride-shares can take you anywhere in the downtown San Diego area and beyond that you need to go.

A more convenient method of transportation is the MTS Trolley which has two stops in front of the San Diego Convention Center and stops in Little Italy Fashion Valley Old Town San Diego and now heads as far as UTC near La Jolla.

Nearby dockless scooter and bike rentals offer a fun way to explore San Diego and there are plenty of designated parking spaces for your rental car.

Kathmandu Guest House (KGH) one of the oldest hotels in Kathmandu on Sunday formally opened its newest wing The Karna Annex.

KGH founder Karna Shakya and legendary mountaineer Reinhold Messner jointly inaugurated the new wing. The duo had also laid the foundation stone of the new wing in 2018.

The new wing was conceived after the 2015 earthquake damaged KGH’s main building which was 100 years old according to the company. The new wing has 35 super deluxe rooms. It is also home to the Museum of Nepali Art.

“We’ve come a long way since we started out over 50 years ago… Not bad for someone who became a hotelier by accident” said Shakya during the launch event.

He also thanked Messner for coming to Nepal to inaugurate the building.

“He’s part of our family so much so we have a room dedicated to him” he said.

Messner also spoke fondly of his love for the KGH. He said it was his home away from home and one of the best places to live in Kathmandu.

“This place is home it has always been home. I’ll come and stay here for years to come” said Messner.",,,

Already the move to remote work and digital commerce has reshaped how people handle retail shopping cryptocurrency B2B payments and cross-border transactions.

The seismic shift began last year when COVID-19 caused in-person card payments to decline by 11.7 billion transactions or 13% from 2019. Simultaneously online and in-app payments rose by 8.7 billion transactions or 24% according to data the Federal Reserve released in December.

Pressure to improve the speed accuracy and security of payments increased pushing crypto closer to the mainstream. Now central banks around the world — including China — are flirting with the launch of their own digital currencies.

Fintechs are enabling many of these new payment innovations and in some cases they're directly challenging traditional financial services providers. In others fintechs are partners instead.

He said he's grateful this holiday season for all the business he's seen.

""We did have a small line out both doors when we first opened this morning” Trimberger said.

According to Mastercard SpendingPulse which tracks all kinds of payments including cash and debit transactions holiday sales rose 8.5% from a year earlier.

That's the fastest pace of sales growth in 17 years.

""We've been really busy we feel very fortunate I think in general my neighbors have all had a good holiday season and really pleased with that” Trimberger said.

With the ups and downs throughout the pandemic many local business owners remain optimistic and are hopeful to end the shopping season on an even stronger note.

For now it’s customers like Joey Graef from Green Bay who drove nearly an hour to snag some discounts.

""We started at seven Taylor Creek opened up at eight we've been going since and now we're here in Sturgeon Bay” Graef said.

""It’s been a tradition for us to be open the day after Christmas and I think it would've been a little challenging. You can come down and recharge your Christmas spirit because there's still a lot of holiday magic out here” Trimberger said.

Throughout its run in Ring of Honor Shane Taylor Promotions became arguably the most impressive stable in wrestling today.

The group launched Moses Kaun and O’Shay Edwards to new heights as the trio alongside Shane Taylor defended the ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship during their unmatched reign with the gold. Though the group lost the titles at ROH Final Battle: End of an Era Shane Taylor Promotions’ excellence is undeniable.

Taylor has previously discussed his aim to keep the group together though its members are hitting the open market in the wake of the news that ROH reportedly won’t renew the contracts of its talent roster at the end of 2021. No matter what happens next STP’s legacy will go down in ROH history.

During an interview with WrestleZone Taylor Edwards and Kaun reflected on the group’s success. First Taylor expressed his pride in the way each member of the stable has shined; though they were all talented they took the ball and ran with it when they received the opportunities that they hadn’t been getting.

“To sit here and say I feel like a proud big brother would be an understatement” said Taylor. “When I met every single one of these guys they were already supremely talented supremely confident they just needed the reps. They just needed the opportunity. You could see that they were damn near miles ahead of anybody around yet for some reason people didn’t know what to do with them they didn’t see it. They didn’t understand what they had. Seeing talent has never been an issue for me. So I knew that next to me I could provide them the opportunities and the reps that they needed.

“All I had to do was step back and watch them do what I already knew that they could do and we’ve seen it. With the growth of Kaun and Moses as a tag team it’s undeniable. They went from guys that people just were like well you know they could be good. To now you know [they’re] universally recognized as pillars of any tag team division that they walk into it. That’s not an accident. They’ve always had that in them.”

Taylor then took a moment to praise Edwards’ confidence and his successful tendency to bet on himself. “The Baddest of All Time” compared Edwards to himself before he explained that even though STP had to deal with a lot of “bulls—“ the work itself wasn’t a problem at all.

“…Even though O’Shay is older than me I wasn’t about to let that slide I’ve watched him bet on himself own every stage he’s been on whether it’s been on a Ring of Honor stage or every independent that he goes to and dominated” said Taylor. “The level of confidence that he has is scary close to mine you know what I mean and his ability to go out there just because he can and just because he wants to.

“When you have these individuals all together at the same time with the common goal while you still have to put in the work and while it was still tough navigating all the bull— the work is easy. Once we get out there and all we gotta do is fight it’s easy.”

Edwards a powerhouse who is fitting called “The Big Bad Kaiju” went on to describe how he always sought to prove his stablemates they made the right choice by taking a chance on him no matter where they happened to be competing on any given night. Given the way he thrived with the group it’s safe to say he succeeded in this regard.

“It was the day that I linked up with Shane and Moses and Kaun and they were the first group of people where I was never trying to prove them wrong I was trying to prove ’em right” said Edwards. “…It was just like ‘Nah man you’ve got the right guy. You want me let me show you why you made the right choice. And every day I stepped up into that ring it was to prove that you guys made the right choice regardless of who’s signing checks regardless of who’s in front of us regardless of whose ring we were in. It was hey man we made the right choice here.”

As for Kaun he stated that Shane Taylor Promotions collectively made six-man tag team matches important again and the group’s dominance is unrivaled in the wrestling world.

“In the end we should be talking about we made trios wrestling relevant again” said Kaun. “We are the most dominant six-man unit in professional wrestling today…and we’re the greatest six-man unit in Ring of Honor history period.”

Moving forward many fans are eager to see what the members of Shane Taylor Promotions do next. Whether they stay together or venture off on their own the stablemates will continue to pursue the group’s goal to advocate for diversity in wrestling by thriving in the ring and being a shining example of excellence.

The league has been impacted heavily by Covid-19 outbreaks at Premier League clubs with a total of 14 matches called off so far. One was postponed due to heavy snow.

So which games have been called off? Who has been worst affected by the disruption and when could these rescheduled matches actually be played? We take a closer look...

WHICH PL GAMES HAVE BEEN CALLED OFF?

Burnley vs Tottenham - November 28 - inclement weather

Brighton vs Tottenham - December 12

Brentford vs Man Utd - December 14

Burnley vs Watford - December 15

Leicester vs Tottenham - December 16

Man Utd vs Brighton - December 18

Southampton vs Brentford - December 18

Watford vs Crystal Palace - December 18

West Ham vs Norwich - December 18

Aston Villa vs Burnley - December 18

Everton vs Leicester - December 19

Liverpool vs Leeds - December 26

Wolves vs Watford - December 26

Burnley vs Everton - December 26

Aston Villa vs Leeds United - December 28

Arsenal vs Wolves - December 28

WHICH CLUBS HAVE BEEN WORST AFFECTED?

Burnley are the worst affected with four Premier League matches to play. Watford Aston Villa and are the worst affected with four Premier League matches to play. Watford Aston Villa and Everton (Boxing Day) were all called off due to Covid outbreaks and they also had a Premier League game postponed against Tottenham in November due to heavy snow at Turf Moor an hour before kick-off which needs rearranging.

Considering three of those four opponents sit tenth or lower in the Premier League table traditionally pragmatic Burnley boss Sean Dyche may have felt it was a good time of the campaign to build on their one win this season but instead have only been able to fulfil 15 out of a possible 19 Premier League fixtures.

Burnley are now set to take on Manchester United on December 30 which if it goes ahead will be their first match in 18 days. Will the Burnley players lack match fitness? Quite possibly.

Tottenham had two Premier League games against Brighton and Leicester called off due to Covid-19 after their UEFA Europa Conference League tie against had two Premier League games against Brighton and Leicester called off due to Covid-19 after their UEFA Europa Conference League tie against Rennes on December 9 was also called off . It meant Tottenham had a 14-day gap between their 3-0 win over Norwich on December 5 and an impressive 2-2 draw with Liverpool on December 19

Most of Tottenham's players who had Covid will be lacking match fitness after recovering from the virus and are now set to play four matches in 11 days with a crucial Carabao Cup semi-final first leg tie against Chelsea on January 5

Watford also have to play three matches against Burnley Crystal Palace and Wolves in their fight for Premier League survival.

WHAT ABOUT THE SUMMER?

It is unlikely games will be played after the Champions League final on May 28 as the UEFA Nations League gets underway on June 2 with four competitive matches through to June 14.

The 2022/23 Premier League season begins earlier than usual on August 6 to allow for a break from November 21-December 18 for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

HOW ARE TEAMS IN EUROPE AFFECTED?

Liverpool will take on Inter Milan in the Champions League last 16 on February 16 and March 8 but need to play Leeds in the new year and may do so without the trio of Mohamed Salah Sadio Mane and Naby Keita who are all set to take part in the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon which begins on January 9. The final is on February 6.

Manchester United will play Atletico Madrid in the last 16 on February 23 and March 15 but still have two matches against Brentford and Brighton to fulfil.

Tottenham were unable to play their UEFA Europa Conference League group decider against Rennes on December 9 because of a Covid outbreak at the north London club. A win would have sent Tottenham through to the knockout stages. However were unable to play their UEFA Europa Conference League group decider against Rennes on December 9 because of a Covid outbreak at the north London club. A win would have sent Tottenham through to the knockout stages. However UEFA decided to award Rennes a 3-0 victory which means Spurs' participation in the tournament is over

The benefit for Tottenham will be that they will have more midweek spaces open to catch up with their three Premier League matches in their push for a top-four spot.

Leicester had seven players unavailable for a Europa League group-stage decider against Napoli due to Covid-19 and lost the game 3-2. It saw Leicester get demoted to the Europa Conference League. A competition that manager Brendan Rodgers admitted he did not know anything about.

Nevertheless alongside West Ham the Foxes will be in the knockout stages of European competition from mid-February.

West Ham will at some point need to play a rearranged game against Norwich while Leicester have games at Tottenham and Everton to play. Both clubs will be hoping these will not come too close to crunch European matches.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhYm9vLmNvbS9saXN0cy8xMC1rcG9wLWFydGlzdHMtdXNlLWN1c3RvbS1taWNyb3Bob25lcy1zcGVjaWFsLW1lYW5pbmdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 K-Pop Artists Who Use Custom Microphones That Have Very Special Meanings,"Microphones are one of the most important things to a singer especially important to K-Pop artists. Some idols go as far as to have custom microphones made in order to add more towards a group dynamic (if they are in a K-Pop group) hold a special meaning to fans show their personality etc. Here are 10 K-Pop artists who have specially made microphones.

1. BTS

These microphones could be signifying each member’s respective personality and each color reflects a little part of that member.

2. BLACKPINK

This could be to signify the group’s fandom color or the group’s color.

3. Tiffany

A shining microphone for a bright artist fitting.

4. IU

IU has had multiple custom made microphones that she’s used.

5. iKON

The red microphones could be signifying the fandom’s color of pearl red.

6. WINNER

The fandom color is blue so this could have a different meaning. Perhaps it’s because WINNER has a clean and sleek music style or just because white is a pretty color.

7. EXO

Each microphone could be signifying each member and their different personality traits.

8. AB6IX

This could be because the group’s logo is red.

9. 2NE1

Different microphones for different personalities.

10. Park Hyoshin

While Ranveer Singh is winning accolades for his performance as Kapil Dev other actors playing his ‘Devils’ have also left fans and critics impressed. From Saqib Saleem Tahir Raj Bhasin Jatin Sarna jIIVA Harrdy Sandhu to Ammy Virk each actor brings fore an uncanny portrayal of champion cricketers. Among them also stands actor Adinath Kothare who plays Dilip Vengsarkar in the sports drama. An acclaimed Marathi actor Adinath’s directorial debut Paani won the 66th National Award for Best Film on Environment Conservation/Preservation.

Speaking exclusively to indianexpress.com the actor shared that he somewhere credits Paani for helping him bag 83. Adinath Kothare had just come back after shooting for the film which also features him in the lead. He was tanned had lost almost 10 kilos and was sporting a moustache. “This was the time I received a call from Mukesh Chhabra’s office for an ad film. However when I went there I was told the ad film required a different look. As I was leaving one of the assistants stopped me and said that my new look might suit another casting” he shared. Soon the actor was asked to see some videos of Dilip Vengsarkar and asked if he could duplicate the style.

“When I was told it’s for Kabir Khan’s 83 where Ranveer Singh is playing Kapil Dev I knew it was a huge project. I gave the audition but did not hear for a long time from them. I almost forgot about it when I got a call one day asking if I can come and meet Kabir Khan the next day. I was excited and also nervous. I did my homework read about the 83 World Cup and Dilip sir. I also did my cardio shaved to look all sharp. And when I met him I was in for a surprise as Kabir sir was so chilled out. It was an amazing interaction and he narrated the entire script. He also told me how the film is not just on Kapil Dev but the entire team and how each one had their own moments and contributed to the win. I was blown away by the entire conversation and at the end of it he just shook my hands and said ‘welcome on board’. That’s how my journey with 83 started.”

While the physical resemblance was thanks to the casting and styling but Kothare shared how each actor also had to get the cricketers’ style of playing. “We were enacting living legends and their style of playing speaking walking is known to the world. There was no scope for us to go wrong. We trained for a year under Balvinder Sandhu. Dilip sir has a very unique grip and he himself told me how he struggled with that all through his career. Even then he has the most graceful shots and that made him earn the title of ‘Colonel’ from Lala Amarnath. It was a very difficult learning experience and I am waiting for people to share their feedback on my performance.”

Dilip Vengsarkar was injured during the second match with West Indies when Marshal Malcolm’s bouncer hit him on the chin. While he recuperated from the grievous injury the cricketer had to miss the rest of the matches. Calling the team the ‘Clint Eastwood’ of cricket Adinath shared how he was amazed at how they faced the fastest bowlers with no proper equipment. “When I asked him about the incident he smile and told me that ‘I wanted to play yaar. I didn’t care about the injury’. It’s just that the doctors didn’t allow him. I was just amazed at how rough and tough they are. They truly were cut out of a different cloth.”

He further shared how it was essential for all actors to have a bond given they were part of a team on screen. And the on-screen camaraderie would have only been portrayed on screen if they did gel in real life. Crediting their Dharamshala boot camp for breaking the ice the actor shared that it was a very smart move by makers. “We were living eating sleeping together and for the first time we did feel like a team. Post that camp we started hanging out together and became thick friends. I think we needed that energy and it became extremely crucial for the shoot. Luckily for us that just kept getting better every day.”

Stating that while each one brought in a different flavour it was obviously Ranveer Singh who was the constant riot in their locker room. Calling him a ball of energy Adinath Kothare shared that they always looked forward to having him around. He added that the rest of the team was equally mad and it looked like a bunch of ‘mad men came together for the film’.

Working on an ensemble also turned out to be a learning experience for him as he realised the importance of ‘team spirit’. “As actors we crave attention and there was a lot of anxiety among everyone on how would we all share the limelight. As I said the camp at Dharmashala helped us become friends. It was such an important exercise psychologically and socially as it really helped us get together. Be it Ranveer or anyone I think we were such secure actors that we never flinched at being a part of a team and helping each other perform. I think I learnt so much on this shoot and the infectious energy among each other kept us going.”

Asked about the delays 83 faced due to the pandemic he said “I think it’s an evergreen subject and even if it came after 10 years it would have gotten the same response. However we were running out of patience and had started to turn extremely impatient. Our prayers have finally been heard and now the world can see our labour of love in theatres.”

83 also stars Deepika Padukone Pankaj Tripathi Jiiva Dinker Sharma Nishant Dahiya among others."

McCormick listened to struggles and challenges in the community firsthand from commonwealth veterans who attended.

He was welcomed to speak by Congressman Glenn “GT” Thompson and the chairman of the Clinton County Republican Party Kurt Smith who praised McCormick for what he’s been doing during his campaign.

Some of the topics McCormick touched on were the economy immigration the fentanyl crisis term limits the country’s spiritual decline and support of veterans across the country.

He answered questions from the crowd using his perspective as someone who served in the U.S. military and spoke about what he would do to better support veterans as Pennsylvania’s next U.S. Senator.

Those in attendance had the opportunity to sign McCormick’s bus which he hopes to fill with signatures from across the commonwealth.

At least that’s what the Pittsburgh Steelers’ fourth-round draft pick credits for his own sense of loyalty.

An FCS football player out of the Missouri Valley Football Conference’s South Dakota State Jackrabbits McCormick faced the same challenges as any small-school prospect. No matter how well you dominate your competition you’re always asked who did you beat? Such questions often cap their potential to the middle rounds of the draft.

A lot of times NFL-worthy prospects from small schools must answer those questions in Bowl games and practices. Arguably fewer small-school players make it this far because those who have that talent enter the transfer portal. They end up changing schools where they can raise their profile. McCormick never did despite the opportunity to do so and he explained why.

“Yes I had offers. The temptation was not there” he told reporters on Friday via the team’s website. “South Dakota State gave so much to me and developed me into who I am now. Who am I to leave South Dakota State? They poured so much into me. I feel like they should be able to reap the benefits of what they helped create. Sure some money would be cool or whatever but it’s just ultimately my loyalties lie with the people that are good to me.”

Reporters asked him questions in the same vein after the draft and he gave the same answer. “I feel like in today’s world loyalty is kind of an afterthought” he said at the time via 93.7 The Fan. “South Dakota State did so much for me it was a no-brainer for me to be loyal to them.”

McCormick first arrived at South Dakota State in 2018 redshirting his first season as a zero-star prospect from Sioux Falls. He managed two starts the following season before the COVID-19 pandemic wiped out his redshirt sophomore year. In all he spent six years there logging comfortably over 3000 career snaps on the offensive line.

We’ll see how loyalty influences McCormick’s relationship with the Pittsburgh Steelers moving forward. He has a chance to earn a starting job though not as a rookie. They drafted him after taking linemen in the first two rounds precisely for that reason. If he does crack the starting lineup will he show loyalty to the Steelers when he hits free agency?

That doesn’t mean taking a cheap contract because business is always a part of the equation. But for some more than others so are our core values. McCormick credits his family for the emphasis he puts on loyalty.

“I think that’s just the way I was raised” he said. “People that are good to you you should be great to them and give back to them. That’s just the way it’s always been for me.”

Loyalty. It’s an easy talk to talk but try walking it and most will fall on their face. McCormick stayed loyal to South Dakota State and it served him well to get this far.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtbmV3cy8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM5MzYvc3RlZWxlcnMtc2lnbi1yb29raWVzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtY29udHJhY3QtdGVybXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers officially sign rookies Mason McCormick Logan Lee,"The Pittsburgh Steelers officially signed two members of their 2024 NFL Draft class Friday including fourth-round guard Mason McCormick and sixth-round DL Logan Lee. The news comes on the same day of the start of rookie minicamp taking place between Friday May 10 and Sunday May 12. Financial terms of their contracts were not disclosed.

McCormick in particular could be in a position to earn some significant playing time in the 2024 season with several question marks remaining regarding the current configuration of players on the offensive line. Should McCormick have a successful offseason he could be in the mix to compete with starting right guard James Daniels. Daniels is in the final year of his contract with the Steelers with a 2024 cap hit of just under $11.2 million. By trading or releasing Daniels the Steelers can save $8.25 million against the salary cap in 2024.

Related Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024

Though McCormick might afford the Steelers the flexibility to make that decision on the roster It would still be a surprise to see them do so especially given the fact that they’ve got two other rookies presumably starting on the offensive line this year including OT Troy Fautanu and C Zach Frazier.

The Steelers have 43 players on their 2024 Rookie Minicamp Roster with 12 of them being rookies in this class including five undrafted free agents who received contracts. That leaves five drafted rookies remaining with whom the team will need to finalize a deal ahead of training camp including first-round OT Troy Fautanu second-round center Zach Frazier third-rounders WR Roman Wilson and LB Payton Wilson as well as sixth-round DB Ryan Watts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy1zaWduLWRyYWZ0LXBpY2tzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtdG8tcm9va2llLWNvbnRyYWN0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers sign draft picks Mason McCormick Logan Lee to rookie contracts,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://triblive.com/sports/steelers-sign-draft-picks-mason-mccormick-logan-lee-to-rookie-contracts/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy1zaWduLWRyYWZ0LXBpY2tzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtdG8tcm9va2llLWNvbnRyYWN0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Across 15 official McDonald's Instagram accounts around the world 14.5% and 12.4% of posts from September to December 2019 were targeted towards young app users in upper-middle-income countries and higher-income countries respectively as they featured a picture of a child or adolescent.

In comparison 22.0% of posts were targeted this way to underage audiences in lower-middle income countries Omni Cassidy PhD of NYU School of Global Public Health in New York City and colleagues reported in BMJ Nutrition Prevention & Health.

Children and adolescents are gaining more weight during the COVID-19 pandemic; the estimated proportion of U.S. kids with obesity rose from 19.3% in August 2019 to 22.4% in August 2020 according to estimates from the CDC.

McDonald's is the largest fast food chain in the world and it operates in 118 countries with nearly 40000 restaurants across the globe. McDonald's has official Instagram accounts in 62 countries according to Cassidy's group.

""Exposure to fast food ads through social media may place vulnerable groups -- particularly those in lower-income countries -- at increased risk for obesity and diet-related chronic conditions"" the study authors wrote. ""By targeting certain subsets through child-targeted ads and price promotions McDonald's social media ads may exacerbate healthcare issues in the most vulnerable countries in the world.""

Cassidy and colleagues found that the promotion of healthy habits was generally low across McDonald's country-specific Instagram accounts though accounts for richer countries were more likely to portray healthy habits. Past studies have also shown that fast food companies tend to advertise healthier products in wealthier countries compared to in lower-income countries the authors said.

On Instagram McDonald's marketing tactics for lower-middle income countries featured more frequent posts free giveaways and price promotions.

In contrast the company relied more on celebrity and influencer endorsements in richer countries. However this finding could have been skewed by the high use of celebrity endorsements in South Africa in particular where 93.3% of posts included such an endorsement the study authors said.

The present study looked at 849 posts from McDonald's Instagram advertising from September to December 2019 for 15 countries. The countries were grouped by 2019 World Bank classifications:

Higher-income countries: the U.S. Australia Canada the U.K. United Arab Emirates Portugal and Panama

Upper-middle-income countries: Romania Lebanon Malaysia Brazil and South Africa

Lower-middle income countries: Indonesia Egypt and India

Instagram accounts had on average 2.1 million followers each for those targeting lower-middle income countries 3.5 million for those targeting upper-middle-income countries and 4.4 million for those targeting higher-income countries.

The study sample represented approximately 25% of all McDonald's official Instagram accounts. As such Cassidy and colleagues acknowledged a major limitation of their study was uneven sampling meaning that the data may not be extrapolated to represent all countries with McDonald's.

They also noted that McDonald's chains operate differently in various countries.

However a surprising newcomer is looking to take over the abandoned storefronts and revitalize them. According to a recent report by Eat This Not That Shawarma Press has opened up several locations inside of Walmarts and further expansion could be in the cards.

A previous partnership between McDonald's and Walmart put 700 fully-equipped restaurants inside of retail stores around the country but they all began closing down about a decade ago. In many cases other fast-food chains have tried to take the spaces for themselves with varying degrees of success but none quite like Shawarma Press. The franchise is a rising star in the fast-food game and a foothold in Walmart stores could be a quantum leap forward for the brand.

Shawarma Press is well known in parts of Texas already. It serves a ""fusion"" style take on shawarma – a Middle Eastern dish consisting of thinly sliced meat roasted on a cone and cut for bowls platters salads or wraps. Shawarma Press takes these variations even further with the Tandoori Press Tex-Mex Shawarma and other spins on the classic meal.

Shawarma Press has seen some rapid expansion over the last five years and it is only expected to rise higher. The company's founder and CEO Sawsan Abublan issued a statement to journalists saying that its move into the Walmart Supercenter in Plano Texas is ""expected to be completed in early November"" and that more growth is on the way.

""We were the first establishment to introduce shawarma in the Dallas-Fort-Worth metroplex"" Abublan said. ""Some people are not familiar with it so we explain that 'shawarma' is the wrap and 'press' refers to the grill or griddle used to make the wrap crispy. Customers appreciate that shawarma and the rest of our dishes are made from scratch including Mediterranean staples such as our famous hummus falafel and sauces.""

""We're thrilled by this opportunity to introduce our fast-casual Mediterranean food concept to everyone"" Abublan added. ""With 10 new franchises launching in Walmart and other locations the timing is perfect for us to delight customers with the many delicious flavors and health benefits of Mediterranean food.""

Shawarma Press locations can now be found in Florida Texas and Oklahoma with more popping up all the time. If its partnership with Walmart continues that could leave 700 restaurants for the taking.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXBpdGFsZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNi9uYXZ5LWZvb3RiYWxsLXBsYXllci14YXZpZXItbWNkb25hbGQtb3ZlcmNhbWUtZGlmZmljdWx0LXVwYnJpbmdpbmctdG8tZWFybi1zZXJ2aWNlLWFjYWRlbXktYXBwb2ludG1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Navy football player Xavier McDonald overcame difficult upbringing to earn service academy appointment,"When Navy football player Xavier McDonald returns to St. Petersburg Florida for Christmas he has two families to visit.

Of course McDonald spends as much time as possible with his biological family — mother Bonnie Martinez and four younger siblings. He often sees his father Clarence McDonald Jr. at church as both are members of the City on a Hill congregation.

However home for McDonald these days is with the Compton family in the Northeast section of the city. He moved in with Chris and Amy Compton the summer before his senior year at Northeast High and has maintained a permanent bedroom in the home ever since.

In fact the Comptons began the process of adopting McDonald but he turned 18 years old before all the paperwork was finalized.

As a sophomore at the Naval Academy McDonald now enjoys a level of stability that is a far cry from what he had while in high school. For that he is grateful and the holidays are a time to contemplate how far he’s come and give thanks for the blessings he’s received.

Because the mere fact that McDonald is attending one of the most prestigious institutions in America is “nothing short of incredible” according to his high school football coach. “It’s a testament to what a remarkable person Xavier is” said Jeremy Frioud who was head coach at Northeast High when McDonald starred there.

McDonald overcame an enormously challenging childhood to become a high achiever in both academics and athletics. He somehow managed to excel in both football and track and field while working 30 to 35 hours a week and taking care of four younger siblings.

McDonald took on that heavy responsibility as a freshman in high school after both his parents were incarcerated simultaneously. Clarence McDonald was imprisoned first for domestic violence against Bonnie Martinez who herself was later jailed for a shoplifting offense.

Xavier and his four younger brothers — Kamron Jacob Joshua and Micah — were placed in foster care. Xavier was able to directly look after Kamron who is two years younger because they were together in one foster home. However he also made sure to continually check on Jacob Joshua and Micah who were with a different foster family.

“Midway through my freshman year my parents got into trouble with the law. They had bad situations that led to them being incarcerated and separated from me and my brothers” McDonald said. “I had to grow up really early and really fast. I had to learn how to take care of myself and my brothers too. My parents weren’t around so I had to try to fill their shoes.

“It basically developed me into the person I am now — very mature very caring. I think about my brothers and others before myself.”

Xavier McDonald (rear center-left) with his mother Bonnie Martinez (rear center-right) and younger brothers Kameron (rear left) Jacob (front-left) Joshua (front right) and Micah (rear right).

To help support himself and his siblings McDonald got a job as a cashier at Winn-Dixie. During football season he would ride a bicycle from Northeast High to the grocery store and work from 5:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. He then rode the bike home and studied sometimes until 2 a.m.

Despite the dire situation McDonald was even more determined to succeed. He made the Northeast High varsity football team and started at safety as a skinny sophomore leading the team in tackles that season. He also maintained a 3.5 GPA.

“During that time my parents were away all I could think about was: What can I do to be a role model for my younger brothers? How can I show them that even with all this going on you can still prevail and do great things? You shouldn’t let your situation or surroundings determine what you’re going to be in life” McDonald said.

“That was a really heavy burden on my shoulders. That’s what I constantly thought about and was my motivation every day. I wanted to put myself in position to get into college to show my brothers they could do it as well.”

Frioud described McDonald as “an extremely hard worker who didn’t say a word.” He knew the youngster was a top-notch student and never got into trouble at school. So the coach was surprised and concerned when McDonald did not show up to practice for two straight days. That is when he learned from a guidance counselor that McDonald’s mother was in jail.

“When a kid is getting great grades and doing everything right you just automatically assume they have a great home life” Frioud said. “I was blown away when I found out what Xavier was dealing with. I found him in school the next day and said ‘Listen whatever you need I got you.’ I wanted to do everything in my power to help get the kid through a very tough situation.”

When Xavier (along with Kamron) was moved to a different foster home in Clearwater it was Frioud who made sure he could stay at Northeast High by driving him to school each morning.

Martinez was eventually released and the family was reunited. During that time Frioud would shuttle McDonald to and from Friday night football games.

“I would always buy Xavier food at Wawa before games because I could tell he was not eating” Frioud said. “I would also buy him a ton of food after the games and he wouldn’t eat any of it. I realized he was bringing it home for the younger brothers.”

Helping hands

The Compton family came into McDonald’s life during his junior year. Amy Compton became the Northeast High football team mother when her son Luke was a freshman. He began spending a lot of time at the Compton home which is within walking distance of the high school.

With his mother struggling to make ends meet McDonald moved in with the Comptons and discovered a more structured lifestyle.

“It was a tough transition because we have very strict rules and are very regimented and Xavier had not grown up that way. It was a steep learning curve for a while” said Amy Compton a nurse who works for the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Nobody was happier about the turn of events than Frioud who watched McDonald transform himself into a Division I prospect as a junior.

“It was an absolute godsend that Chris and Amy took Xavier into their home. They have played a pivotal role in this success story” said Frioud noting that McDonald quickly put on significant weight and got much stronger “because he was now eating all the time.”

Chris and Amy Compton who began the process of adopting Xavier McDonald visit with him at the Naval Academy this fall.

Iowa State was the first school to offer McDonald a scholarship and Marshall soon followed. Other offers began rolling in but Frioud made a command decision when Navy assistant Danny O’Rourke showed up at Northeast High.

“I’d never coached a kid special enough to go to the Naval Academy until Xavier came along. I told Danny right away this is a kid that needs to go to the Naval Academy” Frioud said.

Frioud then told McDonald he needed to seriously consider the Annapolis service academy and listen carefully to what O’Rourke had to say. One part of the recruiting pitch stood out: a guaranteed job after graduation.

“I remember Coach O’Rourke was really enthusiastic about how great the Naval Academy was and how it would set me up for life” McDonald said. “Just knowing my future would be secure really meant a lot. I’d never had that type of reassurance before.”

McDonald made an early commitment to Navy and arranged to meet O’Rourke at Northeast High early one morning to submit an application. O’Rourke was surprised when McDonald arrived dripping with sweat and learned a bike was his only mode of transportation. The Navy assistant found out the family situation when McDonald filled in parental information that stated his father was incarcerated and the total family income was less than $20000.

McDonald had to spend the 2019-2020 school year at the Naval Academy Prep School before being officially accepted into the academy. Nobody was happier than O’Rourke when he showed up for plebe summer.

“You have to root for a kid like Xavier who has been through so much” he said. “That kid is going to do great things because he has so much willpower and determination.”

McDonald put on 16 pounds of weight and muscle between his freshman and sophomore seasons at Navy. The 6-foot 205-pound player switched from safety to the outside linebacker position known as striker and started the Houston game. He was also a member of several special teams and finished with 11 tackles in 10 games before being slowed by a late-season injury.

“I don’t know any other Navy football players but I can say with absolute certainty that Xavier is the toughest kid on that team. The amount of mental toughness that kid has shown is unbelievable” Frioud said. “No one overcomes the type of serious adversity Xavier did. And the truth is that no one really knows how bad it got except Xavier who kept it all to himself.

“I’ve never seen a kid who was so determined and so resourceful to find a way to get it done.”

McDonald’s parents neither of whom could be reached for this article are trying to turn their lives around. Clarence McDonald Jr. lives in Largo Florida and works at a food distribution center. Bonnie Martinez lives in St. Petersburg and works as a server at a Chili’s.

Meanwhile Xavier McDonald continues to keep a close eye on his younger brothers. Kamron is 19 years old and working while 16-year-old Jacob is a junior at St. Petersburg High and hoping to earn a college scholarship for basketball. Joshua 15 just is a high school freshman while 12-year-old Micah is in eighth grade.

Chris and Amy Compton consider Xavier one of their children and remain very involved with his life. They traveled to Annapolis for the final home game against East Carolina and Amy is a member of the “Motherhood of the Brotherhood” support group. A devout Christian she thanks God every day for guiding Xavier through turbulent times.

“Xavier has faced challenges in his personal life that are almost unimaginable and the fact he’s accomplished what he has is more than amazing; it’s a miracle” Amy Compton said. “Xavier has done all this on his own which is truly incredible. He’s just a great example that a tough background and difficult circumstances don’t have to define who you are.”

Amy recently gave Xavier permission to get a tattoo and was pleased with what he had inscribed across his chest. It was a line from a verse in Philippians 4:13: “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHkxMDAuY29tL25ld3MvbWNkb25hbGQtcy1jaGluYS1leGVyY2lzZS1iaWtlcy1iMTk4MjU3MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's China adds exercise bikes to its restaurants - and people are baffled,"The McDonald’s menu doesn’t exactly include the healthiest options but it appears as though the fast-food chain in China has added something to its restaurants to try and rectify the problem: exercise bikes.

Ever wanted to do some cycling while chowing down your Big Mac? Now—at least in China—you can!

The workout equipment has been added to two locations with the single-seat bike facing the wall and the pedals being attached to the floor mount.

See it for yourself in action:

The Independent reports that in a statement the fast-food chain revealed that there’s more to the exercise bikes than first meets the eye.

They said: “The Green Charging Bike is an in-restaurant experience currently being tested at two locations in China that is designed to inspire more green behaviours as customers enjoy their McDonald’s favourites.

“The bike generates electricity to power everyday devices like mobile phones and is a part of McDonald’s China’s ‘Upcycle for Good’ project.

“[It is] an initiative focused on creating products with plastic parts from recycled materials.”

It’s definitely an interesting addition and it makes a statement for sure. Even so there are not too many people if any that have ever wanted to do some physical exercise or cardio while they’re eating—especially in public.

It further raises the question of whether people will actually use the bikes as the woman does in the video or if they will all the more likely simply use the station to enjoy their meal as the man sitting behind her does.

Despite the fact that the bike is seemingly the brand’s attempt to make a move in the right direction some poked fun at the exercise equipment.

“Lol you need to be on that bike 7-9 hours to burn half of that meal” one person joked in the comments.

Another person shared “Feeling less McGuilty.”

Others compared it to an episode of Black Mirror.

“Thanks Black Mirror” one person said plainly."

Following a high rate of adverse experience-related dropouts Merck called it quits Monday on a Phase III trial of its anti-TIGIT antibody vibostolimab and anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda in skin cancer.

The late-stage study was evaluating vibostolimab as an adjuvant treatment to Keytruda in patients with resected high-risk melanoma. The investigational anti-TIGIT antibody works by restoring antitumor activity by blocking the TIGIT receptor from binding to its ligands to help T lymphocytes destroy tumor cells.

A pre-planned analysis revealed the high rate of dropouts primarily due to immune-mediated adverse events making it “highly unlikely that the trial could achieve a statistically significant improvement” in recurrence-free survival.

Based on the recommendation of an independent data monitoring committee Merck said it is unblinding the study to offer Keytruda alone to patients who had been receiving the combination treatment and sharing the results with the scientific community and regulatory agencies.

Keytruda is currently approved in two skin cancer indications for patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma and as an adjuvant for certain stages following surgery. Merck continues efforts to move its blockbuster anti-PD-1 therapy up to an earlier line of treatment. The company is pursuing an ongoing Phase III study combining Keytruda with Moderna’s individualized neoantigen therapy V940 in patients with resected high-risk melanoma.

“We continue to ask the tough questions in an effort to fully explore the potential of novel coformulations and combinations that build on the foundation of Keytruda with a goal to improve upon current standards of care and help even more patients with cancer” Marjorie Green head of oncology for Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

The Keytruda-vibostolimab coformulation is in ongoing Phase III trials for lung cancer. Merck pointed out in Monday’s announcement that interim safety reviews have not resulted in any study modifications in these studies.

In December 2023 the company announced the combination treatment failed to meet endpoints in a Phase II study of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients with progressive disease after treatment with immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

Monday Merck & Co Inc (NYSE:MRK) announced the discontinuation of the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation arm of the Phase 3 KeyVibe-010 trial.

The trial evaluates the investigational coformulation of vibostolimab and Keytruda (pembrolizumab) compared to Keytruda alone as adjuvant treatment for patients with resected high-risk melanoma (Stage IIB-IV).

Data from a pre-planned analysis showed that the primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival (RFS) met the pre-specified futility criteria.

A higher discontinuation rate of all adjuvant therapy by patients was observed in the coformulation arm versus the Keytruda-only arm primarily due to immune-mediated adverse experiences. Thus it is highly unlikely that the trial could achieve a statistically significant improvement in RFS.

Based on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) Merck is unblinding the study and recommends that patients receiving the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation be offered the option to be treated with Keytruda monotherapy.

Data analysis from this study is ongoing.

Ongoing Phase 3 studies evaluating the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation in lung cancer include KeyVibe-003 KeyVibe-006 KeyVibe-007 and KeyVibe-008.

Interim external data monitoring committee safety reviews have not resulted in safety-related study modifications.

Last week Merck’s Phase 3 KEYNOTE-B21 trial of Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment with or without radiotherapy did not meet its primary endpoint of disease-free survival (DFS) for newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients after surgery with curative intent.

The study’s other primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) was not formally tested since DFS did not reach superiority.

May 13 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK) known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada today announced the discontinuation of the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation arm of the Phase 3 KeyVibe-010 trial. The trial is evaluating the investigational coformulation of vibostolimab an anti-TIGIT antibody and pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy compared to KEYTRUDA alone as adjuvant treatment for patients with resected high-risk melanoma (Stage IIB-IV). At a pre-planned analysis data showed that the primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival (RFS) met the pre-specified futility criteria. A higher rate of discontinuation of all adjuvant therapy by patients in the coformulation arm versus the KEYTRUDA-only arm primarily due to immune-mediated adverse experiences rendered it highly unlikely that the trial could achieve a statistically significant improvement in RFS. Based on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) Merck is unblinding the study and recommends that patients receiving the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation be offered the option to be treated with KEYTRUDA monotherapy. Data analysis from this study is ongoing. Results will be shared with the scientific community and communicated to regulatory agencies.

""Through our clinical development program we continue to ask the tough questions in an effort to fully explore the potential of novel coformulations and combinations that build on the foundation of KEYTRUDA with a goal to improve upon current standards of care and help even more patients with cancer"" said Dr. Marjorie Green senior vice president and head of oncology global clinical development Merck Research Laboratories. ""We are grateful to the patients and investigators for their participation and will leverage insights from this trial as we rapidly advance our diverse pipeline of novel mechanisms including further study of this coformulation in lung cancer.""

Merck is committed to the development of new treatment options for patients with melanoma including in earlier stages of disease which build upon the current standard of care. The program includes the ongoing Phase 3 V940-001 study in collaboration with Moderna evaluating V940 (mRNA-4157) an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy (INT) in combination with KEYTRUDA as adjuvant treatment in patients with resected high-risk (Stage IIB-IV) melanoma.

In the U.S. KEYTRUDA has two approved indications in melanoma: for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB IIC or III melanoma following complete resection.

Story continues

Vibostolimab is Merck’s investigational anti-TIGIT antibody that restores antitumor activity by blocking the TIGIT receptor from binding to its ligands (CD112 and CD155) thereby activating T lymphocytes that help destroy tumor cells. Merck has an extensive clinical development program evaluating the safety and efficacy of the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation alone and in combination with other agents in over 3000 patients.

Ongoing Phase 3 studies evaluating the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation in lung cancer which are routinely monitored by external data monitoring committees include KeyVibe-003 KeyVibe-006 KeyVibe-007 and KeyVibe-008. Interim external data monitoring committee safety reviews have not resulted in any safety-related study modifications to date. No changes to these studies are anticipated based on the KeyVibe-010 findings.

KeyVibe-010 is a randomized double-blind active comparator-controlled Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05665595) evaluating a coformulation of vibostolimab and pembrolizumab (MK-7684A) versus KEYTRUDA alone as adjuvant treatment for patients with resected high-risk Stage IIB-IV melanoma. The trial’s primary endpoint is RFS. Key secondary endpoints include distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and overall survival (OS). The study enrolled 1594 patients who were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive:

Vibostolimab/pembrolizumab coformulation (pembrolizumab 200 mg/20 mL and vibostolimab 200 mg intravenously [IV] every 3 three weeks [Q3W] for up to 17 cycles); or

Pembrolizumab (adult patients receive 200 mg and adolescent patients ≥40 kg receive 2 mg/kg [up to a maximum of 200 mg] IV Q3W for up to 17 cycles).

About melanoma

Melanoma the most serious form of skin cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells. The rates of melanoma have been rising over the past few decades with more than 330000 new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2022. In the U.S. skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed and melanoma accounts for a large majority of skin cancer deaths. It is estimated there will be more than 100000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed and more than 8000 deaths resulting from the disease in the U.S. in 2024.

About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical program

Finding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers Merck is studying KEYTRUDA in earlier disease states with more than 25 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.

About vibostolimab

Vibostolimab (MK-7684) is an investigational humanized anti-TIGIT antibody discovered and developed by Merck. Vibostolimab restores antitumor activity by blocking the TIGIT receptor from binding to its ligands (CD112 and CD155) thereby activating T lymphocytes that help destroy tumor cells. The coformulation of vibostolimab and pembrolizumab and is being evaluated in a wide range of cancers including lung other solid tumors and blood cancers.

About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection 100 mg

KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands PD- L1 and PD-L2 thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA

Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1 blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway thereby removing inhibition of the immune response potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions which may be severe or fatal can occur in any organ system or tissue can affect more than one body system simultaneously and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes creatinine and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting monitor blood cortisol at baseline prior to surgery and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies including infection. Institute medical management promptly including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA including fatal (0.1%) Grade 4 (0.3%) Grade 3 (0.9%) and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.

Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA and 77% had resolution.

Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC including fatal (0.2%) Grade 4 (0.3%) and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients.

Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)

Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) acute and chronic GVHD hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

Previous research attentions are mainly devoted to applying meta-structures to tailor light in free space and develop relevant devices and applications. However recent researches are revealing the prominent potential of leveraging subwavelength meta-structured waveguides to enable exotic waveguiding phenomena and design novel waveguide-based devices.

For instance photonic integrated circuits are hatching as a promising candidate to revolutionize conventional integrated electronic circuits for its exceptional advantages such as broad bandwidth high operation speed and low power consumption. Nevertheless as the most fundamental building block of integrated photonics conventional optical waveguides still encounter challenges in terms of bulk footprint compromised light-matter interaction efficiency and restrained available functionalities. Fortunately the concept of meta-waveguides can be adopted here to open a new avenue towards powerful manipulation of guided light in subwavelength scale infusing new degrees of freedom into waveguide landscapes to dramatically boost device performance and enable novel functionalities.

In a new paper published on the journal of ‘Light: Science & Applications’ a team of scientists from China United States and Italy have presented a comprehensive review article offering a panorama on the optic of meta-waveguides. Latest advances on various subwavelength meta-structured waveguides are systematically cataloged encompassing a broad class of photonic devices and systems that ally metamaterials and metasurfaces with diverse optical waveguides (dielectric/ plasmonic/ optical fibers). Brief physical fundamentals with explicit design methods (including both forward and inverse design tutorials) and representative applications for meta-waveguides are comprehensively summarized. The authors highlighted “how incorporating the concepts of meta-optics with waveguide technologies can propel photonic integrated circuits into new heights by providing versatile efficient coupling interfaces novel on-chip optical signal processing paradigms and diverse platforms for sensing imaging and artificial intelligence”.

Figure 1 briefly introduces the zoology of meta-waveguide family. A plethora of

applications are prototyped on this flexible playground including for instance metasurface-patterned dielectric waveguides forward designed metamaterial waveguides metasurface- or metamaterial-hybrid optical fibers meta-structures- assisted plasmonic waveguides and inverse designed metamaterial waveguides to name a few.

As illustrated in Figure 2a meta-waveguides can be classified via either design methods or underpinning waveguide platforms.

“On the one hand meta-waveguides can be conceived by physical intuition-based approaches (namely forward design henceforth) by leveraging the toolbox of metasurfaces and metamaterials with waveguide optics.”

“On the other hand we can also use inverse design which relies on computer optimizations (see Figure 2b) to develop free-formed analog (curvilinear boundaries) or digital (with relatively regular boundaries) metamaterial waveguides.”

Photonic structures with subwavelength devised details are canonical to meta-waveguides. Taking two-dimensional periodic silicon segments as an instance (see Figure 2c) the meta-waveguides should be modeled as a designer effective medium which is different from the photonic bandgap theory found in photonic crystals or scalar diffraction theory used in non-subwavelength gratings.

“Despite the concept of meta-waveguides is still in its infancy exciting progress are hatching with bright perspectives and profound potential applications. As conceptually illustrated in Figure 3 the advancement of meta-waveguides can not only extend meta-optics to the realm of guided electromagnetic waves and waveguide technology but also promise to reshape the landscapes of photonic integrated circuits and massive emergent applications” as the scientists envisaged.

Meta-waveguides may further venture photonic integrated circuits and many relevant applications in biomedical sensing imaging and detection into new territories.

While luxury fashion names like Gucci and Ralph Lauren are stepping into the metaverse the internet's next iteration is also opening its doors to smaller creators -- case in point a 28-year-old digital clothing designer is making top dollar on the biggest metaverse platform in Asia according to a BBC report.

South Korea-based Zepeto has nearly a quarter of a billion users and its app allows people to create avatars or digital representations of themselves. But avatars need clothes and more than 1.6 billion virtual fashion items have been sold on Zepeto the BBC reported.

Among the most well-known users in the platform's fashion world is Monica Louise a Canadian woman known as Monica Quin who designs and sells digital apparel.

The BBC report published Thursday highlighted Louise in a broader story about the metaverse saying she earns ""an impressive six-figure salary"" through her Zepeto avatar.

Louise's dresses tops and other items are sold using Zepeto's currency called zems and are priced from one to five zems each. Zepeto users purchase zems with real money and creators receive $106 for every sale worth 5000 zems.

""There are clothes that I cannot afford to wear in real life but in the digital world I can buy all of them"" Louise told the BBC. ""I think that's one huge factor why I'm really drawn into this.""

Zepeto started three years ago and last month landed a $1 billion valuation in a funding round led by Japanese conglomerate Softbank. HYBE the company that manages K-pop sensation BTS was among the investors and poured in about $41 million.

About 70% of its users are female including teenagers. Chief Strategy Officer Rudy Lee told the BBC that Zepeto is the first social network for a lot of its users.

Zepeto also has other partnerships that feature digital representations of clothes from Ralph Lauren and Gucci. And fashion has been the focus in other portions of the metaverse. Virtual land in the Fashion District on Decentraland recently sold for $2.4 million.

""We think the Fashion District purchase is like buying on Fifth Avenue back in the 1800s … or the creation of Rodeo Drive"" Lorne Sugarman the CEO of Metaverse Group told Insider about his company's deal announced in November."

EAST RUTHERFORD NJ—Does anybody want to play some football? It’s the question pretty much everybody in the New York Jets organization is asking aloud right about now.

With COVID-19 ravaging the entire NFL and Northern New Jersey the Jets will be without a plethora of players when they welcome the Jacksonville Jaguars to MetLife Stadium for a Week 16 matchup.

The one showcase that’s still officially on however is the main event the one that features the top two picks from the 2021 NFL draft: Zach Wilson and Trevor Lawrence.

Jets vs. Jaguars game info

New York Jets (3-11)

(3-11) Jacksonville Jaguars (2-12)

(2-12) NFL Week 16 Dec. 26 2021 1 p.m. ET CBS

MetLife Stadium East Rutherford NJ

Just one game separates the two teams in the standings which means this one means a lot as it relates to the 2022 NFL draft order.

Head-to-head does not matter as it relates to draft order; instead strength of schedule is the first thing to look to if the Jets and Jags are tied up in the win-loss column. Right now the Jets’ .504 strength of schedule winning percentage does not get the job done against the Jags’ .508.

Nonetheless this one could go a long way in determining who picks closer to the top of this coming offseason’s NFL draft.

The Jets will wear their Stealth Black uniforms and the game will be broadcast on CBS at 1 p.m. ET.

Jets vs. Jaguars history

The Jaguars lead the all-time series 8-7.

Jacksonville currently holds a slim one-game lead over New York on the strength of two consecutive victories.

In October 2019 the Jags knocked off the Jets by a final of 29-15. Current Jet Keelan Cole opened the scoring with a 6-yard touchdown from Gardner Minshew.

A Jags’ 31-12 win in September 2018 saw the 1-2 Jets drop to 1-3 in Todd Bowles’s final season as head coach. Blake Bortles threw for a cool 388 yards and two touchdowns while rookie Sam Darnold went for just 167 yards and a score.

The Jets had won the previous four matchups prior to the Bortles breakout in 2018 a streak that stretched from September 2011 to October 2017.

Jets vs. Jaguars odds ( FanDuel Sportsbook

Spread : Jets -1.5 (-110) Jaguars +1.5 (-110)

: Jets -1.5 (-110) Jaguars +1.5 (-110) Moneyline : Jets -122 Jaguars +104

: Jets -122 Jaguars +104 Over/Under: 41 (O: -110 U: -100)

Don’t adjust your phones or computer monitors; you are seeing things correctly. The New York Jets are favored in a football game.

Officially per FanDuel Sportsbook the Jets are a 1.5-point favorite in this one. But considering the game is in MetLife Stadium the Jags would most likely be the slim favorites if it were played at a neutral site.

Jets vs. Jaguars injury report

New York Jets

Elijah Riley (Concussion): Out

Jamison Crowder (Calf): Doubtful

George Fant (Knee): Questionable

Bryce Hall (Illness non-COVID): Questionable

C.J. Mosley (Back): Questionable

Sheldon Rankins (Knee): Questionable

Quinnen Williams (Shoulder): Questionable

The topic of the day revolves around the injury report and Reserve/COVID-19 list. Never look at only the injury report in the NFL these days.

In addition to the above that shows Elijah Riley out Jamison Crowder doubtful and a host of other players questionable key contributors such as Alijah Vera-Tucker Elijah Moore Michael Carter II Ashtyn Davis Foley Fatukasi John Franklin-Myers Ryan Griffin and Corey Davis will all miss the content while stuck on IR or the Reserve/COVID-19 list.

And this doesn’t even take into account the long-term IR players such as Carl Lawson Vinny Curry Marcus Maye Lamarcus Joyner and Mekhi Becton.

Jacksonville Jaguars

Brandon Lindor (Quad): Questionable

Lerentee McCray (Ankle): Questionable

The Jags come into the game much healthier as just two players appear on the injury report (questionable).

Nonetheless they too have several players dealing with COVID-19-related absences. As of this moment Josh Allen Travis Etienne Jr. Laviska Sheanault Jr. Ben Bartch and Jordan Smith are on the team’s Reserve/COVID-19 list.

Jets’ keys to victory

Have enough players to play?

Quite honestly there isn’t much strategy involved as of this moment. With so many players scheduled to miss the game the personnel is so drastically different that it forces league rankings and identities to become a non-factor.

Jets vs. Jaguars prediction

New York Jets 26 Jacksonville Jaguars 18

In a bit of a shocker I’ll take the New York Jets in a 26-18 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. Expect Braxton Berrios and Keelan Cole to have big games along with Michael Carter on the ground.

It’ll be tough for Zach Wilson as he’ll be dropping back without his two starting guards and perhaps without George Fant (currently questionable to play) but the Jags defense isn’t anything that should worry Mike LaFleur.

There are some who feel as though the Jets should sit their rookie quarterback courtesy of the exhibition-type feel to the game.

Nonsense.

This is football and this is a kid quarterback that needs confidence. Considering these are the Jaguars it’s a no-doubter to play the kid if only to give him the chance to right the ship and get rolling a bit at this level.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uZmwvamV0cy9uZXdzL25ldy15b3JrLWpldHMtcXVhcnRlcmJhY2stemFjaC13aWxzb24tY29tbWVuZHMtamFja3NvbnZpbGxlLWphZ3VhcnMtdHJldm9yLWxhd3JlbmNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York Jets QB Zach Wilson commends Trevor Lawrence before facing Jaguars,"New York Jets rookie QB Zach Wilson praised Jacksonville Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence before their first NFL matchup saying he'll be cheering Lawrence on.

Zach Wilson and Trevor Lawrence will face off for the first time in the NFL on Sunday.

Leading up to the Week 16 showdown between the Jets and Jaguars at MetLife Stadium this year's No. 2 overall pick had nothing but positive things to say about the No. 1 overall selection.

""He's a good dude a cool guy to be around"" Wilson told reporters on Friday. ""It's going to be a fun matchup because we'll be playing for hopefully a long time. It's going to be cool just to follow his career and match up against those guys. I hope he does well.""

Wilson revealed that the two signal-callers got to know one another during combine training leading up to the 2021 NFL draft.

Considering these rookie quarterbacks won't literally play against each other between the lines on Sunday Wilson said that he'll be able to root for Lawrence.

""We can both have success"" Wilson explained. ""Yes do I want our team to beat the Jaguars? Yeah I do. I hope we go out there and play well. But I don't look at this as me versus Trevor. Or my stats versus Trevor's. It has nothing to do with that.

""It's not like we're fighting for a starting position on the same team we can cheer each other on.""

Both Wilson and Lawrence have struggled at times during their rookie years dealing with their own adversity in New York and Jacksonville respectively.

Lawrence has thrown 14 interceptions this year tied for the most in the NFL this season. Wilson isn't too far behind with 11 picks. You have to figure that number would be higher as well if he didn't miss four games with a knee injury.

While Wilson has dealt with a barrage of injuries around him on offense (and a COVID-19 outbreak) Lawrence is battling the challenges of a head coaching change midway through the season after Urban Meyer was fired recently.

Rookie numbers aside Wilson commended his highly-touted counterpart admiring the fact that Lawrence has always handled his expectations.

""He's done an amazing job of not listening to the noise and the expectations never got too high for him and he just handles his business"" Wilson said. ""Coming out of high school as the number one quarterback college as the number one quarterback and then the NFL that's tough. He's done it. I've got a lot of respect for him.""

Sunday's contest will have a signficant impact on where these two teams pick in the 2022 NFL draft with only three games remaining in the regular season.

Jacksonville (2-12) is currently in the No. 1 slot for a second straight season per Tankathon. Meanwhile New York (3-11) is presently scheduled to pick fourth and eighth overall (the second pick courtesy of the Seahawks and the Jamal Adams trade).

I was four years old it was 1996 and my parents had just driven myself my brother and my grandma (Magaw as we called her) from the Texas panhandle to the Las Vegas Strip to celebrate Christmas in style.

We weren't staying at The Mirage.

In fact we were on the far end of the Strip at the MGM Grand but I can still remember if just for a fleeting second how magical it felt to enter that larger-than-life space. Above me the glass atrium felt like a spaceship people from all walks of life floated by in every direction slot machines were dinging and rattling coins were jingling in large plastic buckets and as far as the pictures show — I was enthralled.

But the thing I remember the most were the fish a giant wall of them full of more shapes colors and designs than any little boy from rural cotton-growing ""Friday Night Lights"" West Texas had ever seen. That was the moment when I fell in love with The Mirage — and hotels as a whole.

Now flash forward a quarter of a century and my love for The Mirage hasn't changed. Though I may have ditched my stroller and OshKosh B'gosh overalls every time I visit Las Vegas it's essential for me to walk under that big glass dome and say hi to those fish though now it's usually while I'm in line to check in to the hotel instead of gawking from a distance.

When The Mirage opened its doors for the first time back in 1989 three years before I came into existence it changed the world — at least the hotel world.

Set on 77 acres Las Vegas mogul Steve Wynn set out to build a megaresort. And he did. At the time it was the largest hotel on the planet and it redefined what a resort could with its sprawling size seemingly endless dining options toned down but visible theme (technically Polynesian in case you were wondering) and overall sense of luxury.

It also opened up Las Vegas as a family-friendly destination thanks to its over-the-top erupting volcano Siegfried & Roy's magic show featuring white tigers and the chance to temporarily escape the mundaneness of everyday life to feel like you and your family entered a tropical paradise hidden in the middle of the Nevada desert. A mirage if you will.

Since that first trip to Las Vegas back when my wallet (also OshKosh) only held a library card I've returned countless times. And in a way over the years it feels like I've grown up with The Mirage which became an MGM property in 2000 and was just acquired by Hard Rock International.

On those earlier trips (mostly work trips my parents let me tag along on) we'd slip into The Mirage for a buffet free-for-all or step out on the Strip to watch the volcano. My parents would usually let me pick out a slot machine that ""felt right"" and one would play $5 while the other stood back with me on the kid-designated carpet.

The summer before my senior year of high school my relationship with The Mirage ascended to a whole new level. My mom booked a massive suite to stay in for a work trip and let me invite a friend. Over the course of a long weekend we lounged in the dry summer heat by the pool drank Dr Pepper from champagne glasses saw ""The Beatles LOVE"" by Cirque du Soleil and generally acted like we owned the place. It was a great story to tell our friends back in the sleepy town of Levelland Texas.

Before I knew it I was 21 and my wallet — now Coach maybe American Eagle — had my driver's license my college ID and an MGM player's card. Then I was drinking Champagne from a champagne glass and feeling too scared to sit down at a blackjack table. I'd spend hours playing penny slots with my dad my mom anchored down at a craps table.

It was at The Mirage the first time I won big — $800 on an Ellen-themed slot machine. And it was Howie Mandle's voice at the Deal or No Deal machine tucked away between the bathroom and the ticket office that frequently convinced me to say ""no deal"" sometimes for better and sometimes for worse.

For Christmas of 2019 my family shared a suite at The Mirage the last time we'd see each other for more than 15 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the silly memories of 2 a.m. steak and eggs me still trying to learn to play craps from my mom and everyone recounting their antics the next morning that held me through that long separation.

And then just this month we evolved again. Celebrating my best friend's 30th birthday 15 friends gathered yet again in a two-bedroom suite on top of The Mirage. This time I saw my favorite casino through the blurry lens of old college friends celebrating the privilege of getting older.

We danced with cowboys in the sportsbook to a live country band; we scouted out the machines that ""felt right"" just like my parents taught me; and we had a moment when we looked around and realized how weird it was that we'd all ""grown up.""

Mostly we talked about how annoying it was that I knew every nook and cranny across the resort's 77 acres.

Soon we'll say goodbye to The Mirage and hello to the Hard Rock Las Vegas. The volcano will have one more triumphant explosion and then be paved over to build a larger-than-life building in the shape of a guitar.

After that who knows what next? I don't even know what's next for me. We've aged and we've changed — and we'll change again. But what won't change and I'm certain of it are the memories I made over the years in the hotel that will always feel like my hotel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vZW4tZ2IvdHJhdmVsL2Rpc2NvdmVyL3Byb3BlcnR5L05ldmFkYS1VUy9MYXMtVmVnYXMvRGVsYW5vLUxhcy1WZWdhc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delano Las Vegas | The Hotel Collection | Amex Travel GB,"Fine Hotels + Resorts:

If Hammon chooses to accept either the Liberty or Aces job it’s expected to take place in the lead up to the WNBA’s January free agency sources tell The Athletic.

The Liberty head coaching job is currently open after New York and Walt Hopkins parted ways in early December. The Aces job is currently filled by Bill Laimbeer who has coached in the WNBA since 2002. If Hammon were to accept the Aces job Laimbeer would step aside and potentially fill a different organizational role sources said.

Hammon played 16 seasons in the WNBA the first eight with the New York Liberty and the second eight with the San Antonio Stars. She retired in 2014 and in 2018 when MGM Grand Resorts International bought the Stars and moved the team to Las Vegas renaming the franchise the Aces.

Since becoming an assistant coach on Gregg Popovich’s Spurs staff in 2014 Hammon has had a lot of firsts. In July 2015 Hammon became the first-ever female to serve as head coach in NBA Summer League leading the Spurs’ summer team to a championship. In 2018 she became the first woman to ever be interviewed for an NBA head coaching job when she spoke to the Milwaukee Bucks. On Dec. 30 2020 Hammon served as acting head coach when Popovich was ejected in a game against the Los Angeles Lakers.

Last offseason Hammon interviewed with the Orlando Magic and Portland Trail Blazers. She became the first woman to reach the finalist stage of an NBA head coaching search process when she was one of the last candidates to meet with Portland ownership before the hiring of Chauncey Billups.

In January 2021 Raiders owner Mark Davis bought the Aces and in May the franchise hired Nikki Fargas to be the team president. Both Davis and Fargas have expressed how important it is to the Aces to be well connected with former players from every iteration of the Aces (Utah Starzz San Antonio Silver Stars and the San Antonio Stars). As a part of those efforts the Aces retired Hammon’s No. 25 jersey this past September.

“It’s another huge honor. I really appreciate the Aces digging back into the program’s history and honoring the people that came before” she said. “I think that’s how you build culture. That’s how you build character within your organization. And I think Mark Davis and the ownership group trying to really make it a family affair and bring in the previous organizations and the players that impacted not just the Aces but the Stars and the WNBA and honoring that legacy is super special.”

The Liberty parted ways with Hopkins in early December after two seasons with the franchise. Hopkins worked closely with GM Jonathan Kolb on a “rebuild hybrid” that resulted in the franchise going 12-20 and making the playoffs in 2021 after going 2-20 in the 2020 bubble season.

The Aces have finished first in the WNBA West over the past two years with A’ja Wilson winning regular-season MVP honors in 2020. Laimbeer’s style has relied far more on interior play and getting to the free-throw line while much of the rest of the league Liberty included have drawn their offense out to lean heavily on 3-pointers. It is worth noting that the Aces GM job is currently open after former GM Dan Padover left to be the Atlanta Dream GM in October.

What would Hammon returning to the WNBA represent?

Chantel Jennings senior WNBA reporter: She has always been a name that would be thrown around in vacancies as a “dream hire” so for a franchise — either the Liberty or Aces — to land a coach who is not only a WNBA alumnus but also a current NBA assistant who appeared to be on track to be an NBA head coach would be quite the coup.

Franchises have talked a lot about getting former players involved in coaching and the front office but Hammon’s return to the league would be a huge boost in the 26th season for both validation of the league and its publicity.

Where would Hammon be a better fit?

Jennings: Both franchises are in different spots but she would help both in their current existences.

In New York she’d be tasked with developing a team around one of the most exciting young guards in the league — Sabrina Ionescu — while continuing to build the franchise out of an extended losing period. With the Aces she’d be handed the keys to a car that already has a lot of the pieces in place but has yet to get over the championship hump.",,,

You can get stories like this one straight to your inbox every Thursday morning by subscribing here.

If you didn’t know semiconductor chips were important before the pandemic you do now.

Also known as “microchips” these little bits of tech form the brains behind new cars phones computers gaming consoles and countless other products we rely on everyday (which are now all abruptly in short supply).

Now IBM and Samsung have unveiled a new microchip design that promises radically faster more efficient chips — and a big upgrade to all of our tech that relies on them.

The challenge: Semiconductor chips contain tiny gates called “transistors” that control the flow of electricity. This is what allows a traditional computer to process information using a binary on/off code. (If a gate’s open that’s a “1.” If it’s closed that’s a “0.”)

To make faster more powerful computers we need microchips with more transistors but to keep the chips well micro we’ve had to keep packing more and more transistors into the same area.

We’re now hitting a wall in the amount of transistors we can pack onto a microchip.

The end of the line: In 1975 semiconductor pioneer Gordon Moore famously predicted that we’d be able to double the number of transistors on microchips every two years and that projection — “Moore’s Law” — proved accurate for decades thanks to heroic efforts by engineers.

We’re now hitting a wall in the amount of transistors we can pack onto a microchip though. Making them smaller is just becoming physically impossible — the ones we have today are so small that 1000 of them laid end-to-end are only the width of a human hair.

“The fact is when they’re talking about building physical entities like semiconductors and transistors you can only go so small” Robert Sutor chief quantum exponent at IBM told Electronic Products.

“Atoms have a certain size and you’re approaching the almost atomic molecular distances at this point” he continued. “You’re limited by that.”

IBM and Samsung have unveiled a new microchip design that promises radically faster more efficient chips.

The idea: IBM and Samsung’s new design stacks transistor components vertically on a microchip with electricity flowing up and down rather than the traditional horizontal design with electricity flowing from side to side.

They call their approach “Vertical-Transport Nanosheet Field Effect Transistor” (VTFET) and they say it could not only allow for more transistors on a microchip but also make the flow of electricity through them more efficient.

https://youtu.be/OF3Zwfu6Ngc

Compared to today’s standard transistor design (called FinFET) devices with VTFET chips would have a “two times improvement in performance or an 85 percent reduction in energy use” according to IBM.

That means batteries could last way longer (or be much smaller) and computers could produce much less waste heat which impacts performance and requires loud fans to keep the system cool.

In other words: smartphone batteries that last a week rather than a day.

“Scaling silicon is not the only way to get lower power and better performance.” Valeria Bertacco

The bigger picture: IBM and Samsung haven’t said when they plan to start producing chips with the stacked transistor design so we don’t know when they might actually start showing up in your phone or watch but it typically takes a few years to go from the drawing board to figuring out how to mass produce chips and building devices capable of using them.

However the stacked design and more densely packed transistors are not the only ways we’re going to keep computer power growing in the decades to come.

“Scaling silicon is not the only way to get lower power and better performance” Valeria Bertacco director of the University of Michigan’s Applications Driving Architectures research center told EE Times in 2019. “It was just the easiest way until 10 years ago.”

Replacing silicon with other materials such as graphene might unleash big upgrades in performance too.

Another way is to specialize microchips for specific tasks and divide the computer’s labor.

“Hardware customized for particular domains can be much more efficient and use far fewer transistors enabling applications to run tens to hundreds of times faster” MIT researcher Tao Schardl told MIT News in 2020.

More efficient software and better algorithms could also allow progress to continue even if transistor numbers don’t keep increasing. Replacing the semiconductor materials such as silicon in microchips with other materials such as graphene might unleash big upgrades in performance too.

Then there’s the ultimate game-changer: quantum computers which aim to do away with transistor-laden microchips entirely. Instead they encode information in entangled particles that can represent 1s 0s or both simultaneously which dramatically increases the computer’s potential processing power.

But today’s silicon microchip electronics aren’t going to be replaced by quantum versions or even graphene any time soon so in the near-term we’ll have to rely on clever new designs to grind out another round of Moore’s Law improvements.

May 17 2022 - Semiconductor Stocks in India? Here's a Watchlist for You to Track...

Semiconductor Stocks in India? Here's a Watchlist for You to Track...

Editor's note: Semiconductor stocks are a hot trend in equity market today.

In December 2021 we were quick enough to identify this megatrend and wrote about the top semiconductor stocks.

A lot has happened since we last wrote to you in December 2021. In this updated article we take you through the recent developments.

Continue reading...

If you're looking for growth stocks semiconductor stocks should be the first place you should look.

Why?

2021 and 2022 were good years for the semiconductor industry as demand surged. However the pandemic caused disruptions which throttled supply.

The demand-supply mismatch resulted in semiconductor stocks seeing a sharp rally and touching their all-time highs.

And here's the thing...

There are not one or two drivers of technological advancements where semiconductor chips are proving their worth.

The transformation of auto sector as we undergo an electric vehicle (EV) revolution.

5G rollout.

Smartphones smart TVs and other electronic items.

These were just a few examples but there are more.

As industries rush towards digitization demand for semiconductors will only grow more.

So if you think the semiconductor theme is just temporary and might be over soon think again.

The government has lined up a host of initiatives for local semiconductor manufacturing. Currently India meets its semiconductor requirements through imports.

The demand-supply mismatch is here to stay and semiconductor stocks will make headlines yet again.

The companies involved in this space directly or indirectly are still very few. This can change very quickly and the right pick could be the x-factor for your portfolio.

Recently we wrote about the top semiconductor companies and why they should be on your watchlist.

Top Semiconductor Stocks in India

This list is still extremely relevant today.

While these stocks have the potential to deliver huge gains you should be very careful about which semiconductor stock to invest in.

There's been another major development since we wrote about semiconductor stocks in December 2021.

Companies have submitted plans for setting up fab units (a technical word for a plant where semiconductors are produced) while many have submitted proposals for designing and packaging semiconductors.

Global semiconductor giants are showing interest to set shop in India and giving India's semiconductor plans a much-needed push.

For instance international semiconductor consortium ISMC will invest a whopping US$3 bn in setting up a semiconductor chip-making plant in Karnataka.

Believe it or not developments in this space are happening at a fast pace.

India's Semiconductor Stocks to watch Out For...

The global shortage of semiconductor chips has triggered concerns as companies around the world fail to meet rising demand for a wide range of essential as well as modern tech products.

The shortage has intensified over the past couple of months.

Semiconductors are components needed for manufacturing cars televisions refrigerators washing machines personal computers laptops mobiles etc.

These components are made from silicon and fit into microcircuits that power various electronic goods and components.

These little chips are so important that tens of thousands of workers must get lines that are a millionth of a meter i.e. one micron wide exactly right. Or else it won't work. The semiconductor chips fail.

Semiconductors play an important role in a variety of fields. For example operating air conditioners improving automobile safety laser treatment in cutting-edge medical care and the list goes on.

While making a list of semiconductor stocks in India there were no surprises. Every stock which had even little exposure to semiconductors has seen a sharp rally.

Why?

The buzz around semiconductors started mainly due to the shortage of semiconductor chips.

Another factor driving semiconductor stocks higher is the Indian government's efforts and support.

The government has announced the PLI scheme for semiconductor industry. This scheme is worth a whopping Rs 760 bn to be invested over the next 5-6 years.

The scheme aims to boost the semiconductor and display manufacturing in India. It will position the country as a global hub for hi-tech production Semiconductor demand in India is most likely to outstrip supply in near future.

As part of the scheme apart from big companies the government will also incentivise startups to design and make semiconductors.

While there are not many companies involved directly in manufacturing semiconductor chips in India there are some indirect plays.

Let's take a look at listed Indian companies engaged in the semiconductor industry.

#1 Tata Elxsi

It was in August this year when the Tata group showcased its ambitious plan to foray into semiconductor manufacturing.

The company's chairman N Chandrasekaran said the group has already pivoted into a number of new businesses like electronics manufacturing 5G network equipment as well as semiconductors.

The Tata group is in talks with at least three state governments in India to invest US$300 m towards a new semiconductor assembly and testing unit. The states are Tamil Nadu Karnataka and Telangana.

The group is also in talks with major international companies including those from Taiwan for its semiconductor chip business.

Tata Elxsi which is a Tata group company is already into the business of semiconductor services that includes artificial intelligence tools and frameworks design solutions and development.

Note that this foray will help the Tata group supply semiconductor chips and other components to Tata Motors and Tata Power apart from other companies across the world.

#2 Dixon Technologies

Dixon Technologies is the biggest manufacturer of LED TVs in India producing TVs for brands like Samsung Panasonic Xiaomi TCL OnePlus and many more. They also manufacture lighting products for companies like Philips Havells Syska Bajaj Wipro Orient and more.

In 2020 the company forayed into information & communications technology (ICT) hardware including laptops desktops tablets and servers and set up a factory in South India.

As chips are quite important for TVs and other electronics which Dixon makes it could set up a chip manufacturing plant in the future.

However the company's CFO said in 2021 that it has no ready plans for now as a chip manufacturing plant is a high capital expenditure investment of US$4-5 m.

To know more about the company check out Dixon Technologies' financial factsheet and latest quarterly results.

#3 ASM Technologies

ASM Technologies provides consulting and product development services in the areas of engineering services and product R&D.

The main clients of ASM Technologies include reputed customers involved in manufacturing of semiconductor equipment and network devices.

As the pace of technological advancement has been very high in these industries the company's clients invest significantly in R&D to stay ahead of competition. This results in recurring revenues for ASM.

ASM Technologies is in the process of expanding its service offerings and has recently forayed into areas of virtual reality (VR) internet of things (IoT) and open edX platform management.

As the company is closely linked to the semiconductor industry its shares have been on a spectacular run this year.

Over 100% gains came in the month of January 2021. In the year gone by shares of the company are up a whopping 600%.

Surprisingly mutual funds FII or DIIs don't hold any stake in the company. In fact as per ASM Technologies' latest shareholding pattern promoters hold majority of the stake.

Update: Recently the company formed a 50:50 joint venture (JV) with Hind High Vacuum (HHV) to undertake design led engineering and manufacturing of tools sub-systems sub-system components and components for the semiconductor and solar industries.

To know more about the company check out ASM Technologies financial factsheet and latest quarterly results.

#4 SPEL Semiconductor

SPEL Semiconductor is engaged in offering electronic integrated circuits (ICs). Its products are used mostly in cell phones computers notebooks and personal digital assistants.

It's facility Natronix is India's first and only semiconductor IC assembly & test facility.

The company's customers are some of the biggest integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) and fabless companies in the US Asia and Europe.

While the company's shares are on a tear this year it has little to offer on the financials front. For the December 2021 quarter the company has posted a loss of Rs 10 m.

This was its sixth consecutive quarter of losses.

Update: When the government invited proposals for semiconductor manufacturing and display plants SPEL Semiconductor registered for semiconductor packaging.

The scheme for establishing semiconductor and display fabs manufacturing facilities was announced last year in December. The first round of applications were invited till 15 February 2022.

#5 Moschip Technologies

Moschip Technologies is a semiconductor and system design company with a focus on turnkey ASICs mixed signal IP semiconductor & product engineering and IoT solutions catering to various industries.

This little-known company has emerged as a leading semiconductor design services company providing various services to clients globally. It has a track record of more than 20 years.

The company has four arms namely Gigacom Semiconductor LLC California USA Gigacom Semiconductor Visakhapatnam FirstPass Semiconductors Hyderabad and Institute of Silicon Systems Hyderabad. Moschip acquired these companies as part of its growth plan to offer the full suite of skillset and expand business geography.

From the lows of Rs 14 touched last year shares of Moschip Technologies surged to Rs 83.55. That's a gain of over 370% in just one year.

After trading in a range shares of the company broke through and gained momentum after the PLI scheme was informed.

Between November 2021 and December 2021 shares of the company gained 85%.

Update: Shares of the company have come under pressure in the past few months amid the broad-based selloff and because of weak quarterly results.

Currently the company continues to focus on semiconductor design semiconductor IP (intellectual properties) and other IoT projects.

To know more about the company check out Moschip Technologies financial factsheet.

#6 Ruttonsha International

This company manufactures semiconductor devices power rectifiers assemblies and semiconductor diodes.

The semiconductor devices which it makes includes diodes rectifiers thyristors among others ranging from 10 amps to 12000 amps with voltage groups ranging from 200 volts to 5000 volts.

In 2005 Ruttonsha International was taken over by Dr Harshad Mehta and Mrs Bhavna H Mehta the promoters of Silicon Power Corporation USA.

Just like other stocks involved in the semiconductor industry shares of Ruttonsha International also saw a spectacular run on the bourses.

Starting 3 December 2021 when the stock was trading at Rs 75 per share it continuously traded in an uptrend and gained over 100% in a month.

Update: The company's one way rally was halted due to the Russia-Ukraine war inflation concerns among other factors which halved the company's stock.

When government invited bids for semiconductor fab units Ruttonsha International registered for making compound semiconductors.

Compound semiconductors are different from silicon ones. While a majority around 80% of the world's semiconductors use silicon the remaining 20% use compound semiconductors.

The company has also acquired 100% stake in Visicon Power Electronics which is in the business of manufacturing silicon carbide (SiC) wafers and power electronic devices through epitaxial process.

This acquisition was done for ease of business operations and widen its product reach across diverse business vertical of semiconductors.

The company has big plans for manufacturing SiC based products in India for which it is setting up a fab unit.

#7 Vedanta

After Tatas the Vedanta group announced to invest a huge sum to make displays and other semiconductor chips in India.

It was announced in December 2021 that the Vedanta group is planning to invest US$20 bn over the next 5-10 years to make displays and other semiconductor chips in India. This investment will be made through Avanstrate Inc. a glass substrate manufacturer in which Vedanta has a controlling stake.

An integrated display fab facility and a separate semiconductor facility will be set up.

Avanstrate is in talks with various states that have experience in electronics including Gujarat Tamil Nadu Maharashtra and Haryana. These states provide incentives over and above the central government's schemes.

Update: Vedanta's investment of US$20 bn is almost double of the Indian government's PLI scheme for semiconductors.

To become India's first chip maker Vedanta is seeking 1000 acres of free land water and power at concessionary and fixed prices among other incentives.

It will form a joint venture (JV) with Taiwan's Foxconn and manufacture semiconductor chips in the 28 nm category.

Vedanta has also proposed setting up a display fab on its own.

Vedanta's core business is mining. But it has ventured into the semiconductor space before.

None of these attempts took off. Vedanta claims it had never shelved these plans and is ready for another go.

It wants to start operations at its display fab by 2024. It also believes its JV with Foxconn can start operations in the chip fab by 2025.

Apart from the above there are few other listed Indian stocks which are directly or indirectly related to the semiconductor industry.

These companies include Solex Energy MIC Electronics Indosolar and Surana Solar.

How India stands to benefit

Note that building a semiconductor ecosystem needs big investments and critical infrastructure to support it. The plants need a continuous supply of electricity and water.

Even a single manufacturing plant can use anything between two and nine gallons of water per day.

It also needs manpower. If we go by estimates the recent PLI scheme could lead to the creation of 35000 jobs apart from one lakh indirect employment opportunities. It could also generate investments to the tune of Rs 17000 bn.

As the chip shortage seems to be far from over and the demand expected to rise India stands to benefit as it has adequate resources water and manpower.

Most emerging technologies have high dependence on semiconductors.

A mobile phone or a consumer appliance or even a vehicle as the pace of innovation increases the use of semiconductors will also increase.

Also in September 2021 India made a deal with Taiwan. This deal allows Taiwan to transfer technology for a chip plant worth an estimated US$7.5 bn in India. These chips would power everything from 5G devices to electric cars.

Meanwhile India will be financing 50% of the chip foundry capex. In addition the facility will enjoy tax breaks and other incentives. This deal is certainly a win-win for both India and Taiwan.

In a recent editorial Co-head of Research at Equitymaster Tanushree Banerjee shared some insights on this topic.

Here's an excerpt...

Currently India imports almost all semiconductors.



Its demand is estimated to reach around US$100 bn by 2025 from about US$24 bn in 2021.



Previous efforts to get companies to invest in the semiconductor space had failed. The complex manufacturing processes requires heavy investments apart from need for supply of uninterrupted clean water and electricity.



India is seen as strong player in chip design. But the companies here have failed to get chip foundries into the country.



The investments in India's semiconductor capacity are expected to grow 4-fold in the next few decades.

Tanushree has identified a tech company in India which is grossly underrated despite its dominant role in semiconductor chip designing.

The company has set up management teams in Taiwan South Korea and Vietnam in recent months seeing the growth potential of this business.

With its disruptive capabilities Tanushree believes the company's future seems far more promising than its past.

In the meantime we recommend you watch the below video where Tanushree shares her views on India's top semiconductor stocks.

In Edge Canary builds for Windows Microsoft has started testing a new feed that introduces native RSS functionality with Collections integration.

Platforms like Google News or Microsoft News have put an end to the classic days of RSS which still powers popular aggregation tools.

Google News Google Discover and Microsoft News are algorithm-based approaches to deliver content to the users and plenty of people have been looking for a way to curate their news feed. Right now if you want to subscribe to the RSS feed you need to rely on RSS readers or use web apps like Feedly.

“We’ve heard it loud and clear” Google said when the feature was reintroduced in Chrome for Android.

Microsoft’s implementation for the same feature is called “followable web” and it’s currently rolling out to select users running Edge Canary. The flag to enable this experimental feature appeared nearly three months ago and it has been reintroduced in the latest update as part of the company’s controlled beta testing.

As the name suggests Followable Web allows users to access a curated feed of updates from their favourite websites using a Collections button within the toolbar. It’s also housed in the Collections panel and articles published by publications will appear in a modern feed when you open the browser next time.

At the moment Edge’s RSS feed feature is part of Collections so you’ll need to tap on the Collections button. In future it’s possible that the RSS feed feature will be moved into the toolbar of the browser with its own button.

Microsoft is also introducing a new “Follow” button which will be located in the address bar of the browser. The sites you visit in Edge will have a “follow” button in the address bar if they have a supported RSS feed and updates from the site will also appear in a new side panel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmV3aXJlLmNvbS9vcGVuLXB1Yi1maWxlcy13aXRob3V0LW1pY3Jvc29mdC1wdWJsaXNoZXItMTA3NDY2OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Open PUB Files Without Microsoft Publisher,"What to Know A .pub file is a Microsoft Publisher file format that's easiest to open with Microsoft Publisher.

If you don't have Publisher you can use LibraOffice Draw CorelDraw or other programs that support the .pub format.

It may also be possible to use Zamzar to convert the .pub file you want to open to another more user-friendly file format.

The easiest way to open a .pub file is with Microsoft Publisher the program it was created in. If you don't have MS Publisher there are a few others ways you can open a .pub file.

Ways to View PUB Files Without Microsoft Publisher

When you have a Microsoft Publisher document but don't have access to Publisher there are tools viewers and shortcuts that open .pub files created by Microsoft Publisher. LibreOffice Draw part of the open-source LibreOffice suite is a good tool that can open Publisher files.

Most of the time it's better to convert a Publisher file to another more universal format. There are several methods you can use to create a shareable Publisher file. PDF is always a great choice but prior to Publisher 2010 there is no built-in PDF export feature n Microsoft Publisher.

When the content rather than the layout is of primary importance (and no graphics are needed) the best way to exchange information is as plain ASCII text. But when you want to include graphics and wish to preserve your layout plain text won't do.

Use Microsoft Publisher to Create a File to Share

To share Publisher 2000 (or above) files with users of Publisher 98 save the file in Pub 98 format.

Create Printable Files From Publisher Documents

Send the recipient a file that they can print to their desktop printer. They won't be able to view it onscreen but they can get a fairly accurate printout. Several methods are available although each method may have drawbacks.

Save the File in PostScript Format

To create a .ps file go to the File menu select Save As then select the Save as type drop-down arrow and choose PostScript. This method is usually used to prepare files for commercial printing. If the recipient has a PostScript capable printer they can print the file.

Save the Publisher Document as an EPS File

Normally used for commercial printing an EPS file can be opened in many graphics programs. An EPS file must be opened in another program (such as PageMaker or QuarkXPress) to be printed. A separate EPS file is made for each page in the publication.

To create an EPS file in Publisher go to File > Print then in the Print dialog box select Print Setup > Properties. Choose Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) as the PostScript output format. To print each page one at a time select Print to file.

Print a Publisher Document to a PRN File

When printing the publication select the Print to file check box. Instead of printing to the printer Publisher creates a PRN file. The recipient uses the DOS Copy command to send the file to their desktop printer (from the DOS PROMPT type copy filename.prn lpt1 or lpt2 depending on where the printer is located).

If your printer doesn't match that of the recipient the PRN file may not print exactly as you envisioned. If you exchange files regularly with a recipient obtain a copy of the print driver for their printer and use it to create the PRN file from Publisher.

Create HTML Files (Web Pages) From Publisher Files

Convert your Publisher document to an HTML file then either post the file on the web and send recipients the address to view the files or send the HTML file to the recipient for them to view offline in a web browser.

If you send the files include all the graphics as well and set up the file so that all HTML and graphics reside in the same directory. This way the recipient can place the files anywhere on their hard drive.

Or take the HTML code that Publisher creates and send an HTML-format email. The procedure to send an HTML email depends on your email client. How the HTML email is received by the recipient depends on what email client they use (and if they accept HTML-formatted email).

Create PDF Files From Publisher Documents

Convert your Publisher document to the Adobe PDF format. Publisher versions before Publisher 2007 don't have a PDF export option. Instead use a program such as Adobe Acrobat Distiller.

To create the PDF file create a PostScript file then use Adobe Acrobat to create the PDF file. The recipient will be able to view the document on-screen or print it. However the recipient must have the Adobe Acrobat Reader (it's free) installed. There are also some printer drivers and software available that create PDF files from most Windows applications.

Pixabay

In Publisher 2007 and 2010 save the Publisher file as a PDF from the program to send it to anyone who has software (including the free Acrobat Reader) that can open or view PDF files.

How to Use a PUB File If You Don't Have Publisher

When you have a file in the natural Publisher format (.pub) but don't have access to Microsoft Publisher you have a couple of options.

Get a Trial Version of Publisher

You'll get the entire Office Suite along with a free trial version of the latest Publisher. Use it to open and view your file.

Convert Publisher Files to Other Software Formats

It may be possible to convert a PUB file into the natural format of another desktop publishing software. Check the import options in the software of your choice to see if it accepts PUB files (and which version of PUB file). PDF2DTP is a plugin that converts Publisher files to InDesign.

When using an application such as PDF2DTP some elements of the file may not convert as expected.

Another option is to use an online conversion site such as Zamzar to convert PUB files to PDF and other formats. Currently Zamzar converts PUB files to these formats:

DOC : Microsoft Word document

: Microsoft Word document HTML : Hypertext Markup Language

: Hypertext Markup Language MP3 : Compressed audio file

: Compressed audio file ODT : OpenDocument spreadsheet

: OpenDocument spreadsheet PCX : Paintbrush bitmap image

: Paintbrush bitmap image PDF : Portable document format

: Portable document format PNG : Portable network graphic

: Portable network graphic PS : PostScript

: PostScript RTF : Rich text format

: Rich text format TXT: Text document

Another online PDF conversion tool Office/Word to PDF also converts PUB files.

She tells TOFARATI IGE about her career family and other issues

You are the first woman to attain the position of MD of Cadbury Nigeria Plc in over five decades. In what ways is this symbolic for you?

I guess having a woman as managing director of a manufacturing company in Nigeria has been something of a big deal historically speaking. This is largely due to our socio-cultural realities where men tend to dominate in virtually all areas of our national life—be it politics or the corporate world. Perhaps that was the reason my appointment as the first female managing director of Cadbury Nigeria Plc made the headlines.

There has been a global push for gender parity in the workplace particularly at the board level where critical decisions are made. Nigerian businesses are not left out with numerous appointments of female leaders and Chief Executive Officers in financial services technology FMCG and even the oil sector. It is symbolic to have a female CEO in a manufacturing company particularly as this traditionally has been a role held by men. As a global company Mondelēz International— our parent company— has a growing number of women leaders across our functional operations and business units. This is in line with our diversity and inclusion agenda. At MDLZ we have deliberately made it our focused objective to develop and promote our female talents.

What is your typical day like?

Each day is unique as I have reporting responsibilities to numerous stakeholders (local international internal and external). Yes there are many meetings market visits (customer and consumer engagements) employee engagement sessions mentoring commitments to name a few.

What is important for me is to ensure I have a constant connection with all my stakeholders focusing on the ultimate goal – to achieve our business objectives.

How would you describe your experience so far as the MD of the company?

I am fortunate to work with the best talents who have a great understanding of our business objectives and are clear on what needs to be done. One thing we did as a team a couple of years ago was to spend time thinking through and aligning on our mission. This was very important for us as it also helped to define what we would need to do to achieve our business objectives. I see myself as an enabler supporting our leaders and guiding the different teams as necessary with the ultimate goal of delivering on our agreed objectives.

Of course our consumers and our business partners are our biggest stakeholders and connecting with them is key to our existence. It is important to spend quality time with them as they are key to our success.

I have also learnt to prioritise the company’s relationship with other important stakeholders including the government trade associations and numerous regulators.

My corporate role as the Managing Director of Mondelēz West Africa means I am also responsible for our business in Ghana and chair the board of Cadbury Ghana Limited. We now have a growing export business across the ECOWAS region and I am excited to see our brands growing beyond our borders.

I joined Cadbury Nigeria as the Finance Director in 2007 and over the years since then I have come to understand the business quite well. With all the right support moving from the FD role to becoming MD was quite seamless.

How would you assess the ease of doing business in Nigeria?

Governments all over the world strive to create an enabling environment for businesses to thrive essentially from the standpoint that the private sector is a key engine for growth of the economy. While our government acknowledges the role of manufacturers in creating jobs boosting gross domestic product and adding value to our economy manufacturers grapple with a myriad of challenges in Nigeria.

Today we struggle with numerous economic issues including unpredictability of our foreign exchange and rising inflation which makes decision-making and planning challenging. Most manufacturers in our sector generate power as the national grid is unreliable and we cannot afford to have persistent power cuts in food manufacturing. Our ports are congested and have huge negative consequences on imports and exports. Our road network is poor and hauling products across Nigeria is an ongoing nightmare. And now we worry about the security of our people with the rising wave of kidnapping across the country.

While the government has put in place several laudable incentives to stimulate economic growth there is often a disconnect when it comes to implementation of these initiatives.

For example the Export Expansion Grant scheme introduced some years ago to stimulate non-oil export is a commendable initiative. The scheme is very relevant to Nigeria especially now that the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement has kicked off. We need to ensure that Nigerian businesses compete favourably with their counterparts in other African countries. The EEG was designed to encourage the export of ‘made in Nigeria’ products with a view to creating more employment opportunities for Nigerians and generating forex for the country. Several companies took advantage of the scheme as part of their business growth plan.

However implementation has been an issue and the scheme has left many companies short-changed. At a point the government suspended implementation of the scheme citing abuse. Yes it is unfortunate that some companies have abused the scheme but those who have made bona fide investments and commenced export activities based on the rules of the scheme have also suffered because of the actions of a few culprits and the inability of the regulatory authorities to police the system. Today the government is still owing several legitimate exporters including Cadbury a backlog of EEG credit notes running into hundreds of billions of Naira. This defeats the purpose of the scheme. As we strive to encourage non-oil export I believe the government needs to revisit the EEG scheme.

When it comes to matters relating to the economy we must ensure that we follow through on implementation of policies as our credibility to our local and international business partners is at stake when we don’t. Foreign Direct Investment will only happen where an investor has confidence that the government will ensure full and lasting implementation of its policy initiatives. We often struggle to get additional investment into Nigerian businesses because investors are worried that the government will change policies abruptly.

In what ways did the COVID-19 pandemic impact on the activities of the company and how were you able to mitigate them?

The COVID-19 pandemic has really disrupted lives and livelihoods across the world. During the nationwide lockdown announced by the Federal Government in the early days of the pandemic our manufacturing and distribution operations were significantly impacted. As a food manufacturer we were classified as ‘essential’ but our suppliers struggled to get materials to us and selling was tough with market closures and dwindling consumer income. Moving our products from Lagos to our various distribution points across the country was tough.

Our various trade associations were extremely supportive. The Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association and the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria worked with relevant state governments the Federal Ministry of Industry Trade and Investment and the Nigerian Governors’ Forum to enable manufacturers of essential goods like Cadbury distribute our products all across the country. The support we also got from our host governor; Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State is commendable.

During the lockdown open markets which formed almost 70 per cent of our sales channels were closed. Our team became extremely creative and agile developing innovative channels including E-Commerce and door to door retail channels to generate sales.

In what ways are you planning to take the company into the future?

Our mission statement is focused on nourishing and delighting our consumers with the right snacks. As a team we are committed to our stakeholders and aim to always do what is right for our environment. This is the core of what we do who we are and the lever for our growth agenda.

However we are not unmindful of the vagaries of our operating environment or the intense competition in the industry. We also recognise the importance of being consumer-centric. Our consumers are the reason we are in business in the first place. So we must position ourselves to better understand and meet their needs. We will continue to grow our existing brands and enter new categories and segments.

Our shareholders the owners of the business expect returns on their investment. We therefore aim for profitable growth as we navigate the challenges that exist in our operational environment. One of our values as a business is to operate with agility as we make decisions to drive our business performance.

I want to look back in a few years to see Cadbury West Africa as a market leader in all the categories that we operate in. We should be relevant to the economy in our key markets and our stakeholders must see us as creating superior value for them. We must be an employer of choice and our people must be proud to be members of the Cadbury family. I believe we are on the right track in this regard.

What are some of the personal qualities that have helped you get this far in your career?

My values are shaped by my faith as a Christian and this is key to decisions that I make and the way I work. Integrity is one of the values that I hold dearly to.

Furthermore I grew up in a home where we had strict moral upbringing. My father was a disciplinarian who did not fail to apply the rod when it was necessary. So is my mum. These values have to a large extent shaped my character and continually facilitate my decision-making. I praise my team lavishly when they are doing well but I can also be a pain in the neck when I find they are dropping the ball. I try to strike the right balance.

What peculiar challenges do women face in their careers and what effects do they have on career growth?

Women generally face some form of discrimination in the workplace. Sometimes it is subtle but oftentimes it becomes more blatant. For instance women are often overlooked when it comes to promotion to higher levels of responsibility. This tends to stifle their growth in the organisation. I had a first-hand experience of this when I worked in the United Kingdom. So it is something I can relate to easily. Also there are some jobs that seem to be the exclusive preserve of men. Women are not allowed to do such jobs. There is often a legislation backing up this law. For example women are not allowed on night shifts in factories in Nigeria because of some colonial law passed many decades ago.

I am glad that is changing as we now have a growing number of women appointed to top leadership positions in various sectors of the economy. This shows that we are making some progress and it is something we should encourage for the sake of equity. That is how we can grow as a nation.

How are you able to balance your career and personal life?

Let me start by saying that it is important for one to set one’s priorities right and stick to them. This helps one to strike a fine balance between work and life. According to my scale of priority God comes first; my family (my husband who has been my biggest cheerleader and my children) are second; and my career and job come after these.

I guess the mistake some married career women make is to put their job first. This tends to distort the harmony in the family and sometimes harmony also with their faith. We must all learn to get our priorities right to ensure there is balance between our careers and personal lives. When we retire from work someday it is our families that we will all go back to. If a career woman chooses to sacrifice the family front for her job the consequences may not be too pleasant.

What advice do you have for young people as regards career growth?

I do mentor younger colleagues and other people outside of my immediate work environment and one of the things I often tell them is related to the point that I have just made. I always tell them to try and get their priorities right from the start. That way they can maintain proper focus in terms of career growth. There are several distractions out there but with focus and discipline young people can achieve their career aspirations.

What do you consider to be the highest and lowest moments of your career?

The biggest highlight of my career is my appointment as CEO of Cadbury Nigeria Plc and Managing Director of Mondelēz WA. I am struggling to think of a low moment.

Who are your role models and mentors?

As a Christian I take a lot from what I have been taught in the Bible particularly the leadership style of Jesus Christ. I also admire my parents for their courageous leap into the exciting but challenging world of entrepreneurship. My late father was an illustrious entrepreneur and an inspiration for me. Today I reflect on his management style and business decisions even in my current role.

What are your fondest childhood memories?

I grew up in a large family where discipline and order reigned. Mistakes could be overlooked but there was zero tolerance for lies. Anyone who told lies knew the consequences. We all helped with the work at home. There was no idling around the house. My father was a disciplinarian when it came to enforcing punishment for a deserving infraction committed by any of the children. He also expected his children to be top performers in school. One dreaded going home at the end of the school term/year if one was not top three in class.

What were your childhood ambitions?

I initially wanted to be a lawyer but changed to Economics and Accounting because I thought I would make more money in this profession. Today when I see some of my legal bills I wonder if I chose the right career.

How do you unwind?

rtc-config='{ ""vendors"": { ""aps"": {""PUB_ID"": ""600"" ""PUB_UUID"": ""d02f0482-a50f-427c-ac01-9856371f1f6b"" ""PARAMS"":{""amp"":""1""}} }}'>

Unwinding is only possible ‘away from home’. I enjoy running and spending time with my family over a well-deserved meal after the run.

They’ve been steadily adding to their product offering since their inception in 2002 and now offer everything from tube amps to 3D printers. I’ve been one of their customers for 11+ years beginning with the purchase of a 100’ component cable and most recently with a binding post wall plate for my outdoor speakers; not riveting intel but gives you a sense of the diversity of their product line.

More recently they’ve turned their attention to home theater speakers and rather than limp in they’ve attacked this segment of home theater. The subject of this review is essentially a 5.1.4 Atmos capable rig (the .4 coming from Atmos drivers in the towers and surrounds) from their Monolith line: the THX-465T towers THX-365C center channel THX-265B surrounds and 15” THX Ultra Certified 1000-Watt Monolith subwoofer (model 24458).

Monolith THX Certified Speakers

As you can imagine given the nomenclature all of these speakers and the entire Monolith line are THX Ultra Certified. In a nutshell THX Certification helps ensure accuracy wide dispersion (for those sitting in the cheap seats) and the ability to play at high volume without distortion. The 465T towers retail for $999 each (currently on sale for $799) and feature four 6.5” woofers a 2” cloth dome midrange driver and a 1” silk dome tweeter. The Atmos driver on the top of the speaker features a 5.25” pulp cone woofer and a .6” silk dome tweeter. They’re also quite large measuring 55.3” high by 13.1” wide by 16.7” deep and they weigh a stout 55 pounds each. Frequency response measures 29 Hz – 24 kHz vented and 45 Hz – 24 kHz when sealed and sensitivity is rated at 89.5dB. It’s also worth noting that the cabinets in the Monolith line are all HDF (High-Density Fiberboard) not MDF worth mentioning as this provides markedly better damping and is a welcome touch especially at these price points.



The THX-365C center channel retails for $399 (currently on sale for $349) and features two 6.5” pulp cone woofers a 2” silk dome midrange driver and a 1” silk dome tweeter. The 365C measures 9.7” high by 22.9” wide by 10.8” deep and weighs in at 26.4 pounds. Frequency response is 65 Hz – 24 kHz and sensitivity is rated at 89.5dB.

The THX-265B Atmos-enabled surrounds retail for $349 (currently on sale for $269) and feature one 6.5” pulp cone woofer and a 1” silk dome tweeter while the up-firing Atmos speaker features a 5.25” pulp cone driver and a .6” silk dome tweeter. Frequency response is 65 Hz – 24 kHz and sensitivity is rated at 86.0dB. The 265B’s measure 15.4” high by 9.7” inches wide by 10.8” deep and they weigh 21.4 pounds each.



Lastly the Monolith 15” 1000 Watt sub which is an extreme example of their exemplary price to performance ratio (more on that later).

Hang on to your hats as you read these specs both those of form as well as function. The sub retails for a very reasonable (given its performance) $1339 (currently on sale for $1099) and features a 15” driver and 1000-Watt Class D amp. The cone is made of a combination of fiber pulp and fiberglass said to provide greater accuracy output and dynamics. It’s also been designed with 3 ports allowing you the flexibility to run it sealed or unsealed. Frequency response is dependent on whether you run it sealed: 15-200Hz vented (2 ports): 14-200Hz or vented (3 ports): 16-200Hz.

Generally speaking a sealed sub is going to provide tighter more accurate bass while a ported sub will be louder and give you more boom but you’ll lose some accuracy. It couldn’t be a more subjective situation hence Monoprice provides you the option. I prefer a sealed box and kept the sub as such throughout critical listening. As with all other Monolith speakers the cabinet is made of HDF and Monoprice paid particular attention to the internal bracing of the cabinet in order to ensure proper damping.

In past subwoofer reviews I’ve used the term “beast” to describe them; those reviews need to be edited to reflect what now lurks in my theater – a true beast both in terms of girth as well as performance. To put it in perspective my 12-year-old son was too small to help maneuver it and my wife was simply too scared. So in a true Festivus Feat of Strength I wrestled all 128.5 pounds of it downstairs and into position in my theater without help. There would be no experimenting with positioning. Luckily it did fit albeit barely into the subwoofer sweet spot in my theater.

Hookup

I began by connecting the speakers to my Marantz SR7013 receiver using Solstice 8 speaker cables from Wireworld. Assorted source components include my Macbook Pro Arcam irDAC and LG Ultra HD Blu-ray player. The only real wrinkle with connecting a system of this ilk is the fact that given the upward-firing Atmos drivers in the front towers and surrounds a 5.1.4 system. As such each of those speakers needs an extra set of speaker wires. In some systems this is pretty straightforward in my system due to the fact that all of my source components are in another room; it was kind of a bitch. That said regardless of your particular setup there’s a solid chance it’s going to be easier than cutting holes in your ceiling and routing cables to them.

The only other wrinkle I’ll mention is the fact that the tower cabinets don’t ship enclosed rather the base acts as the final piece of the speaker cabinet enclosure. So it’s a bit disconcerting to unbox one of these beasts lay it on its side and realize that there’s an open hole on the bottom of the cabinet. That said once the base is installed they seal quite nicely and not to tip my hand perform admirably. This is likely a cost-saving measure and one for which I have no complaint just thought it worth mentioning. After plenty of hours of the break-in and running my receiver’s auto-calibration it was time to begin critical listening with several Atmos encoded Blu-rays and some Spatial Audio courtesy of Apple Music.

Performance

Out of the gate I wanted to get a sense of how the upward-firing Atmos drivers would compare to my dedicated in-ceiling Atmos setup. I’ll admit having only heard demos (almost always in highly controlled environments) I was skeptical about how they might perform and honestly had never truly considered such a setup for my theater.

So with plenty of preconceived notions for which I’m not proud I fired up my trusty Dolby Atmos demo disc given to me at CES several years ago. I started with this Blu-ray as there are several well-recorded Atmos clips with which I’m very familiar. I’ll say without hyperbole I was truly stunned. Are there differences in the sound of a dedicated down-firing Atmos ceiling speaker vs one that’s firing up and off the ceiling? Of course. Would it bother an untrained ear with the right setup? I doubt it. Case in point – during casual listening sessions neither my wife nor my 12-year-old son noticed any difference in terms of sound quality immersion etc.

Did it make me second-guess my decision to tear up my ceiling tear out some of my hair and spend a shit ton of money on my existing in-ceiling setup? Yes. In other words if you’re on the fence about in-ceiling vs. upward-firing Atmos speakers I can say that unless you’re truly discerning about sound quality and want only the most immersive setup you should strongly consider both propositions.

After ejecting the demo disc it was on to John Wick 3 – Parabellum (Lionsgate). In the beginning of chapter 8 during the gunfight with Keanu and Halle Berry I noted the Monoliths brought forth most of the realism and intensity that I’m used to from my reference system while also keeping their composure through the cacophony. There are plenty of bullet impacts and stabbings in this scene and this is where the sub shone brightly.

As a matter of fact I’d say at least in terms of watching an action film it’s as solid a performer as I’ve had in my listening room. With music wherein you might want more accuracy speed subtlety etc. you can do better but you’re also going to spend a lot more than a grand to get there. But back to the film I did note that while still compelling the upward firing Atmos speakers tend to put off a bit more of a manufactured sound than what you get with dedicated in-ceiling Atmos speakers which is to be expected. That said the Monoliths still provided a compelling sense of realism and especially with the sub made me miss the movie theater a tad less.

Next up in the cue was the Diamond Luxe Edition of Gravity the only Blu-ray release of the film that has an Atmos encoded soundtrack. So rare is this disc that it’s going for $300 on eBay which is more than I’ll make for writing this article but I digress. In the opening scene as NASA communicates with the astronauts the dialogue comes from all around you a true showcase for Atmos and one that will expose a lesser Atmos rig. In this case you’d never know that the Monolith Atmos drivers were firing up and off the ceiling as opposed to hanging up in the air. Also in this and with other films I noted how articulate and transparent the center channel is with dialogue.

As a reminder we’re talking about a center channel that costs $349; transparency is not a term typically associated with sub-$400 centers. The surrounds also shone brightly during this sequence of the film drawing you right into the action with both the effects as well as the dialogue and managing to create and hold all of the tension the filmmakers intended. I kept marveling at the fact that this level of performance can be had for $3600. While not a bargain for many myself included at this level of performance it’s a downright steal.

Moving on to music I played Pink Floyd’s Learning to Fly in Dolby Atmos through Apple Music’s new Spatial Audio offering. It was an interesting mix with the vocals moving back and forth across the front of the soundstage. While the Monoliths did a commendable job in providing solid detail and imaging Spatial Audio in general turned out to be a bit of a mixed bag. It’s highly track-dependent wherein some mixes are compelling and others sound gimmicky and are off-putting. That said it’s certainly worth your time if you have an Atmos capable rig and like to experiment.

As I continued with music I played around with some familiar bass-heavy tracks to see who’d give up first the Monolith or me. I lost. Playing Sunflower by Post Malone I noted that the sub hit the heavy bass notes with taut accurate bass and never lost its composure. I had a similar experience with tracks like Supersonic (My Existence) by Skrillex and The Beastie Boys Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament which while hitting hard is also a good measure of a system’s overall coherence and dynamic range. It was on this track much like with the Gravity demo where I truly fell in love with the Monoliths.

They image well provide a compelling soundstage (on most tracks) and are just plain fun. The sub also provided me with an answer to a question audiophiles have been asking themselves for many moons – is there such a thing as too much sub? The answer is no. Going up in power driver size etc. is commensurate with the level of enjoyment and is one of the most compelling ways to re-create the movie theater environment.

For my last music test I had to throw in a Blu-ray concert and after much deliberation went with my favorite female artist of all time – Stevie Nicks. Her Blu-ray The 24 Karat Gold Tour (BMG) in DTS-HD Master Audio is a true testament to the fact that at least as of 2015 she’s still got it. It was during this demo that I noted the midrange prowess of the Monoliths especially in terms of resolution. I also noted that both vocals and guitars tended to sit toward the rear of the soundstage while backing vocals tended to fill the entirety of the soundstage though possibly due to the recording rather than the speakers.

Any rig has its limitations and it was while listening to this concert that I came back down to earth and noted the lack of transparency and resolution compared to my reference rig albeit at more than twice the price. All that said we can’t talk Stevie without talking vocals and I noted that the Monoliths did a solid job conveying her signature rasp range and vibrato especially on familiar tracks such as Landslide and Rhiannon. I also noted exemplary imaging with the guitar hovering up and to my left and the piano floating all around the listening position.

The Downside

While the subwoofer comes with a decent set of “getting you started” instructions nothing beyond a card directing you to the Monoprice website exists in the other speaker boxes. This might seem like a minor oversight but when you consider the fact that these are Dolby Atmos capable speakers it’s not necessarily going to be obvious to a noob how to properly connect them to a receiver. Further once you follow the link mentioned on the card Monoprice makes no mention of how to connect them to your receiver.

While these are purpose-built speakers it’s worth noting that they are at least with respect to the towers and sub exceedingly large. While this is not a negative per se it’s simply a reminder to do your homework on your theater’s size and what level of performance you’re looking for before ordering.

All of that said sonically speaking which is obviously the most critical component with a set of speakers; I found no critical fault with the Monoliths at least none that would stop me from buying them.

Competition and Comparison

In the interest of trying to keep this as fair as possible let’s consider this particular system’s total current sale price of $3584 since that’s today’s pricing. Typically when writing this section in a review I have a couple of comps that pop right into my head. In this case I’m somewhat loath to admit I had to resort to research. Though to my credit many of the major speaker manufacturers are limping into the Atmos realm as they’ve been waiting to see if this new technology is here to stay. 3D anyone?

Given the proliferation of films being released in Atmos coupled with Apple embracing the technology it’s now a pretty strong bet that it’s here to stay. Anyway there simply isn’t anything out there at least that I’m aware of that delivers this much bang for the buck; they’re sort of the Bayliner of the speaker realm. Anyway after some digging I did come up with a couple of options – one dedicated rig with the Atmos drivers built-in and the other using Atmos add-ons. Anyway without further preamble here are a couple of other options worth a look at. I’ll start with Klipsch as it’s one of the rare brands in which quality and consistency run from their least expensive offerings all the way up to their reference line.

The rub with Klipsch is in trying to navigate their product offering as it’s a mess; too many products and a website in desperate need of an overhaul. That said a comparable Atmos capable Klipsch system would be their R-625FA 5.1.4 Dolby Atmos Home Theater System. While you’ll save some money with the Klipsch system you’ll also lose out markedly on bass as this system is paired with an anemic (compared to the Monolith) sub featuring a 12” driver and 400-Watt amp. If you want a Klipsch subwoofer comparable to the Monolith you’ll want to look at the THX-1200-SW but that’s also going to cost you roughly $500 more and drop you from a 15” driver down to a 12”. On the upside that also translates to a smaller cabinet that’s almost 50 pounds lighter than the Monolith. Another option for those who might not be aware is Dolby Atmos add-on speakers. These are designed to sit atop an existing tower or surround and basically make them Atmos capable. There are a host of manufacturers offering them – Klipsch Monitor Audio ELAC etc. If your budget doesn’t allow for a dedicated Atmos rig upgrading your current system is worth considering especially if you want to test the water before doing a deep Atmos dive.

Conclusion

This is by far the longest review I’ve ever written... though we’ll see what happens once my editor gets ahold of it. The reason? I had a blast with the Monoliths and truly enjoyed what I was hearing. Monoprice offers a 5-year replacement warranty and a 30-day money-back guarantee both critical components when selling direct to consumers. Monoprice is a company (unlike say Elite Screens) that strives to put the customer first. As such if you place an order and decide after setup that you want more bass or maybe want to go smaller on your front towers just reach out and they’ll be happy to help.

Monoprice is a rare company especially in 2021 that is willing to put the customer first. While Monoprice has priced their speakers aggressively putting together a high-performance Atmos system is still costly. So do your research then create your own real-world demo in your own home but do it with the right company which is to say one that not only makes a solid product but does their utmost to ensure their customers are able to enjoy it.

They’re on sale and it’s the holiday season – a great time to get off the fence get into Dolby Atmos and do it right. Monoprice touts their Monolith line as “the best value in high-end audio” - they’re making one hell of a case.

The young nose tackle was preparing for his sophomore season that summer when he learned his application to the University of Wisconsin School of Business had been denied.

“That was the eye-opener for me” Williams acknowledged. “I said: ‘Let’s get working. Let’s get going.’”

Williams’ sophomore season ended on Nov. 9 when he suffered a season-ending knee injury in a victory over Iowa.

“It just reaffirmed the fact that football can be over that quick” he said. “Both had the same impact. Just in a different way. Both were very important to me being in the position I am now.”

Williams a fourth-year senior from Lincoln Nebraska is positioned for success away from football. He is set to play his last game at UW Thursday in the Las Vegas Bowl.

But he already has a job lined up at Morgan Stanley in New York.

“That was one of the biggest reasons I chose Wisconsin over a lot of the other schools” Williams explained “was the opportunity to excel at life outside of football.

“You never know when that time for football is up so setting up a path was always super important to me. Wisconsin just provided so many opportunities for that and all you have to do is take advantage of them.”

According to Williams he had to push harder in the classroom and become more involved in business-related clubs after failing to be admitted to the School of Business.

He was admitted on his second attempt and then secured an internship with Morgan Stanley last summer.

“I sent out about 10 to 15 emails a day for three weeks trying to find any way I could connect” Williams said of his attempts to land an internship. “Not a lot of responses but the ones that did respond were very important. That is how I started to expand my network more and more.

“I was offered an internship at Morgan Stanley and then from there I was working extremely hard trying to balance that intense internship with this very intense football lifestyle. It was the hardest three to four months of my life.”

Williams spent only two weeks in New York before returning to Madison after the internship was moved online because of COVID-19.

“It was still long hours” he said. “It took truly 100% of my time and effort. It was a very intense and difficult summer.”

Williams has played in 11 of 12 games this season filling in for starter Keeanu Benton.

Like many of his teammates he had the opportunity to return in 2022 for an extra season of eligibility but decided he was prepared for the next step in his life.

“This year has been the best year of my football career – ever – particularly the relationships I have built with the guys” he said. “I want to leave football on the best note that I can. For me it’s not wins and losses.

“It is the relationships that you build and the fun you have. And I’ve had the most fun I’ve ever had this year.

“If I want to leave on a perfect note this is the way to do it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJhbXMuY29tL3RlYW0vZnJvbnQtb2ZmaWNlLXJvc3Rlci9kYW4tYXVndXN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dan August,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55cC5vcmcvYWR2YW5jZXMtcGVkaWF0cmljcy9jb25mcm9udGluZy10aGUtY2hhbGxlbmdlcy1vZi1tb3RpbGl0eS1kaXNvcmRlcnMtaW4tY2hpbGRyZW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Confronting the Challenges of Motility Disorders in Children - Advances in Pediatric Gastroenterology,"Confronting the Challenges of Motility Disorders in Children

As a pediatric neurogastroenterologist Julie Khlevner MD Director of the Pediatric Gastrointestinal Motility Center at NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital provides highly specialized expertise for difficult-to-treat motility disorders in children. The emerging subspecialty recognizes the relevance of intestinal pathology and abnormal brain-gut interactions in neurogastroenterology and motility disorders. In a published review of the clinical implications of the brain-gut axis Dr. Khlevner and her co-authors note that the relationship between the brain and the intestine begins during development and persists throughout life and according to research studies this is what links the emotional and cognitive centers of the brain with intestinal functions.

The Pediatric Gastrointestinal Motility Center established nearly a decade ago with Dr. Khlevner at the helm provides a much-needed resource for infants children adolescents and young adults whose motility conditions are often difficult to diagnose and challenging to treat.

“Motility disorders are non-discriminatory and can affect anyone regardless of age ethnicity or gender” notes Dr. Khlevner. “Their etiology is multifactorial – whether genetic idiopathic or induced by surgery or other interventional procedures.”

In 2018 Dr. Khlevner was one of 35 leading experts invited to participate in a full day symposium on “Advances in Motility and in Neurogastroenterology – AIMING for the Future” held during the annual meeting of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition. This symposium which explored clinical paradigms in pediatric GI motility disorders provided a foundation for advancing new scientific and therapeutic research strategies in the field.

Addressing Diagnostic Dilemmas

“Performing and interpreting motility evaluations in children present unique challenges that are further complicated by technical difficulties and patient cooperation” notes Dr. Khlevner. “It's important to remember that pathophysiology of pediatric motility disorders can be very different than what's reported in adults. The lack of child-specific normative data can make analysis more difficult and care must be taken to avoid over-interpretation. For example we often use Chicago classifications to diagnose esophageal motor disorders but the normatives are based on adult data. Despite very few studies validating its use in children we've applied these parameters to pediatrics.”

Functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders in children can range from relatively benign complaints such as constipation to more serious and rare conditions such as Hirschsprung’s disease. Dr. Khlevner in collaboration with multispecialty colleagues provides comprehensive testing consultation and treatment with the goal of identifying the causes of a child’s symptoms and intervening to improve his or her quality of life.

“While upper gastrointestinal motility disorders are common in children there's often a delay in diagnosing these conditions” says Dr. Khlevner. “Children frequently present with nonspecific signs and symptoms that are often mistaken for gastroesophageal reflux. Many are prescribed acid-suppressant medications for a prolonged period of time before motility disorders are considered or undergo several invasive procedures that are non-revealing prior to considering an evaluation in a comprehensive motility program. A motility evaluation by an expert in the field plays an integral role in diagnosis when a workup is inconclusive and symptoms don't respond to conventional medical therapy. Motility disorders should always be considered in the differential diagnosis.”

Advances in technology to measure motor and sensory characteristics of the upper and lower GI tract have not only led to better understanding of the pathophysiology underlying neurogastrointestinal disorders occurring in childhood they have also facilitated the development of less invasive diagnostic tests and more targeted treatment options. With resources that include the latest diagnostic and therapeutic tools the Pediatric Gastrointestinal Motility Center is at the forefront of innovative evaluation and treatment.

Dr. Khlevner notes that esophageal manometry is a common procedure performed in pediatrics. “The advent of high-resolution manometry offers particular advantages for children because the study is easier to perform and provides unparalleled insight into esophageal physiology. With the addition of impedance to high-resolution esophageal manometry the clinical significance of motor abnormalities can be assessed in the setting of effective or ineffective bowel clearance.”

The Motility Center also employs high-resolution 3D anorectal manometry which is used to evaluate the voluntary and involuntary properties of the anorectum and to identify neuropathy in the setting of spinal pathology as well as sitz marker studies to evaluate how quickly food is moving through the intestines.

With the availability of evaluations by a neurogastroenterologist and the latest diagnostic tools in the field the Motility Center attracts referrals from pediatricians and pediatric gastroenterologists from around the country.

Antroduodenal manometry is an advanced motility study that is less commonly performed but it has become important in the diagnosis of gastroparesis and pseudo-obstruction in children presenting with upper tract symptoms. Adds Dr. Khlevner “As with esophageal manometry high resolution manometry technology has also been applied. But more diagnostic tools that are validated in children are absolutely needed. Continued research of non-invasive diagnostic modalities may lead to less discomfort while maintaining a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of these disorders.”

An Urgent Need for Child-Tested Treatments

“The pharmacotherapy currently available for pediatric motility disorders is very limited and new medications are certainly needed” says Dr. Khlevner. “With limited treatment options approved for children we often turn to off-label agents to help our pediatric patients.”

Current therapeutic procedures include Botox injections into gastrointestinal sphincters; biofeedback for the treatment of fecal incontinence; and specialized surgical procedures for motility disorders that are refractive to medical treatment.

“Importantly our center participates in multicenter trials on novel pharmaceuticals not readily available elsewhere which is particularly important for patients who have tried everything and nothing is effective.” — Dr. Julie Khlevner

“Hopefully with the continued basic science advances in the function of the enteric nervous system such as the identification of new receptors new compounds will emerge and the treatment and prognosis of children with primary motility disorders will improve” says Dr. Khlevner. “There are many promising treatments for children with motility and functional disorders in development including regenerative medicine optic genetics and additional gut-selective medications.”

Setting Standards for Training in Pediatric Neurogastroenterology

As an emerging specialty pediatric neurogastroenterology has been further strengthened with the development of guidelines for training in neurogastroenterology and motility disorders (NGM) under the auspices of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition and the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society.

In a collaborative effort with colleagues from 14 other centers Dr. Khlevner led a joint task force of the two societies to identify the components of knowledge skills and management expected of NGM consultants and provide standards in training. The resulting document published in the January 2021 issue of the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition was the first of its kind and has been endorsed by two major gastroenterology societies. The members of the task force anticipate that this document will serve as a resource to break existing barriers to pursuing a career in NGM and provide a framework towards uniform training expectations at three hierarchical tiers corresponding to EPA (entrustable professional activities) levels.

“The field of neurogastroenterology has received some much needed attention” says Dr. Khlevner. “It is a vibrant and exciting specialty and the future is bright for children with these disorders.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2xhdXJlbmRlYnRlci8yMDIxLzEyLzI1L2Zhc2hpb24tYW5kLXRoZS1tZXRhdmVyc2Utd2h5LXJhbHBoLWxhdXJlbi13YW50cy10by1zZWxsLXlvdS1kaWdpdGFsLWNsb3RoaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fashion And The Metaverse: Why Ralph Lauren Wants To Sell You Digital Clothing,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurendebter/2021/12/25/fashion-and-the-metaverse-why-ralph-lauren-wants-to-sell-you-digital-clothing/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2xhdXJlbmRlYnRlci8yMDIxLzEyLzI1L2Zhc2hpb24tYW5kLXRoZS1tZXRhdmVyc2Utd2h5LXJhbHBoLWxhdXJlbi13YW50cy10by1zZWxsLXlvdS1kaWdpdGFsLWNsb3RoaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2V1cm9wZS9zaHVuLXBvbGFyaXNhdGlvbi10cnktZGlhbG9ndWUtaGVhbC1kaXZpZGVkLXdvcmxkLXBvcGUtc2F5cy1jaHJpc3RtYXMtMjAyMS0xMi0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shun polarisation try dialogue to heal divided world pope says at Christmas,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/shun-polarisation-try-dialogue-heal-divided-world-pope-says-christmas-2021-12-25/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2V1cm9wZS9zaHVuLXBvbGFyaXNhdGlvbi10cnktZGlhbG9ndWUtaGVhbC1kaXZpZGVkLXdvcmxkLXBvcGUtc2F5cy1jaHJpc3RtYXMtMjAyMS0xMi0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

But the producers of All the Light We Cannot See have chosen a student with no formal acting training who is registered blind in a move that has been welcomed by disability rights activists.

Although Aria Mia Loberti has no formal training her natural ability has led to her being cast in a four-part adaptation of Anthony Doerr’s novel. She will portray Marie-Laure a blind teenager whose path collides with Werner a German soldier as they try to survive the devastation of war in Nazi-occupied France.

The book is being adapted by Steven Knight the British creator of the Bafta-winning gangster drama Peaky Blinders whose acclaimed films include Dirty Pretty Things a thriller about illegal immigrants in London starring Chiwetel Ejiofor and directed by Stephen Frears.

“She did several auditions which are absolutely remarkable” Knight said. “She’s amazing.” Asked whether such natural acting talent can ever be taught he replied: “You can perfect it. I don’t think you can learn it. You are born with it. She has got it. So we’ve been very fortunate.”

Last weekend actor Rose Ayling-Ellis captivated audiences in winning Strictly Come Dancing as the competition’s first-ever deaf contestant proving as she put it “that deaf people can do anything”.

For Loberti being cast in such a high-profile production is similarly significant for blind and partially sighted people for whom she has campaigned. She said: “I have a rare and severe form of a genetic eye condition called achromatopsia. As a result I’m completely blind in some environments and have minimal variable residual vision in others.”In the novel her character says: “When I lost my sight Werner people said I was brave. When my father left people said I was brave. But it is not bravery; I have no choice. I wake up and live my life. Don’t you do the same?”

Lauren Appelbaum of RespectAbility a non-profit organisation dedicated to changing how society views people with disabilities said: “Netflix is really going to be able to play a role in changing these stigmas surrounding what it means to be blind. Just because you’re blind it doesn’t mean you can’t be an actress in a major role … It’s not overcoming blindness or in spite of being blind. She just happens to be blind and is going to play this role.”

Appelbaum who herself has a disability added: “It’s almost impossible to truly portray someone with disability without having that disability. The nuances that you can bring to that role are just going to make that character so much more dynamic. You don’t have the risk of the actor making a mistake that would show that it’s inauthentic casting which I’ve seen happen time and time again.”

The novel became a global phenomenon selling more than 15m copies after its publication in 2014. In the Observer Justin Cartwright wrote: “It is easy to understand why Doerr’s book is regarded by many as an epic and a masterpiece.” The New York Times’s critic blamed its author “for lost sleep because once I started reading his new novel … there was no putting it down”.

Loberti had been similarly inspired when she decided to audition for the screen adaptation after hearing of the casting search from a former teacher.

She is currently a PhD student in rhetoric at Penn State University in Pennsylvania having received her master’s in ancient rhetoric at Royal Holloway University of London this year as a US-UK Fulbright scholar.

In a statement she described the book as an “intricately crafted story of hope forgiveness power and resilience … Not in a million years did I think anything like this would ever happen to me … I am massively lucky. More lucky and humbled and grateful than I can express.”

The drama is being directed by Shawn Levy whose previous productions include Stranger Things and the Night at the Museum franchise. Of Loberti’s casting he said: “We searched the world and reviewed thousands of auditions. We never thought our path would lead to someone who has not only never acted professionally but never auditioned before.

“It was a jaw-drop moment when we first saw Aria Mia Loberti who is both a natural performer and an advocate for disability … I can’t wait to tell this beautiful story with her at the centre.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc2hlZW5hc2NvdHQvMjAyMS8xMi8yNi9kb250LWxvb2stdXAtcmV2aWV3LWEtZ3JlYXQtc2F0aXJlLW9uLW5ldGZsaXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Don't Look Up' Review: A Great Satire On Netflix,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/sheenascott/2021/12/26/dont-look-up-review-a-great-satire-on-netflix/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc2hlZW5hc2NvdHQvMjAyMS8xMi8yNi9kb250LWxvb2stdXAtcmV2aWV3LWEtZ3JlYXQtc2F0aXJlLW9uLW5ldGZsaXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vcG9wY3VsdHVyZS5jb20vc3RyZWFtaW5nL25ld3MvdHdpbGlnaHQtbGVhdmluZy1uZXRmbGl4LXdoZXJlLXdhdGNoLWFsbC01LW1vdmllcy1hZnRlci1uZXRmbGl4LWV4aXQtcGVhY29jay_SAXdodHRwczovL3BvcGN1bHR1cmUuY29tL3N0cmVhbWluZy9hbXAvbmV3cy90d2lsaWdodC1sZWF2aW5nLW5ldGZsaXgtd2hlcmUtd2F0Y2gtYWxsLTUtbW92aWVzLWFmdGVyLW5ldGZsaXgtZXhpdC1wZWFjb2NrLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Twilight' Leaving Netflix: Where to Watch All 5 Movies After Netflix Exit,"The Twilight Saga film series' time on Netflix is coming to an end but that doesn't mean fans of the hit five-film series are out of luck. When the complete Twilight film collection exits Netflix on Saturday Jan. 15 they will quickly be making their way to Peacock which will be their exclusive new streaming home beginning on Sunday Jan. 16.

Based on author n Stephenie Meyer's book series of the same name Twilight fever began in 2008 with the release of Twilight the first installment in what would become a five-film franchise. The franchise centers on the love story of Bella and Edward. After relocating from Arizona to Forks Washington Bella's life is turned upside down when she meets Edward whom she soon discovers is a vampire. The two quickly fall in love but their relationship faces challenges not only from other supernatural forces but also from a love triangle including Jacob Black. In addition to the original 2008 film the franchise includes four other titles – The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009) The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010) The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 (2011) and The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 (2012). The series is lead by Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner with Peter Facinelli Elizabeth Reaser Ashley Greene Jackson Rathbone Nikki Reed and Kellan Lutz also starring.

The switch to Peacock marks just the latest move for the franchise. Prior to the films being available for streaming on Netflix the complete Twilight Saga film collection was available on Amazon Prime until they were removed on Aug. 31 2020. They were then briefly streamable on Hulu before being removed on Oct. 31 2020.

The franchise's latest move will likely be met with great success for Peacock. When the films were added to Netflix in July they earned a weeks-long stay on the streamer's Top 10 charts and top 10 hourly data revealed some impressive viewing figures. That data according to What's on Netflix showed that Twilight was viewed 25.03 million hours from July 11 to Aug. 1. Between July 18 to July 25 The Twilight Saga: New Moon enjoyed 14.86 million hours. During that same time period The Twilight Saga: Eclipse received 8.96 million hours The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn: Part 1 earned 7.99 million hours and The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn: Part 2 received 13.90 million hours.

Twilight fans have until Saturday Jan. 15 to watch the films on Netflix. They will then make the move to Peacock on Sunday Jan. 16. The streaming service offers a free seven-day premium tier upgrade. Once the trial ends Peacock Premium which unlocks everything Peacock has to offer costs $4.99 per month. The ad-free Peacock Premium Plus meanwhile costs $9.99 per month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vY293Ym95LWJlYm9wLW5ldGZsaXgtY2hhbmdlcy1hbmltZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cowboy Bebop: 10 Things The Netflix Series Changed From The Anime,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vY293Ym95LWJlYm9wLW5ldGZsaXgtY2hhbmdlcy1hbmltZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdW50ZXJmaXJlLm9yZy9hcnRpY2xlL3BhbGVzdGluaWFuLXNlYXNvbi1vbi1uZXRmbGl4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Palestinian season on Netflix,"Michael Lavalette reviews a number of Palestinian films currently streaming on Netflix

Netflix are currently streaming a series of Palestinian films most are well worth watching.

Pomegranates and Myrrh tells the story of newlyweds Kamar and Zaid two Christian Palestinians from the Ramallah area whose new life together is shaken by Ziad’s arrest.

Ziad is arrested in a stand off with Israeli soldiers who are trying to confiscate his land. He is imprisoned and pressured to sign over the land to the army – but he refuses which means he is held in ‘administrative detention’ after his original sentence is served.

Through Kamar’s experience we get the reality of prison visits check points settler violence army incursion and land grab.

Kamar copes through her love of dancing. She is a member of a Dabka troop and a new instructor – with his own back story of loss in Beirut in 1982 – also introduces a degree of sexual tension to the story.

Well worth a watch.

Pomegranates and Myrrh Netflix

When I’m talking or teaching about Palestine people often ask about checkpoints and what they are like.

It’s difficult for people in Britain to grasp the reality of what they mean: the disruption to daily life the (wasted) time spent trying to get through the mixture of arrogance and impunity which shapes the soldiers’ attitudes to Palestinians (especially Palestinian young people).

Many of these themes are captured in the short film Like Twenty Impossibles. It’s only just over 16 minutes long but gives a real insight into what checkpoints are like and mean.

Similarly the 10-minute short The Crossing centres on the experience of three siblings trying to get from the West Bank to Palestine48 with a special permit because their grandfather is dying.

Special permit or not nothing is ever straightforward when it comes to negotiating with the Israeli occupation forces.

The Crossing Netflix

Children of Shatila is a really moving film about what happened to Shatila camp in Beirut in August 1982 and the impact it had on people’s lives. Told through the eyes of children it really is worth watching.

A similar documentary that focuses on children is Born in Gaza. Filmed after the 2014 Israeli attack it tells the story of life and the struggle for survival of the people in the Gaza strip.

Born in Gaza Netflix

3000 Nights tells the story of a wrongly convicted Palestinian woman Layal.

Soon after her arrest Layal discovers she is pregnant and goes on to give birth to Nour whilst inside.

Set in the early 1980s it covers the brutality of treatment of Palestinian prisoners by the Israeli authorities – and the attempts to recruit prisoners to be ‘canaries’ (informers on their fellow Palestinian activists.)

It tells the story of Layal’s growing political awareness and the prisoners’ resistance within the Israeli prison regime.

3000 Nights Netflix

Giraffada is a movie that is loosely based on a true story from the Second Intifada.

The film is set in the West Bank town of Qalqilya (though some of the scenes are clearly shot in the more mountainous Nablus).

Qalqilya is in the ‘northern sector’ of the West Bank and is an agricultural town with significant productive land. It is particularly well-known for the quality of its oranges.

But today farmers are cut off from their land by the apartheid wall that encircles the town. In fact the town’s inhabitants say they are ‘living in a bottle’ as there is only one road and one entrance into the town.

During the Second Intifada an Israeli incursion attacked the town’s zoo – the only zoo in the West Bank. As part of the attack the zoo’s giraffe was shot.

Giraffada Netflix

The movie is based on the (fictional) story of the zoo’s vet Yacine his son Ziad and a French photographer Lora who try to smuggle a giraffe into Qalqilya zoo from Palestine48 after an Israeli air raid causes the death of one of their two giraffes.

But smuggling a giraffe from Palestine48 onto the West Bank isn’t straight forward!

The film addresses issues with checkpoints especially the oppressive checkpoint just outside Qalqilya (where I have spent many an hour ‘waiting to be processed’) army incursions clashes with resistance forces farmers cut off from their land and the ongoing plight of the West Bank’s only zoo.

Tel Aviv on Fire is based on the story of hapless Salam who gets a job in film production in Ramallah. He only gets the job because his uncle owns the company.

A chance encounter at a checkpoint with an Israel army commander Assi leads to him getting a role as a scriptwriter on a popular television drama based on events leading up to the Six Day War of 1967.

Rather improbably Assi starts writing parts for the Israeli general in the drama. And this opens up ‘debate’ over the direction of the TV drama. Can it ignore the realities of Palestinian oppression and come to a ‘happy’ (?) ending. The movie makes the answer clear.

Tel Aviv on Fire Netflix

Finally the short film 3 Logical Exits looks at the plight of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.

In 2019 the Lebanese Government reclassified Palestinian refugees as ‘foreign workers’ and required them to have a permit in order to work.

This is just the latest in a long list of discriminatory legislation put in place against a Palestinians in the country.

The short documentary by film maker Mahdi Fleifel follows up his earlier film A Man Returned. It follows Reda from the Ain El-Helweh camp in Southern Lebanon.

The film looks at the three logical exits for Palestinians: drugs (either selling or using) joining the factions (either Islamic or Palestinian liberation organisations) or migration out the country.

It’s astonishing what is crammed in to 15 minutes of filming!

In many ways this is the most difficult one to watch. But it captures the lack of freedoms lack of choices and despair that is a central part of refugee life.

Picture: AFP

Elina Svitolina wants to make one thing clear before her exhausting 27-hour trip on Monday from Switzerland to Adelaide via Sydney.

No-one followed up on the Ukrainian tennis star’s initial specticism about the Covid-19 vaccine meaning there were no reports about her being fully vaccinated way back in June.

The Victorian Government and Australian Open’s vaccine mandate remains a hot topic as the tennis summer prepares to start next week – but it’s no issue for 15th-ranked Svitolina.

“Even if they tell me that I have to get a third shot I would be happy to do that because I see now so many new cases – and lots of players” Svitolina told News Corp.

“Lots of our friends are getting Covid so it’s quite tough right now.”

Svitolina and her husband French tennis player and former world No.6 Gael Monfils plan to be in South Australia for two tournaments each and will be the top seed in three of the four combined.

Free of the quad injury that halted her bid to reach the WTA Finals for a fourth time the 27-year-old is keen to test where she’s at against a bumper field that includes Ash Barty and eight of the top 10.

It will be the fun-loving Svitolina’s first trip to Adelaide but Monfils is familiar with the city after previously being coached by South Australian Roger Rasheed.

“It’s amazing to see so many good players signing to play from the beginning of the season” she said.

“Everyone’s trying to be ready for the first (grand slam) tournament for Melbourne so it’s a really good field and it’s going to be really tough from the beginning of the tournament.

“There’s no time for adjustments – you have to be ready from the first round mentally physically so this is very exciting I think for the tournament and for players as well.”

Svitolina who broke into the top 10 in 2017 and kept her spot until October this year made the US Open quarter-finals won a title in Chicago and earned a singles bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics.

That Olympic medal was Ukraine’s first in tennis so it had no competition as her on-court highlight for 2021 but her Swiss wedding in July topped everything else.

“It was a very special moment for me and Gael” Svitolina said.

The official home of the British Prime Minister was rated the top residence because it scored the best on the golden ratio metric a measure often used by artists and mathematicians to determine the aesthetic qualities of objects.

The theory follows that if a building or artwork falls into the golden ratio and is as close to the golden ratio as possible it is as aesthetically pleasing as possible.

Picture: Richard Dobson

The traumatised ex-wife of footy star Michael Jennings has released a statement after their embattled relationship played out publicly through the courts.

Allegations of sexual assault and abuse were laid bare in the NSW District Court last week forcing the former NSW State of Origin star to pay his ex Kirra Wilden $500000 in damages.

Ms Wilden sued her ex-husband alleging that during their six-year relationship she was sexually assaulted and verbally abused.

She also made accusations that he would drink excessively gamble heavily and use cocaine.

Mr Jennings 33 has denied all allegations that he sexually assaulted his former partner and has not been charged.

Following the proceedings Mr Wilden has now spoken out via a statement released through her lawyer.



“I am happy that the case gives an opportunity for victims of harm in marriage — of either gender — to seek relief in civil proceedings” she said.

“I now have an opportunity through this system to heal.”

Following a 10-day trial throughout the middle of the year District Court Judge David Wilson earlier this week ruled in Ms Wilden’s favour.

He ordered that she be paid more than $490000 in damages after claiming that she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the alleged sexual assaults.

Judge Wilson also ordered that his judgment and a transcript of proceedings be forwarded to the NSW Police for Ms Wilden’s allegations to be investigated.

Text messages tendered to the court during the proceedings showed that by December 2013 their relationship was already strained.

During one exchange Ms Wilden told her then partner that she was refusing to attend a New Year’s Eve party because the evening prior he had volleyed a series of expletives and insults at her while drunk punched her car and attempted to break up with her.

“Don’t call me a f---ing c-- t and tell me ruining your life and think it’s OK alright please don’t message me” she said in the message at 1.20pm.

“When did I say that?” Mr Jennings said in reply.

“Last night I’m over it I’m not putting up with it anymore” she said.

“You were acting crazy punching the car and burning your leg hair off im … Not putting up with it.”

The couple were married in October 2015 but by May 2016 Ms Wilden had left their marital home.

She alleged that from October 2014 to May 2016 she was sexually assaulted four times while she was his fiancee and wife.

According to Ms Wilden’s evidence the first three assaults all occurred in similar circumstances after Mr Jennings had arrived home drunk in the early hours.

She alleged that on those three occasions she said “no” or “stop” that he called her a “slut” and accused her of sleeping with other men before having sex with her without her consent.

Ms Wilden told the court that the first incident occurred at their Kensington apartment in Sydney’s eastern suburbs.

He arrived home sometime between 2am and 4am and she found him on his hands and knees banging on the front door according to her evidence.

She described how he pulled down her underwear laid on top of her and sexually assaulted her.

“I was telling him ‘no’ that I don’t want to have sex with him” Ms Wilden said in her evidence.

“He said ‘Why? Because you’re sleeping with other people? With other guys?’ His words.”

Mr Jennings denies any of the alleged sexual assaults took place and said on that occasion he went to the casino after attending a wedding and arrived home about 7am and let himself in using his own key.

She alleged that further assaults occurred at the same unit in Kensington another residence at Bella Vista in 2015 and at their property at The Ponds in 2016.

She said of the third alleged assault: “I just remember laying there and feeling like dead.

“I didn’t feel it. I just no feeling but blank. Like I was actually dead. Like my soul had left my body.”

Ms Wilden said she woke the next morning to find that Mr Jennings had wet the bed and ruined her new quilt.

Mr Jennings said during his testimony that he would not “try and force myself onto her”.

His lawyer also told the court that she did not believe the allegations could meet the criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt.

Mr Jennings did however admit to using recreational drugs during his playing career.

His time in the NRL is almost certainly over after he was in October handed a three-year suspension by the NRL after testing positive to banned performance-enhancing substances Ibutamoren and Ligandrol.

During the proceedings Ms Wilden claimed that she would find small plastic satchels containing white powder in Mr Jennings’ washing.

After being given a certificate by Judge Wilson protecting him from prosecution in relation to his drug use Mr Jennings admitted that he used cocaine during Mad Monday celebrations in 2013 (following the Roosters’ premiership win) 2014 2015 and after his move to Parramatta in 2016.

Asked who had supplied the cocaine he said: “I guess it was just at the party that we were celebrating at.

“It would be one of my mate’s friends.”

Ms Wilden told the court that at the time of the alleged incidents she did not believe she had been raped stating she thought it was her “duty” to have sex with Mr Jennings.

She eventually disclosed the allegations to a partner – who she began seeing following their separation – a psychologist and a lawyer.

“It is plain that Ms Wilden has suffered enormous insult humiliation embarrassment and shame by the conduct of Mr Jennings and that ought to be reflected in an award of damages” Judge Wilson said.

“I accept the evidence of Ms Wilden as to how she felt following each of the acts and generally since they occurred.”

Ms Wilden was awarded $490091 in damages which included $200000 in general damages $51250 for future treatment and $100000 for economic loss."

Picture: AFP

Elina Svitolina wants to make one thing clear before her exhausting 27-hour trip on Monday from Switzerland to Adelaide via Sydney.

No-one followed up on the Ukrainian tennis star’s initial specticism about the Covid-19 vaccine meaning there were no reports about her being fully vaccinated way back in June.

The Victorian Government and Australian Open’s vaccine mandate remains a hot topic as the tennis summer prepares to start next week – but it’s no issue for 15th-ranked Svitolina.

“Even if they tell me that I have to get a third shot I would be happy to do that because I see now so many new cases – and lots of players” Svitolina told News Corp.

“Lots of our friends are getting Covid so it’s quite tough right now.”

Svitolina and her husband French tennis player and former world No.6 Gael Monfils plan to be in South Australia for two tournaments each and will be the top seed in three of the four combined.

Free of the quad injury that halted her bid to reach the WTA Finals for a fourth time the 27-year-old is keen to test where she’s at against a bumper field that includes Ash Barty and eight of the top 10.

It will be the fun-loving Svitolina’s first trip to Adelaide but Monfils is familiar with the city after previously being coached by South Australian Roger Rasheed.

“It’s amazing to see so many good players signing to play from the beginning of the season” she said.

“Everyone’s trying to be ready for the first (grand slam) tournament for Melbourne so it’s a really good field and it’s going to be really tough from the beginning of the tournament.

“There’s no time for adjustments – you have to be ready from the first round mentally physically so this is very exciting I think for the tournament and for players as well.”

Svitolina who broke into the top 10 in 2017 and kept her spot until October this year made the US Open quarter-finals won a title in Chicago and earned a singles bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics.

That Olympic medal was Ukraine’s first in tennis so it had no competition as her on-court highlight for 2021 but her Swiss wedding in July topped everything else.

“It was a very special moment for me and Gael” Svitolina said.

“That month was very busy for both of us. We had our wedding and the next day we had to fly to Tokyo straightaway so no big celebrations but in the end it was very special.

She alleged that further assaults occurred at the same unit in Kensington another residence at Bella Vista in 2015 and at their property at The Ponds in 2016.

She said of the third alleged assault: “I just remember laying there and feeling like dead.

“I didn’t feel it. I just no feeling but blank. Like I was actually dead. Like my soul had left my body.”

Ms Wilden said she woke the next morning to find that Mr Jennings had wet the bed and ruined her new quilt.

Mr Jennings said during his testimony that he would not “try and force myself onto her”.

His lawyer also told the court that she did not believe the allegations could meet the criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt.

Mr Jennings did however admit to using recreational drugs during his playing career.

His time in the NRL is almost certainly over after he was in October handed a three-year suspension by the NRL after testing positive to banned performance-enhancing substances Ibutamoren and Ligandrol.

During the proceedings Ms Wilden claimed that she would find small plastic satchels containing white powder in Mr Jennings’ washing.

After being given a certificate by Judge Wilson protecting him from prosecution in relation to his drug use Mr Jennings admitted that he used cocaine during Mad Monday celebrations in 2013 (following the Roosters’ premiership win) 2014 2015 and after his move to Parramatta in 2016.

Asked who had supplied the cocaine he said: “I guess it was just at the party that we were celebrating at.

“It would be one of my mate’s friends.”

Ms Wilden told the court that at the time of the alleged incidents she did not believe she had been raped stating she thought it was her “duty” to have sex with Mr Jennings.

She eventually disclosed the allegations to a partner – who she began seeing following their separation – a psychologist and a lawyer.

“It is plain that Ms Wilden has suffered enormous insult humiliation embarrassment and shame by the conduct of Mr Jennings and that ought to be reflected in an award of damages” Judge Wilson said.

“I accept the evidence of Ms Wilden as to how she felt following each of the acts and generally since they occurred.”

Ms Wilden was awarded $490091 in damages which included $200000 in general damages $51250 for future treatment and $100000 for economic loss."
NEE,NextEra Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL2JpbGxpbmdzZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9zdGF0ZS1hbmQtcmVnaW9uYWwvbW9udGFuYXMtbGFyZ2VzdC13aW5kLWZhcm0tdW5kZXJ3YXktbmVhci1taWxlcy1jaXR5L2FydGljbGVfNjUzMWJjZWQtZTZmYy01YTAzLWJiNzEtNWU1ZTQ3NjJkNzE0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Montana's largest wind farm underway near Miles City,"ANGELA — On a recent winter afternoon the wind on this Eastern Montana plain was rising slowly like a tide the cool dense air rolling in to replace what’s been warmed by daylight.

At first the change is barely noticeable but then the 210-foot blades of the Clearwater Wind Project start to turn. Though the blades have been feathered to catch none of what this chilly air has to offer they turn nonetheless.

The setting is perfect for what will be Montana’s largest windfarm said Jess Melin. A Livingston guy Melin is executive director of renewable development for NextEra Energy Resources.

The company brands itself as the world's largest generator of renewable energy from wind and solar. This 750-megawatt giant is NextEra’s first Montana project. Melin seems to preface all his observations about Eastern Montana with “I’m a little biased.”

“You got to have a place to put a machine you have to have willing landowners. Very gracious landowners who have been great to work with in Eastern Montana. I'm a little biased but I've always thought Eastern Montana has the best people on Earth and we found great landowners” Melin said. “You need transmission need a way to get your product to market. We have to build that transmission down to the Colstrip substation because this is where the fuel is. But we're delivering this to Colstrip. One of the gems of Eastern Montana is the Colstrip transmission system.”

There’s money in the quarter-acre wind turbine leases for Montana landowners. In Clearwater’s case the payouts over the next 30 years are expected to be $226 million. Each turbine however takes up about 50 square yards. The land around the turbines is available for grazing and crops.

Property taxes paid to Custer Garfield and Rosebud counties where Clearwater is located are $217 million over the same period.

At this site the net capacity factor is about 40% meaning that during the year the turbines are at maximum capacity about 40% of the time.

“There’s a definite cycle to it but at about 40% of the year they're at max capacity which means they're going to be turning probably 80% of the year at some rotational experience” Melin said.

Half of the project is scheduled to come online in late 2022. Colstrip stakeholder Puget Sound Energy has contracted for the first 350 megawatts of Clearwater’s capacity. Puget agreeing to purchase 350 megawatts of Clearwater capacity was crucial for launching the project. It assured that nearly half of the wind farm’s power would have a customer for the next 20 years.

The wind turbines being erected now are for Puget. The remaining 400 megawatts will be built when there’s another customer.

Mild start to December

Favorable weather conditions have allowed the project to build out months ahead of schedule. Construction Manager Damon Steelman said the first phase of construction could finish in the spring though conditions would have to remain favorable. With the hardest months of the Montana winter still ahead an early finish isn’t guaranteed.

The initial flourish of 350 workers on site pouring concrete burying power lines building 134 miles of new access roads and upgrading another 94 miles has subsided. There are now 200 workers at Clearwater. There’s no man camp. Everybody drives in from the outlying area.

Clearwater’s list of potential customers is only four utilities long. Collectively representing 70% of the ownership in the nearby coal-burning Colstrip Power Plant each owner faces a state deadline to phase out coal from its portfolio with the first requirement coming at the end of 2025 in Washington which is by far the largest consumer of Colstrip power.

But it’s a less often discussed detail of Washington’s climate law that benefits Clearwater or any Montana renewable project trying to sell into the Pacific Northwest. The provision concerns the Colstrip transmission line.

When Washington legislators passed the Clean Energy Transformation Act in 2019 they didn’t just put an expiration date on coal power. Lawmakers also required that the transmission lines connected to retiring coal power plants start moving energy from another source or be removed from customer bills as early as January 2026. The requirement is based on the concept that utility customers can’t be asked to pay for assets that aren’t used and useful for service.

“The adjusted depreciation schedule must require such a qualified transmission line to be fully depreciated on or before Dec. 31 2025” reads the law which instructs Washington utility regulators to make the determination.

NextEra’s agreement with Puget Sound Energy requires the power to be delivered to Puget at the Colstrip substation. The freight from there is the utility’s responsibility. That arrangement being able to deliver the power after a relatively short distance works in favor of the project.

From the wind farm there’s a path of steel transmission towers laid in a line that points directly to Colstrip and disappears in the rolling hills. The line will service Clearwater located roughly 33 miles northwest of Miles City and nothing else.

Asked about the 750-megawatt scale of the wind farm Melin said that’s the size necessary to justify the expense of the 83-mile transmission line from Clearwater to Colstrip. A smaller facility wouldn’t pencil out. The scale also matches what was available for transmission capacity at Colstrip.

Clearwater also takes up the Colstrip line transmission capacity that came available when Colstrip Units 1 and 2 retired in January 2020 after 45 years of operation. These generators were the oldest of the power plant’s 4 units but were no longer profitable according to Talen Energy and Puget which split ownership in the two 307-megawatt units equally.

In June Puget’s Andrew Padula told Lee Montana Newspapers that Clearwater’s electricity output was expected to peak at times of the year when wind farms in the Pacific Northwest were less active.

“Montana wind provides a geographical diversity relative to PSE’s wind resources in Washington along with a winter generation profile that fits well with PSE’s peak load need” Padula said.

Montana renewables

The other Colstrip owners facing Washington’s coal phase out have also identified Montana wind power as a cost-effective renewable source. The projects they develop or contract with will keep Montana in the energy export business. As 664 megawatts of coal-fired generation retired in Montana over the past two years development of wind energy for export grew by 990 megawatts specifically because Colstrip Power Plant owners Puget Sound Energy and PacifiCorp invested in Montana renewables.

PacifiCorp became the first Colstrip owner to build a Montana wind farm in 2020 when it constructed the 240-megawatt Pryor Mountain Wind Farm near Bridger. Energy from Pryor Mountain’s 114 turbines doesn’t move on the Colstrip line. Rather the power moves south into Wyoming on the Yellowtail Dam intertie line owned by PacifiCorp.

At the time of construction PacifiCorp put the cost of Pryor Mountain Wind at $406 million. The wind farm was an early step in PacifiCorp’s plan to build 7000 megawatts of renewable generation in the next decade. Pryor Mountain is expected to produce about 841000 megawatt hours a year enough power for 76000 homes on an annual basis.

The wind farm pays about $330000 year in taxes.

In an April report Colstrip owner Avista concluded that “200 megawatts of Montana wind are the most economic new resource to meet CETA requirements beginning in 2024.” The Spokane-based utility presented a scenario in which it brought Montana wind online in three 100-megawatt increments the first two coming in 2023 and 2024 with another 100 megawatts of capacity in 2028. The utility didn’t indicate a particular source for Montana wind.

Colstrip owner Portland General Electric has also strategized for Montana renewables in its future portfolio though it doesn’t have a specific project.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWlseWNhbWVyYS9uYW1lL2NoYXJsZXMtc2F5cmUtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzE5ODUzNTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Charles Sayre Obituary (1949 - 2021) - Boulder CO - The Daily Camera,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/dailycamera/name/charles-sayre-obituary?id=31985357 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWlseWNhbWVyYS9uYW1lL2NoYXJsZXMtc2F5cmUtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzE5ODUzNTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Whether it’s the Air Force 1 Air Max 1 or any of the Air Jordan retros and 25 30 35 or 50 years the Swoosh uses every occasion it can to celebrate some of its most iconic sneakers.

Next year alone we’re looking at the 35th anniversaries of both the Nike Air Max 1 and the Air Jordan 2 with several high-profile collaborations and releases set to follow. But there’s another sneaker that is celebrating a milestone next year; one that has flown somewhat under the radar but is more impressive and central to Nike’s history than either of the other two sneakers. In 2022 the Nike Cortez turns 50.

The Nike Cortez was Nike’s first-ever shoe designed by Bill Bowerman and taking cues from the Onitsuka Tiger Cortez (later renamed the Corsair in 1974) which was also designed by Bowerman. When Nike changed its name from Blue Ribbon Sports and sought to bring its own sneakers onto the market it was the Cortez that kick-started its meteoric rise to the top. Today 50 years later the sneaker remains popular which is why it’s surprising that it hasn’t seen a concerted push from the Swoosh in prior years (outside of the popular Kendrick Lamar collaborations).

Next year however that looks to change. Union LA are set to release two colorways of the Cortez both of which have already been leaked online. Due to Los Angeles’ love for the model (the Cortez is often considered the quintessential LA shoe) Union’s involvement seems fitting.

Now there have been rumblings about a sacai x Nike Cortez collaboration which would see Chitose Abe’s label bring its double-everything approach to the Cortez after reworking several other iconic Nike models. Should those rumblings prove true it would be a fitting way to celebrate the Cortez’s 50th-anniversary. sacai’s Nike collaborations have been some of the most popular over the past few years as have Union LA’s.

“If there’s one thing Ronnie Fieg is know for his execution. To commemorate his latest flagship locations in Paris and Hawaii he dropped two Air Force 1s which at first glance may not look too crazy but when you look up close and peep the crazy yet subtle detailing you’ll see why these shoes are so impressive. Both pairs feature an all white premium upper complimented by the embossed Kith-branded quarter panels which sits on a sail outsole. The Paris version draws inspiration from the French flag with the velvet collar and tri-colored mini embroidered Swoosh while the latter version has a ‘Blue Lagoon’ collar and mini embroidered swoosh which is similar to the water in Hawaii.” — Henry Francois

“The best Nike collab this year has to go to Off-White. I jump back and forth between the 50 and the lemonade AF1. But in my eyes it really may be the 50 with Virgil [Abloh] passing. I’ve wondered in hindsight if he knew his time here may not be the longest and he wanted to ensure as many people as possible could have his work. Hence the way it released and the volume. If that is the case it makes the release far more meaningful than what many of us thought initially. And that says a lot to me personally.” — Ricky Shoebio

“We got hit with a slew of triple collabs this year but the Nike x Sacai x Fragment LDV Waffle was a beautiful nod to nostalgia mixed with just the right hit of modern notoriety. My personal favorite was the light smoke gray colorway. Expounding in the classic Bill Bowerman creation I loved the double Swoosh suede overlays and small Fragment lightning bolt logo — just the right amount of hype to keep the new generation of sneakerheads satiated while making the OG’s appreciative of the resurgence of a classic silhouette. A definitely top pick for 2021 for me.” — David “Kari” Daniels

The Nike Blazer Low Jumbo though arguably less timeless than the original has become somewhat of a mainstay offering. More and more colorways are beginning to appear and this latest provides a look that reminds me of the ever-beloved Chunky Dunky.

This is due entirely to the inclusion of primary colors which dresses the silhouette’s more forward-facing elements. The left shoe’s enlarged Swoosh for starters boasts a bright sky blue; and when complemented by the deep green checks on the right the connection to Ben & Jerry’s pints begins to come into focus. Additionally a pale yellow and red also join the palette alternating atop the tongue whose laces and surrounding leather opt for a neutral white.

RAVENNA Ky. — Chesapeake & Ohio 2-8-4 2716 will visit New England following its restoration the Kentucky Steam Heritage Corporation announced on Saturday.

Kentucky Steam has inked an agreement with the Railroad Museum of New England to bring the big main line steam locomotive to its Naugatuck Railroad in Connecticut at some point in the future for a months-long residency. The visit will kick off what is expected to be a year-long trip from its home base in Ravenna Ky. where it is currently being restored.

C&O 2716’s trip to Connecticut — which Kentucky Steam President Chris Campbell said could happen sometime in the middle part of the decade — would be the first visit of a main line steam locomotive to New England in more than a generation. Kentucky Steam said additional stops on its maiden tour would be announced at a later date.

“We’re pleased to be hosting C&O 2716 on our railroad as it will be the first large steam locomotive to operate in New England since (the 1970s)” said Howard Pincus chairman of RMNE. “It’s a wonderful opportunity to partner with a capable and visionary group like KSHC. Moving operational steam locomotives between heritage groups is quite common in Great Britain but has only been done a few times in the United States.”

While many small steam locomotives have operated in New England in recent decades visits by large main line steamers have been few and far between. In the 1960s and 1970s Nickel Plate Road 2-8-4 759 led excursions there for Steamtown and Ross Rowland’s High Iron Company. And in 1975 Reading Company 2101 lead the American Freedom Train all the way to Portland Maine. Since then the largest steam locomotive to grace New England’s main line rails has been Canadian Pacific 4-6-2 1201 which made a trek across northern Maine in 1989.

The exact dates of the visit have yet to be determined and officials said they would not be announced until certain restoration benchmarks had been met. However there were already plans in the works for excursions along the Naugatuck’s 19-mile line between Waterbury and Torrington Conn. and even photo freights.

Kentucky Steam has been restoring 2716 since 2015. The group also owns a 40-acre former CSX Transportation yard in Estill County Ky. where the work has been taking place. Campbell tells Railfan & Railroad that for the last few years the non-profit has been focusing on working on the shop facility itself. Now that a lot of that work has been completed they plan on focusing on the locomotive more which is about 30 percent done.

“We are several years off from making our way up east” he said. “But with announcements like this we hope people who have considered contributing to the restoration can see an end goal in sight. We are excited to get the engine fully operational and bring people to us in Kentucky. But we are equally as excited to get out on the road.”

Campbell said while Class I railroads including CSX and Norfolk Southern have been very generous to the non-profit it’s important to not simply rely or hope for chances to get out on their rails. He said that working with established short line and tourist operators will get 2716 in front of more people when the locomotive is again running.

Along with Saturday’s announcement KSHC is spearheading a fundraiser to secure $10000 for the locomotive’s restoration by the end of 2021.

The National Trust’s annual review of wildlife and weather for the year highlights how climate change is affecting landscapes and nature – with winners and losers this year.

It was a good year for many orchids but butterflies had a bad summer and it was a bad nesting season for birds at some of the sites the National Trust cares for across England Wales and Northern Ireland.

The dry March and an April that was the fourth driest since 1862 saw wildfires at two significant landscapes cared for by the National Trust: the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland and Marsden Moor in Yorkshire.

The fire in the Mourne Mountains devastated 200 hectares (500 acres) of land and the Yorkshire blaze ripped through 520 hectares (nearly 1300 acres) of moorland destroying a diverse range of plants and affecting threatened birds in both sites.

On the Dorset coast a 300-metre cliff fall in April the largest on the stretch of coastline for 60 years was caused by prolonged periods of dry weather rain and erosion by the sea the National Trust said.

And the late autumn with a good show of colour was brought to a sharp end in November with Storm Arwen which uprooted hundreds of trees at Bodnant Gardens Wales and at other sites such as Wallington in Northumberland.

Ben McCarthy head of nature conservation and restoration ecology at the National Trust said: “Climate change is making some forms of extreme weather events the new normal.

“Heatwaves and heavy rainfall are becoming more frequent and more intense.

“What we’re seeing in the UK with the impacts of wildfires and severe storms such as Arwen and Barra is how climate change is altering our landscapes forever. ”

He warned the extreme events were putting even more pressure on the UK’s wildlife which is already in trouble with more than half of species in decline and 15% under threat of extinction.

“Our nature is part of what makes the UK unique and we must all play our part to protect it ” he urged saying conserving nature and improving habitats could support larger populations that were better able to respond to climate change.

Orchids were among wildlife winners in 2021 with good displays of pyramidal orchids on Rodborough Common in Gloucestershire in June bee orchids on the Golden Cap estate in Dorset and autumn lady’s tresses at some grasslands and sand dunes in southern England and Wales.

But butterflies struggled with 60% of species recorded in lower numbers than in 2020 according to conservation charity Butterfly Conservation’s Big Butterfly Count.

National Trust noticed butterflies emerging later in the very cool spring and lower numbers at sites such as in the New Forest while the reintroduced large blue butterfly also saw numbers down in Somerset and Gloucestershire.

But purple emperors were seen at Anglesey Abbey Cambridgeshire for the first time and at Sheringham Park Norfolk which they appeared to colonise in 2017 while the critically endangered spider Zora silvestris was discovered at Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire.

A chilly April and rain and gales in May hit the nesting attempts of birds from barn owls at Mount Stewart Northern Ireland to lapwings at Blakeney Freshes in Norfolk.

It was a mixed year for terns (Tim Robinson/National Trust/PA)

And it was a mixed year for terns with different species of the seabirds faring well or badly at various sites depending on their local circumstances.

Arctic terns saw numbers increase at Long Nanny in Northumberland with the reestablishment of 24-hour patrols to ward off predators but little terns were flooded out and Sandwich and common terns did well at Blakeney Point due to a lack of disturbance and plentiful food.

Late frosts in April and into late May hit apple blossom and the harvest particularly in northern parts of England and Northern Ireland but a warm damp autumn with few frosts proved to be a bumper year for grassland fungi such as waxcaps.",,,

Approximately 30 minutes after launch Webb detached from the Ariane 5 rocket marking the beginning of a million-mile journey and the start of a two-week complex deployment process to unfold the spacecraft in preparation for arrival at Lagrange Point 2 (L2).

“Since the dawn of the space age NASA international partner agencies and industry partners together with Northrop Grumman have been defining what is possible in space science and exploration” said Kathy Warden chairman chief executive officer and president Northrop Grumman. “Over the next few weeks the James Webb Space Telescope will transform into an awe-inspiring scientific tool that will usher in a new era in human discovery.”

During the journey to L2 Webb will convert from its stowed position in which it left Earth to the configuration that will allow it to see light coming from the earliest stars to shine in the Universe. Part of this journey is to unfold the tennis court-sized five-layer sunshield around the sensitive mirrors that allow Webb to take pictures and collect data that will come back to Earth for scientific review. Once operational Webb will explore farther than ever before into the cosmos looking back 13.5 billion years.

For the last time on Earth the James Webb Space Telescope’s sunshield was deployed and tensioned by testing teams at Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach California where final deployment tests were completed.

To deliver this kind of scientific data Webb incorporates innovative design advanced technology and groundbreaking engineering. Ten technological inventions were created to build the revolutionary telescope so that it can detect light from the first stars and galaxies. Some of these innovations include optics detectors and thermal control systems.

The Webb telescope is the biggest observatory built for launch into space. Its 18 gold-plated mirrors make for a system that is far more sensitive than the Hubble Space Telescope which it will succeed as humanity’s most powerful scientific instrument for studying the formation of our universe and distant worlds in our galaxy.

But the Webb with a price tag of some $10 billion has trudged through one of the most fraught development timelines of any space program lasting over two decades and costing billions more than its original estimate.

“The stuff they faced was what a lot of space programs face because everything has to be perfect on a spacecraft like that — you can’t go fix it after launch” said Cristina Chaplain who for roughly a decade led audits of the James Webb Space Telescope at the Government Accountability Office Congress’ watchdog agency.

“It’s very complex and fragile” she said. “There’s going to be mistakes but on a program like that one little teensy thing can have dramatic consequences.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3M5bGl2ZS5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS9sb29raW5nLWJhY2staW4tdGltZS1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1hbmQtZGVsYXlzLW9mLXRoZS1qYW1lcy13ZWJiLXNwYWNlLXRlbGVzY29wZS0xNDI0MjjSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzOWxpdmUuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvbG9va2luZy1iYWNrLWluLXRpbWUtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtYW5kLWRlbGF5cy1vZi10aGUtamFtZXMtd2ViYi1zcGFjZS10ZWxlc2NvcGUtMTQyNDI4L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Looking back in time: Development and delays of the James Webb Space Telescope,"Looking back in time: Development and delays of the James Webb Space Telescope

The design and development of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) took place over a span of 30 years with engineers having to come up with new technologies that did not exist when astronomers conceptualised the instrument. While the telescope is waiting at the launchpad for its ride to the halo orbit around the second Sun-Earth Lagrange point the development of the instrument has already proved tremendously beneficial to humans on Earth.

The wavefront optical measurement devices have led to medical measurement instruments that can provide detailed data on the shape of human eyes in seconds as against hours. The laser interferometers used to dampen slight vibrations has found widespread applications in aerospace semiconductor and medical industries. The cryogenic Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) developed for Webb were also used to upgrade Hubble and continue its spectacular observations. The infrared sensors developed for JWST have also been used to upgrade the Hubble and were used in the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) instrument among other astronomical assets.

Webb is the largest observatory to be deployed in space with an expected operational cost of $9.4 billion over its planned mission duration making it the most expensive astronomical instrument as well. For a short span of time in the mid 2000s mission directors contemplated adding a grapple for servicing by future robotic or human missions but this plan was dropped. Instead there are several backup systems on the Webb and it is designed to be reliable and has been thoroughly tested to ensure that it works as expected. Still it is one of the riskiest missions undertaken has been plagued with delays and has even survived an attempt at cancellation. Here is a history of the development of the JWST.

1989-1996

Planned launch date: 2005

Even before the launch of Hubble astronomers were already planning the next generation space observatory that could fill in the holes in the Hubble observation runs. NASA along with the Space Telescope Science Institute (STSci) hosted the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) workshop to figure out the follow-on mission to Hubble. Astronomers felt the need for an instrument that could capture more data in the infrared spectrum to look at the distant objects as well as peer through the dust clouds obscuring newly formed stars observing their protoplanetary discs. These observations would provide a deeper understanding of the evolution of the cosmos as well as the origin of life.

Although the technologies did not exist at the time of conception astronomers were confident that they could be developed in time. These technologies involved the fabrication of lightweight optics the cryogenic instruments as well as technologies for polishing the mirror. The astronomers sat around discussing polishing grinding and chipping before advancing the design. At that point in time the proposed telescope was larger than the Webb with a primary mirror having a diameter between 10 and 16 metres. When it came to deciding the regime of the spacecraft a low Earth orbit was ruled out because of disturbance and heat and a high Earth orbit was considered problematic because of the difficulty of servicing. An acceptable compromise was locating the observatory on the Moon where it could potentially be serviced by future missions.

Following the first feasibility study in 1989 STSci and Goddard Space Flight Centre (GSFC) study the feasibility of The NGST. Three independent teams determine that such an instrument is feasible. Three independent teams determine that such an instrument is possible taking the plans ahead to the next round of mission studies. Teams from GSFC TRW and Bell Aerospace fine tune the technical features and financial requirements of the telescope. Lockheed Martin Bell Aerospace and TRW conduct preliminary analysis of design and cost.

1997-1999



Planned launch date: Late 2007 or early 2008

In 1998 the STSci which had been heading the Hubble programme since 1983 was chosen to manage the science operations of what was still named the NGST. Before the duties of STSci were expanded the facility was expected to shut down in 2010 with the cessation of operations of Hubble. NASA planned to start formal development of the NGST in 2003 and based on the experience with Hubble decided to involve the scientific community through the early stages of the design and development of the NGST.

There were four primary designs for the NGST that NASA was choosing between. The GSFC led design had a primary mirror 8 metres in diameter and a deployable sunshield to keep the instruments between -223 and -183 degrees Celsius. The Bell Aerospace design had four widely seperated sunshields as well as an 8 metre wide primary mirror mounted on three hinged slices. A Lockheed-Martin led design had a mirror 6 metres in diameter with rings of metal shields to keep the instruments cold along with a large deployable solar panel. Another design by TRW had a 3 metre wide primary mirror made up of six hexagonal panels surrounding a seventh panel in the middle and a sunshade with five layers of shields deployed with masts and wires.

While the GSFC Bell Aerospace and TRW designs were meant for the halo orbit in L2 the Lockheed-Martin design was meant for a highly elliptical orbit around the Sun to avoid the dust in spacecraft in orbit near the Earth. Elements from all these designs would make it to the JWST such as the deployable solar panel the hexagonal shaped mirror components a sunshield made up of multiple layers and the final deployment in the halo orbit at the second Sun-Earth Lagrange point.

In 1999 the instrument was still named the NGST. At a four day conference between September 13 and 16 scientists engineers from private spaceflight companies and representatives from NASA ESA and the Canadian Space Agency CSA met to discuss the scientific ideas and technical possibilities of the instrument that would fill in the gaps that Hubble was unable to study.

The fundamental idea of needing to observe the universe in infrared was crystallised to study the highly redshifted objects from the dawn of time the oldest stars and galaxies in the cosmos. At that time the instrument was planned to have a mirror 8 metres in diameter larger than the 6.5 metre wide mirror on the JWST. The more complicated mirror had 36 segments as against the 18 on the Webb. A consequence of the size was that the primary mirror had to be folded up to fit into any launch vehicle and later deployed in space.

The overall basic design of the instrument had been conceptualised but the specifics still needed to be worked out. This involved being able to engineer around formidable challenges such as the extremely low temperatures required for the infrared instruments to work figuring out how to unfold the mirror building a solar shield that can unfold to the size of a tennis court and reducing the weight of the entire instrument as well as packing it into the same size as Hubble.

2000 -2005

Planned launch date: 2011

Between 2000 and 2001 MIT Strategic Engineering Research Group (SERG) investigated some of the systems and design approaches that would eventually make it to the Webb. The Nexus Space Telescope was developed which had three deployable mirror segments as well as a deployable sunshield. This was to be a technology demonstration precursor mission to the Webb. The lightweight components needed to construct the optical telescope assembly cryogenic instruments and the optical pathways were all tested for performance. The Nexus telescope had a scheduled launch date of 2004 but the project was cancelled because of a lack of funding.

In 2002 the NGST was rechristened as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) after the second administrator of NASA James Webb who made it a point to balance out human exploratory launches with the missions that deployed instruments dedicated to the advancement of science. Although the presidential mandate was to put a man on the Moon Webb believed that the space program was more than a political race. While Webb was best known for being at the helm during the Apollo program the vigorous science program saw 75 launches during his tenure including several interplanetary missions. Robotic spacecraft were developed for the exploration of the Moon Mars and Venus under his tenure. In 1965 Webb suggested that a flagship space based observatory then known as the Large Space Telescope should become a major NASA effort.

Commenting on the change in name NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe said “It is fitting that Hubble’s successor be named in honor of James Webb. Thanks to his efforts we got our first glimpses at the dramatic landscapes of outer space. He took our nation on its first voyages of exploration turning our imagination into reality. Indeed he laid the foundations at NASA for one of the most successful periods of astronomical discovery. As a result we’re rewriting the textbooks today with the help of the Hubble Space Telescope the Chandra X-ray Observatory and in 2010 the James Webb Telescope.”

Along with the change in name NASA also announced that TRW will be responsible for constructing the instrument integrating the science instruments performing the pre-flight testing and the on-orbit checkout. The size of the primary mirror was not finalised but was decided to be no smaller than 6 metres in diameter. The expected width of the primary mirror was 7 metres.

In 2003 astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope spotted distant faint objects that were believed to be the first galaxies formed in the universe ending the cosmic “dark ages”. These galaxies were formed within a billion years of the Big Bang. Researchers estimate that there were around 400 million such objects filling the entire universe during that time and then believed that they only had to wait seven years before the JWST would reveal the entire population of proto-galactic objects. They are still waiting.

During this time it was believed that it would not be possible to extend the mission duration of Hubble beyond 2010 because of its decaying orbit. The original planned cessation of activities for the Hubble was 2010 with the satellite falling towards the Earth between 2013 and 2020. Astronomers desperately wanted a period of overlap when both the HST and the JWST would be in orbit which was one of the reasons that NASA planned the missions that would extend the life of Hubble.

Based on the timelines taken to launch previous observatories including Hubble and Chandra astronomers were almost certain that the JWST would be delayed to around 2017 at least. The recommendation from the scientific community was to extend the life of Hubble as much as possible so that observations from Hubble would be able to complement the observations from JWST which could not image the skies in visible light and the UV range of the spectrum.

On February 1 2003 the Colombia disaster changed NASA’s plans of what to do with its assets in space. Originally NASA had plans to bundle the Hubble into a shuttle and bring it back down to Earth to spend the remainder of its life as a museum exhibit. The number of crewed missions to space and their purpose had to be reevaluated after the Space Shuttle Colombia disintegrated during re-entry.

Christopher McKee one of the members in NASA’s advisory panel on deciding the future of Hubble said “Astronaut John Grunsfeld addressed the panel and said that he and his colleagues realize that whenever they go up they are risking their lives and they are perfectly willing to do that in order to enable Hubble to do more science but they were not ready to risk their lives just to bring it back to stick in a museum.” The recommendations by the panel was to extend the mission duration of Hubble as much as possible.

In 2003 the contract of prime constructor was awarded to Northrop Grumman previously held by TRW. After testing two mirror technologies beryllium and ultra-low expansion glass with a evaluation lasting six months the beryllium based design was chosen. The number of segments was reduced to 18 with the primary mirror diameter finalised to its current measurements of 6.5 metres. Construction of the mirror segments began in 2004.

After five years of development on the technology NASA began to construct the primary mirror segments. Lee Feinberg JWST Telescope Manager at GSFC said “The development of the lightweight cryogenic beryllium mirror technology has been ongoing for nearly five years so the recent demonstration of the critical aspects of this technology and the resulting formal start of the primary mirror manufacturing is a significant achievement in the overall program.”

The 18 segments of the primary mirror were manufactured in three batches of six segments each with work proceeding parallelly on all the segments on an assembly line. The ESA’s Ariane V was chosen as the launch vehicle. The target halo orbit at L2 was confirmed with a planned mission duration between 5 and 10 years.

In 2005 Northrop Grumman displayed a full scale model of the JWST at the National Space Symposium in Colorado Springs. The model was built to demonstrate the scale and complexity of the telescope. At that time the official launch date was still 2011 though most astronomers involved in working with space observatories were skeptical and anticipated a delay to a date beyond 2017. Also notably the time required to reach the halo orbit at the L2 point was three months at that time as against the one month required today.

2006-2010

Planned launch date: 2013 or 2014

The sequence of deployments for the Webb is worked out with the solar panel deploying soon after launched followed by the communications antenna and then the five layer sunshield. There are over 40 deployable components on board the Webb. The construction of the Integrated Science Instruments Module (ISIM) which served as the “chassis” for the space telescope was completed along with the Backplane which served as the spine for the Optical Telescope Element (OTE) made up of the primary and secondary mirrors as well as the supporting structures and the Backplane. The OTE directed the captured light to the science instruments in the ISIM. The Sunshield protected both the OTE and the ISIM from the energies of the Sun as well as the reflected radiation from the Moon and Earth.

A number of technologies that just did not exist at the time of conception were created just for the Webb. These included a light but tough sunshield to protect the instruments from radiation the near and mid-infrared detectors lightweight backing frames for the mirror segments and microshutters the width of three to six human hairs to selectively block out light and allow the observatory to better image its targets. NASA also developed the software and algorithms needed to make the nineteen individual mirrors on the instrument function as a single surface.

2011-2015

Planned launch date: October 2018

In 2011 the JWST survived an attempt by the US Congress to shut down the project because of escalating costs and delays. The move came after a review panel found that the project was plagued with bad management poor planning and too much optimism about the challenges faced. The representatives believed that the space agency should focus on smaller projects that could support a broader segment of the community as against resource hungry flagship science missions. Scientists and the astronomy community protested strongly against the move with movements petitions and calls to action. NASA managed to reach a compromise by promising more closer monitoring of the schedule and costs delaying other programs and smartly reallocating available resources.

At the time of the attempted cancellation over 75 percent of the hardware for the telescope had been constructed. The mirrors were ready to be integrated into the telescope by that time. Over the next few years all the hardware for the telescope finished construction. The science instruments were integrated into the ISIM.

After checking the ISIM by spinning it around in a centrifuge to check if it would behave as expected when deployed the four science instruments the near-infrared camera (NIRCam) the mid-infrared instrument (MIRI) the near-infrared spectrograph (NIRSpec) and the near-infrared imager and slitless spectrograph (NIRISS) were all integrated into the JWST. In 2015 the ISIM was tested with all four science instruments for three months in a cryogenic vacuum chamber to make sure that the instruments work as expected when deployed in space.

On December 17 2015 ESA signed the launch contract for deploying the telescope from Europe’s spaceport at Kourou in October 2018. At that time the mirror segments were being assembled and the ISIM was undergoing further cryogenic testing. Stéphane Israël Chairman and CEO of Arianespace said “It is a great honour for Arianespace to be entrusted with the launch of JWST a major space observatory which will enable science to make a leap forward in its quest of understanding our Universe. It is also an immense privilege to be part of such an international endeavour gathering the best of US European and Canadian space technology and industry.”

2017

Planned launch date: Between March and June 2019

A month before the scheduled launch date in October 2017 NASA announced that the launch was being pushed to 2019. This was because the integration of the various spacecraft elements was taking longer than expected. Eric Smith program director for the JWST said “Webb’s spacecraft and sunshield are larger and more complex than most spacecraft. The combination of some integration activities taking longer than initially planned such as the installation of more than 100 sunshield membrane release devices factoring in lessons learned from earlier testing like longer time spans for vibration testing has meant the integration and testing process is just taking longer. Considering the investment NASA has made and the good performance to date we want to proceed very systematically through these tests to be ready for a Spring 2019 launch.”

March 2018

Planned launch date: May 2020

The science payload consisting of the ISIM and the Optical Telescope Element (OTE with the primary mirror the secondary mirror and the backplane which forms the “spine” of the spacecraft) was shipped to Northrop Grumman along with the spacecraft element and the sunshield for the integration of the spacecraft. NASA announced that it needed additional time for further testing of the fully integrated spacecraft to ensure that it would survive the forces it would encounter during the launch. In some of the vibration tests screws and washers came loose from the spacecraft element.

The spacecraft element had to undergo further environmental testing to make sure that it survives the vibrational acoustic and thermal environments that it would be subjected to during the launch. Engineers also needed to integrate all the components and ensure that they worked well with each other. Thomas Zurbuchen associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate said “Considering the investment NASA and our international partners have made we want to proceed systematically through these last tests with the additional time necessary to be ready for a May 2020 launch.”

June 2018

Planned launch date: March 2021

Just a month later Webb Independent Review Board (WIRB) submitted a review with recommendations to NASA with decisive steps necessary to ensure the success of the mission. The WIRB found that several factors including technical difficulties and human errors had impacted the development schedule of the spacecraft. Tom Young the chair of the review board said “Webb should continue based on its extraordinary scientific potential and critical role in maintaining U.S. leadership in astronomy and astrophysics. Ensuring every element of Webb functions properly before it gets to space is critical to its success.”

Zurbuchen added “The more we learn more about our universe the more we realize that Webb is critical to answering questions we didn’t even know how to ask when the spacecraft was first designed. Webb is poised to answer those questions and is worth the wait. The valuable recommendations of the IRB support our efforts towards mission success; we expect spectacular scientific advances from NASA’s highest science priority.” The launch was pushed to March 30 2021.

July 2020

Planned launch date: October 2021

In July 2021 NASA announced that it was targeting an October 31 2021 launch because of delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic as well as technical challenges. The new safety precautions reduced personnel on-site and disruptions to shift work were cited as a reason for pushing back of the launch date. By this time the fully integrated spacecraft was undergoing a further series of tests including system level environmental testing to ensure that it works as intended once deployed in the halo orbit at L2.

Zurbuchen said “The perseverance and innovation of the entire Webb Telescope team has enabled us to work through challenging situations we could not have foreseen on our path to launch this unprecedented mission. Webb is the world’s most complex space observatory and our top science priority and we’ve worked hard to keep progress moving during the pandemic. The team continues to be focused on reaching milestones and arriving at the technical solutions that will see us through to this new launch date next year.”

September 2021

Planned launch date: December 18 2021

In August 2021 NASA announced that the rigorous testing regimen for the observatory had been completed and that the spacecraft was being redied for shipping to the launch site. In September 2021 NASA announced that the launch date had been shifted to December 18 a move made in co-ordination with Arianespace which had a number of Ariane 5 flights lined up including the VA254 launch the first Ariane 5 flight since 2020 and VA255 flight. The launches which took place in July and October deployed two communications satellites to geosynchronous orbit each.

Gregory L Robinson Webb’s program director said “Webb is an exemplary mission that signifies the epitome of perseverance. I am inspired by our dedicated team and our global partnerships that have made this incredible endeavor possible. Together we’ve overcome technical obstacles along the way as well as challenges during the coronavirus pandemic. I also am grateful for the steadfast support of Congress. Now that we have an observatory and a rocket ready for launch I am looking forward to the big day and the amazing science to come.”

Planned launch date: December 22 2021

During the pre-launch operations while technicians were preparing to attach the instrument to the launch vehicle a clamp band suddenly loosened shaking the delicate observatory. An anomaly board immediately flocked to the telescope to make sure that none of the components were damaged. The telescope turned out to be fine but the incident delayed the launch by four days to December 22.

Planned launch date: December 24 2021

The launch was delayed by another two days to December 24 because of problems with a communication link to the launch vehicle that had to be fixed. The revised launch date was for Christmas Eve which would have been a perfect Christmas present to astronomers and enthusiasts of space science. The NASA and contractor team dwindled because of the holidays and NASA Administrator Bill Nelson told the Associated Press “Since it’s Christmas Eve all the congressional delegations that were going down all of that has evaporated”. However Nelson confirmed his own presence at the launch and even broke into song “All I want for Christmas are not my two front teeth but for the success of JWST.”

Planned launch date: December 25 2021

A weather forecast of high speed high altitude winds played spoilsport to a Christmas Eve launch posing a risk of blowing the launch vehicle off course or even destroying it. The mission control team indicated that another review of the expected weather conditions would be conducted on December 23. Other activities associated with the launch proceeded as planned with the rocket rolled out to the launch pad a process that takes two hours and the completion of a launch readiness review after which the telescope was greenlit for launch.

By 2023 (or 2024 or 2025 or maybe 2030 depending on whom you ask) you may look up into the night sky and see no International Space Station (ISS) flying above you. Russia you see keeps threatening to pull out of the project and take its space station modules with it -- and right now ISS can't operate without them.

On the other hand Russia's Roscosmos space agency also just announced that it will launch up to four space tourism flights to the station annually for the foreseeable future hoping to replace revenues lost when American astronauts switched from flying on Russian Soyuz rockets to flying on SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft instead.

Roscosmos plans to increase the production of #Soyuz spacecrafts to four per year to launch more space tourists. https://t.co/YA6GogTYvI — Katya Pavlushchenko (@katlinegrey) December 16 2021

With this new development it seems Russia's plans to abandon ISS forcing NASA to find a way to keep the station running without Russia are up in the air (so to speak). But even if Russia does stick around when you consider that the ISS project began in 1998 with an expected service life of 15 years the station's days are clearly numbered. Whether the actual end date is 2023 2030 or somewhere in between eventually ISS is going to go away.

So what are we going to do when that happens?

Calling all space companies

Apparently we're going to build new space stations -- commercial space stations built by companies you can invest in.

We know this because earlier this month NASA picked three companies out of a field of 11 bidders and awarded them ""Commercial Low Earth Orbit Development"" contracts totaling $415.6 million in value. The lucky winners were:

Aerospace and defense giant Northrop Grumman NOC 0.39% )

Privately held Nanoracks a subsidiary of Voyager Space Holdings which was awarded $160 million to design a research-focused ""Starlab"" in cooperation with Lockheed Martin LMT 0.36% )

And Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space tourism company which got $130 million to help it get its planned ""Orbital Reef"" space station concept off the ground.

Mind you none of these space station concepts are quite ready for prime time. Both Nanoracks and Blue Origin are looking to begin launching modules only in the second half of this decade -- but before 2030 -- while Northrop hasn't made a date for its space station public yet. But if these plans pan out investors could soon have at least two publicly traded space station operators Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin -- and potentially three should Blue Origin decide to IPO -- to choose from.

What happens next

The contracts envision space station construction to proceed in two ""Phases."" In Phase One the concept phase the three main awardees will ""formulate and design commercial low-Earth orbit destination capabilities suitable for potential government and private sector needs ... through 2025.""

That accomplished NASA will shift into Phase Two in which it ""intends to certify for NASA crew member use commercial low-Earth orbit destinations."" (Implied but strangely not stated outright in NASA's announcement is that for a ""destination"" -- a space station -- to be certified it will presumably have to be built first.)

Still assuming space stations are built and certified NASA anticipates that going forward it will pay contractors to host probably two NASA astronauts in low Earth orbit (LEO) more or less continuously. NASA will also lease space necessary to conduct ""approximately 200 investigations annually to support human research technology demonstrations [and] biological and physical science"" in orbit.

In this way NASA hopes to ensure low-cost continued access to low Earth orbit for its needs while freeing itself to focus more intently on ""its Artemis missions to the Moon and on to Mars."" And with NASA guaranteeing it will remain a client for the foreseeable future these companies can rest assured they'll have a revenue stream with which to pay back any investment they make in building the stations.

That should make the decision to build the space stations a bit easier for the companies involved -- and give investors a better shot at one day owning a piece of a space station company (or three).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMjAvc2NpZW5jZS93ZWJiLXRlbGVzY29wZS1hc3Ryb25vbXktaG9tb3Bob2JpYS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Webb Telescope's Latest Stumbling Block: Its Name (Published 2021),"Many astronomers were disappointed when NASA’s up-and-coming space telescope the successor to the vaunted Hubble Space Telescope was named for James Webb a former NASA administrator who led the agency through the glory years of the Apollo missions. Why not name it for an astronomer the way other space missions — Hubble Kepler — have been instead of a bean counter? But they held their tongues.

After all the new telescope which is now scheduled to be launched from a spaceport in French Guiana on Dec. 18 was designed to be bigger and more powerful than the Hubble. Orbiting the sun a million miles from Earth it will be capable of bringing into focus the earliest stars and galaxies in the universe and closely inspecting the atmospheres of nearby exoplanets for signs of life or habitability.

Now a new objection to the Webb name has arisen inflaming the astronomical community. In 2015 Dan Savage a columnist for The Stranger a Seattle newspaper called attention to the fact that James Webb before running NASA had been the under secretary of state in the Truman administration during the Lavender Scare a period when thousands of gay men and lesbians lost their government jobs as potential security risks. Was this the kind of person to name a groundbreaking telescope after?

That question gained prominence this spring when four astronomers — Lucianne Walkowicz of the JustSpace Alliance and Adler Planetarium in Chicago Chanda Prescod-Weinstein of the University of New Hampshire Brian Nord of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and of the University of Chicago and Sarah Tuttle of the University of Washington — published an op-ed in Scientific American under the title “The James Webb Space Telescope Needs to Be Renamed.”"

Just like your Christmas turkey I have stuffed this system full of high-end hardware and added a small splash of RGB lighting to keep the Christmas spirit alive.

Recently a friend of mine asked me to build him a new gaming system which normally wouldn’t be a problem. However in the current climate with the extortionate graphics card prices it took me a while to put together a spec that was affordable and also available. After a few days with various stock informer Discord notifications being sent I finally settled on an RTX 3080 Ti (not the best value for money but needs must and all that) that was in stock so I grabbed it at almost £1490 (ouch).

With approximately £2500 to spend on the whole system (which would normally sound like a very healthy budget) we set about picking the rest of the parts for this system. The RTX 3080 Ti took up a big share of the budget but I managed to get what I think is a pretty decent spec gaming system and should hopefully give him a few enjoyable years of gaming with solid graphics performance.

System Specification:

Luckily my friend isn’t too fussy with how his systems look but there were a couple of requests regarding aesthetics. A black case had to be used and RGB should be kept to a minimum so pretty simple overall. I think I managed to fulfil those requests as you can see the build turned out to look quite stealthy with its mostly black interior and just the graphics card adding a splash of colour from the RGB lighting effects.

There are a couple of things worth mentioning about the build. I didn’t get the chance to review the Corsair 4000D case series when it was launched Leo had the pleasure of that but I have to say that now I have built a couple of systems in the 4000D it feels like a great budget case. I am also glad that Corsair chose to use plain black fans in the 4000D as the look worked perfectly with the theme of this build.

KitGuru says: Overall I was very pleased with how this build turned out minimal RGB lighting and the stealthy black interior is pleasing to the eye. I think I did pretty well with the spec for the budget available in the current market. What do you guys think of this £2500 build?

But what are some of the reasons that Pop!_OS stands out from other Ubuntu-based distros available? Why should you consider it as a daily driver for your computer?

I switched to Pop OS from Ubuntu three years ago and it has been my daily driver since then.

Let me point out the benefits of choosing it as the operating system of your choice.

Reasons to Pick Pop!_OS Over Other Linux Distributions

Note that some of the reasons listed could be entirely subjective to what you want and how you expect your desktop experience to be.

With that in mind let me highlight why I chose Pop!_OS as my main OS over other Linux distributions:

1. Separate NVIDIA/AMD ISO

In case you have a system with Nvidia GPU it is not feasible to make it work using Nouveau (an open-source driver for Nvidia cards).

Well you get a working display but you cannot utilize the benefits of your graphics card.

For instance you will encounter stuttering and performance issues with almost every task that needs to utilize the GPU.

Hence the proprietary Nvidia drivers are the only solution to make things right.

And to conveniently add the proprietary driver out of the box the distro needs to include it in the ISO itself or offer a separate ISO with Nvidia’s latest available proprietary driver.

While you can always manually install the proprietary drivers it is not always a flawless experience.

The procedure should be similar to that of installing Nvidia drivers in Linux Mint for most of the popular Linux distros if you are curious.

Driver Manager | Linux Mint (Cinnamon)

Note that at times you will need to troubleshoot or re-install the correct (or an older driver version of the driver) to use Nvidia graphics properly.

But if you get a separate ISO for Nvidia-powered systems or an Nvidia graphics installation mode (like Zorin OS) it eliminates the hassle of installing Nvidia drivers manually.

This is not just about the ease of use but Pop!_OS always works out of the box with the help Nvidia ISOs offered.

I have had issues with Linux Mint Ubuntu and a few other distributions when I tried to manually install the proprietary drivers. So Pop!_OS is a breeze to set up for my system with Nvidia graphics.

2. Automatic Tiling Manager

Without a tiling manager you need to constantly drag and drop (and move) your active windows to organize them for quick access.

So a window tiling manager makes it convenient to automatically organize the active windows of any application that you launch.

Of course the experience with a tiling manager will differ as per your screen size but even if you have a modest 27-inch size display it should be a noticeable experience.

I find myself using it all the time even without a big monitor (or a dual-monitor setup).

I have never used it on a laptop but at the end of the day having an automatic window tiling manager (that you can enable/disable) sounds like a useful feature.

It helps with enhancing your multi-tasking capabilities without necessarily moving to different workspaces.

3. Ease of Use

Why do you think Ubuntu is one of the best Linux distributions?

It manages to offer an easy-to-use modern desktop experience for years now.

Impressively System76 has managed to polish the user experience in Pop!_OS up a notch on top of Ubuntu.

Hence Pop!_OS is not just another Ubuntu distro but the presence of an application launcher application library dock workspace customizations and various other optimizations lead to a unique desktop experience.

For my use-case it feels better than Ubuntu. Not to forget it also includes some of its tools like Popsicle that comes in handy later down the road.

4. Newer Linux Kernel

Pop!_OS 21.10 featuring Linux Kernel 5.15.8

Ubuntu may not feature the latest and greatest Linux Kernel especially when it comes to LTS releases.

However Pop!_OS tries its best to offer the latest Linux Kernel releases even for the LTS releases. For instance Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS packs in Linux Kernel 5.11 but Pop!_OS 20.04 LTS features Linux Kernel 5.13.

For most users this may not be a big deal but Pop!_OS pushes newer Linux Kernel faster than most other Linux distributions.

If you want your latest and greatest hardware to work well with Linux distros Pop!_OS is a fantastic bet.

5. Application Launcher

Application launcher comes in incredibly handy to quickly launch an app or navigate between active windows.

The ability to invoke the launcher using a shortcut (or maybe a macro linked to it as I use it) makes it one of the quickest ways to launch applications and navigate between them.

Of course you can install tools like Ulauncher to achieve the same. However having it pre-configured and working out of the box without any troubleshooting is convenient.

6. Fast Upgrade Process

Even though upgrading Linux distributions is usually hassle-free Pop!_OS tries its best to refine and improve the upgrade process with every update.

For instance with Pop!_OS 21.10 they introduced improvements that would prevent conflicts in the upgrade process and make it a seamless process.

In fact I upgraded from Pop!_OS 21.04 to 21.10 in a few clicks without any issues.

7. Thrives to Improve the Modern Desktop Experience

Pop!_OS may not be a lightweight Linux distro but it focuses on providing a top-notch experience for modern desktop users.

While there are plenty of good Linux distributions for older computers it is equally important to aim for newer-gen hardware.

Pop!_OS does that incredibly well considering System76 also tests the distribution on latest hardware configurations with their laptops.

In addition Pop!_OS also offers out-of-the-box tweaks that makes things easy for a user in terms of OS experience. While Linux is all about tweaking and taking control of your system Pop!_OS seems to be succeeding in making it a mainstream option and a viable alternative to Ubuntu that could prove to be better for some.

Bonus: Package Updates

System76 has recently switched away from Launchpad to its own repositories with the Pop!_OS 21.10 release.

It should let them push updates faster and take control of packages to ensure the best experience for users.

This should also make the Pop!_Shop more useful. So yet another reason to keep using Pop!_OS on my machine.

Wrapping Up

Pop!_OS does a lot of good things.

And if you are confused with choosing a Linux distro that is easy to use compatible with latest hardware and fits various use-cases I would recommend Pop!_OS.

The above-mentioned reasons are why I stick to it even after I tried switching away to Zorin OS and Linux Mint for a few months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9HZUZvcmNlLVJUWC0zMDgwLUxhcHRvcC1HUFUtdnMtTlZJRElBLUdlRm9yY2UtUlRYLTMwODAtVGktdnMtR2VGb3JjZS1SVFgtMzA4MC1UaS1MYXB0b3AtR1BVXzEwNDc0XzEwNzAyXzExMTE3LjI0NzU5OC4wLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU vs NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti vs NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU,"The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU or 3080 Mobile (for laptops GN20-E7) is the fastest graphics card for notebooks in early 2021. It is based on the GA104-775-A1 Ampere chip and offers 8 or 16 GB GDDR6 graphics memory with a 256 Bit memory bus. It supports PCIe 4.0 and will be available in different variants from 80 - 150 Watt (TGP) (80 90 115 125 135 145 and 150+ Watt). As package the notebook graphic card uses GB5-256 and the chip size is 40x40mm. The GPU supports eDP 1.4b to connect the internal monitor.

There is no more Max-Q variant (formerly used for the low power variants) but every OEM can choose to implement Max-Q technologies (Dynamic Boost Whispermode).

The performance depends on the TGP setting and cooling of the laptop. At the same TGP level the RTX3080 should be faster than the old top model the RTX 2080 Super Mobile and similar to the desktop RTX 3070. This means the GPU should be well suited for 4k gaming or QHD with high frame rates. The similar named RTX 3080 desktop card is significantly faster.

The GA104 chip offers 6144 FP32 ALUs of which half can also execute INT32 instructions (i.e. 3072 INT32 ALUs). With Turing all shaders could still execute FP32 or INT32 instructions. The raytracing and tensor cores on the chip were also improved according to Nvidia. The Ampere chips also include an improved 5th generation video encoder (NVENC for H.264 and H.265) and a 7th generation decoder (for various formats now including AV1).

The GA104 chip is manufactured by Samsung in 8nm (8N) which is not quite able to keep up with the 7nm node at TSMC (e.g. used by AMD and also for the professional GA100 Ampere chip).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmt0ZWNocG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNS9uZXctd29ybGQtcmVjb3JkLWZvci1kcHUtcGVyZm9ybWFuY2Utc2V0LWJ5LW52aWRpYS1ibHVlZmllbGQv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya3RlY2hwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzI1L25ldy13b3JsZC1yZWNvcmQtZm9yLWRwdS1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1zZXQtYnktbnZpZGlhLWJsdWVmaWVsZC8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New World Record for DPU Performance Set by NVIDIA BlueField,"Data centers require incredibly rapid storage access and as per the latest report by NVIDIA Its BlueField-2 DPU is the fastest available.

NVIDIA’s recent testing revealed that two BlueField-2 data processing units achieved 41.5 million input/output operations per second (IOPS) – more than four times the IOPS of any other DPU.

Using conventional networking protocols and open-source software the BlueField-2 DPU achieved record-breaking performance. It obtained greater than 5 million 4KB IOPS and more than 20 million 512B IOPS for NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) a standard means of accessing storage media using TCP networking one of the fundamental internet protocols.

It enables even better storage performance leveraging the popular RoCE network transport option to boost AI big data and high-performance computing applications.

BlueField outperformed both as an initiator and a target in testing simulating real-world storage setups with different storage software libraries and workloads. InfiniBand the recommended networking architecture for many HPC and AI applications is also supported by BlueField.

Methodology of Testing

BlueField’s 41.5 million IOPS is more than four times the previous world record of 10 million IOPS obtained utilizing proprietary storage options. This performance was obtained by connecting two fast Hewlett Packard Enterprise Proliant DL380 Gen 10 Plus servers one serving as the application server (storage initiator) and the other as the storage system (storage target).

Each server was outfitted with two Intel “Ice Lake” Xeon Platinum 8380 CPUs running at 2.3GHz resulting in 160 hyperthreaded cores per server and 512GB of DRAM 120MB of L3 cache (60MB per socket) and a PCIe Gen4 interface.

To accelerate networking and NVMe-oF each server was outfitted with two NVIDIA BlueField-2 P-series DPU cards each with two 100Gb Ethernet network ports for a total of four network ports and 400Gb/s wire bandwidth between initiator and target which were linked together using NVIDIA LinkX 100GbE Direct-Attach Copper (DAC) passive cables. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) was installed on both systems.

Both SPDK and the regular upstream Linux kernel target were evaluated for storage system software using the default kernel 4.18 and one of the most recent kernels 5.15. Three storage initiators were tested: SPDK the regular kernel storage initiator and the SPDK FIO plugin. FIO and SPDK were used for workload creation and measurement. I/O sizes were tested using 4KB and 512B common medium and small storage I/O sizes respectively.

The NVMe-oF storage protocol was tested at the network transport layer with both TCP and RoCE. Each setup was evaluated with total bidirectional network usage with 100% read 100% write and 50/50 read/write workloads.

The study also found the following BlueField DPU performance characteristics:

Testing with smaller 512B I/O sizes yielded better IOPS but lower-than-line-rate throughput whereas testing with 4KB I/O sizes yielded higher throughput but lower IOPS statistics.

100% read and 100% write workloads yielded comparable IOPS and throughput. However 50/50 mixed read/write workloads delivered more extraordinary performance by simultaneously leveraging both directions of the network connection.

Using SPDK resulted in faster performance than kernel-space software but at the expense of increased server CPU use which is expected given that SPDK operates in user space with continual polling.

Because of frequent storage enhancements introduced by the Linux community the current Linux 5.15 kernel performed better than the 4.18 kernel.

DPU Storage Performance that Sets Records Enables Storage Performance with Security

In addition to quick storage access BlueField enables hardware-accelerated encryption and decryption of both Ethernet storage traffic and storage media preventing data theft or exfiltration. It offloads IPsec at up to 100Gb/s (data on the wire) and 256-bit AES-XTS at up to 200Gb/s (data at rest) lowering the risk of data theft if an adversary has tapped the storage network or if physical storage devices are stolen sold or disposed of incorrectly.

Customers and leading security software vendors are leveraging BlueField’s recently updated NVIDIA DOCA framework to run cybersecurity applications – such as a distributed firewall or security groups with micro-segmentation – on the DPU to improve application and network security for compute servers lowering the risk of unauthorized access or data modifications on storage attached to those servers.

Colombia which is Latin America’s third-largest petroleum producer and the world’s largest manufacturer of cocaine for nearly a century has been caught in a simmering low-intensity asymmetric conflict that reached boiling point during the 1980s. The primary flashpoint for the civil conflict which currently engulfs Colombia and failed to end with the 2016 FARC peace accord was the April 1948 assassination of Liberal Party leader Jorge Gaitan in Bogota. That sparked the Bogotazo days of violent rioting that swept across Bogota resulting in up to 3000 deaths which eventually evolved into a vicious 10-year civil war between the Colombian Liberal and Conservative parties known as La Violencia. While that brutal struggle ended in a 1958 power-sharing agreement between Colombia’s leading political parties it sowed the seeds for the current low-intensity multiparty asymmetric conflict. In 1964 the Colombian Communist Party formed the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC – Spanish initials) after a military attack on the community of Marquetalia a Communist peasant enclave established during the of La Violencia. That event saw the communist FARC emerge as the most powerful left-wing anti-government armed group during the conflict. The guerillas eventually cut ties with the Colombian Communist Party and increasingly relied upon kidnapping extortion and cocaine trafficking to fund their operations. Prior to these events which cast Colombia into what appears to be a never-ending low-intensity asymmetric multiparty civil conflict oil was discovered in 1918 at the La Cira-Infantas field in the Middle Magdalena Basin near the city of Barrancabermeja. Even after additional petroleum discoveries in the Middle Magdalena Basin it was not until the giant Caño Limon Cusiana and Cupiagua oilfields were discovered between 1983 and 1993 that Colombia embarked on becoming a major oil producer. Those mega discoveries and a notable increase in foreign energy investment as well as petroleum production occurred despite violence surging because of the tremendous influx of profits from the booming cocaine trade.

Even the tremendous escalation of violence homicides kidnappings and attacks on energy infrastructure which escalated in the late-1980s lasting well into the early 21st century had little material impact on Colombia’s hydrocarbon sector. By 1991 Colombia was pumping over 400000 barrels per day more than double its output in 1985 despite becoming the world’s murder capital with a homicide rate of 84 intentional killings per 100000 people. That was more than eight times greater than the U.S. which reported 9.8 homicides per 100000 head of population 7-times higher than neighboring Venezuela’s murder rate of 12 and 8-times larger than Ecuador’s 11 homicides per 100000 people.

Heightened insecurity and violence remained a persistent problem in Colombia even after the collapse of the Medellin and Cali cartels as the FARC and National Liberation Army ELN (Spanish initials) ramped-up operations as vast revenue flowed in from the drug trade. By 2000 after President Andres Pastrana’s peace negotiations with the FARC had failed the leftist guerillas controlled a 42000 square mile territory in southeastern Colombia and kidnappings had surged to a record high of 3500 for the year. Even those events failed to have any material impact on Colombia’s oil boom. A combination of soaring oil prices and rapidly improving internal security during the early 2000s because of Plan Colombia and President Alvaro Uribe’s military campaign against the FARC saw foreign energy investment and hence crude oil production growth.

During 2003 when Brent averaged $28.83 per barrel a 15% increase over 2002 Colombia pumped an average of 550000 barrels of crude oil per day. When Brent had soared to over $140 per barrel during 2008 annual petroleum production averaged 600000 barrels daily and kept growing to peak at a yearly record of just over 1 million barrels per day by 2013. Since 2016 Colombia’s petroleum output has been in terminal decline impacted at first by the late-2014 oil price crash sharply rising violence and finally because of the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Even the 2017 demobilization of the largest leftist guerilla group the FARC after a 2016 peace agreement was struck with the government of President Juan Manuel Santos has done little if anything to arrest Colombia’s production decline. That in part can be blamed on current President Ivan Duque’s reluctance to fully implement the peace deal contributing to an increase in violence and civil unrest in regional Colombia.

During 2020 the crisis-driven Andean nation only pumped on average 781300 barrels of crude oil per day as the COVID-19 pandemic related national quarantine lockdown and sharply weaker oil prices impacted investment as well as production. More worrying is that despite the pandemic lockdown ending by September 2020 and energy investment increasing average petroleum output only reached 734231 barrels per day for the first 10 months of 2021 which is 6% less than the full year 2020. That disappointing decline occurred because of heightened civil unrest with anti-government protests sweeping across Colombia during late- April 2021 lasting into May and early-June 2021. Falling crude oil output can also be attributed to rising insecurity in regional areas where petroleum industry operations are concentrated fueled by a marked uptick in violence related to the activities of illegal armed groups and cocaine production.

It is the cocaine trade that is an enduring problem for Colombia. The tremendous profits that the trade generates are responsible for fueling what is a near-perpetual low-level asymmetric conflict where only the illegal armed actors change as the various groups fragment and reform. Estimates vary but Colombia’s government believes the civil conflict has claimed up to 260000 lives and displaced at least 9 million people. According to the UN Colombia’s cocaine production during 2020 increased by 8% compared to a year earlier despite a 7% decrease in the volume of land used for coca cropping and an 18% increase in seizures. The scale of massive profits generated by cocaine is highlighted by former finance minister Juan Carlos Echeverry’s estimate (Spanish) that the drug trade generates $8 to $12 billion annually which is equivalent to 5 to 4% of Colombia’s gross domestic product. Using Echeverry’s numbers the cocaine trade is contributing the same amount if not more to Colombia’s GDP than the oil industry which based on DANE data (Spanish) for the first 3 quarters of 2021 was responsible for 3% of GDP.

Rising security risk and rural violence which is mostly fueled by the vast profits generated by the cocaine trade is a key deterrent to attracting onshore oil investment in Colombia. A combination of security risks and mature assets saw Occidental Petroleum in October 2020 sell its Colombian onshore petroleum assets in an $825 million deal although the company retained its offshore exploration blocks. Despite the risks associated with operating in onshore Colombia the Andean country’s 2021 bid round found some success. Seven companies made offers for 30 of the 53 blocks (Spanish) on offer with initial investment expected to exceed $148 million. Five of the offers came from national oil company Ecopetrol or its subsidiaries and 21 from intermediate energy companies with existing operational presence in Colombia Parex Resources Frontera Energy and Canacol Energy. This indicates that Colombia is struggling to attract foreign onshore energy investment because of the heightened security risks coupled with high breakeven prices and elevated carbon content of the sour heavy crude oil produced.

For many swimming in college is a lifelong dream that is pursued with dedication and determination. Fitter and Faster is proud to honor these athletes and those who supported them on their journey.

Cara O’Toole from London Great Britain has announced her commitment to continue her academic and athletic careers at Old Dominion University beginning in the 2022-2023 school year. She has the potential to make a huge impact at the conference level and in school history.

“SO so excited to officially announce that I have been given the most amazing opportunity to continue my academic and swimming career at Old Dominion University . A massive thank you to my coaches family and friends who have supported me throughout the process🤍#reignon🦁🇺🇸”

O’Toole swims for Ealing Swimming Club out of London GBR. In February 2020 she competed at the Middlesex County Championships where she earned long course best times in the 800 freestyle (8:54.50) and the 200 backstroke (2:19.69).

She continued her success into March 2020 as she earned numerous best times while at the Region Spring Open Meet. Those times included the long course 200 (2:07.30) 400 (4:21.27) and 1500 (17:02.57) freestyles as well as the 100 backstroke (1:05.96).

She is a British 2x national medalist Swim England 2x national medalist and a London region Champion. She also was selected to the Swim England London team that was supposed to race in Barcelona before the meet was canceled due to COVID-19 and she qualified for the British and Irish 2021 Olympic Trials.

O’Toole attends Royal Masonic School for girls in Rickmansworth England.

Her best times (LCM/SCM) with SCY conversions are:

200 freestyle: 2:07.30 2:04.89 (converts to 1:51.80)

400 freestyle: 4:21.27 4:17.68 (converts to 4:52.73)

800 freestyle: 8:54.50 8:53.34 (converts to 9:58.87)

1500 freestyle: 17:02.57 17:27.58 (converts to 16:42.51)

200 backstroke: 2:19.69 2:14.94 (converts to 2:01.56)

Based on her best converted times O’Toole has the potential to make a huge impact for Old Dominion at the conference level. They would have earned her a second place finish in the 1650 freestyle a third place finish in the 500 freestyle and a seventh place finish in the 200 backstroke. She would have been the only member of the team in the top eight in the 500 and 1650 freestyles.

She also has the potential to make school history as her best converted times already put her third in school history in the 500 and 1650 freestyles as well as eighth in the 200 backstroke.

Old Dominion University is a public university located in Norfolk Virginia. The school is a member of Conference-USA (C-USA). The team finished sixth out of six teams at the 2021 C-USA Championships. They were led by current junior Tara Enneking who captured the conference title in the 200 IM.

O’Toole will arrive next fall as a member of the class of 2026 along with fellow international student Sadie Goldin.

The property located in a guard-gated neighborhood at 10 Davenport Lane was previously listed at $7.5 million but has gone through several price changes since it was listed.

It’s unclear how much the home actually sold for; however according to Mansion Global it was purchased by Shannon Ralston the founder and CEO of Angel Staffing -- a company that services medical facilities statewide.

The home sits on 12.2 acres and is built in the Santa Fe style with imported adobe and 14 hand-sculpted fireplaces.

Despite being almost 8000 square feet it has just three bedrooms but a detached casita offers a fourth bedroom.

According to the listing there are 6 and a half bathrooms and custom-designed features from artist Bill Tull throughout the property.

Storment keeps faith strong on his winding football journey,"When he concludes his college football career on Tuesday at the Liberty Bowl T.J. Storment will put the finishing touches on a journey perhaps unlike any other.

Many a college football player can say he was a 31-game starter at the FBS level. But who besides Storment can say he represented five schools spread over six years and four states? Since leaving high school in Statesville North Carolina the Red Raiders' 6-foot-7 315-pound offensive tackle has suited up for two years at Old Dominion and one each at Fullerton College Colorado State TCU and Texas Tech.

Just reading that in black and white one might conjure images of a self-centered mercenary interested only in what was best for him.

But ever since he was little if that description ever applied to a skyscraper of an offensive lineman Storment's been learning to enrich others as the son of parents who started a ministry 15 years ago.

""My faith in Christ is definitely my primary goal wherever I am to spread the word and have good community around me"" he said. ""That's my ultimate goal a lot more important than football. But my football journey has definitely been interesting.

""I don't know that there's ever been a guy to letter at four different Division I programs. If you had asked me in high school if that's what I thought it would be I'd say you're crazy. But it's the way the journey went and I wouldn't change it.""

Texas Tech news:Athletes' NIL deals reach $370K

The Tech tackle's winding path might be easier to understand considering coaching changes have been a significant reason. The day after Storment signed with Old Dominion ODU fired the offensive line coach who recruited him. Right off the bat a welcome to the harsh business of college football.

And Storment loved it at Colorado State but after his first season with the Rams CSU cut loose the Mike Bobo staff. TCU had long been one of his dream schools so when the CSU running backs coach went to TCU Storment followed. Then he followed offensive coordinator Sonny Cumbie from TCU to Tech where he's started 11 games for the Red Raiders this season at left tackle.

""I've never wanted to transfer from a single school I've been at to be honest with you"" Storment said. ""Out of high school I didn't really have many options. I wanted to do better which is why I chose to leave Old Dominion.

""Junior college you have to leave right? Colorado State I was there for a year started every game at left tackle and they fired our entire coaching staff. The coaches that recruited me at Old Dominion out of high school were let go.

""TCU last year was a little bit different situation but obviously I followed coach Cumbie here and we have a great relationship. Is it standard? No. Is it very very unique? For sure. But do I think that that changes anything about me as man me as a player me as a follower of Christ? No.""

But as backgrounds go in preparing a guy to meet new people Storment seems particularly well-suited. Fifteen years ago back home in North Carolina Jeff and Natalie Storment left the business world to start a Christian ministry. T.J. was 9 at the time.

Power Cross Ministries according to its website ""began in 2006 with four boys in a living room invited together for a Bible study dinner and a football game in the yard. That first week there were four boys the next there were eight and within a few months over thirty boys were taking part.

""Today Power Cross trains and disciples over 350 young men each day across two locations in Statesville and Salisbury North Carolina with a vision for more campuses all over the United States.

""Since we’ve begun our Power Cross family of staff and volunteers have served over 115000 free meals provided over 5000 hours of academic support and cheered on and coached hundreds of young men in countless games and practices.""

Powercross.org details its work under nine category subheadings: daily discipleship athletic teams and training academic support free meals daily mentorship from older volunteers transitional housing for the homeless or displaced family celebrations assistance in college recruiting and an annual Power of the Cross rally.

Storment said Power Cross Ministries ""was my entire life growing up.""

""I was one of the first kids to be in it"" he said. ""It started with me going up to Mom and Dad saying 'Hey what do you think about doing a Bible study' when I was 8.

""Dad always says he taught the worst Bible study ever taught because he'd just accepted Christ and he didn't know a ton about it.""

From such humble beginnings though the ministry and its purpose grew.

""They take inner-city kids that aren't as privileged as a lot of kids growing up"" Storment said. ""They have football basketball baseball wrestling programs tutoring facilities. They teach five or six Bible studies feed a couple of thousand meals. And they have a second location now.

""It started with me and five buddies doing a Bible study after basketball practice one time and God just kind of saw a need. It was just incredible to see how God's using my parents and seeing that ministry expand.""

The Power Cross emblem bears the motto ""Practice Hard Pray Harder.""

According to the Power Cross website 90 percent of its participants come from single-parent homes or are being raised by relatives. Those who are part of the program for at least two years it reports have a 100-percent graduation rate with 70 percent enrolling in college or vocational training.

""Power Cross is focused on providing young men with positive role models and a vision for what their lives can be"" it says. ""We work with young men across different economic backgrounds and home lives and we believe that athletics and discipleship have the ability to bridge the social and economic gaps we see in our communities.

""We believe that each young person deserves the same opportunity to excel by using the abilities they have been blessed with which is why Power Cross is 100% free to all participants.""

For Storment spending his childhood around so many other young people at Power Cross then playing for five college football programs in four time zones has enhanced his personal growth.

Drawing upon all those experiences he says has helped him become more social and less socially awkward. He's struggled with that in the past.

""I think that as I've continued to mature you'll see that I'm a lot more confident in certain social situations"" he said. ""But I think the primary thing that the ministry's helped with is having my core and my values and my faith in Jesus that is the primary way that I channel everything else I do.""

You can get stories like this one straight to your inbox every Thursday morning by subscribing here.

If you didn’t know semiconductor chips were important before the pandemic you do now.

Also known as “microchips” these little bits of tech form the brains behind new cars phones computers gaming consoles and countless other products we rely on everyday (which are now all abruptly in short supply).

Now IBM and Samsung have unveiled a new microchip design that promises radically faster more efficient chips — and a big upgrade to all of our tech that relies on them.

The challenge: Semiconductor chips contain tiny gates called “transistors” that control the flow of electricity. This is what allows a traditional computer to process information using a binary on/off code. (If a gate’s open that’s a “1.” If it’s closed that’s a “0.”)

To make faster more powerful computers we need microchips with more transistors but to keep the chips well micro we’ve had to keep packing more and more transistors into the same area.

We’re now hitting a wall in the amount of transistors we can pack onto a microchip.

The end of the line: In 1975 semiconductor pioneer Gordon Moore famously predicted that we’d be able to double the number of transistors on microchips every two years and that projection — “Moore’s Law” — proved accurate for decades thanks to heroic efforts by engineers.

We’re now hitting a wall in the amount of transistors we can pack onto a microchip though. Making them smaller is just becoming physically impossible — the ones we have today are so small that 1000 of them laid end-to-end are only the width of a human hair.

“The fact is when they’re talking about building physical entities like semiconductors and transistors you can only go so small” Robert Sutor chief quantum exponent at IBM told Electronic Products.

“Atoms have a certain size and you’re approaching the almost atomic molecular distances at this point” he continued. “You’re limited by that.”

IBM and Samsung have unveiled a new microchip design that promises radically faster more efficient chips.

The idea: IBM and Samsung’s new design stacks transistor components vertically on a microchip with electricity flowing up and down rather than the traditional horizontal design with electricity flowing from side to side.

They call their approach “Vertical-Transport Nanosheet Field Effect Transistor” (VTFET) and they say it could not only allow for more transistors on a microchip but also make the flow of electricity through them more efficient.

https://youtu.be/OF3Zwfu6Ngc

Compared to today’s standard transistor design (called FinFET) devices with VTFET chips would have a “two times improvement in performance or an 85 percent reduction in energy use” according to IBM.

That means batteries could last way longer (or be much smaller) and computers could produce much less waste heat which impacts performance and requires loud fans to keep the system cool.

In other words: smartphone batteries that last a week rather than a day.

“Scaling silicon is not the only way to get lower power and better performance.” Valeria Bertacco

The bigger picture: IBM and Samsung haven’t said when they plan to start producing chips with the stacked transistor design so we don’t know when they might actually start showing up in your phone or watch but it typically takes a few years to go from the drawing board to figuring out how to mass produce chips and building devices capable of using them.

However the stacked design and more densely packed transistors are not the only ways we’re going to keep computer power growing in the decades to come.

“Scaling silicon is not the only way to get lower power and better performance” Valeria Bertacco director of the University of Michigan’s Applications Driving Architectures research center told EE Times in 2019. “It was just the easiest way until 10 years ago.”

Replacing silicon with other materials such as graphene might unleash big upgrades in performance too.

Another way is to specialize microchips for specific tasks and divide the computer’s labor.

“Hardware customized for particular domains can be much more efficient and use far fewer transistors enabling applications to run tens to hundreds of times faster” MIT researcher Tao Schardl told MIT News in 2020.

More efficient software and better algorithms could also allow progress to continue even if transistor numbers don’t keep increasing. Replacing the semiconductor materials such as silicon in microchips with other materials such as graphene might unleash big upgrades in performance too.

Then there’s the ultimate game-changer: quantum computers which aim to do away with transistor-laden microchips entirely. Instead they encode information in entangled particles that can represent 1s 0s or both simultaneously which dramatically increases the computer’s potential processing power.

But today’s silicon microchip electronics aren’t going to be replaced by quantum versions or even graphene any time soon so in the near-term we’ll have to rely on clever new designs to grind out another round of Moore’s Law improvements.

May 17 2022 - Semiconductor Stocks in India? Here's a Watchlist for You to Track...

Semiconductor Stocks in India? Here's a Watchlist for You to Track...

Editor's note: Semiconductor stocks are a hot trend in equity market today.

In December 2021 we were quick enough to identify this megatrend and wrote about the top semiconductor stocks.

A lot has happened since we last wrote to you in December 2021. In this updated article we take you through the recent developments.

Continue reading...

If you're looking for growth stocks semiconductor stocks should be the first place you should look.

Why?

2021 and 2022 were good years for the semiconductor industry as demand surged. However the pandemic caused disruptions which throttled supply.

The demand-supply mismatch resulted in semiconductor stocks seeing a sharp rally and touching their all-time highs.

And here's the thing...

There are not one or two drivers of technological advancements where semiconductor chips are proving their worth.

The transformation of auto sector as we undergo an electric vehicle (EV) revolution.

5G rollout.

Smartphones smart TVs and other electronic items.

These were just a few examples but there are more.

As industries rush towards digitization demand for semiconductors will only grow more.

So if you think the semiconductor theme is just temporary and might be over soon think again.

The government has lined up a host of initiatives for local semiconductor manufacturing. Currently India meets its semiconductor requirements through imports.

The demand-supply mismatch is here to stay and semiconductor stocks will make headlines yet again.

The companies involved in this space directly or indirectly are still very few. This can change very quickly and the right pick could be the x-factor for your portfolio.

Recently we wrote about the top semiconductor companies and why they should be on your watchlist.

Top Semiconductor Stocks in India

Company CMP (Rs) 1 Month (%) 3 Months (%) 1-Year (%) 3-Year (%) Tata Elxsi 8119.3 4% 17% 124% 840% Dixon Technologies 3340.2 -23% -20% -15% 640% ASM Technologies 423.2 -28% -33% 287% 822% SPEL Semiconductor 57.1 -14% -9% 398% 808% Moschip Technologies 50.2 -26% -27% 70% 164% Ruttonsha International 238.2 -24% -31% 367% 485% Vedanta 287.2 -32% -22% 3% 79% MIC Electronics 15.6 -12% -30% 1257% 1596% Indosolar 3.9 -29% -13% 97% 131% Surana Solar 23.0 -7% -13% 147% 243%

This list is still extremely relevant today.

While these stocks have the potential to deliver huge gains you should be very careful about which semiconductor stock to invest in.

There's been another major development since we wrote about semiconductor stocks in December 2021.

Companies have submitted plans for setting up fab units (a technical word for a plant where semiconductors are produced) while many have submitted proposals for designing and packaging semiconductors.

Global semiconductor giants are showing interest to set shop in India and giving India's semiconductor plans a much-needed push.

For instance international semiconductor consortium ISMC will invest a whopping US$3 bn in setting up a semiconductor chip-making plant in Karnataka.

Believe it or not developments in this space are happening at a fast pace.

India's Semiconductor Stocks to watch Out For...

The global shortage of semiconductor chips has triggered concerns as companies around the world fail to meet rising demand for a wide range of essential as well as modern tech products.

The shortage has intensified over the past couple of months.

Semiconductors are components needed for manufacturing cars televisions refrigerators washing machines personal computers laptops mobiles etc.

These components are made from silicon and fit into microcircuits that power various electronic goods and components.

These little chips are so important that tens of thousands of workers must get lines that are a millionth of a meter i.e. one micron wide exactly right. Or else it won't work. The semiconductor chips fail.

Semiconductors play an important role in a variety of fields. For example operating air conditioners improving automobile safety laser treatment in cutting-edge medical care and the list goes on.

While making a list of semiconductor stocks in India there were no surprises. Every stock which had even little exposure to semiconductors has seen a sharp rally.

Why?

The buzz around semiconductors started mainly due to the shortage of semiconductor chips.

Another factor driving semiconductor stocks higher is the Indian government's efforts and support.

The government has announced the PLI scheme for semiconductor industry. This scheme is worth a whopping Rs 760 bn to be invested over the next 5-6 years.

The scheme aims to boost the semiconductor and display manufacturing in India. It will position the country as a global hub for hi-tech production Semiconductor demand in India is most likely to outstrip supply in near future.

As part of the scheme apart from big companies the government will also incentivise startups to design and make semiconductors.

While there are not many companies involved directly in manufacturing semiconductor chips in India there are some indirect plays.

Let's take a look at listed Indian companies engaged in the semiconductor industry.

#1 Tata Elxsi

It was in August this year when the Tata group showcased its ambitious plan to foray into semiconductor manufacturing.

The company's chairman N Chandrasekaran said the group has already pivoted into a number of new businesses like electronics manufacturing 5G network equipment as well as semiconductors.

The Tata group is in talks with at least three state governments in India to invest US$300 m towards a new semiconductor assembly and testing unit. The states are Tamil Nadu Karnataka and Telangana.

The group is also in talks with major international companies including those from Taiwan for its semiconductor chip business.

Tata Elxsi which is a Tata group company is already into the business of semiconductor services that includes artificial intelligence tools and frameworks design solutions and development.

Note that this foray will help the Tata group supply semiconductor chips and other components to Tata Motors and Tata Power apart from other companies across the world.

#6 Ruttonsha International

This company manufactures semiconductor devices power rectifiers assemblies and semiconductor diodes.

The semiconductor devices which it makes includes diodes rectifiers thyristors among others ranging from 10 amps to 12000 amps with voltage groups ranging from 200 volts to 5000 volts.

In 2005 Ruttonsha International was taken over by Dr Harshad Mehta and Mrs Bhavna H Mehta the promoters of Silicon Power Corporation USA.

Just like other stocks involved in the semiconductor industry shares of Ruttonsha International also saw a spectacular run on the bourses.

Starting 3 December 2021 when the stock was trading at Rs 75 per share it continuously traded in an uptrend and gained over 100% in a month.

Update: The company's one way rally was halted due to the Russia-Ukraine war inflation concerns among other factors which halved the company's stock.

When government invited bids for semiconductor fab units Ruttonsha International registered for making compound semiconductors.

Compound semiconductors are different from silicon ones. While a majority around 80% of the world's semiconductors use silicon the remaining 20% use compound semiconductors.

The company has also acquired 100% stake in Visicon Power Electronics which is in the business of manufacturing silicon carbide (SiC) wafers and power electronic devices through epitaxial process.

This acquisition was done for ease of business operations and widen its product reach across diverse business vertical of semiconductors.

The company has big plans for manufacturing SiC based products in India for which it is setting up a fab unit.

#7 Vedanta

After Tatas the Vedanta group announced to invest a huge sum to make displays and other semiconductor chips in India.

It was announced in December 2021 that the Vedanta group is planning to invest US$20 bn over the next 5-10 years to make displays and other semiconductor chips in India. This investment will be made through Avanstrate Inc. a glass substrate manufacturer in which Vedanta has a controlling stake.

An integrated display fab facility and a separate semiconductor facility will be set up.

Avanstrate is in talks with various states that have experience in electronics including Gujarat Tamil Nadu Maharashtra and Haryana. These states provide incentives over and above the central government's schemes.

Update: Vedanta's investment of US$20 bn is almost double of the Indian government's PLI scheme for semiconductors.

To become India's first chip maker Vedanta is seeking 1000 acres of free land water and power at concessionary and fixed prices among other incentives.

It will form a joint venture (JV) with Taiwan's Foxconn and manufacture semiconductor chips in the 28 nm category.

Vedanta has also proposed setting up a display fab on its own.

Vedanta's core business is mining. But it has ventured into the semiconductor space before.

None of these attempts took off. Vedanta claims it had never shelved these plans and is ready for another go.

It wants to start operations at its display fab by 2024. It also believes its JV with Foxconn can start operations in the chip fab by 2025.

Apart from the above there are few other listed Indian stocks which are directly or indirectly related to the semiconductor industry.

These companies include Solex Energy MIC Electronics Indosolar and Surana Solar.

How India stands to benefit

Note that building a semiconductor ecosystem needs big investments and critical infrastructure to support it. The plants need a continuous supply of electricity and water.

Even a single manufacturing plant can use anything between two and nine gallons of water per day.

It also needs manpower. If we go by estimates the recent PLI scheme could lead to the creation of 35000 jobs apart from one lakh indirect employment opportunities. It could also generate investments to the tune of Rs 17000 bn.

As the chip shortage seems to be far from over and the demand expected to rise India stands to benefit as it has adequate resources water and manpower.

Most emerging technologies have high dependence on semiconductors.

A mobile phone or a consumer appliance or even a vehicle as the pace of innovation increases the use of semiconductors will also increase.

Also in September 2021 India made a deal with Taiwan. This deal allows Taiwan to transfer technology for a chip plant worth an estimated US$7.5 bn in India. These chips would power everything from 5G devices to electric cars.

Meanwhile India will be financing 50% of the chip foundry capex. In addition the facility will enjoy tax breaks and other incentives. This deal is certainly a win-win for both India and Taiwan.

In a recent editorial Co-head of Research at Equitymaster Tanushree Banerjee shared some insights on this topic.

Here's an excerpt...

Currently India imports almost all semiconductors.



Its demand is estimated to reach around US$100 bn by 2025 from about US$24 bn in 2021.



Previous efforts to get companies to invest in the semiconductor space had failed. The complex manufacturing processes requires heavy investments apart from need for supply of uninterrupted clean water and electricity.



India is seen as strong player in chip design. But the companies here have failed to get chip foundries into the country.



The investments in India's semiconductor capacity are expected to grow 4-fold in the next few decades.

Tanushree has identified a tech company in India which is grossly underrated despite its dominant role in semiconductor chip designing.

The company has set up management teams in Taiwan South Korea and Vietnam in recent months seeing the growth potential of this business.

With its disruptive capabilities Tanushree believes the company's future seems far more promising than its past.

In the meantime we recommend you watch the below video where Tanushree shares her views on India's top semiconductor stocks.

The nascent cooperation started earlier this year and will involve Taiwan training Indian engineers. The partnership will also include the transfer of technology and creating a manufacturing hub in the country people in the know of the development told News18.

The Centre on Wednesday approved a Rs 76000-crore scheme to boost semiconductor and display manufacturing in the country in a bid to position India as a global hub for high-tech production and attract large chip makers. The step is aimed to boost India’s ambitions to be self-reliant in electronics manufacturing usher in investments and generate 35000 specialised jobs apart from indirect employment for one lakh people.

While much of the modalities are still to be decided the intent of collaboration between India and Taiwan is clear. The two countries have also created a joint group that is focusing on the creation of a semiconductor manufacturing hub and these groups have already met twice this year.

Taiwan is a world leader when it comes to the semiconductor market and dominates the industry. Its Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company according to estimates accounts for 50% of the global market. According to SEMI the global industry association representing electronics manufacturing Taiwan will remain the largest semiconductor material market in 2020-2021.

Both sides are looking at the possibility of one of three Taiwan semiconductor giants setting up a facility in India that may come up in Gujarat or Maharashtra but this has not been finalised yet.

Amid tensions with China the Indian side has been proceeding cautiously while dealing with Taiwan. But the country’s growing need for semiconductors is believed to be the reason for the engagement with Taiwan. India’s semiconductor needs may grow 50 times from the current level of $2 billion to $100 in the next four years.

The development comes even as there has been increased people-to-people interaction between the two sides. Last year Taiwan’s government hosted mega Diwali celebrations. 2020 also saw spontaneous strong support by Indians especially on social media on Taiwan’s national day. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has in the past tweeted about Indian dishes and said her favourite foods are chana masala and naan. She also recalled her India visit what she termed as “memories of a vibrant diverse & colorful country.”

–

After successfully preventing a German widow from selling her late husband’s bootleg CD Eric Clapton promised some additional holiday cheer Friday by announcing a forthcoming single titled “Heart of a Child” co-written by Clapton and his friend and fellow vaccine skeptic Robin Monotti.

The song arrives Dec. 24 and while the track’s lyrics aren’t explicitly about Covid-19 in the same over-the-top way as Van Morrison’s new music there are definite undertones to the anti-lockdown and vaccine-hesitant stances that Clapton has aligned with during the pandemic.

Rowling Used to Want to Debate Gender. Now She Just Insults Trans People

“We lost the love of a man / I was proud to know / They locked you down boy / Made you grieve alone” the lyrics state. “Turn off the TV / Throw your phone away / Don’t you remember / What your daddy used to say.”

As Clapton’s friends and past collaborators have abandoned the guitarist over the past few years due to his Covid-19 stances it has perhaps forced Clapton to write songs with whichever friends he has left regardless of profession: It was through Monotti an architect and film producer who is currently suspended from Twitter that Clapton first detailed his “disastrous” health experience after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and blamed “the propaganda” for overstating the safety of the vaccine.

The “close friends” later sat down for a 20-minute conversation where they questioned lockdowns mandates the vaccine “passport” Ivermectin and more:

Despite claiming that he is not anti-vaccination Clapton continues to deepen his connection with proponents of that field including recently engaging anti-vaxx kingpin Robert F. Kennedy for a lengthy video interview where he bashed Rolling Stone for our article about his support of the anti-lockdown movement as well as his history of racial tirades.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Also known as MitM (Man-in-the-Middle) phishing toolkits these tools have become extremely popular in the cybercrime underworld in recent years after major tech companies started making 2FA a default security feature for their users.

The direct result was that threat actors who managed to trick a user into entering credentials on a phishing site found that the stolen credentials became useless since they couldn't bypass the 2FA procedure.

To counter this new trend in account security protections since at least 2017 threat actors started adopting new tools that would allow them to bypass 2FA by stealing a user's authentication cookies which are files created inside a web browser once the user has logged into an account after the 2FA process was completed.

In most instances cybercrime groups have relied on a malware category known as an ""infostealer"" to steal these authentication cookie files from computers they managed to infect.

However there is another way to steal these files that does not rely on infecting a computer with malware—namely by stealing the authentication cookies while they transit the internet from the service provider to a user's computer.

Explained: Real-time phishing -vs- MitM phishing

For the past few years cybercriminals have been slowly adapting their old phishing toolkits to go around 2FA procedures primarily by using two techniques.

The first one is known as ""real-time phishing""[1 2] and relies on an operator sitting in front of a web panel while a user is navigating and interacting with a phishing site.

The idea is that once a user enters their credentials on the phishing site the operator uses these credentials to authenticate themselves on the real site.

When the attacker is presented with a 2FA challenge the threat actor simply pushes a button that prompts the user for the actual 2FA code (received via email SMS or authenticator app) and then collects and enters the 2FA token on the real site creating a legitimate connection between their (attacker) system and the victim's account.

Typically real-time phishing tools are used for breaking into web banking portals where user login sessions don't stay active longer than a few minutes and every re-authentication request needs another 2FA code.

Attackers that use real-time phishing don't bother collecting authentication cookies—since these have a short life—and typically steal user funds from an account right away burning their access.

However mundane services like email providers social media accounts gaming services and others have more relaxed rules around user login sessions and they create authentication cookies that sometimes are valid for years.

Once obtained these files can grant the attackers a more stable and undetectable way of accessing an account even without the owner's knowledge.

This is where MitM phishing toolkits have proven to be useful for some threat actors who don't want to dabble with distributing infostealer malware.

Instead they use phishing kits adapted to work as reverse proxies which relay traffic between the victim (1) the phishing site (2) and the legitimate service (3).

Users who authenticate on a MitM phishing site are actually logged into a legitimate site but since all the traffic goes through the reverse proxy system the attacker also has a copy of the authentication cookie which he can then abuse or resell on underground markets dedicated to the trade of authentication cookies [1 2].

In a way MitM phishing toolkits are real-time phishing toolkits but without the need of a human operator since everything is automated through the reverse proxy.

Ironically today many of these MitM phishing toolkits are based on tools developed by security researchers such as Evilginx Muraena and Modlishka.

MitM phishing toolkits are gaining in popularity

In a study published last month academics from Stony Brook University and security firm Palo Alto Networks said they analyzed 13 versions of these three MitM phishing toolkits and created fingerprints for the web traffic that goes through one of these tools.

They used their findings to develop a tool called PHOCA that could detect if a phishing site was using a reverse proxy—a clear sign that the attacker was trying to bypass 2FA and collect authentication cookies rather than credentials alone.

The researchers said they fed PHOCA with URLs reported by the cybersecurity community as phishing sites between March 2020 and March 2021 and found that 1220 of these sites were using MitM phishing toolkits.

The number is a significant jump from the roughly 200 phishing sites running reverse proxies that were active in late 2018 and early 2019 according to stats provided at the time to this reporter by late RiskIQ researcher Yonathan Klijnsma.

This rise shows that these tools and MitM phishing kits in general have slowly gained in popularity among the cybercrime ecosystem.

A reason why they did can also be linked to the fact that most are free to download easy to run and there are plenty of tutorials and collaboration requests on hacking forums that have helped threat actors get acquainted with this new technology.

With 2FA seeing a broader adoption among online services currently all signs point to the fact that most phishing operations will eventually evolve to include MitM capabilities into their standard features sometime in the near future. They have no reason not to and this is why this research was carried out in the first place.

For more information on this study the researchers presented their findings last month at the ACM CCS 2021 security conference.

The video of their presentation is below and a copy of their report titled ""Catching Transparent Phish: Analyzing and Detecting MITM Phishing Toolkits"" is also available for download as a PDF.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3dtdC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8zZy1uZXR3b3Jrcy10by1zaHV0LWRvd24taW4tMjAyMi13aGF0LXRoaXMtbWVhbnMtZm9yLXlvdXItcGhvbmXSAV9odHRwczovL3d3bXQuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzNnLW5ldHdvcmtzLXRvLXNodXQtZG93bi1pbi0yMDIyLXdoYXQtdGhpcy1tZWFucy1mb3IteW91ci1waG9uZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3G networks to shut down in 2022: What this means for your phone,"KALAMAZOO Mich. ( ) — A new year could mean a necessary upgrade to a new phone. Major mobile carriers will be shutting down their 3G networks in 2022 rendering older phones useless.

The retirement of the 3G network is to make room for more advanced networks like 5G which is much faster.

Once the 3G network is shut down 3G cell phones will not work.



In addition some older 4G phones that do not support HD Voice (VoLTE or Voice over LTE) will also stop functioning. This means users will not be able to make or receive calls and texts even to 911.

Data services will also be unavailable on those devices. AT&T said it will shut down its entire 3G network by February 2022.

T-Mobile which merged with Sprint said it will fully retire Sprint's 3G network by March 31 Sprint's 4G LTE network by June 30 and T-Mobile's 3G network by July 1.

Verizon said it will completely shut down its 3G network by Dec. 31 2022.

The Federal Communications Commission said other carriers like Cricket Boost Straight Talk and some Lifeline mobile service providers use the networks of AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon. As a result phones under those carriers could also be affected.

The major mobile carriers have each set up web pages with more information on their plans to phase out their 3G networks. The web pages include lists showing which phones are affected.









Those who need to get new phones to avoid a loss of service are advised to ask their providers about trade-in offers to upgrade at a discount or no cost.

A Verizon employee says users should log into their accounts to see what upgrades they are eligible for.

Verizon said it initially announced it would shut down its 3G network in 2019. But the carrier pushed back the date to help its customers transition to newer devices.

Verizon said more than 99% of its customers are on the 4G LTE or 5G network and less than 1% are using 3G.

The FCC said the retirement of the 3G network will not only affect phones but other electronics like medical devices tablets smart watches SOS services in vehicles home security systems and other products connected to the 3G network.

You don’t need me to tell you that Squid Game was the biggest piece of professionally-created entertainment this year. Those staggering numbers—sampled by 142 million accounts in 90 countries (and finished by 87 million of them) in its first 23 days; 1.5 billion hours viewed in its first 28 days; the kind of global fandom usually reserved for soccer stars and Avengers movies—speak for themselves. The nine-episode South Korean sci-fi thriller that Netflix bought for $22 million has created $900 million in value according to internal documents that were revealed in October by Bloomberg and its stars became subjects of everything from TikTok memes to Halloween costumes to a talent agency frenzy to sign them.

What’s most interesting to me isn’t that Squid Game happened it’s that this kind of foreign super-breakout was inevitable and that television success in the future will be defined mostly on these global terms. Anyone paying even casual attention can see what happened in 2021 as a flashing signpost of where this is all headed: Huge investments in local-language programming lead to mainstream-able hits that can be algorithmically promoted to a global audience that’s trained to embrace subtitles and foreign actors; that in turn will create nearly instant exponential growth in consumption of that content. In other words: Massive f-ing hits.

A mouse mat that threatened to undermine global efforts to avert nuclear warfare. The sales photo on Etsy showed a blameless-looking rubber rectangle hand made in Leicester with a Persian rug motif. But PayPal decided that it violated international sanctions and suspended the account of the unsuspecting purchaser.

To understand the modern business model – and the contents of my consumer inbox – look no further than this “illicit” item.

A computer algorithm had decided the mat was Iranian contraband computer software suspended the customer’s PayPal account automated warnings threatened termination unless the customer could prove its provenance and customer service agents seemed powerless to apply human logic.

It was the same artificial intelligence and human apathy that forced graduates to keep funding repaid loans  informed an Ovo customer that they owed £19000 for two months of energy and allowed a 10-minute flight schedule change to scupper a honeymoon.

Add to the mix this year’s double act Brexit and Covid which gave companies two cast-iron new excuses for skirting consumer rights law. As much of the nation retreated to the sofa to work and Brexit muddied the rule book the computer was given ever greater control and customers found themselves trapped in limbo. “Kafkaesque nightmare” is a recurring phrase from our literary readers.

As always there are so many worthy contenders for an award but it’s been a pleasure to narrow them down to the following standout takes on customer service. In all cases the customer was only offered effective service after I intervened.

Most rubbish excuse

A joint gong for eBay and delivery firm UPS. When MS of Manchester sought a refund from an eBay seller for a £130 satnav that never arrived he was refused. eBay sided with the seller since tracking showed that the item had been delivered – to his rubbish bin. How could UPS have known that without a notification card MS would not think to check his wheelie bin before collection day?

Bleeding heart for empathy

Legal & General tried hard for this honour. It twice informed a grieving man that he had been bequeathed £14000 from his late sister’s pension plan before realising it had sent the forms to the wrong relative. Then it erroneously told the deceased’s father to expect £19000. The bequest was in fact intended for the grandson who in proud Scottish tradition bore the same name but a different address to his father and grandfather. The comically named “sensitive claims” department discovered it had lost the late woman’s letter of instruction and in its absence refused to discuss the legacy with her executors.

Surrealism in Whitehall

The UK government sweeps the table. Take your pick. The Department for Work and Pensions misunderstood its own rules and penalised a universal credit claimant for not applying while in an induced coma. The Home Office whose rules on residency permits are so misleading and whose stance when applicants are duly misled so intransigent that an eligible spouse was denied indefinite leave to remain and presented with a £1000 bill for NHS services.

Or there’s the Ministry of Justice’s multimillion- pound reforms to streamline the probate service. Closure of local probate offices a new online system declared unfit for purpose by legal firms and a Covid backlog have left families in legal limbo for up to nine months.

Most cunning cop-out

What’s more risky – explosives or footwear? Both score equally according to courier firm DPD. Its stance makes perfect sense. It allows customers to book a delivery for an identified item pay extra for insurance cover and then if the consignment goes missing and a claim is made it can duck a payout by declaring it’s on a list of prohibited items along with human flesh and counterfeit currency.

Vigilant customers who study delivery exclusions may be none the wiser. DPD forbids the mailing of “personal effects” while Hermes refuses to pay compensation in the event it wrecks or loses “composite items of any description” or “items which can be exchanged by themselves or with any other item for money or goods or services”.

Brexit bonus prize

WK of Cumbria’s purposeful lockdown hours were spent contesting a £111 customs charge on a £12 wall bracket. It had been omitted from a delivery from the German company Loxhome in November 2020 and sent separately in the new year. By then post-Brexit customs charges had kicked in. The duty for the bracket was applied to the entire £460 order. WK refused delivery to avoid the charges. But courier UPS returned to slip it through his letter box and by the time the Observer intervened debt collectors were pursuing him for £115.

Meanwhile a new identity was the Brexit bonus for some startled EU nationals who had been granted EU Settled Status in the UK. A Home Office computer anomaly meant that women who had lived for decades under their married surname were registered under their birth name which appears first on some EU passports. They faced losing access to services because their proof of residency rights did not match official documents.

Great escape artists

Holidays! Remember those jaunts to Mediterranean beaches in the old days? While the few who dared set their sights on sunny climes battle for refunds for cancelled trips many who played safe and booked local are also out of pocket. One reader did get as far as Cornwall only to discover that the five-star water resort he’d booked had no record of him. Booking.com reassured the family they had been rebooked – in the beguiling suburb of Uxbridge 250 miles away.

Airbnb meanwhile decided that lockdowns are not an extenuating circumstance for cancellation and refused to require hosts to refund customers whose trips were banned by government rules while deducting its 15% service fee from hosts who decided to do the right thing.

Distinguished desertion order

The high street banks can share this between them for abandoning scam victims to penury. Criminals have again been the biggest Covid winners with increasingly sophisticated strategies to access personal accounts . The good news is major banks have pledged to refund victims who were not unduly negligent. The bad is they often try their darnedest to wriggle out of it.

I’ve investigated unrefunded losses of £900000 this year and persuaded banks to return 54% including a £225000 pension pot stolen from a retired detective by a cloned investment firm.

Nationwide deserves the spotlight for failing to protect and refusing to refund a pensioner’s £70000 life savings stolen in a similarly sophisticated scam. It finally offered to refund her a year later following contact from the Financial Ombudsman Service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vYW5hc2gub3JnL25ldy1zaGx1Y2hpbS10by1wZXBwZXJkaW5lLXVuaXZlcnNpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Shluchim to Pepperdine University,"Rabbi Sholom and Goldie Eagle (nee Wasserman) together with their daughter Toby recently moved to Malibu California to establish a welcoming Chabad presence at Pepperdine University.

Rabbi Sholom and Goldie Eagle (nee Wasserman) together with their daughter Toby recently moved to Malibu California to establish a welcoming Chabad presence at Pepperdine University. Sholom and Goldie will be working together with Chabad of Malibu to provide a warm and non-judgmental home for Jewish students.

Sholom is originally from Baltimore and Goldie is from Toronto. They moved to Malibu at the beginning of the academic year and have already been received with great enthusiasm by the students faculty and administration at Pepperdine. They have witnessed the strong need for a permanent Chabad presence on campus.

Pepperdine University is ranked in the top 50 schools in the U.S. Students are attracted to the institution for its world-renowned academia and the Caruso School of Law and Graziadio Business School among many other programs offered. The college also boasts breathtaking views of the Pacific Coast.

“Goldie and I hit the ground running and have met lots of students and hosted delicious Shabbos meals featuring cuisines from around the world” Rabbi Eagle said. “We also built a Sukkah on campus with the full support of the University and hosted an amazing ‘Sushi in the Sukkah’ event which was the first Jewish experience on campus for dozens of students.” Rabbi Eagle noted that “an added benefit which is so gratifying is that the faculty members have been 100% supportive of our efforts to promote Jewish life on campus.”

This was the first year in the history of Pepperdine University that a large public Menorah was displayed on campus.

The Eagles were appointed by Rabbi Levi and Sarah Cunin directors of Chabad of Malibu and Rabbi Shlomo Cunin Head Shliach of California and Nevada.

Your donations will help students embrace their Jewish identity provide a loving home and family on campus and enable them to enjoy inspiring Shabbos and holiday meals.

Karat Packaging is involved in providing third-party logistic services in California and this is likely where it will deploy the electric Tesla Semi pickup trucks. The electric vehicle claims to be capable of running 805 kilometres on a single charge and will be able to tow 80000 lbs.

Last month beverage company PepsiCo's CEO Ramon Laguarta confirmed that it expects to take delivery of the first set of Tesla Semis by the fourth quarter almost four years after placing its initial order for the electric trucks. The latter has placed an order for 100 of Tesla's electric trucks so as to reduce fuel cost bills and eliminate carbon emissions from its fleet.

Apart from Karat Packaging and PepsiCo other companies that have placed an order for Tesla Semis include Walmart fleet operator JB Hunt Transport Services and food distributor Sysco Corp. Tesla Semi is claimed to offer an efficiency of more than 0.80 km per kWh through its aerodynamics and powerful electric powertrain.

Earlier this month an Insideevs report claimed that the long-awaited Tesla Semi pickup has entered limited production at the EV giant's Giga Nevada site. The report cited an unofficial post by a Tesla enthusiast who spotted the Semi performing some basic tests at the factory backyard sans a trailer. These tests included acceleration braking and turning around in circles.

While the mass-production of the Semi has been pushed to 2023 it isn't surprising that the EV maker is looking at producing limited units of the vehicle given the placement of orders from various logistics companies.

CFO Vice Chair at Visa (present)

CFO at NBCUniversal

CFO Vice Chair at Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc.

CFO EVP and President of E-commerce at Safeway Inc.

President of the Information and Media Group at The McGraw-Hill Companies

SVP of Finance and CFO at PepsiCo International

VP Strategic Planning at Frito-Lay International (PepsiCo)

Partner Media and Consumer Companies at Booz Allen Hamilton

Associate at Booz Allen Hamilton

“If you had told me when I was 21 that I would spend more than half my career being a CFO I would have said ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m an engineer and I love marketing and media” Vasant Prabhu vice chair and CFO at Visa Inc. told me. “I tell people—build your skills build your relationships build your reputation. But stay flexible in terms of what you’re willing to do because you never know what your next opportunity is going to be.”

Prabhu a C-suite executive at a global credit card and payments powerhouse may have started out as an engineer but his curiosity for business changed his path from science to finance with a few twists and turns along the way. For the past 21 years he’s had CFO roles at public companies. “I guess I just have been the sort of person where you throw me into the water and I’ll figure out how to swim” he said. “I’ve never been fearful.” Like when his love of travel took him to Giza in Egypt in 1982. Prabhu wasn’t afraid of an impromptu climb to the top of a pyramid he told me.

Four factors to consider in your job search

“I was six months in the U.S. and had never lived outside India” Prabhu explained. “I didn’t know anything about business.” He was pursuing an M.B.A. at the University of Chicago when Paul Branstad a senior partner at the management consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton hired him as a summer intern. Chrysler led by CEO Lee Iacocca at the time was his client during the internship. “I was shocked that someone would actually pay me to go and learn how businesses worked” he said. But the “most profound thing was that someone would bet on me.” That has been a theme throughout his career. “If someone wants to take a chance on you at first you might say why me?” Prabhu said. “That’s what I did many times.” But he advised: “just take it.”

Prabhu was eventually hired as an associate at Booz Allen Hamilton. Consulting was “a fabulous place to start a career” because he learned how various businesses operated including company culture he said. Prabhu rose up the ranks to become a partner serving media and consumer companies. He enjoyed his job but wanted to play a major role in creating value at an organization rather than advising companies how to do so. “I decided okay it’s time to leave” he said. “And I was very deliberate about which company I went to work for.”

Prabhu said he began considering four factors in a job search:

-Choosing an industry or business you’re passionate about

-Making sure the company has a reputation for having good talent

-Working with a group of people you trust and respect

-Figuring out how you can make an impact

“You’ll be very successful” he asserted. “You’ll get the promotions you’ll make the money and not only that you’ll just be happier.”

His checklist led him to PepsiCo. In the early 1990s “Pepsi had a reputation for being this incredibly well-run company with some really smart people in very interesting businesses” Prabhu said. In the 1980s Steve Jobs recruited John Sculley who was VP and president of PepsiCo to become CEO at Apple Inc he noted. In 1992 Prabhu was hired as VP of strategic planning for Frito-Lay International. “It proved to be the best decision I ever made” he said. “Everything I know today about being a CFO I learned Pepsi.”

He was at the company for about a year when then CEO Roger Enrico and Fred Reynolds Prabhu’s boss asked him to take on the roll SVP of finance and CFO for Pepsi Cola International. He was 31 years old at the time. At first Prabhu thought why me? He still had much to learn about finance. But the execs thought he could do the job Prabhu said.

“At Pepsi we don’t think of CFOs as ‘financial people’” he recalled the execs said to him. “We want good businesspeople; we want people who can be operationally focused. You’ll be fine.”

Much is currently being discussed about the evolution and broadening the CFO role. But PepsiCo was ahead of its time in its philosophy for a finance chief he said. “A lot of other companies have caught up with them and now do define CFO jobs that way” Prabhu said.

He became a chief for the first time. “I realized this is a great job because it’s very broad in scope” he said. “You can get involved in anything you want to and have a lot of impact.” It’s a position that creates value for the whole company and allows you to work in a wide range of industries Prabhu said.

Leading at the onset of the dot.com boom

After a few years at PepsiCo Harold Whittlesey “Terry” McGraw III then CEO of McGraw-Hill Companies approached Prabhu about taking on the role of president of the information and media group he said. McGraw-Hill was one of his clients while working at Booz Allen. The position included overseeing TV stations B2B trade publications and the flagship magazine BusinessWeek. (Bloomberg L.P. bought the magazine in 2009 and renamed it Bloomberg BusinessWeek.)

The job met his four criteria. “My first passion has always been the media business” he said. Prabhu knew McGraw-Hill’s culture and team well from his consulting days he explained. McGraw was someone whom he liked and respected. And Prabhu saw a way to make an impact. “It was 1998 just as the internet was taking off” he said. “I saw this incredible opportunity that existed to digitize these [print] businesses.” Although “it was very hard to leave Pepsi I felt this was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up” Prabhu said. “Terry bet on me. I’d never run a business before let alone businesses like these that were quite substantial.”

Under his lead the group started to make the pivot by creating BusinessWeek online Prabhu said. “We tried to get a whole bunch of the businesses to move to digital” he said. But it was the early stages of the dot.com boom. For instance Amazon just went public in 1997 AOL was “still a big player” and Google and Facebook didn’t yet exist Prabhu said. “I would say nobody at that time [understood] how devastating the impact of digital media would be on the traditional print media” he said. “Everyone thought that they needed to add a digital component to their business. But didn’t realize how significant the change would be over time.”

As the leader of the media group Prabhu shouldered this responsibility to a greater degree than if he were the finance chief. “The big difference between being CFO and being president is there’s a much larger component of people management” Prabhu said. “The role is more operational. And the hardest part of any leadership role is managing change which is hard because it’s risky. It’s uncomfortable. And often people are threatened by it.” His role as president made him a better CFO later on Prabhu said.

Now with digital experience Prabhu’s work at Booz Allen Hamilton again resulted in a job offer he couldn’t refuse. “Steve Byrd the CEO of Safeway was someone I had met in my consulting days” Prabhu said. “Steve asked me if I would come and be his CFO as well as help him create an internet business or two. I’d never been the CFO of a public company. And I’d never been in the supermarket business. But Steve took a chance on me.” In 2000 Prabhu began the role of EVP CFO and president of e-commerce which checked all of the boxes on his job criteria list. Plus it offered the added bonus of living in California.

“We launched Safeway.com but it turned out it was very early for that” he said. “Consumers were not really looking to buy groceries online in those days. Right now they’re much more comfortable doing it especially through the pandemic. But we did launch something else called Safeway marketing services. It was a way to use the company’s data as a marketing tool for other businesses. That proved to be an idea that had legs. It went on to become Blackhawk Network Holdings Inc. [a digital payments company].”

Time for travel

Barry Sternlicht CEO of Starwood Capital Group was previously the CEO of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide a company he founded in 1995. In 2004 the hotel industry trailblazer asked Prabhu to join his team as vice chairman and CFO he said. “Barry was a very fascinating person to me” Prabhu said. “He was a was a creative innovative guy. He created the W Hotel brand for example.” Learning from Sternlicht combined with Prabhu’s love of travel and an opportunity to work on Starwood’s changing business model checked all the boxes on the list.

“I thoroughly enjoyed the hotel business” he said. “There are days when I still miss it. It’s a fun business.” Starwood’s several brands including Sheraton Westin W Hotels and St. Regis had operational real estate and loyal program dimensions he said. “The people who work in hotels are very interesting” Prabhu said. “And I used to meet all these fascinating people who owned hotels all over the world. I loved that.”

Prabhu was responsible for all financial functions information technology and various corporate functions. He stayed with the company for a decade amid many changes. “I had as many as four CEOs there” he said. “They say when the CEO changes the CFO is the first to go because the CFO is often the person CEO likes to pick. I’ve been able to survive those [changes]. I’m on my second CEO at Visa by the way.” If internal and external stakeholders and the board feels like the finance chief is a valuable member of the team and the CFO accepts adapting to the new leader’s style it seems to work out Prabhu said. And a bit of luck helps as well he said.

The road leads to Visa

In 2014 Prabhu returned “back to my first love which was the media business with a great group of people” as CFO for NBCUniversal headquartered in New York he said. Charles Scharf who was the CEO of Visa at the time was persuasive in recruiting Prabhu for CFO role at the San Francisco-based company he said. “Charlie was willing to bet on me even though I’ve never ever worked in a business like this” he said. “I’ve been in hotels and media. But he was willing to trust me with it.” An added bonus was the job location Prabhu’s beloved California. “I’m never leaving California again” he quipped.

“What I found appealing about Visa was there was this incredible iconic brand global in scope that had this great history and was at an interesting trying time in its in its evolution” he said. “The world around it was changing. And this was opening up some extraordinary opportunities. But at the same time there were also threats.” Again the job met all of his criteria and Prabhu began as finance chief at Visa in February 2015. He compared it to the climate he faced in media in 1998. “The decisions we make today will determine how successful this business is 10 years from now” he said. “And we’ll determine the shape of the industry.” He continued “given that I’ve been doing this for a long time I thought it’d be a great opportunity to use everything I’ve learned.”

Five years ago Visa was essentially enabling payments to merchants Prabhu said. “Today we can enable any kind of money flow” he said. “You can send a remittance to someone else in some other country. We enable a lot of startups to scale because of our network.” Visa announced in December the launch of its global crypto advisory practice within its consulting and analytics division. “As a CFO you play a role in the formulation of the strategy but it’s always a team effort” said Prabhu who became vice chair of the company in May 2019.

From Tomato Sauce flavoured Simba Chips to trying to bring back Chocolate Log South Africans have had some bad food heartbreaks this year.

HP Sauce was also hard to find this year.

With alcohol bans to blame Marmite was also in short supply earlier in the year.

We may be right in the throes of the festive season but some South Africans may still be mourning the discontinuation of favourite food items that did not survive 2021 or food shortages they had to endure this year.

This year saw a number of leading snacks and treats go on the production line for a final time in South Africa while some were at times hard to find.

These are some of the food items that were discontinued this year or were in short supply.

The All Gold Tomato Simba Chips

Under the SaveYourFlavour hashtag this year chip makers PepsiCo which owns the Simba and Lays brands asked customers to choose their favourite flavour between three of their iconic ones; Cheese and Onion Salt & Vinegar and Tomato Sauce. Failing to get enough votes the Tomato Sauce flavour faced the cull. But it was not without many lamenting the loss.

So Nestle's Chocolate Log and Simba's All Gold Tomato Sauce flavour are going to be discontinued?I wish I could buy every favourite to keep them on the shelves but alas all things come to an end eventually. pic.twitter.com/fNX1bewCcY — Natalie (@NatAlleyCat) August 1 2021

This is how South Africans voted for their favourite flavour

1. Cheese and Onion: 539 298 | 4499%

2. Salt and Vinegar: 195 460 | 3700%

3. Tomato Sauce: 110 623 | 1801%

When the company confirmed its discontinuation of the Tomato Sauce flavour it said South Africans have changed their taste preferences over time and are moving away from sweet salty creamy and tangy favourites. It said customers are now moving towards braai flavours such as Shisanyama Chilli Biltong and Chakalaka.

In the same crisps category stock levels of Lays and Simba chips are currently low following frost damage to some potatoes. The harsh weather conditions this year caused a potato supply disruption that has left PepsiCo which owns Lays and Simba with limited capability to deliver some flavours and packet sizes.

""We experienced disruptions in our potato supply due to frost conditions affecting crop yields. Whilst those issues are largely behind us we were left with very low inventory levels entering peak season festive demand with constrained supply as a result"" John Stevenson senior vice president for South Africa foods & beverages at PepsiCo Sub-Saharan Africa told the Business Insider South Africa this week.

Chocolote Log

South African's hearts broke a second time when an attempt to bring back Chocolate Log flopped. South Africans are so obsessed with Nestle’s Chocolate Log that they drew up a petition to bring it back over a year since it was discontinued. In October Nestle said it took note of the petition and although it did not promise it would bring back the chocolate with a creamy marshmallow on a crisp wafer it always listens to its customers.

The petition demanded that Nestlé must return ""the GOAT of chocolate"" or greatest of all time because the world needs ""[t]he creaminess of the marshmallow stuffed with caramelized wafer all coated in glazed sweet chocolate"".

The HP Sauce

HP Sauce lovers had a tough year in 2021 after the much-loved UK condiment disappeared from shelves last year. This came following the end of a distribution contract between Kraft Heinz which owns HP sauce and PepsiCo-owned Pioneer Foods which held the licence to sell the sauce in the country.

Although retailer Pick n Pay managed to bring back the sauce it had scant supply of the product.

The popular brown sauce is named after London's Houses of Parliament. Every year 28 million bottles of the sauce are consumed. With a distinct taste the sauce is tomato-based with molasses and malt vinegar derived from barley.

A shortage of Marmite

Every time South Africa experiences a Marmite shortage it becomes clear just how much they love the the yeast-derived spread. Around June this year consumers reported that they could not find Marmite on shelves. It was not the first time customers had to face such a shortage. Last year supply grew thin too following alcohol bans that disrupted the supply of brewer's yeast from AB-Inbev. The spread is made from a concentrated extract from that byproduct of making beer.",,,
PFE,Pfizer,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNS9pbnZlc3RpbmcvY2VvLW9mLXRoZS15ZWFyLTIwMjEvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBQWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMTIvMjUvaW52ZXN0aW5nL2Nlby1vZi10aGUteWVhci0yMDIx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Albert Bourla of Pfizer is the CNN Business CEO of the Year,"New York CNN Business —

The Covid-19 pandemic is far from over. But life in many ways has returned to something resembling normal for many. That’s in large part because there are now multiple coronavirus vaccines including one from Pfizer.

And that’s one of the main reasons CNN Business has named Pfizer (PFE) CEO Albert Bourla as the CEO of the year. Bourla joins previous winners Marc Benioff of Salesforce (CRM) Target (TGT) CEO Brian Cornell and Chipotle’s (CMG) Brian Niccol.

CNN Business considered several other influential CEOs for this year’s honor including Lisa Su of AMD (AMD) Ford’s (F) Jim Farley Marvin Ellison of Lowe’s (LOW) David Solomon of Goldman Sachs (GS) Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Sundar Pichai and yes Time Person of the Year Elon Musk of Tesla (TSLA)/SpaceX.

But Bourla was our choice for all that Pfizer has done in a year where Covid vaccines went mainstream (vaccine was even named word of the year by Merriam-Webster) and helped stabilize America’s economy — and the world’s for that matter.

“Pfizer did a lot of good [for] humanity and we are very very proud of it” Bourla said in an interview with CNN Business. “Not only were we able to save so many lives … but we are enjoying high levels of corporate reputation right now. People like us.”

Hoping to get Covid pill approved in early 2022

Pfizer isn’t the only company that has developed a vaccine. But the Big Pharma leader even more so than its European partner BioNTech (BNTX) or rival vaccine developer Moderna (MRNA) has become synonymous with the fight against Covid.

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first approved in the United States for 5- to 11-year old kids. But many parents of even younger children are now waiting to hear about when a vaccine might be approved for babies toddlers and pre-schoolers.

Bourla said he understands the frustration of parents who are fully vaccinated but cannot get their youngest kids protected.

“We’re working very intensively on that to make sure we can bring a solution for that” Bourla said.

“We are looking at different doses well below the doses that have been used [for adults and older kids.] We know that it will be safe. What we are looking to see is if that will protect them by giving the lower dose” he added.

But Pfizer announced after the interview with CNN Business took place that it is still evaluating whether three smaller doses of its vaccine will be effective for kids under 5 after finding two child-sized doses were not producing the expected immunity in 2- to 5-year-olds.

In addition Pfizer has developed a pill that could drastically reduce the risk of severe complications hospitalization and death for people who contract the virus. The Food and Drug Administration announced following the interview with Bourla that it had approved Pfizer’s Paxlovid oral treatment.

But Bourla stressed to CNN Business that the pill is not meant to be a substitute for the vaccine.

Ready to launch an Omicron-specific vaccine if needed

The recent rise of the Omicron variant has created concerns around the globe about the efficacy of the current vaccines. But Bourla told CNN Business that he believes its and BioNTech’s vaccine will control Omicron “quite well” especially if people have received two doses and the booster.

He conceded however that it is possible Pfizer will need to launch a new vaccine to specifically target Omicron or any other future variants. Bourla said Pfizer is already developing a shot aimed at Omicron and that he believes it could be tested and submitted to regulators for approval by March.

If Pfizer needs to produce Omicron-specific shots that will not slow the manufacturing of the existing vaccine Bourla said.

“We are aiming for a four billion [dose] annual manufacturing capacity of our current vaccine. And if we have to switch between the two the old and the new we still will make four billion. We don’t expect that we will lose any volume” he said.

Bourla also acknowledged that there are cynics who question whether Pfizer is just trying to make as much money as possible from the vaccine.

After all Pfizer said in its latest earnings release in November that it generated $13 billion in revenue from the vaccine in the third quarter and that it now expects $36 billion in revenue from it for the full year.

Bourla told CNN Business that it is charging poorer developing nations less for the vaccine than it does to wealthier countries. But cost isn’t the only challenge. He said some countries such as those in remote parts of Africa are “lacking basic infrastructure.”

“They don’t have centers to vaccinate people particularly in remote places. They do not have enough nurses” he said. “Sometimes they are lacking syringes sometimes they are lacking refrigerators so that they can store the vaccine. So this is unfortunately the situation.”

Bourla is hopeful the World Health Organization and the public-private vaccine alliance Gavi will be able to help resolve some of these issues. He also said the company is looking into drone delivery more to ensure that people get the vaccine more quickly.

“We are doing everything we can to find ourselves on the right [side] of history” he said.

Bourla also continued to stress that the vaccine is safe and that the only way for life to return to normal is for people to get the shots.

“I don’t see any reason why next year will not be a normal year if we do the simple things that are available for us” Bourla said. “If we have very big numbers of people that don’t want to do a third dose or don’t want to vaccinate at all that’s a problem.”

More to Pfizer than the Covid vaccine

Pfizer and Bourla aren’t resting on their laurels.

The company has also been at the forefront of developing many other promising blockbuster drugs such as blood thinner Eliquis breast cancer treatment Ibrance and rheumatoid arthritis pill Xeljanz as well as the Prevnar family of pneumonia vaccines.

Bourla is fully aware that for a drug company to remain successful it has to have even more promising drugs in the pipeline.

Several of Pfizer’s current top sellers are due to lose patent protection in the next few years. Once they expire that opens the door for cheaper generic drugs to compete with them.

That’s a big reason why Pfizer announced plans for a nearly $7 billion deal earlier in December to acquire Arena Pharmaceuticals (ARNA) a company developing drugs to treat immuno-inflammatory diseases. The acquisition came just one month after Pfizer completed a more than $2 billion purchase of cancer drug maker Trillium Therapeutics.

“It’s challenging to multitask” Bourla said. “But let’s not forget what else we are working on. There are so many medicines for cancer for other infectious diseases for cardiovascular diseases for other diseases.”

“We are heavily invested right now in cancer” Bourla added. “The biggest percentage of our R&D investment goes into oncology right now.”

Investors have rewarded Pfizer which ironically enough was booted from the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2020 just a few months before its vaccine was approved. Shares are up nearly 65% in 2021 — more than any Dow stock — and are not far from a record high.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzI1L3BhdGVudC12YWNjaW5lLWhpdi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The COVID vaccine patent war has an unsettling parallel in HIV drugs,"In 1998 the South African Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association teamed up with 39 pharmaceutical companies to sue Nelson Mandela's government for suspending international trade agreements that protected the patents to HIV antiretroviral medication.

At the time of the lawsuit it was estimated that one in nine South Africans had contracted HIV and the cost of providing the patent-protected medication was largely out of reach to the 4.7 million people in the country who needed it.

Defending his decision to bypass the WTO's agreement protecting intellectual property Nelson Mandela said in a TV interview: ""I think the pharmaceuticals are exploiting the situation that exists in countries like South Africa — in the developing world — because they charge exorbitant prices which are beyond the capacity of the ordinary HIV/AIDS person. That is completely wrong and must be condemned.""

""The government is perfectly entitled in facing that situation to resort to generic drugs and it is a gross error for the companies for the pharmaceuticals to take the government to court"" Mandela continued.

In deciding to ignore patent laws Mandela made a moral decision that saving lives was more important than protecting private property rights. The pharmaceutical companies argued back that if developing countries could effectively steal their medicines they would have less incentive to research new drugs in the future that could also save millions of lives.

Twenty-three years later history is repeating itself. In October of 2020 South Africa and India noticed that the overwhelming amount of pre-purchasing agreements for COVID-19 vaccines were being negotiated by rich countries meaning those countries would get the vaccine first. The two nations went to the World Trade Organization and asked for a temporary suspension on patents for all COVID-related medicines and technologies so that the developing world could produce vaccines on its own without having to rely on handouts from COVAX or donations from rich countries.

It turns out they were right to worry. According to the New York Times COVID data tracker 74% of all COVID-19 vaccines have gone to upper and middle income countries while less than 1% have gone to low-income countries. More booster shots have been administered in rich countries than single shots given in poor ones. All the while lower-middle income countries have suffered the highest estimated excess death rate from the virus.

The pharmaceutical lobby instantly lashed out against South Africa and India's proposal. Among their arguments was that even if they surrendered their patents there weren't enough manufacturers in the developing world to make the vaccines — and they argued that even if there were it would take ages for the technical transfers necessary to get them up and running. That likely isn't true: this week Doctors Without Borders identified 120 manufacturers in Asia Africa and Latin America with the technical requirements and quality standards needed to produce mRNA vaccines.

But putting technical arguments of who-can-do-what aside a bigger question is not who should be allowed to produce the vaccine — but who has the moral right to own it in the first place.

The COVID vaccines used in high-income countries were developed largely — in some cases entirely — with public funding. The AstraZeneca vaccine was invented at the Jenner Institute at Oxford University with 99% of public funding. Moderna received 100% of its funding for the vaccine from Operation Warp Speed and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was funded with almost half a billion dollars from the German government. Pharmaceutical companies have also invested huge sums of their own money in vaccine development without which they would not have been able to bring about the vaccines so quickly.

But let's pretend that the public invested nothing and it was only a small handful of multinational pharmaceutical companies that took the risk and invested millions of dollars to develop the vaccines. Surely the pharma companies are entitled to a reward for their investment and the great service they are providing humanity by supplying life-saving medicine.

But how much should that reward be? Is a couple of million enough? How about a few billion? Pfizer has said it will make $33.5 billion in revenue from sales of its vaccine this year. Even after taking out a chunk that pharma companies say will be reinvested for the development of new medicines Pfizer's shareholders are left with billions to line their Christmas stockings.

Western society has long enshrined the right to private property; as the old saying goes possession is 9/10ths of the law. The pharmaceutical companies clearly have the right to sell their property – in this case vaccines – to whomever it wants and at whatever price it sees fit. Yet Western societies are also governed by principles of The Enlightenment among them a right to ""life liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" So what happens when these rights abut? Should somebody's right to ""life"" mean they have a right to take somebody else's private property? Representatives from the pharma lobby would likely say no while global health advocates would probably say yes.

Because I'm home alone with my eight-year-old daughter and desperately trying to avoid watching the first Harry Potter movie for the hundredth time I decided to divert her attention away from the TV by asking her how she would resolve this moral dilemma. She responded in typical childhood fashion: ""The pharma companies are not being very very nice and if sick people need the vaccine they should go to the police and make the pharma companies give them the vaccine."" I suppose that any daughter of a left-leaning journalist is likely to produce the same answer to this ethical quandary but I'd be very interested to hear how the children of Pfizer's C-Suite would respond.

Children are usually quite good at answering black and white philosophical questions that lack nuance. Voldemort is bad Harry Potter is good. Killing people is wrong as is stealing Mommy's white chocolate bar. The public invested billions of dollars. Millions of lives are at stake along with hopes and dreams of getting back to ""a normal way of life."" If pharma companies are robbed of the rights to their private property for COVID-19 vaccines who's to say the same won't happen for HIV or diabetes drugs.

Fortunately for policy makers their jobs are not currently under threat by primary school–aged children. But delegates at the WTO are essentially being asked the same question only with a lot more nuance that can easily derail the central question of how the global community should organise itself to respond to a public health emergency. It's been well over a year since the WTO council responsible for intellectual property agreements was asked to consider South Africa and India's proposal for an intellectual property waiver. So far nothing tangible has happened. If delegates don't know what to do about the waiver perhaps they can turn to their children for advice as their moral compass is apt to be more sound.

Another fun question to ask one's children is how much money the people should give the pharma companies in exchange for taking the vaccine and giving them to poor countries. My daughter said: ""Maybe like five or ten euros."" To her that is a lot of money.

But that convenience comes with a catch: The pills have to be taken as soon as possible once symptoms appear.

The challenge is getting tested getting a prescription and starting the pills in a short window.

U.S. regulators authorized Pfizer’s pill Paxlovid and Merck’s molnupiravir last week. In high-risk patients both were shown to reduce the chances of hospitalization or death from COVID-19 although Pfizer’s was much more effective.

A closer look:

WHO SHOULD TAKE THESE PILLS?

The antiviral pills aren’t for everyone who gets a positive test. The pills are intended for those with mild or moderate COVID-19 who are more likely to become seriously ill. That includes older people and those with other health conditions like heart disease cancer or diabetes that make them more vulnerable. Both pills were OK’d for adults while Paxlovid is authorized for children ages 12 and older.

WHO SHOULDN’T TAKE THESE PILLS?

Merck’s molnupiravir is not authorized for children because it might interfere with bone growth. It also isn’t recommended for pregnant women because of the potential for birth defects. Pfizer’s pill isn’t recommended for patients with severe kidney or liver problems. It also may not be the best option for some because it may interact with other prescriptions a patient is taking. The antiviral pills aren’t authorized for people hospitalized with COVID-19.

WHAT’S THE TREATMENT WINDOW?

The pills have to be started as soon as possible within five days of the start of symptoms. Cough headache fever the loss of taste or smell and muscle and body aches are among the more common signs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers a website to check your symptoms.

Dr. Cameron Wolfe an infectious disease specialist at Duke University Hospital advises getting a test as soon as you have symptoms of COVID-19.

“If you wait until you have started to get breathless you have already to a large extent missed the window where these drugs will be helpful” Wolfe said.

WHERE CAN I GET THE PILLS?

You’ll need a prescription first from a doctor or other authorized health worker. The U.S. government is buying the pills from Merck and Pfizer and providing them for free but supplies will be limited initially. They’ll be shipped to states where they will be available at drugstores community health centers and other places. Treatment lasts five days.

Some pharmacists may be able to administer a quick COVID-19 test and prescribe the pills all in one visit. They already do this in many states for flu or strep throat.

WILL THE PILLS WORK FOR THE OMICRON VARIANT?

The pills are expected to be effective against omicron because they don’t target the spike protein where most of the variant’s worrisome mutations reside. The two pills work in different ways to prevent the virus from reproducing.

ARE THERE OTHER OPTIONS FOR NEW COVID-19 PATIENTS?

Yes but they aren’t as easy to use as a pill: They are given by IV or injection typically at a hospital or clinic. Three drugs provide virus-fighting antibodies although laboratory testing suggests the two aren’t effective against omicron. British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline’s antibody drug appears to work and officials say they are working to increase the U.S. supply. The only antiviral drug approved in the U.S. remdesivir is for people hospitalized with COVID-19.

South Korea restored tough distancing curbs last week after easing them in November after a series of record daily new infections and serious cases stretched medical services despite a vaccination rate of over 92% for those aged 18 or older.

Pfizer's oral antiviral treatment called Paxlovid is ""expected to help prevent serious deterioration of patients admitted to residential treatment centers or being treated at home"" by diversifying coronavirus treatments beyond injections currently used in the field drug safety minister Kim Gang-lip told a press briefing.

The drug will be used for adults or children 12 years or older weighing over 40 kilograms with mild to moderate symptoms with a high risk of developing a severe case of coronavirus due to causes such as underlying diseases.

Another oral coronavirus treatment called molnupiravir developed by Merck known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada applied for emergency use earlier this month but the ministry is still reviewing as they need additional info on efficacy Kim said.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

After getting an initial look at Bronny James at the NBA draft combine on Monday it sounds like there are multiple teams hoping to further evaluate him.

During an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium said (3:42 in video) he knows of ""at least two or three teams outside of just the [Los Angeles] Lakers that want to schedule workouts and have meetings with Bronny James.""

ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski and Jonathan Givony reported on Monday that James has been medically cleared to be drafted by the NBA's Fitness to Play Panel following his diagnosis of a congenital heart defect that caused him to suffer a cardiac arrest during a workout with USC in July.

The eldest son of the legendary LeBron James Bronny had all eyes on him during the draft combine on Monday. While his measurements were on the smaller side he had a 40.5-inch vertical leap and also impressed with his shooting skills.

James has until the May 29 deadline to continue exploring the NBA draft waters. If he chooses to return to college he has entered the transfer portal and will pursue opportunities away from the Trojans.

Sittenfeld case get it wrong? Ex-councilman hopes appeals court frees him from prison,"CINCINNATI — Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld asked a three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to throw out his public corruption conviction at a hearing on Thursday.

Once a rising political star and favorite to be Cincinnati mayor Sittenfeld is now serving a 16-month sentence for bribery and attempted extortion.

But Sittenfeld is looking for freedom and exoneration.

“I think this was a good day for Sittenfeld. I think the judges’ questions went much tougher on the prosecutor than on Sittenfeld’s lawyers” said Ken Katkin a Northern Kentucky University law professor who attended the 2022 trial and Thursday’s oral arguments at the appeals court.

Sittenfeld has maintained that he did nothing illegal by accepting $20000 in campaign donations from undercover FBI agents who were posing as developers and championing their project to redevelop a blighted downtown property into a boutique hotel because he was a pro-development politician.

It is extremely rare for an appeals court to overturn a jury’s verdict in a criminal case; it only happens 10% of the time said Katkin who gave Sittenfeld a much higher chance of winning on appeal.

More than 75 people attended Thursday's hearing mostly Sittenfeld’s friends family and political supporters. Once every seat in the large courtroom had been filled a court official directed the standing spectators to an overflow room where they could listen to the hearing.

Oral arguments are usually slated for 30 minutes. But the three-judge panel of appointees of former President Donald Trump asked repeated questions that pushed the hearing to 40 minutes. The judges were John Bush John Nalbandian and Eric Murphy.

Sittenfeld’s attorney Yaakov Roth warned of the widespread implications on political fundraising if the appeals court let this conviction stand. Roth a partner at the Washington D.C. law firm of Jones Day helped to vindicate former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell from corruption charges.

“There is a real danger of exposing every elected official in the nation to potential prosecution” said Roth who argued the government is illegally expanding corruption laws by targeting routine political behavior as somehow criminal.

But Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Singer who prosecuted Sittenfeld during a three-week trial with colleagues Emily Glatfelter and Megan Gaffney Painter reminded the court that the jury’s verdict must be respected.

“The jury does not assess any piece of evidence standing alone the jury assesses all of the evidence in the full context and … the jury found Mr. Sittenfeld’s testimony not credible” Singer said.

The jury rejected Sittenfeld’s explanations from the witness stand about his intent behind some very controversial recorded conversations that prosecutors used to convict him.

Lawyers on both sides focused on an October 2018 recorded call between Sittenfeld and Chinedum Ndukwe who was cooperating with the FBI. Sittenfeld who wanted to run for mayor asked for campaign donations in the form of “rounding up LLCs” from Ndukwe a former Cincinnati Bengal turned real estate developer: Sittenfeld can be heard saying “You don’t want me to be like hey Chin love you but can’t.”

""Honestly I can ... I can sit here and say I can deliver the votes"" Sittenfeld told the undercover agent who is known as Rob during a November 2018 meeting at a downtown condo.

Former prosecutor and ex-city councilman Steve Goodin said an appeals court isn't likely to contradict a jury’s findings.

“There is a jury who found there is actually an express deal to sell his vote. That is his biggest problem” Goodin said.

But Sittenfeld’s case despite its local nature has captured the national spotlight especially among legal conservatives. Former attorneys general White House counsels law professors and former prosecutors filed amicus briefs on behalf of Sittenfeld and in opposition to criminalizing political fundraising.

“All of them were arguing … these were all lawful campaign contributions that were properly recorded to the Federal Election Commission properly disclosed and not diverted these funds were not spent on anything improper either” Katkin said. “These kinds of prosecutions are extremely unusual bordering on almost never happening where no money is diverted into a candidate’s pocket.”

The three judges asked repeated questions about the standard for sufficiency of evidence yet seemed skeptical about throwing out the jury's verdict. They also picked up on technical issues at the trial such as amending the indictment and instructions to the jury.

“This issue of informal amending of an indictment ... what they’re really asking is did the prosecutors and the judge invite the jury to convict based on Sittenfeld’s conversation with Chin Ndukwe even though he was only charged with taking a bribe from the developers not Chin Ndukwe"" Katkin said.

At the end of the hearing Roth asked the judges to consider suspending the remainder of Sittenfeld’s sentence and releasing him from prison while the appeal was pending.

If that happened Katkin said Sittenfeld could be released this week. But the final appeals court decision may not come for three months.

Sittenfeld was the third council member the FBI arrested in 2020 on public corruption charges stemming from a massive sting at Cincinnati City Hall involving at least three undercover FBI agents and multiple informants who secretly recorded numerous elected leaders over two years.

Former council member Tamaya Dennard pleaded guilty to honest services wire fraud for accepting $15000 as part of a scheme to exchange her votes for money. A judge sentenced her to 18 months in prison and she was released in 2022.

Former council member Jeff Pastor also pleaded guilty to honest services wire fraud. Prosecutors said he took $55000 in bribes in exchange for votes on development deals.

Pastor is serving his two-year sentence at the same federal prison as Sittenfeld who was his former colleague at City Hall. Both are at the minimum-security prison and camp at Ashland in Eastern Kentucky.

PONCA CITY Oklahoma—When Earl “Trey” Howe III returned home here after four years of military service the first thing he noticed was the smell.

Howe grew up in and around Ponca City the site of the Phillips 66 refinery one of the oldest and largest crude oil refineries and tank farms in the country. The smell from the plant—a sulfur-rich odor somewhere between rotten eggs and freshly paved asphalt—was so constant he’d never even noticed it.

But now it seemed to follow him everywhere.

“Depending on which way the wind is blowing I’ll get a stronger whiff on some days than others” Howe 51 the former chairman of the Ponca Tribe of Oklahoma said. “It’s overpowering sometimes.”

A soft-spoken 6’4” father of three Howe lives just a few blocks from the refinery in the house where his grandparents once lived. Sometimes at night the flares which burn off excess hydrocarbons that can not be easily recovered or recycled are so bright and so loud—the whoosh of flames sounds like a jet engine—they can be seen and heard from miles away.

“You could feel it more than hear it” Howe said of a recent flaring that shook the ground and left him wondering if he and his family should evacuate. It was “like I was sitting next to a bomb.”

Ponca City takes its name from the Ponca Tribe a Native American tribe that lives nearby. For more than a century the region in north central Oklahoma has been ravaged by the environmental degradation associated with oil and gas development.

From abandoned oil and gas wells to refineries tank farms and hydraulic fracturing the pollution and destruction—including damage from thousands of man-made earthquakes—have exacted a heavy toll on the region’s air land water and people.

In many ways Ponca City and its 24000 predominantly white inhabitants are well off. Its schools library sports centers parks and concert hall would be the envy of most small towns in America.

But interviews with local residents historical records legal depositions and internal government reports tell of a sacrifice zone where oil rights were first taken from the Ponca Tribe and then exploited by the oil and gas industry with little thought given to environmental protection.

The resulting development has left homes enveloped in toxic fumes black slime oozing from basements emissions of fine particulate matter that can damage the heart and lungs and walls cracked from earthquakes induced by injecting wastewater from hydraulic fracking deep underground. In one case the fumes were so overpowering a family was forced to leave their home for several years.

Groundwater contamination from what is now the Phillips 66 refinery led to one of the largest environmental settlements in U.S. history with the company buying and razing an entire neighborhood in the early 1990s.

But the contamination wasn’t entirely eliminated: Over the last 20 years the refinery’s owners have bought out and leveled dozens of additional homes for unstated reasons. But through a review of county property records and well-monitoring data provided by state regulators Inside Climate News has found that the location of the houses closely tracks unsafe levels of benzene and other contaminants in groundwater a fact that has not previously been reported. And Phillips 66 has continued to remove contaminants like petroleum oil gasoline or diesel fuel from extraction wells near the neighborhood.

Bernardo Fallas director of corporate communications for Phillips 66 said the company conducts its operations in a manner that protects human health the community and the environment.

In White Eagle the headquarters of the Ponca Tribe several miles downstream where the Arkansas River and Salt Fork of the Arkansas River meet the pollution has been especially damaging. Children once swam in the waters while people fished from its banks. In recent years fish have washed up dead along the shoreline killed by a still-unidentified pollutant. Water from private wells in the community are no longer fit for drinking gardens are contaminated with pollution and inhalers are as common as cell phones.

“We’re being killed as surely as when they brought us the smallpox blankets and wrapped us in poison” said Casey Camp-Horinek a tribal elder and official environmental ambassador for the Ponca Tribe. “We’re being wrapped in a poison that kills the air the water and the Earth and that kills my people.”

‘We Have to Find a Way Forward’

The degradation in and around Ponca City is emblematic of the systemic long-term devastation of the environment that a group of lawyers and advocates are pushing to make an international crime. The campaign aims to treat “ecocide” in the same way as genocide or crimes against humanity offenses that are prosecuted by the International Criminal Court in the Hague.

Criminalizing ecocide is likely to take years if it succeeds at all and even then many challenges would remain. The law could only be applied to future crimes and the United States is not a member of the international court so the impact of its petroleum industry might remain outside the law. But the Ponca Tribe isn’t waiting on legal wrangling half-a-world away. The tribe is seeking protection under a parallel effort known as the rights of nature a legal movement that has sprung up in countries around the globe in recent decades seeking to grant legal rights to rivers forests and wildlife.

In 2018 the Ponca Nation became the first tribe in the United States to sign into law a rights of nature resolution and the tribe is now working on an additional rule that would give added protection to the rivers that run through their community.

“We have to find a way forward” Camp-Horinek said.

The rights of nature approach she said more closely aligns with an Indigenous understanding of the environment in which human beings are a part of nature not separate from it. “We are nature protecting itself” she said.

The legal standing of the rights of nature remains unclear. So far no U.S. court has upheld a rights of nature law and courts that have ruled on whether rights of nature can be enforced have all said they cannot. As more Indigenous and other communities pass rules on the rights of nature however that could change.

If courts do rule in favor of the rights of nature the implications for oil and gas companies operating near the Ponca Tribe could be significant. The tribe’s 2018 resolution includes a provision that if a corporation is found guilty of an offense related to the rights of nature the chairman of the board of the corporation will be held liable with a maximum sentence of a year in prison and a $5000 fine per day for each offense.

Such protections may be needed now more than ever.

Although a landmark 2020 U.S. Supreme Court ruling delivered greater tribal sovereignty for Native communities in Oklahoma state efforts to fight the ruling could jeopardize what limited environmental regulations currently exist on Indigenous lands.

“It has messed with our ability for the Clean Water Act to be successfully implemented and for the Clean Air Act to be successfully implemented” Camp-Horinek a leader of the rights of nature movement for the tribe and for tribes globally said. “So we are using the rights of the river as a possible way to protect the Ponca people.”

‘I Hope I Don’t Have to Move’

On a drive around the southern edge of Ponca City Howe a member of Ponca’s tribal council or “business committee” brings his silver Ford Explorer to a stop next to a culvert where a small stream flows out of the Phillips 66 refinery on its way to the Arkansas River.

“Me and my friends would ride our bicycles down here” he says pointing to the now fenced-off drainage ditch where he used to bike as a kid.

“It’d be grayish and sometimes reflecting off the light you could see a rainbow of colors” Howe said of the water.

The creek flows through what used to be a thriving low-income Indigenous Black Hispanic and white community with its own grocery store church and school.

The school closed in the late 1970s after dozens of students began fainting from fumes from the nearby refinery.

In 1989 residents from the neighborhood sued Conoco the owner of the refinery at the time after black slime began oozing into their basements. The residents claimed unusually high rates of cancer respiratory problems birth defects skin rashes and other illnesses they believed were linked to an underground spill from a tank or pipes at the refinery. They pointed to Conoco’s own water samples that showed elevated levels of benzene in the groundwater.

As part of the settlement Conoco agreed to buy and either tear down or relocate about 400 homes near the refinery although the company never admitted fault for any adverse health effects. All that remains of the community that was once there is the brick archway entrance to the school.

But ConocoPhillips and the subsequent owner of the refinery Phillips 66 have torn down more than three dozen other houses since then in a residential neighborhood east of the refinery. The buyouts track closely with areas where the concentration of benzene in the groundwater exceeds the EPA’s maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 0.005 milligrams per liter according to a map from 2014 that is part of the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality’s permit for the refinery. Benzene occurs naturally in crude oil and is produced during the refining of gasoline. Long-term exposure has been associated with leukemia.

Phillips 66 also has continued to remove tens of thousands of gallons of “light nonaqueous phase liquid”—contaminants such as petroleum oil gasoline or diesel fuel—from extraction wells near that site in recent years according to data from the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality.

A 1990 settlement between Conoco and Ponca City residents living near the refinery resulted in the company buying out and either tearing down or relocating approximately 400 homes. However the buy outs didn’t end there as the company has continued to purchase and remove dozens of additional homes in the neighborhood since the settlement as shown in these satellite images from 2004 to 2019.

Fallas the Phillips 66 corporate communications director acknowledged the continuing purchases and the fact that the company has continued to remediate pollution.

“Since the early 1990s Phillips 66 (then Conoco and ConocoPhillips) has worked cooperatively with state regulators to continue remediation and monitoring of groundwater beneath and surrounding the Ponca City Refinery” Fallas said.

He added “As part of our state permitting requirements impacted groundwater is drawn back to the refinery for recovery and treatment. Phillips 66 has purchased and continues to purchase property near the refinery that meets certain criteria to increase the buffer zone between the community and the refinery.”

Overall pollution levels in the area have gone down over the past 20 years Erin Hatfield communications director for the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality said but added”That said a number of wells are still over the MCL for benzene.”

Howe lives only a few blocks from the most recent buyouts.

He said he worries that the underground spill that resulted in the mass-buyout in the 1990s may now be spreading into his neighborhood.

“I hope I don’t have to move” he said.

A House From Hell

A few blocks from Howe’s home and a block from the most recent spot where Phillips 66 is buying out houses sits one of the most extreme examples of the fallout from the region’s more than 100 years of oil and gas development. In 2013 Chris and Sherry Walls and their four children had to flee from their home after the local gas company discovered the house was enveloped in a cloud of methane gas.

The Walls spent three years living out of hotels and rental properties before the Oklahoma Corporation Commission installed a ventilation system designed to suck gas from beneath the house and vent it above their rooftop. The Walls returned home soon after but the ventilation system only made matters worse so the family stopped using it.

Still grieving from the death of one of their sons wracked with debt exacerbated by the constant moves and unable to find the source of the leak Chris Walls may have found it to be more than he could take. On June 18 2017 Father’s Day Sherry found her husband’s body hanging in their garage.

“I think our house had a lot to do with it” she said.

Four years after her husband’s death Sherry Walls and her daughter Diamond are living in a house still enveloped by gas. ​​An internal Oklahoma Corporation Commission report from 2018 viewed by Inside Climate News concluded there is a “possible well location on the Walls property or even under the house.” Gas wells were drilled in the neighborhood around 1910 and are among an estimated 25000 to 100000 “orphaned” wells in the state for which the operator is unknown or no longer exists.

Walls said the Ponca City mayor and Phillips 66 had offered to relocate her to a new house but it was smaller than her current home she said and she declined. Ponca City officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Sharon Wilson a gas imaging specialist with Earthworks an environmental advocacy organization based in Washington visited Walls’ home in 2017 soon after Chris Walls died. Using a thermal camera she looked at the images and was appalled not only by the volume of gas she saw billowing from the ventilation system but the gas she smelled as she stood outside the home.

“I don’ t know how they can live there” Wilson said. “The state should have done something about it a long time ago. It’s a failure of the regulatory agency.”

Oklahoma Corporation Commission spokesman Matt Skinner said the ventilation system that his agency installed solved the problem.

“It worked perfectly” Skinner said. “We literally moved if not heaven the earth and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to [get to] a place where it wasn’t seeping gas” Skinner said.

However the 2018 internal Oklahoma Corporation Commission report came to the opposite conclusion.

“The Corporation Commission’s Oil and Gas Division along with all the people who have worked on this situation are very disappointed that the extraction remediation effort fell short of our goal” the report stated. “It is apparent that efforts at the surface to divert the stray gas are—futile.”

This Will Bring ‘Bad Medicine’

In 1908 not long after the last land run in the newly formed state of Oklahoma and the year Henry Ford unveiled the Model T an oil prospector from the East arrived on the Cherokee Strip. E.W. Marland a wildcatter and lawyer who had already made and lost an oil fortune in Pennsylvania spent the next three years drilling dry wells while living on credit at the Arcade hotel in Ponca City.

An amateur practitioner of the emerging field of geology Marland took an interest in a hillside southwest of town that he believed to be a geologic dome a cap under which might lie a vast reservoir of oil.

The land belonged to Willie Cries for War a member of the Ponca Tribe which the U.S. Army had forced from its ancestral homelands in Nebraska to what is now Oklahoma some 30 years before.

The outcrop where Marland wanted to drill was a sacred site for the Ponca offering commanding views towards their homeland in the north and the confluence of the Salt Fork and Arkansas Rivers to the southeast a reminder of their earlier home where the Niobrara and Missouri Rivers meet. The hilltop also was a tribal cemetery where bodies were placed on top of wooden scaffolds rather than buried underground.

Drilling into the hilltop was out of the question. But with the help of some local ranchers—who depending on the historical account were either benevolent protectors of the Ponca or vultures who preyed on them at every turn—Marland gained permission to drill a short distance downslope from the cemetery.

When the well came in as a gusher White Eagle one of the last Ponca chiefs warned that it would bring “bad medicine” for him his people and for Marland the oil baron later recalled.

“He said this will all come back to impact all of us” Camp-Horinek said. “And we’re living in that time.”

After Marland struck oil Cries for War who was 19 at the time was well compensated in royalty payments for the lease he signed enough for him to live well in his younger years. He bought a large house and several vehicles and hired a cook maid and driver.

But Cries for War was the exception among the Ponca. The Miller brothers—the ranchers who helped Marland negotiate the lease—bought or leased tens of thousands of acres from the Ponca including the mineral rights that went with the land. In return the ranchers owners of the 101 Ranch often paid no more than a sack or flour or potatoes and a few scraps of meat according to “The Real Wild West: The 101 Ranch and the Creation of the American West” by historian Michael Wallis.

In 1920 a federal grand jury indicted the Miller brothers on what ultimately grew to 49 criminal counts charging them with defrauding the Ponca of large tracts of land. The brothers pled guilty to illegally acquiring Indian land valued at more than $380000 although the ruling was later overturned in a federal appeals court.

“It always bothered me to see the Miller Brothers played up as heroes when they defrauded Indians of land greater in value than train and bank robberies committed by the Daltons Doolins James and other bandits combined” Ferdie Deering a longtime columnist for the Daily Oklahoman and editor for the Farmer-Stockman magazine later wrote.

‘Downstream From All That Waste’

Sitting in his print shop in the village of White Eagle Howe recalled how his great uncle Willie Cries for War once sucked stingers out of his neck after he’d been stung by bees.

Howe whose black-rimmed glasses end in neon green at the temples remembers Cries for War as a penniless elder his money long gone living in a spare bedroom of his grandparents’ home.

The oil well drilled on land that used to belong to his great uncle was the beginning of what became the Conoco and later the ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 empire. Marland the oil-man who talked Cries for War into allowing drilling on his land became one of the richest men in the world building a “palace on the prairie” in Ponca City from which he played the role of a British nobleman hosting fox hunts and polo matches for the city’s more affluent white community.

In 1918 Marland built an oil refinery the Phillips 66 refinery in Ponca City a few blocks from where Howe now lives. Soon after opening the refinery began to dump its petroleum waste into the Arkansas River.

For the Ponca Tribe based several miles downstream in the village of White Eagle that was the beginning of the contamination of their drinking water supply. Though the tribe recently built a new water supply system many in the community fear it too is contaminated and they rely primarily on bottled water.

“Conoco flourished and continues to flourish at the expense of those downstream from it” Howe said. “And instead of making things right for the tribe that began their oil production—we should have been one of the wealthiest tribes in not just Oklahoma but the country—we’re downstream from all that waste.”

As a member of the Ponca City Chamber of Commerce board of directors Howe tries to build better relations between the predominantly white community and the Ponca Nation. Growing up Indigenous in and around Ponca City he said he often felt invisible. As a child he excelled at basketball and could dunk by his sophomore year of high school but he was overlooked for Ponca City’s varsity squad something he attributes to being the only Indigenous kid on the team.

Howe is a prominent figure in the region a former chief of police for White Eagle and the current police commissioner for the neighboring Otoe–Missouria Tribe. But when he does errands in Ponca City he said people—from gas station attendants to the staff of the Lowe’s home improvement store—often look past him to help a white person standing behind him.

Ben Waters Trey’s grandfather on his mother’s side worked for the refinery helping to weld many of the large oil tanks across the sprawling nearly four-square mile facility. Earl Howe Senior his grandfather on his dad’s side had cancer though he didn’t die from it. All three of his grandfather’s brothers and Trey’s father Earl Howe Junior died from cancer.

Kay County including Ponca City and the village of White Eagle has one of the highest cancer rates in the state.

Howe doesn’t use fancy terms like “genocide” or “ecocide” but he wonders nonetheless if the refinery was to blame for so many deaths.

“There are a lot of other tribal members who died from cancer” Howe said. “I don’t know if any of those are a direct link but I think there’s an abnormal rate of cancer that could be related to that.”

‘This is Bad Bad Stuff Going On Here’

If the fumes and contaminated water were not enough of a threat in the region until recently a fine black powder routinely covered the cars lawns clothing and pets of the people who lived just south of Ponca City.

Just past the Ponca City city limits on highway 177 a petrochemical plant operated by the Continental Carbon Company manufactures carbon black an incredibly fine powder made from low value heavy oil by-products at the Phillips 66 refinery just to the north.

Carbon black is used to strengthen tires and as a pigment in inks. It is also a potential carcinogen that can penetrate deep inside human lungs.

“The particles are so fine that if you tossed them in the air and didn’t have any wind they would stay airborne for two days” Camp-Horinek said.

In the early 2000s tribal members living near the plant raised the issue with Camp-Horinek’s brother Carter Camp an Indigenous rights advocate and former leader of the American Indian Movement. In a push for greater tribal sovereignty he helped lead a months-long armed standoff with federal agents at Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota in 1973 for which he spent three years in prison.

“They came to my brother Carter and said ‘Look this is bad bad bad stuff going on here. Our children are being born with cancer. We’re dying from what it’s doing to us’” Camp- Horinek said.

The Camp family and other members of the Ponca Tribe decided to take on Continental Carbon. They teamed up with a workers union inside the plant and sent a delegation to the parent company’s headquarters in Taiwan where they held a hunger strike to protest the lax environmental controls at the Ponca City plant.

Without admitting any fault Continental Carbon agreed to a $10.5 million settlement with the Ponca Tribe in 2009 that included tearing down 11 nearby houses and providing relocation funding for those who had lived there.

A row of driveways along the highway that give way to a field of grass and shade trees are all that remain of what were once low-income homes for families.

“I’m not happy with it” Camp-Horinek said. “Because what they did not do is stop Continental Carbon from operating in the same manner as they always have. It’s still going on and they did not get further medical care for all of the people that were impacted by it.”

In 2015 the company entered into a consent decree with the EPA and the Department of Justice to invest $98 million in pollution controls at the Ponca City plant and similar carbon black plants in Alabama and Texas.

In 2018 the Trump administration granted the company an extension giving the Oklahoma plant until April of this year to begin pollution controls to reduce emissions of particulate matter nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides.

​​Dennis Hetu president of Continental Carbon said the additional pollution controls at the company’s Ponca City plant are now complete.

​​”The consent decree said I had to have it up and running this year and it’s up and running” he said.

However an EPA spokeswoman said installation of the pollution controls have not in fact been completed at the Ponca City plant.

“Technical issues associated with the installation of controls and Winter Storm Uri have caused delays” the spokeswoman said referring to the ice and snow storm that caused widespread power outages in Texas in February.

‘If You Can Imagine Being That Child’

Fighting for environmental protection and for the rights of Indigenous people in the face of extreme adversity is in many ways a part of the Ponca DNA Camp-Horinek’s in particular.

On a blazing hot August afternoon in the Clyde Warrior Memorial building in White Eagle a building named after a Ponca youth leader and prominent civil rights activist in the 1960s Camp-Horinek recounts how her people came to live in Oklahoma. It was a forced relocation that as she described it her people should not have even survived.

“My grandfather was around 6 years old at that time when they came into our village site and rounded us up like cowboys would herd cattle at the point of a gun with bayonets at our backs” Camp-Horinek 73 said. “They forced us to leave our homes without our food without our hunting equipment without our cooking equipment without our seeds and walk nearly 700 miles.”

After arriving in what is now Oklahoma in 1877 one in every three members of the Ponca Tribe soon died from starvation and disease.

One of the Ponca chiefs Standing Bear promised his only son who at age 16 lay in a canvas army tent dying of malaria that he would grant his final wish returning his body to their homeland in the north.

“He escaped with his son and went back to Níʼ b d áska or now called Nebraska and after a series of legal moves was declared the first Native to be called a human being under the eyes of the law” Camp-Horinek said of a legal ruling that was a landmark for not just the Ponca but for all Native Americans. “Up until that time we weren’t even considered to be human beings.”

The stories of those who came before her have had a large influence on Camp-Horinek who has dedicated much of her adult life to environmental activism and chairs the Indigenous Council for the Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature an organization advocating for the rights of nature worldwide. Working with a tribal attorney she helped craft the Ponca Tribe’s first rights of nature resolution and she is now working on a second resolution that would provide added protection to the rivers that flow through her people’s land.

She describes her own childhood as that of a brown child growing up in extreme poverty. The youngest of six children in a family of migrant farm workers she attended 12 different schools and in a desperate attempt to make friends allowed herself to be “born again” into seven different Christian churches.

“If you can imagine being that child” Camp-Horinek said “and not being able to understand the full impact of what the system had laid on her and on the other hand… knowing I am a Ponca knowing I was the granddaughter of chiefs and great granddaughter of war chiefs and survivors.”

“Those dualities left me an ability to be awakened into who I was supposed to be” she said.

‘Earthquake Capital of the World’

In 2015 Camp-Horinek’s activism and Howe’s work on the tribal council came together.

In May 2015 Howe who had recently been elected chairman of the Ponca Tribe received a federal grant to construct a veterans’ memorial at the Ponca tribal cemetery to honor members of the community who had fought for their country.

The Ponca cemetery lies half a mile south down the hillcrest from where Willie Cries for War once owned the 120 acres he would later lease to Marland. The site still offers sweeping views of the Salt Fork to the southeast. When the leaves fall from the cottonwood trees each fall you can see where the Salt Fork empties into the Arkansas River a couple of miles downstream.

But a new larger hill the Ponca City landfill just to the north now towers over the cemetery partially blocking views of the Ponca’s ancestral homelands in Nebraska.

“I would imagine our people stood here and looked in all directions and this was the perfect spot to memorialize our people that passed on in view of the river and what looked like their homeland” Howe said. “Now a big portion of that to the north is obstructed by this big mound of trash.”

As Howe walked the rows of headstones in the cemetery to make sure he had identified all the veterans buried there he couldn’t help but notice how many of his community members had died at an early age.

In the tribal council Howe’s concern about the oil industry’s pollution found fellowship with Camp-Horinek’s activism. The two did not know each other well but they knew of each other’s families and Howe was familiar with the Camp family’s history of activism.

When Camp-Horinek ran for a seat on the Ponca tribal council and won they began working together closely and one of their first targets was hydraulic fracturing. Camp-Horinek had recently spoken out against fracking at a public hearing at the Oklahoma state capitol.

By 2016 earthquakes created by fracking were reaching epic proportions in Oklahoma caused not by fracking itself but by the injection of large volumes of wastewater deep underground. Before the state’s fracking boom in the late 2000s Oklahoma averaged two earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater per year. By 2015 that number had soared to 903 earthquakes in a single year more than twice the number of similarly-sized earthquakes recorded in California that year making Oklahoma the “earthquake capital of the world.” On Sept. 3 2016  a 5.8 magnitude earthquake the largest in state history hit 15 miles southeast of White Eagle near Pawnee Oklahoma.

At the same time fish in the Salt Fork river were washing up dead near the tribe’s powwow grounds in White Eagle. News reports later suggested that a leaking tanker truck near a wastewater injection well site may have been the cause but an investigation by state regulators was inconclusive.

Matt Skinner of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission said they found no evidence linking the tanker truck or other oil and gas operations in the area to the fish kill. Skinner said there have been die-off events recorded in the river for decades because of the water’s naturally occuring high salinity which gives the river its name.

In February 2016 the Ponca tribal council with Howe as chairman and Camp-Horinek as a newly elected member passed a resolution banning fracking on Ponca land. The following year at Camp-Horinek’s urging the Ponca business committee passed the first rights of nature resolution approved by a tribe in the United States.

“We have to pay attention to our behavior and what we are doing as a species or simply cease to exist so that the Earth can heal” Camp-Horinek said. “She will endure whether the human species endures or not I think we are at a point of choice there.”

‘A Way to Protect the Ponca People’

The Ponca Tribe is now in the process of developing a second rights of nature resolution for the Arkansas and Salt Fork rivers which Camp-Horinek says would give the rivers stronger legal protections.

Such protections come as the enforcement of environmental regulations on Native lands has been called into question. Following the Supreme Court ruling McGirt v. Oklahoma that returned tribal sovereignty to much of eastern Oklahoma last year Gov. Kevin Stitt has sought to claw back state control.

In one such effort Stitt’s administration invoked a long-dormant rider that Oklahoma Senator and fossil fuel proponent James Inhofe attached to a transportation bill in 2005. The rider grants the state of Oklahoma rather than Native American tribes or the EPA the authority to administer environmental regulations in Indian county.

For the Ponca as well as for many of the state’s other tribal nations control of environmental regulations on tribal land by a state they feel is dominated by oil and gas interests is cause for more than a little concern. The industry is so influential in Oklahoma that the state capitol building is “the only capitol in the world surrounded by working oil wells” according to the Oklahoma House of Representatives. One of them called “Our Petunia’ was drilled in the middle of a flower bed on the capitol building’s lawn.

“Gov. Stitt used that rider to take over our environmental protection laws” Camp-Horkinek said. “We are using the rights of the river as a possible way to protect the Ponca people.”

‘Something Needs to Happen Here’

Driving north from the Ponca Tribal cemetery Howe heads towards his great uncle’s former allotment. He is halted by a gate and a “no trespassing” sign at top of the hill on the north side of the landfill. The view from this side of the landfill looks a lot different from what Howe’s ancestors would have seen from the place where they once laid their deceased on raised scaffolds.

A pile of brush that has been set on fire—in an apparent expansion of the city landfill—burns unattended in a shallow pit dug into the crest of the hillside. A short distance beyond a pumpjack whirs as it sucks oil out of the earth. Further afield the tanks and stacks of the Phillips 66 refinery mark the Ponca City skyline.

Wells have been extracting oil and gas from north central Oklahoma for more than 100 years. Regulators estimate 25000 to 100000 “orphaned” wells lie buried underground across the state. Credit: Phil McKenna

But looking out over his ancestor’s former land Howe also sees signs of hope. In addition to the fires and fossil fuel extraction infrastructure the pinwheels of distant wind farms dot the horizon in nearly every direction. In recent years a number of large wind farms have been built in the area though so far none belonging to the tribe.

Howe said he’d like to buy an electric vehicle. Wind energy he said could be a solution for the entire Ponca Nation’s transportation needs.

“If you took just one turbine it could feed our whole community” Howe said.

Photo Courtesy of Casey Camp-Horinek But Howe and the Ponca Tribe aren’t stopping there. Further afield far beyond even what Howe can see from the hilltop Camp-Horinek recently traveled to Glasgow Scotland on behalf of the tribe to COP26 the United Nations climate summit. There she met with U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland the first Native American to head the Interior Department. Camp-Horinek presented Haaland with a personalized blanket a gift from the Ponca Tribe embroidered by Howe and pressed her tribe’s case for rights of nature protections. It’s unclear how the meeting or the rights of nature resolutions will ultimately affect the tribe but the efforts are worth pursuing Howe said. “Something needs to happen here” he said.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Gottheimer says progressive protesters shouted 'Jew' at NJ event,"Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo is backing up a Jewish congressman’s incendiary claim that he heard protesters scream “Jew!” at him during a September event in New Jersey.

Garden State Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer caused a stir during a Dec. 13 speech at Rutgers University in which he said he was set upon by anti-Semitic protesters on Sept. 20 as he and Raimondo made a series of stops in Bergen County promoting President Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill.

The pair were greeted by around 100 hecklers in Glen Rock — most of whom Gottheimer claimed came from the local chapter of the Working Families Party. The situation was intense enough that Raimondo’s security detail insisted the pair travel in the commerce secretary’s vehicle.

“They were going from store to store protesting and as we were going into the bakery someone from the crowd derisively screamed ‘Jew!'” Gottheimer said adding that Raimondo heard the remark too and reacted with disgust. “She couldn’t believe it. I remember looking at her.”

Raimondo told The Post this week she too heard the hateful jeers.

“Anti-Semitism is wrong reprehensible and unacceptable. I join Congressman Gottheimer in condemning these hateful attacks that have absolutely no place in our politics” Raimondo said.

Though a Democrat Gottheimer is among his party’s most moderate voices and his attacks on “The Squad” and progressives has long drawn activist ire. WFP endorsed his unsuccessful 2020 primary opponent Arati Kreibich — who was at the protest herself.

The WFP refuted Gottheimer’s claim.

“There is no place for antisemitism at WFP and to be clear if that ever happened at a WFP event the person would have been rebuked instantly and asked to leave” said Sue Altman the party’s New Jersey state director. “We have reviewed video footage from our protests and interviewed many many participants in them including Jewish WFP members. All the footage has been made available to the press. We found no sign of such an outburst. No one we spoke to witnessed any anti-Semitic speech and most volunteered that they’d have shut down such behavior immediately.”

The congressman had come to campus to voice his displeasure over a decision by the the part-time faculty union at Rutgers to support Hamas during their most recent round of hostilities against Israel.

“Not long ago I held an event in my district to talk about the benefits of the bipartisan federal infrastructure bill only to have members of the Working Families Party disrupt the event by screaming ‘Jew’ at me. What has our country come to?” Gottheimer told students.

InsiderNJ which covered the protest at the time noted that things had been “a bit impolite” and that “verbal insults were hurled at the congressman.”

The Rutgers speech nevertheless circulated in Jewish circles and won praise from Jonathan Greenblatt CEO of the Anti-Defamation League.

“Congressman Gottheimer spoke movingly about the threat of anti-Semitism facing students on campus and we applaud him for highlighting it. If the Congressman says he was the victim of an anti-Semitic remark we take him at his word” an ADL spokesman Jake Hyman said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

He was referring to the sudden exit of long-standing MD and CEO Vishwavir Ahuja and the induction of RBI-appointed Yogesh Dayal as an additional director on the bank's board. Let's take a look at how the private sector bank performs on key financial parameters:

Comfortable Liquidity Coverage Ratio

The bank had a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of 154 per cent as of September 30 2021 much higher than the RBI's minimum requirement of 100 per cent. LCR is a global benchmark that measures the short-term resilience of banks. It indicates how prepared a bank is for any short-term liquidity stress by way of withdrawal of deposits or funds by external parties. In the last five years RBL Bank has been increasing its deposit base with outstanding deposits almost doubling to Rs 71000 crore.

Adequate Regulatory Capital

The bank has a capital adequacy ratio of 17.50 per cent which is very comfortable. In banking business every lending of Re 1 is backed by capital. A year ago the bank had raised over Rs 1500 crore from marquee investors like Baring Private Equity Asia ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Gaja Capital and CDC Group Plc. However the bank's loan growth has stagnated a bit in the last three years. The provisioning coverage ratio for non-performing assets (NPAs) also needs to go up.

Experts say once the bank starts to grow its loan book its capital requirement will definitely go up. The interim CEO Ahuja however said that the bank has enough capital for the next 2-3 years. RBL Bank's share price has also crashed in the last three years from close to Rs 700 to Rs 172 per share. At this stage any capital raising in the form of core equity will lead to more equity dilution.

Deteriorating Asset Quality

The bank's asset quality has been deteriorating since 2018-19. About 3.5 years ago the bank had one of the best asset quality numbers with gross NPAs at 1.38 per cent and net NPAs at 0.69 per cent. However in 2020-21 RBL Bank's NPAs deteriorated to 4.34 per cent at gross level and 2.12 per cent at net level. The slowdown in the economy impacted its borrowers. The pandemic hit its asset quality numbers further. In the second quarter of 2021-22 its gross NPAs jumped to 5.40 per cent and net NPAs were at 2.14 per cent. Given the pandemic disruption with third wave around the corner and loan restructuring availed by borrowers the real picture of NPAs will emerge once the two-year restructuring period gets over next year.

Lower Profitability

The bank's profitability also took a hit in the last three years because of higher NPAs and provisioning pressure. Profit fell from Rs 867 crore in 2018-19 to Rs 508 crore in 2020-21. The return on assets also declined from 1.27 per cent to 0.54 per cent in the same period. There is also a flight to safety to higher-rated corporates where the margins are not high. Similarly the bank's unsecured loan portfolio where the yields are generally very high has also slowed down.

He is the oldest of six children and was born at Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne WY. After his father’s military tour of duty his family moved back to the family’s roots in Stratford Texas. As the son of a rancher Flores learned the value of hard work and the basics of the American Free Enterprise system. His entrepreneurial experience began at age 10 delivering papers and by age 13 during the summers he was working 12 hours a day six days a week driving a tractor building fences and working cattle. The strong foundation that he and his five brothers and sisters were raised on set the stage for a successful career. Despite the hardships the Flores family never asked for or sought government assistance. Flores learned an early lesson that the value of hard work personal responsibility and saving for the future are important aspects of the American spirit and reflect the values which guided our Nation’s Founding Fathers.

Through hard work determination and prudent saving Flores paid his own way through Texas A&M University from which he graduated in 1976 with a BBA in Accounting (Cum Laude). In 1985 he received an MBA from Houston Baptist University. He and his wife Gina have provided scholarships faculty fellowships and infrastructure investments to support higher education at Texas A&M University and Houston Baptist University – portions of which are dedicated to assist first generation college students primarily from underrepresented groups. They are also major benefactors of K-12 education including support for Yellowstone Academy which provides elementary education to children in one of Houston’s poorest inner city areas.

In 1978 Flores earned his Texas Certified Public Accountancy (CPA) license. Before retiring to pursue public service Flores worked in the energy industry for nearly three decades. During that time he served as a CFO COO or CEO for successful energy companies ultimately serving as President and CEO of Phoenix Exploration Company an oil and gas company focused upon the discovery of American oil and gas resources. This company was started in late 2005 and in light of its rapid growth was included in the Houston Chronicle’s Top Private Companies lists in 2007 and 2008.

As a company leader and entrepreneur Flores has firsthand experience in helping to create hundreds of good-paying American jobs. He also understands the problems that bad government policy and regulation can cause for American job creation and economic prosperity.

Flores has also held numerous governance positions for various public companies private companies and non-profit organizations. Today he serves on the Board of Trustees of Houston Baptist University the Board of Directors of Texas A&M’s Private Enterprise Research Center the advisory board of the Ranching Heritage Association and the Congressional board of directors of the Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute (CHLI).

His previous governance positions include Commissioner of the Texas Real Estate Commission Director and Past Chair of The Association of Former Students of Texas A&M University as well as serving on the Boards of the Phoenix Exploration Company Petro Alliance Services Ltd. Marine Drilling Companies Inc. OneOffshore Inc. Great Western Resources Inc. and The PARC Recreational Ministries Corp.

In 2013 Houston Baptist University honored Flores with the Distinguished Alumnus Award. In 2012 Flores was inducted into the Texas A&M University Corps of Cadets Hall of Honor. In 2011 Texas Tech University’s Ranching Heritage Association honored him with the Boss of the Plains award in 2011 to reflect his association with ranching. In 2010 Texas A&M University honored him as a Distinguished Alumnus the highest honor bestowed upon a former student of A&M and in 2003 he was recognized as an Outstanding Alumnus of Texas A&M’s Mays Business School.

He and Gina are also major contributors to Wounded Warrior programs. Their community involvement includes service as an active volunteer for charitable causes and not-for-profit organizations. Flores’s hobbies include snow skiing and flying. He is an instrument rated private pilot with more than 2500 hours of pilot-in-command time.

Flores and his wife Gina have been married for 38 years and reside in Bryan Texas where they are members of Central Baptist Church. They have two adult sons – Will and John. John and his wife Aimee blessed them with two granddaughters.",,,,,,,,,

One reason behind the newfound interest was the announcement last year that Microsoft Corp. Co-Founder Bill Gates was investing in the industry. However the truth is investors and institutions have been migrating their dollars into “hard assets” with good cash flow for some time.

Let’s examine some factors driving the Canadian self-storage market as well as advice for buyers and sellers.

Market Overview

Compared to other real estate asset classes self-storage has performed exceptionally well during the pandemic for several reasons.

First it isn’t subject to the same challenges as multi-family or retail. Capitalization rates for multi-family properties have been compressed due to the consolidation of assets from large public and private real estate investment trusts in Canada. Additionally multi-family landlords have been greatly limited in their ability to increase rates or evict tenants who fall behind which has made it more difficult for “mom and pop” owners to efficiently manage their assets. Similarly commercial retail assets have experienced volatility due to a limited capacity to provide services in a COVID-19 environment.

Another factor contributing to self-storage success is the “staycation” and outdoor-recreation trend which is driving consumers to stick close to home and purchase recreational items such as camping equipment bikes motor homes boats and sporting equipment. Of course all of this increases the need for storage. In addition some families are downsizing whether for economic reasons such as employment uncertainty or common life transitions such as retirement.

As such Canadian self-storage has experienced an uptick in occupied units in most markets. As the industry becomes more appealing individuals looking to grow their portfolio have decided to invest.

Self-storage ownership is quite decentralized in Canada with 70% of owners having a single asset/location though there’s been more consolidation in recent months. Several groups have merged or amassed a portfolio of more than 1 million net rentable square feet. These firms account for a great deal of the remaining 30% of the market though there are still several mid-size regional operators.

Traditionally self-storage assets tend to sell quicker when they’re closer to primary/urban markets where there’s been extensive activity. However we’ve seen a trend of transactions occurring in secondary and tertiary markets as competition for urban locations becomes more intense.

Advice for Buyers

Self-storage properties are often valued based on gross potential income which means the buyer often pays more for the asset than the business itself is worth. But financial institutions will typically only lend on actual income not gross potential so the purchaser must place a larger down payment than expected.

Self-storage assets are in high demand in Canada right now and facilities listed through a broker are “shopped” to the market. Often once broker fees are factored into the purchase price the buyer can end up paying above market value even when the asset doesn’t have the income to support it. On the other hand if they can deal directly with the seller it’s often easier to facilitate a transaction that’s a win-win.

Before you buy I recommend determining whether you have the time and expertise to actively manage a self-storage facility. If not seek existing owners who have an investment vehicle to purchase and manage a portfolio on your behalf. In general to maximize the value of a real estate asset it takes an ongoing commitment and focus to learn the industry its trends. If you’re unable or unwilling to be an active investor consider partnering with the best owner-operator you can find.

Advice for Sellers

If you’re among those owners looking to sell you must grasp the realities of the market. Typically real estate transactions stall for three reasons:

The owner doesn’t know the true value of their facility and the buyer and the seller can’t agree on the “fair market value.”

The owner hasn’t discussed the fate of the business with the family and doesn’t know whether all members wish to divest of the property.

The owner hasn’t spoken with a tax accountant and attorney to ensure the business is structured to allow maximum value when selling.

Self-storage owners often struggle to determine fair market value for their asset. The potential gap between what the owner or broker feels the asset is worth and the business appraisal received to obtain financing can derail a transaction. Ideally a seller would source a reliable company that offers valuation services to determine asset value. Often they can do so with no obligation or commitment to list.

If you’re looking to sell in the next year or so get professional advice early in the process. It doesn’t need to come at a cost. A professional broker should be willing to discuss your asset and the market without requiring a fee or a listing. When I speak with owners early in their decision to sell I show them how to maximize the value of their asset. By providing knowledge about their competitors and what the market desires for amenities I help them make wise decisions.

Here’s my best advice: You don’t necessarily build your self-storage business to sell it; however you should operate it in such a way that it could be sold if necessary. For example it’s important to invest in technology and have systems and processes in place that would allow a potential buyer to readily assume management of the property.

Whether you’re looking to buy or sell in Canada partnering with an expert is essential to develop a roadmap for the future.

The past year has brought us challenges and optimism for the future.

February 2021 brought us the sale of the Birchwood Mall. New owners continue to be a success story with 10 new businesses — including family entertainment dining shopping and a bakery — within the past several months. Dunham’s Sports moved into a larger space and CubeSmart Self Storage took over a former anchor store at Birchwood Mall.

Also in 2021 Lakeshore Wood Retirement Community opened with resort-style senior apartments. And Sunrise Pace opened in October providing all-inclusive care for the elderly. Aldi Foods renovated their Fort Gratiot store. Godwin’s Furniture opened their Fort Gratiot location.

The Fort Gratiot Fire Department recently took delivery of the long-awaited emergency/rescue truck replacing a 2006 unit. The new truck joins the fire fleet of two rescue pumpers pumper tanker mini pumper and an aerial ladder.

The Fort Gratiot Building Department issued 276 building permits totaling over $32 million for new construction and renovations. The total real property exceeds $1 billion in value.

We look forward to next year being the best we can make it.

Fort Gratiot is a border community. We look forward to the Canadian/US border opening. The opening will benefit our area allowing retail shopping to resume and for family and friends to be together again.

We have a proposed water line extension to service 262 acres of recreation land owned by Fort Gratiot on Parker Road. The water service would provide municipal water for the proposed development of new baseball fields field house and campground. The proposed campground would bring visitors to Fort Gratiot and support area businesses. The water extension will also enclose a service loop and provide additional water capacity to the north east area of the township.

Our Parks Commission has purchased the equipment to create a Disk Golf Course and a new play structure for the Fort Gratiot Pond Park areas. Other park improvements included for 2022 are expanding ADA parking and completing the paving of the pathway around Fort Gratiot Pond. They are also considering the renovation of our tennis courts and the addition of pickle ball courts. Other proposed improvements include a ground maintenance building and development of a farmer’s market.

More from opinion

Housing opportunities continue to expand with the completion of Fort Gratiot Place Apartments a five-building development with 180 units and a club house. The proposed Fort Huron housing development includes 85 single family homes and 135 multiple family units; construction is expected to start in the spring.

New senior housing opportunities include the proposed Lake Huron Woods II a senior living community expansion. This development proposes duplex cottages and an apartment building equipped for those with disabilities. The proposed site is west of Lake Huron Woods I and will be surrounded by a wooded area giving it the feeling of living up north.

Moran Blue Water Chrysler will complete the renovation of the Fort Gratiot store within the next few months. The renovation includes new show room vehicle service entry and vehicle body repair facility.

Fort Gratiot continues to be the place to enjoy life for the day weekend or a lifetime.

And its transition to a cleaner more reliable power system is off to a rough start.

Just six months into a 15-year contract to run Puerto Rico’s electricity transmission and distribution network LUMA Energy is facing protests from residents who say blackouts have worsened criticism from greens that it is moving too slowly to add renewable power and growing scrutiny from the territory’s legislature. That last dynamic reached a peak in November when lawmakers sought the arrest of the company’s top executive.

LUMA owned by Canada’s ATCO group and U.S.-based Quanta Services has also become the target of an activist campaign seeking to revoke its contract an effort that has drawn the attention of the House Natural Resources Committee which is looking into whether the company is living up to its promises.

Solar vs. gas

The Federal Emergency Management Agency has $9.4 billion — the largest amount awarded in the agency’s history — allocated to restore and protect Puerto Rico’s power network from the type of disasters that have plagued it.

Renewable energy and consumer advocates say that money is best spent on putting solar panels on the roofs of every home on the sunny island with the aim of creating a decentralized source of power generation. This could minimize the widespread blackouts that have occurred when storms damage the miles of power lines that run across rugged terrain from the oil-fired power plants that provide most of the island’s electricity.

Those plants are still owned by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority the local government-owned utility being privatized that turned the grid over to LUMA and which most experts blame for years of poor management. Besides being plagued by blackouts the grid is expensive: Residents on the island paid an average of 19.24 cents per kilowatt hour in 2020 nearly 50 percent higher than the average U.S. home.

A new coalition of clean energy union and other organizations Queremos Sol is lobbying federal officials to intervene in the rebuilding to sharply expand the amount of solar energy on the island. It says such an initiative aligns with Biden’s plan to achieve 100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity nationwide by 2035 as well as his goals of transitioning away from fossil fuel infrastructure that has been primarily sited in low-income areas and communities of color.

“Puerto Rico is a very big test” said Ruth Santiago a community and environmental attorney in Puerto Rico and a member of Queremos Sol noting that this is one fight Biden can win without any resistance from Republicans in Congress. “The funds are already allocated. They’re fully within the control of FEMA under the Biden administration.”

But opposition remains particularly among skeptics who think a wholesale shift to renewable power sources will introduce new doubts about reliability.

Jenniffer González-Colón a Republican who is Puerto Rico’s congressional representative doesn’t want the island to be a test case for a fast push to renewables — expressing concern about the island’s economy particularly its pharmaceutical and medical devices industry. She says the best way to ensure reliability is to get energy from diverse sources including liquefied natural gas imports.

“Puerto Rico could be the big experiment for the whole nation in terms of having a diversified portfolio of energy not just one experiment in terms of renewables” she told POLITICO.

‘The grid is in need of complete replacement’

PREPA which regularly put off grid maintenance because of financial shortfalls will have a major voice in how the incoming FEMA funds are spent because it must put forth projects for the agency and its regulator to approve. The utility is under pressure from the Queremos Sol coalition and other organizations to shift its focus more toward renewables rather than rebuilding existing or developing new petroleum-based infrastructure.

The system has been in “severe decay” due to years of poor maintenance and further destabilized by the 2020 earthquake said Luis Martinez director of Southeast energy for the Natural Resources Defense Council’s climate and clean energy program.

“I think the grid is in need of complete replacement” he said adding that it was not designed to withstand the more powerful hurricanes that climate change will increasingly stir in the Atlantic. “Just the layout with generation in the South being sent to the San Juan area in the Northeast across the central mountain range … makes it very difficult and costly to repair and maintain.”

Plants that run on fuel oil or diesel still provided half the island’s power in 2020 while imported natural gas has seen its share reach 29 percent and coal generated 19 percent. Hydropower and other renewables provided only 2.5 percent.

Under the 2019 Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act (17-2019) PREPA is required to obtain 40 percent of its electricity from renewable resources by 2025 60 percent by 2040 and 100 percent by 2050. The law also requires it to phase out coal-fired generation by 2028.

Those figures are roughly in line with Biden’s goal for the country and set a pace that climate advocates say should preclude further dependence on fossil fuels on the island.

“I do think Puerto Rico has the opportunity to go from a system based on petroleum which is very antiquated in terms of generating electricity to essentially a state-of-the-art distributed renewable-based system which can then be a model for other states” Martinez said. He advised against taking “that intermediate step that a lot of folks seem to be pushing for which is to go to imported liquefied gas which is even more expensive.”

But González-Colón dismissed those green ambitions as unfeasible for the immediate future saying the island needs to take an “all-of-the-above” approach while the grid is being rebuilt to enable more renewables.

”We need to use LNG as a way to cut expenses and stabilize the system at the same time you are investing in renewable energy” she said.

For LUMA the problems are more immediate. Data the company supplied to the legislature show that its average power outage time more than doubled to five hours compared with less than half that time in 2020 since it took over the grid in June according to a report in The New York Times though CEO Wayne Stensby has said figures from previous years undercounted the outage time. Those service disruptions prompted a protest that closed a highway in San Juan in October.

The relationship between LUMA Energy and Puerto Rican legislators has also deteriorated to the point that a judge in Puerto Rico found Stensby in contempt of court and issued an arrest order on Nov. 10 for failing to provide requested documents including those pertaining to executive salaries and the makeup and experience of its workforce. The judge later nullified the order after LUMA provided the documents.

The grid in Puerto Rico was already “in pretty bad shape” due to the deferred maintenance by PREPA said Cathy Kunkel energy program manager with Cambio PR an organization promoting sustainable policies and strategies in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. But “the LUMA privatization has certainly made things worse.”

Before joining Cambio Kunkel was lead author of a report published in August by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis that described significant issues with the LUMA Energy contract as well as damaging voltage fluctuations and poor customer service since the company took over the grid. The report attributed the problems to a lack of personnel insufficient transparency and the absence of effective oversight.

Stensby at an Oct. 6 hearing by the House Natural Resources Committee blamed a union blockade for a slow start to repair work and observed that “PREPA is unquestionably the worst performing utility in the United States by each and every measure.”

“It took two decades for PREPA to get in this state we shouldn’t forget and that’s why it’s so important to get started and continue to push ahead” he said. The company has since reached an agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers which will represent LUMA lineworkers while the company will invest $10 million in a technical training program for those workers.

LUMA said it has made improvements in its first six months of managing the grid such as upgrading more than 1800 power poles and dozens of critical distribution breakers to reduce the likelihood of future outages.

“Any service interruption is one too many and we are working hard to make the service and infrastructure improvements so that customers see fewer interruptions” the company said in a Dec. 3 statement.

LUMA said it has connected solar panels for 12000 customers since June amounting to 50 megawatts of renewable energy. In September LUMA has also launched a map on its website to show customers and developers what areas could most easily accept solar projects. And the company said it’s on track to eliminate a backlog of solar connection requests by January.

Pushing ahead with fossil fuels

In the meantime PREPA’s regulator authorized the utility to begin preliminary work for a new fossil fuel-powered unit or energy storage at the fuel-oil power plant Palo Seco to protect against near term price fluctuations of solar PV and battery energy storage and other potential reliability concerns. Environmental justice advocates have objected to the project because of the public health and other harms it could cause for nearby communities.

Environmental advocates are hoping with $9.4 billion in FEMA money flowing to Puerto Rico the federal government will help tip the scales toward renewable power. But in August the agency dashed their hopes by declaring that the power grid work in Puerto Rico would have no significant impact on the environment.

A coalition called the Alianza Energía Renovable Ahora the Alliance for Renewable Energy Now asked the agency in October to reconsider that finding. The coalition accused FEMA of bucking repeated instructions from Congress to direct funding away from infrastructure vulnerable to storms failing to comply with National Environmental Policy Act’s mandates to consider all energy alternatives and their climate impacts and failing to account for environmental justice.

In particular the group says the agency should look at alternatives such as battery energy storage and rooftop solar.

A FEMA spokesperson said via email that it carefully reviews all requests and is evaluating this one.

But NRDC’s Martinez said FEMA could “put its foot down” and say the funding proposals must meet the Biden administration’s goals requirements imposed by the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau and the island’s renewable energy legislative target.

“If they say that I think that will clarify how much wiggle room the utility has to essentially go rogue” he said. “They’re not following what the law says or what the regulators say.”

A PREPA spokesperson could not be reached for comment but a FEMA spokesperson said via email that “while FEMA has no standing in the terms of the contract between PREPA and LUMA FEMA has worked with the Government of Puerto Rico to maximize the flexibility of funding including the ability to pursue renewable energy resources.”

But Queremos Sol’s Santiago said the island’s continuing power outages and its slow transition to solar power pose an environmental justice issue — one that the Biden administration has the power to address.

“What we’re seeing right now is that anyone who can afford to get rooftop solar and batteries is doing it. The problem is we don’t have a lot of people who can afford to do that on their own” she said. “The way to get this solution in place — and everyone agrees it’s a solution to have rooftop solar and battery energy storage systems onsite — is to use those federal funds.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

4 Reviews

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is Qualcomm's latest and greatest flagship chipset yet. It already faces stiff competition from the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 and the upcoming Exynos 2200 but may not quite be up to the task at least if early gaming tests are anything to go by.

As tested by Golden Reviewer the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 on the Motorola Edge X30 puts up an unconvincing display in a 10 minutes Genshin Impact test. The source routinely tests new chipsets to give a closer look at real-world sustained performance with Google's Tensor recently also disappointing.

On the test the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 starts off strong delivering about 60 FPS for the first few minutes. A little over two minutes in however it sees its first dip in performance dropping as low as 43 FPS. Over the first half of the test it manages to average circa 53 FPS while drawing about 8.7 W. In the second half of the test things mostly fall apart with the phone holding an average of 48 FPS but routinely falling lower than 40 FPS. Power consumption over that period is a more reasonable 6.3 W.

Instead Tampa Bay’s regular season woes against New Orleans continued. The defending Super Bowl champions were shut out falling 9-0 to drop to 10-4 on the season. Even worse they lost Chris Godwin (knee) and Patrick O’Connor (knee) for the season and saw Lavonte David (foot) and Leonard Fournette (hamstring) land on injured reserve for the remainder of the regular season.

Of course it’s not as if all is lost for the Bucs. They will still win the division for the first time since 2007 with one win in their final three games (or one Saints loss in their final three games). That means they’ll still get a home playoff game in the first-round but they may very well have to go on the road after that.

Tampa Bay’s latest chance to clinch the NFC South—and its second consecutive playoff berth—came Sunday afternoon. On the road against the Panthers (5-9) the Bucs were extremely short-handed. In addition to the previously mentioned players that are now on injured reserve Mike Evans (hamstring) Antoine Winfield Jr. (foot) Jason Pierre-Paul (shoulder) Breshad Perriman (reserve/COVID-19 list) and Rakeem Nunez-Roches (reserve/COVID-19 list) we’re all out against Carolina.

The Panthers entered Sunday with plenty of questions of their own. With playoffs likely out of the question they’re simply looking to limp to the season’s finish line without running back Christian McCaffrey and a host of other key contributors. Plus head coach Matt Rhule also told reporters during the week that Cam Newton would start under center and play most of the game though Sam Darnold—activated from injured reserve this week—would also play at some point.

So as short-handed as the Bucs were on the day after Christmas they still came in as 11-point road favorites. ESPN’s FPI Matchup Predictor gave them a 73.8% chance to grab that elusive 11th win and fourth-ever NFC South title.

The Panthers took an early 3-0 lead but the Bucs weren’t phased. Jordan Whitehead and the defense dominated the entire game and the offense made the most of what they had with Ke’Shawn Vaughn Cameron Brate and Ronald Jones II scoring touchdowns as Tampa Bay cruised to a 32-6 win and their first division championship since 2007.

Game Recap

The Panthers won the coin toss and elected to defer giving Tom Brady and the depleted Buccaneer offense a shot to take an early lead. Ronald Jones II took his first carry of the game for five yards then Brady found the returning Antonio Brown for four yards to set up 3rd & 1 at the 34-yard line. Jones got three yards on third down to move the chains and keep the drive alive. The Bucs went to their young running back again from there and he got four more yards before two Brady incompletions led to Sterling Hofrichter’s first punt as a Buc. He sent it 45 yards to the Carolina 14 but a 16-yard return by Alex Erickson set the Panthers up with decent field position at their own 30.

Cam Newton found Tommy Tremble for 14 yards to open the first Carolina possession but William Gholston quickly set the offense back by sacking Newton for a loss of six. Jordan Whitehead came flying in on the blitz to set up the sack forcing the Panthers into a 2nd & 16. Newton found Robby Anderson for eight yards on second down to set up 3rd & 8 but before the conversion Carolina called its first timeout of the afternoon. Tampa Bay’s defense couldn’t get off the field after the timeout as Newton hit D.J. Moore for 10 yards to the Bucs’ 44.

The rough opening possession for the Buccaneer defense continued from there with Newton running for a 33-yard gain to the 11. That’s when Todd Bowles’ unit stood tall as Chuba Hubbard was stopped for a two-yard gain on first down. A neutral-zone infraction on Shaquil Barrett gave Carolina half the distance to the goal on second down but he stopped Ameer Abdullah for a loss of two to make up for it before Mike Edwards blitzed and forced a third-down incompletion. That brought out Lirim Hajrullahu to drill a 24-yard field goal on 4th & Goal giving the home team a 3-0 lead with 7:17 to go in the opening quarter.

Tampa Bay’s second offensive series began the way its first one did with Jones getting five yards on first down. Brady then found Jones for a three-yard gain to set up 3rd & 2 which the Bucs converted with a four-yard pass from Brady to Brown. A false start on Rob Gronkowski brought the offense back to 1st & 15 but Jones got 13 yards back on a screen before Ke’Shawn Vaughn broke free for a 55-yard touchdown run—thanks in large part to a nice downfield block by Cyril Grayson. With Ryan Succop’s PAT the Bucs took a 7-3 lead with 4:13 left in the first quarter.

A five-yard pass from Newton to Anderson and a big open-field tackle by Whitehead on Newton forced a quick 3rd & 4 for the Panthers and Sean Murphy-Bunting looked to have broken up a third-down pass but it bounced off his hand and his helmet before Moore caught it for a 15-yard gain and a first down. But after forcing another third down Tampa Bay’s defense got a splash play. Barrett dropped into coverage and tipped Newton’s pass into the air then Whitehead came down with it for his second interception of the season.

The Bucs took over at their own 49 after the interception but went backward in a hurry. Jones got nothing on first down and Brown was called for offensive pass interference on second down to force a 2nd & 20. Brown got seven yards back but the offense still had a 3rd & 13 to face on the other side of the quarter break. The good news? Tampa Bay held a 7-3 lead after 15 minutes.

The Bucs opened the second quarter with a huge third-down conversion with Brady getting enough time from his offensive line to find Brown for a 19-yard pickup to the Carolina 35. Three straight four-yard runs by Jones got the offense inside the 25 before a loss of two on his next run put the offense behind the sticks. An incomplete pass then brought up 3rd & 12 but before that third down Brady called the Bucs’ first timeout. After the timeout Brady found Cameron Brate for a seven-yard gain. Rather than go for it on 4th & 5 Bruce Arians elected for a 36-yard field goal attempt by Succop. He nailed it giving Tampa Bay a 10-3 lead with 10:54 to go in the first half.

When the Carolina offense took the field at its 25 to start the next drive Sam Darnold trotted out to lead the offense to some boos from the home crowd. Those same fans were cheering two plays later when Darnold found Shi Smith for a 63-yard gain after some busted coverage. That put the Panthers in a 1st & Goal situation at the 10 and though the play clock ran out the officials missed it and granted Carolina its second timeout. Newton came back in after the timeout and got two yards on first down before a screen to Abdullah was blown up by Whitehead for no gain. Darnold then relieved Newton on 3rd & Goal only to get sacked by Barrett to force a Hajrullahu 29-yard field goal. The kick got the Panthers back within 10-6 with 7:20 to go before halftime.

With Barrett’s 10th sack of the season he became the fourth player in franchise history to post multiple seasons with double-digit sacks joining Simeon Rice Lee Roy Selmon and Warren Sapp.

Jones opened the next Buccaneer possession with a nine-yard run then a Brady screen to Brown went for one yard and a first down at the 35. Vaughn got just one yard on the next play but Brady found Brown for a 10-yard gain to move the chains on the next play. The two continued to link up from there with Brown running a great route to catch a 22-yard pass to the Panthers’ 32. An offsides penalty on Carolina gave the Bucs another free five yards then Jones got two yards to bring up 2nd & 3 at the 25. Pressure got to Brady on the next play forcing an incompletion and a 3rd & 3. A poorly executed traffic pattern on third down resulted in another incompletion and another Succop field goal try. He connected from 43 yards out extending Tampa Bay’s lead back to seven with 2:40 left in the first half.

The FG puts us up 13-6.#GoBucs pic.twitter.com/Fw6GTUygKo — Tampa Bay Buccaneers (@Buccaneers) December 26 2021

With Darnold in the game at quarterback to open the next drive Sean Murphy-Bunting and a host of Bucs dropped Hubbard for a loss of two to bring up 2nd & 12—as well as the two-minute warning.

After the two-minute warning Darnold found Ian Thomas for a four-yard gain to set up 3rd & 8 but not before the Bucs called their second timeout of the half with 1:53 to go. Darnold then found Terrace Marshall Jr. for six yards on third down bringing the punt team out and forcing timeout No. 3 by the Bucs with 1:48 left in the half.

Brady and the offense got the ball back at their 31 with a chance to add to their lead with 1:41 and no timeouts to work with before halftime. Any points would be big for Tampa Bay considering Carolina was set to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. The Bucs immediately got within scoring range as Cyril Grayson Jr. fought through illegal contact to haul in a pass from Brady and take it 62 yards to the Panthers’ 7-yard line.

The Panthers got the Bucs to 3rd & Goal at the 4 but Brady found Cameron Brate for an easy touchdown on a slant to add to the lead. After a Carolina neutral-zone infraction on the PAT the Bucs elected to go for two. It didn’t work out though keeping the lead at 19-6 with 1:19 left in the second quarter.

Whitehead was called for roughing the passer to open the next Carolina drive but a solid stop by Kevin Minter and a pass breakup by Jamel Dean brought up 3rd & 8. Tampa Bay’s defense then got off the field with Barrett forcing Darnold into an incompletion. After the punt the Buccaneer offense took over at its 17 with 34 seconds left in the half. However the visitors were content to run the clock out and take a 19-6 lead into the locker room.

A holding penalty on the opening kickoff of the second half put the Panthers deep in their own territory giving them a 1st & 10 at the 14. Newton started the half as the Carolina quarterback finding Moore for a nine-yard gain to start things off. Hubbard got nothing on 2nd & 1 with Whitehead and Vita Vea teaming up to stop him short of the sticks. He got four yards on 3rd & 1 though extending the drive. Two incompletions forced a 3rd & 10 then the Buccaneer defense got off the field thanks to a sack from Anthony Nelson.

After a 20-yard punt return by Kenjon Barner the Bucs quickly faced a 3rd & 7 at their 49. Brady as he did so often in the first half found Brown for a 13-yard pickup and a first down at the Carolina 38. A few plays later Gronkowski made his presence felt with a 23-yard catch to the Panthers’ 9. Defensive holding on Jeremy Chinn gave the Bucs a 1st & Goal at the 4 but the offense couldn’t cash in. Instead Tampa Bay settled for a 21-yard field goal from Succop to extend the lead to 22-6.

The FG puts us up 22-6.#GoBucs pic.twitter.com/6MFJffOxWi — Tampa Bay Buccaneers (@Buccaneers) December 26 2021

Jordan Whitehead continued to take over the game on Carolina’s next drive stopping Newton for no gain on first down and breaking up a pass on second down. Vita Vea then sacked Newton on third down to force another Panthers punt.

Starting from their 43 the Bucs had a chance to really put the game out of reach. An 11-yard pass to Brown an 11-yard scramble by Brady and a 14-yard end-around to Grayson got the offense inside the red zone then Brady hit Grayson for a 12-yard gain to the 7. On the next play Jones took the ball around the left end and found the end zone. With Succop adding the PAT Tampa Bay’s lead got to 29-6 with 2:08 left in the third quarter.

Devin White pressured Darnold into a throwaway to open the next Carolina possession then Whitehead made another nice play to force Anderson out of bounds to bring up 3rd & 10. The Panthers kept the drive alive with Moore tipping a pass to himself for a 19-yard gain. One first-down later we reached the end of the third quarter with Tampa Bay leading 29-6.

Carolina picked up another third-down conversion early in the fourth quarter continuing to drive deeper into Tampa Bay territory. But after a split sack for Gholston and Nelson Darnold missed Abdullah on third down to bring up 4th & 11. Forced to go for it down 23 in the fourth quarter Darnold misfired under pressure and that brought and end to what was once a promising drive for the Panthers. With 11:52 to go the Buccaneer offense took over at its own 24.

The Bucs went three-and-out on their next drive having to punt the ball away for the first time since their opening possession. After the kick and a Buccaneer holding penalty the Panthers took over at the Tampa Bay 48. But three straight incompletions brought up a 4th & 10 try and Kevin Minter—filling in for the injured Lavonte David—sacked Darnold to turn the ball over at the Panthers’ 45.

Jones took off for a 16-yard gain to open the next drive before getting dropped for a loss of one on the next play. Two straight incompletions brought Succop back out for another field goal try and Succop hit this one from 48 yards out to give Tampa Bay a 32-6 lead with 7:59 to go.

The field goal is good and we're up 32-6 pic.twitter.com/wg9XY65csh — Tampa Bay Buccaneers (@Buccaneers) December 26 2021

The Buccaneer defense continued to dominate on the next possession with William Gholston getting another sack to bring his total for the day to 2.5—a career high. More pressure on the next play this time from Steve McLendon forced another incompletion and another Carolina punt.

Vaughn ran for 12 yards to open the next Tampa Bay possession then Brady later found Brown for another first down. That was enough to get some of the second team in with Blaine Gabbert taking over at quarterback and new signing Le’Veon Bell getting his first snap in the backfield. His first carry went nowhere and his second went for a loss of one bringing up a 3rd & 11 with less than three minutes to go. An incompletion intended for Scotty Miller meant another punt giving the ball back to Carolina with just over two minutes to go.

The Panthers were committed to putting a garbage-time touchdown on the board getting down to the Bucs’ 11 before appearing to turn the ball over on downs. However a holding call gave them two more shots. An incompletion with one second left meant one last opportunity but Dee Delaney broke up a Darnold pass in the end zone to win the game.

With their 32-6 victory the Buccaneers officially clinched the NFC South for the first time since 2007. That guarantees them at least one home playoff game.

However their names remain unknown to the general public. They are film-set photographers whose task is to capture the essence and the feel of a film apart from the trailer even as they document the history of cinema.

Still photography is as old as cinema. However the status of the photographer has fluctuated on both sides of the Atlantic along with the changing industry: from the star system to the New Wave from publications for cinema buffs to film magazines from analog to digital from the advent of TV series to streaming platforms. While the photographer might be the only one who does not actually make the films his objectives are closely aligned with those of the producer: to promote the theater release with powerful images that reflect the plot and the spirit of the film. From action scenes to portraits of the actors to posters these images circle the globe. Some manage to have a lasting impression on viewers while others go down in film history as its most beautiful documents.

Cultivating an artistic eye

These photographers’ task requires observation patience discretion and instinct. Whether they are English American Italian Australian or French they convey their love of photography and cinema replete with anecdotes which lend a personal touch to their images. These photographers who are seldom household names are true masters. David James is one of them: fascinated by images from the age of nine this legendary British photographer based in Los Angeles has traveled to hundreds of film sets starting at MGM in the early 1960s. He has thousands of stories to tell things to make you laugh until you cry. For starters take one of his first collaborations with director Otto Preminger on the set of Bunny Lake is Missing (1965): “He told me I was there to sell his film. He said ‘Picture you want to buy a can of beans in a supermarket. There are only plain aluminum cans with the word “beans” written across. Add one with an illustration and customers will be hooked.’”

The man who would have preferred the nickname “Mr. Still” rather than “Beecham’s pill”—Cockney for a photograph—has conquered Hollywood both analog and digital. The Man Who Fell to Earth Jesus Christ Superstar Schindler’s List Saving Private Ryan Star Wars VII: his filmography makes your head spin—a discreet approach applied to a diversity of genres always in the service of the film crew: “I always wear dark colors on the set or something to blend with the surroundings” he explained. “Before digital cameras with silent shutters to get the right shot you had to ask for it (sometimes insist). I had two Rolleiflexes a 4×5 flatbed camera and all the accessories.” He would then organize a shooting session to cover the scene. The whole crew had their eyes on him and the actors re-enacting the scene before the camera. “Some directors would direct actors in these brief moments: like Steven Spielberg he’s the perfect man for movie still photography he’s always interested and concerned about the look of his film.”

Toward an expanded vision

David James’s meeting with the director of Schindler’s List was a turning point: “That film was and always will be very special to me. It was the first of many projects with Steven and shooting in black and white was a dream and the only way to go.” James created searing images of the Auschwitz concentration camp and of Ralph Fiennes as a Nazi officer staring at us from his convertible. Between the texture of the photo the actor’s gaze the effect of motion and blur the shot looks like an archival image. A shot taken in the old ghetto: “This type of photo owes its existence also to the gaze and behavior of the actor the costumes the director. It’s like putting together pieces of a great puzzle. You must be in the right frame of mind and live in the moment.”

David James’s career is replete with masterpieces like Tom Cruise atop the Burj Khalifa in Dubai for Mission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol or Saving Private Ryan stills inspired by Robert Capa. Or yet the surreal retro black-and-white shot taken in the Pinewood studios in London on the set of J.J. Abrams’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens which delighted the social networks. When asked how to photograph a film of the magnitude of Star Wars James revealed that he turned down the very first installment A New Hope: “At the time George Lucas said to me ‘I’m going to talk to you about this film what you’re going to see or not see on the set. Don’t say anything until I’m done.’ I sat down and listened. At the end of his description I said to myself that this was not for me too many visual effects that would be hard to handle.”

David James helped found the Society of Motion Picture Stills Photographers (SMPSP) and served as one of its presidents. The organization works toward ensuring global recognition of still photographers and their valuable contribution to the industry. While James has published numerous books he is now dedicated to mentoring passing on his passion for the craft.

Finding the right angle

Chiabella James David’s daughter has long avoided following in her father’s footsteps and the pitfalls of nepotism. “I grew up running after him on sets with his bags of photos” she recalled. “The way ahead seemed obvious but he spent years talking me out of it. … Things fell into place only after I went through a series of tragedies that changed my world in my late twenties.” Her father offered her a job in the stills department on Star Wars VII. Chiabella James has since developed her personal approach by working on several major feature films with Tom Cruise including two Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation and Fallout part of which takes place in Paris. Her career has combined landscapes actor portraits and action shots of fights car chases and explosions: “I thrive on these split-second moments. Understanding how the scene will unfold is the first step and that means asking the crew questions and knowing what camera angles the action is going to be focused on.” Then experience and instinct take over. How to set up the camera and when to press the shutter release: “Nothing compares to that happy feeling when you know you’ve captured the images you wanted.”

the relationship between the characters the scene and the landscape. I positioned them for 10 seconds and asked them to look toward their future in the story. It was quick but valuable.

Chiabella James’s career got a big boost with Denis Villeneuve’s Dune and her photos from the film set have traveled around the world. While she doesn’t really prepare ahead of time she always stays attentive to discussions on the set to understand the plot and the characters because her images “are used only once the production is done and they’re ready to be sold.” Timothée Chalamet Rebecca Ferguson Javier Bardem Josh Brolin Ian McKellen Helen Mirren Gal Gadot: some of the greats have already posed for her: “I’ve been lucky enough to work with many actors who understand the importance of photography to promote the film.” Her own influences include Guy Bourdin Jacques Henri Lartigue Mario Sorrenti but also Clay Enos and of course her father. She aims to prove that film set photography is an art in its own right. “We are the most published photographers in the world but there are thousands of beautiful images that never get used and never see the light of day. I’d like to change that.”

In the heat of the moment

Australian Jasin Boland tells yet another story. He started out as a press photographer before embarking on a career in the film industry where he feels more at home. Both jobs bear some resemblances: “Covering the news and shooting action on feature films is spontaneous” he said “and both come with their own set of problems. In both cases you’re not always welcome you have to know when to stay away. Self-preservation is key!” His golden rule? “Patience and timing.” For him “success comes from failure.” The result is an impressive career and he “appreciates the anonymity” especially when people discover that he has worked on one of their favorite films: “That makes my day!” He has taken masterful photographs of Mad Max: Fury Road Jason Bourne the Matrix trilogy No Time to Die Captain Phillips Thor: Ragnarok and Everest. “I have always treated the film set as a real environment and told the story of the directors offering an opposite or at least alternative point of view.”

Jason Bourne by Paul Greengrass (2016) Universal Pictures (États-Unis France) © Jasin Boland

Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving Matrix by the Wachowski (1999) Warner Bros (United States France) © Jasin Boland

Case in point is the fourth installment of Mad Max shot in Namibia with parts in Cape Town and Sydney. “I had to get over some hurdles” Boland recalled. “George Miller and cinematographer John Searle gave me lots of leeway. … You are only as good as the access you’re given. And what I’ve been allowed to do on this film is unprecedented.” Adventure and action standing up to the challenge being in the midst of things and seizing the moment are the recurring themes. The image of Charlize Theron screaming in the desert is one of the most memorable. “It was the last shot of the day” Boland said. “In such moments my experience as a photojournalist comes in handy.” Because what Boland loves best is capturing the raw emotion when an actor gives his all then lets it all out. “You could never set up this kind of image and get the same emotion. It’s as spontaneous as the news.”

From the desert (Fury Road) to snowy peaks (Everest) to the high seas on a container ship (Captain Phillips) Jasin Boland always ensures his safety when documenting stunts: “I scout the locations and check with the SFX crew to see if there are any explosions or other things on the scene and then I let security and the first assistant director know that the spot is approved so no one is surprised I’m there.” His method is to shoot with both eyes open and to stay alert to the surroundings. He uses camera rigs so as not to miss anything. This Nikon ambassador travels with about 100kg worth of gear and his YouTube channel is full of stories and good technical advice.

The weight of a still image

In France things work a bit differently. While film set photography used to be its own thing with some world-famous shots by Georges Pierre or Raymond Cauchetier this is no longer true today. The advent of digital technology and ultra-high-definition cameras has changed the rules of the game. Producers are scaling back production costs and the photographers bear the brunt of the cuts: they no longer participate in the total duration of the shoot. This problem rises also in the context of film history even if the Cinémathèque française continues to work on the conservation of film heritage. Today production is moving towards a deliberate forgetting of the photographic memory of the seventh art. In the age of social networks the place is left more to photograms (splinters of the 24 images per second) as visuals of films.

And yet storytelling through images remains Stéphanie Branchu’s credo. Her inspiration comes from the sets the costumes and her permanent quest for gaze and emotion. Her career as a film set photographer took off with Patrice Leconte’s Girl on the Bridge (La Fille sur le Pont)and she has since worked on many feature films such as Taken starring Liam Neeson and Jackie starring Natalie Portman: “I’ve loved my job from the very start” she recalls with a smile. “I was working with Catherine Cabrol. The still camera once so important has now been replaced with photograms so we must find the right shot the right frame and prove that our presence brings an added value.” Over her twenty-year-long career she has seen her profession transform: “Set photography has become merely promotional. Producers only think about the film release and about the poster. They are not interested in anything else” she stated frankly even if she still enjoys some artistic freedom. With all her experience she can afford to ask actors to replay scenes although she prefers to capture the moment.

Mathieu Kassovitz Le Bureau des Légendes series 2015-2020 (Canal+) © Stéphanie Branchu

Another change stems from the working methods. In the days of analog film photographers would take their film to the lab select their images from the contact sheets and that was that. “Today digital photography requires a significant amount of time in post-production sorting and retouching which is done off the clock” explained Stephanie Branchu. The time is long gone when the set photographer could produce a real story capturing both the shooting of the scenes the actors and the life on the set. But as a member of the Photographes de Films Associés (PFA) which promotes the profession the art and the photographers’ place in the creative process and memory production she remains hopeful. Her work on TV series like The Bureau (Le Bureau des Légendes) (Canal+) Inhuman Resources (Dérapages) (Arte) Emily in Paris (Netflix) and The Serpent Queen (Starz) has led her to see some “possibilities” yet without getting ahead of herself: “The series are longer; we might work for twenty days at a time or even a month and a half everything is faster.” With streaming platforms such as Netflix however some commissions are specific such as this shot in Emily in Paris with Lily Collins taking a selfie.

Nevertheless working with Americans is still “the most satisfying” because while they pay better they also “value the profession love and want photography.” And the result is comparable when it comes to reconciling the technical aesthetic and promotional aspects of the job in an effort to always tell a story—the story of cinema constantly in the making.

Tierney told Newsday that next on his agenda is pushing to overhaul the state's bail reform law which eliminated cash bail for people arrested for most misdemeanors and nonviolent crimes.

Since it became law in 2020 opponents of bail reform have blamed it for spurring a rise in crime including in Suffolk. But proponents of the law argue there is no evidence connecting crime increases which they attribute mostly to the pandemic and ensuing economic woes.

""I think bail reform is a disaster"" Tierney said in an interview. ""What we can do as the professionals in the field is talk about how these laws don't work and don't keep us safe. I can be loud and unequivocal in saying which aspects of these laws are not good for the safety of our citizens.""

Tierney 55 of Holtsville is set to be sworn in as district attorney Jan. 1. He will oversee an office with an estimated $43 million annual budget and a staff of 441 full-time employees including about 225 prosecutors. Tierney's salary for his first year in office is budgeted at $215250.

In addition to lobbying the State Legislature to repeal the bail reform law and give judges discretion on bail he said he plans to reestablish a unit concentrating on gangs.

A career prosecutor

Tierney spent about 14 years in the Suffolk district attorney's office in two separate stints worked in the Brooklyn district attorney's office and also as a federal prosecutor based in Central Islip for more than a decade.

He said he plans to bring a ""tough on crime"" approach to prosecuting alleged gang members and others accused of committing violent crimes or selling drugs like fentanyl a highly addictive and sometimes lethal opioid.

""When I talk about being tough on crime … I'm talking about those individuals or individuals who are profiting handsomely from selling drugs to the community"" Tierney said. ""So I'm going to be very strict and very tough on those individuals.""

Tierney left the Brooklyn district attorney's office in February to become the chief counsel for compliance and enforcement at Suffolk County Off Track Betting Corp. He needed to be Suffolk-based in order to run for the county's top law enforcement job.

As a prosecutor he has gotten an up-close look at political corruption on Long Island.

Tierney won a conviction in 2016 against Suffolk Conservative Party leader Edward Walsh who was sentenced to two years in prison for illegally pocketing more than $200000 in pay he collected in the sheriff’s department while he was actually golfing gambling or politicking.

Tierney was also part of a team of federal prosecutors who in 2018 tried a corruption case against former Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano his wife Linda Mangano and former Oyster Bay Town Supervisor John Venditto.

Venditto was acquitted and a mistrial was declared in the Manganos’ cases after the jury deadlocked. The Manganos were retried in March 2019 and were convicted by a team of prosecutors that didn't include Tierney.

The panel found Edward Mangano 56 guilty of conspiracy to commit federal program bribery federal program bribery conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud honest services wire fraud and conspiracy to obstruct justice. Jurors found Linda Mangano also 56 guilty of conspiracy to obstruct justice obstruction of justice and two counts of lying to the FBI. They are awaiting sentencing.

In a separate corruption case in Suffolk Tierney's brother-in-law former Suffolk Police Det. Kenneth Bombace testified with immunity at the obstruction trial of former Suffolk District Attorney Thomas Spota and top aide Christopher McPartland that he was one of the detectives along with ex-Suffolk Police Chief James Burke who beat a handcuffed prisoner inside a police precinct in December 2012.

Spota and McPartland were both convicted of conspiracy obstruction of justice witness tampering and acting as accessories to the deprivation of prisoner Christopher Loeb’s civil rights. They began serving 5-year prison sentences this month for their roles in orchestrating the cover-up of Burke's prisoner beating. Burke who pleaded guilty to depriving a person of civil rights and conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice for beating Loeb served most of a 46-month prison sentence.

Tierney was not involved in the Spota and McPartland prosecutions. Asked about Bombace's role Tierney said: ""That's my brother-in-law and I have a great relationship with him. I never had a professional relationship with him.""

Tierney has also prosecuted scores of MS-13 murder cases including the 2014 conviction of alleged MS-13 gang member Adalberto Guzman who was found guilty in the February 2010 killings of Vanessa Argueta and her 2-year-old son Diego Torres.

Tierney's education

A graduate of St. Anthony's High School in South Huntington Tierney was recruited by Brown University in Providence Rhode Island to play football. A knee injury during his freshman year sidetracked the running back’s college career though he resumed playing in his junior and senior years.

After graduating from Brown in 1988 he worked as a paralegal for a year before entering law school at St. John's University in Queens. His grandfather and namesake was a lawyer and a judge in Queens.

Tierney — who with his wife Erica has four children — began his career in the Suffolk district attorney’s office under former District Attorney James Catterson in 1992 and left after seven years to work for the law firm Shaub Ahmuty Citrin & Spratt LLP in New Hyde Park. He returned to the Suffolk district attorney’s office in 2002 when Spota unseated Catterson.

He left that job in 2008 and went to the U.S. attorney's office where he worked as assistant United States attorney until 2019.

He then returned to the state system as an executive assistant district attorney to Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez a Democrat.

Randi Chavis the now-retired staff attorney-in-charge of the Central Islip office of the Federal Defenders of New York an independent nonprofit battled Tierney as a defense attorney for defendants too poor to hire their own counsel.

""It's fair to say that we certainly didn't see eye to eye on the issues in the cases or the appropriate outcomes but Ray was always respectful fair. Integrity he had plenty of it.""

Among Tierney's law school classmates was Richard Donoghue who served as the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District in Brooklyn for about two years under former President Donald Trump.

Tierney's desire to be a prosecutor dates to law school Donoghue said. The two reconnected when Tierney was a prosecutor in the Suffolk district attorney's office and called Donoghue's office to ask about coordinating on a child sexual abuse case.

""He came over with some detectives and laid out a case and as soon as I looked at it I said 'we'll take it'"" Donoghue said. ""I'm sure people in the DA's office were not encouraged to walk their cases over to the U.S. attorney's office. So I think he stuck his neck out in doing that.""

The defendant was convicted of sexually abusing minors and possessing child pornography and was sentenced to 30 years in prison.

Clashing with former bosses

Working on child abuse and domestic violence cases under Spota Tierney recalled clashing with his bosses.

""Obedience was weighed more heavily"" Tierney said. ""I would stick to my guns and that was not really appreciated.""

Tierney later working in the Public Corruption Bureau under McPartland said the case of then-Ocean Beach acting Police Chief George Hesse accused of police brutality was ""my demise.""

""Chris [McPartland] and I had a disagreement and he said I was insubordinate and he wanted me to be fired"" Tierney said.

Tierney kept his job but he was reassigned to rackets before leaving months later in 2008 to work as a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office.

""I acted contrite and I acted sorry because I didn't want to be fired"" he said.

Heading into the election

Tierney said his 15 percentage point victory in November over incumbent one-term District Attorney Timothy Sini — a former federal prosecutor and Suffolk police commissioner — didn't surprise him.

Running on both the Republican and Conservative lines Tierney said he felt the pulse of a community concerned about a perception of escalating crime and angry with the new limits on bail.

Sini a Democrat raised nearly $2 million for his campaign and had the backing of the powerful Suffolk County Police Benevolent Association which typically more closely aligns with Republican candidates.

Tierney's campaign website displayed photos of him with prominent Republicans like former Vice President Mike Pence and ex-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Tierney said his vows to push for overturning bail reform and his self-described title as a ""political neophyte"" appealed to voters.

Jesse Garcia chairman of the Suffolk Republican Party said he recruited Tierney to run after hearing his name from ex-judges and lawyers.

""He had prosecuted everything from drug cartels to gangs murderers and political corruption; he had the full gamut"" Garcia said.

Suffolk County Legis. Robert Trotta a Republican and former police detective and an outspoken critic of the police union leaders has known Tierney since they were kids.

""I've known him as being honest with integrity a great prosecutor who's honest and isn't political"" Trotta said.

The office priorities

Tierney said despite assertions during the campaign that he would scrap Sini's Conviction Integrity Bureau which reviews claims of innocence and prosecutorial misconduct in earlier convictions he's keeping it making it stronger and ""more efficient in protecting those wrongly convicted.""

The unsolved murders of 10 people mostly young women who were sex workers known collectively as the Gilgo Beach killings is a case that Tierney is eager to take on.

""It's an absolute priority"" Tierney said. ""I don't think you can come to the case with any preconceived ideas because then you're sort of limiting yourself. … Nothing is unsolvable.""

Tierney said he wants to provide more updates to the victims' families some of whom according to Tierney have felt frustrated by a lack of information from authorities.

But he insisted he'll invest much of his energy on the bail issue acknowledging that any changes to the state's cashless bail system will have to come from the State Legislature.

Tierney said he'll use his post as district attorney to lobby aggressively for changes to the law including for judges to have more discretion over bail.

""You can reform any system and should continually strive to reform systems"" he said. ""But I think when it comes to drivers of violence you have to first and foremost protect society."""

It really bothers me that while Chula Vista residents deal with no trash service and dedicated essential workers picket in the rain and cold our city representatives are checked out for the holidays.

As a public health crisis looms on the streets of Chula Vista our elected representatives are sitting idle at a moment when their work could really be meaningful. Instead there is silence and inaction.

The city of Chula Vista represented by the mayor and council have a contractual arrangement with Republic Services. They could if they were so inclined end this strike have our trash picked up and respect the hard and dedicated work our sanitation workers do every day.

Over the last few days I’ve visited the picket line. I’ve met many of the men who come by every week and pick up our trash. They are a hard working group.

Luis Garcia was a particular standout among the group. He’s been with Republic Services for 40 years and he makes just above $50000 a year. This is back-breaking work he does day after day.

They deserve to do better and the City Council which proclaims to support working men and women needs to get involved.

At the same time residents and businesses need to have the trash picked up. This is a basic service local elected officials are responsible for ensuring.

I call on the Mayor and City Council to call a special meeting and formulate a strategy for ending this needless disruption.

Rudy Ramirez is a candidate for mayor of Chula Vista.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnM4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvc2FuLWRpZWdvLXNhbml0YXRpb24td29ya2Vycy1zdHJpa2UtZHVtcHN0ZXItdHJhc2gtbm90LXBpY2tlZC11cC81MDktZDU1NzljYWUtY2RmNy00Y2VkLTgxNTMtMjdjNDQ3N2FjMTFi0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,San Diego sanitation workers strike for more than a week piles of dumpster trash yet to be picked up,"More than 250 Republic Services sanitation workers have been on strike for more than week asking for safer work conditions higher pay and improved trash trucks.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY Calif. — Sunday marked the day after Christmas which meant more trash from all the unwrapped gifts.

""By next week that pile will be a lot bigger"" said Rob Martau while pointing at an overflowing dumpster near his home in Bankers Hill.

More than 250 Republic Services sanitation workers and members of Teamsters Local 542 in San Diego walked off the job and have been on strike for more than a week. They started rallying at 4 a.m. the morning after Christmas and continued all afternoon Sunday.

They say they want safer work conditions higher pay and improved trash trucks.

""We have the fifth most dangerous job in the country and to be doing [it] with poor safety vehicles is not good. The trucks are in poor condition"" said Dohney Castillo a driver for Republic Services.

So what will it take for them to come to an agreement?

""A fair contract will provide a dignified wage and pension and contribution and dignity and respect for the job they do"" said Secretary of Treasury for Teamster 542 Jamie Vasquez.

Republic Services sent out a message to customers for the week of December 27 with updates on the delays and other options due to the unanticipated work stoppage.

For Chula Vista residents there will be trash-only services during the December 27 week planned for your regular service day.

Customers can self-haul to the Otay or Sycamore landfill free of charge and will include Christmas tree disposal this week as well. Landfill hours are 7 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. daily. The landfill will close at 3 p.m. on December 31 New Year’s Eve. Customers will be asked to present their Republic account invoice at the landfill for free disposal.

Republic Services provided News 8 with the following statement:

Trash and recycling service has been temporarily delayed due to an unanticipated work stoppage at Republic Services. The company is in contract negotiations with a union representing some of its employees in San Diego County. Those employees are engaged in a temporary work stoppage at Republic’s Chula Vista Newton Armour Street and Claremont Mesa locations. Eastgate customers are not impacted at this time. Because of this Republic is experiencing significant delays in collection service but is working to resolve this situation as soon as possible. Residents and businesses are asked to leave containers out and available for collection and they will be serviced as soon as this weekend. We apologize for the inconvenience and are doing everything we can to resolve the temporary situation. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Until the situation is resolved it can be a smelly situation in local neighborhoods.

""It's pretty gross. I've been taking my friend's dog on walks and it's pretty gross"" said visitor Martha Henderson.

""Unfortunately after Christmas trash piles up and unfortunately we can't do our job as sanitation workers. What is already overflowed plus holiday trash that is being added to that we want to pick it up believe us it's what we do. We can't do that if we don’t have a fair contract to work on that backs what we do"" said Castillo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vaWRhaG9uZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL21lcmlkaWFuLXJlc2lkZW50cy1jYW4tcHV0LW91dC11bmxpbWl0ZWQtdHJhc2gtYW5kLXJlY3ljbGluZy10aGlzLXdlZWvSAWtodHRwczovL2lkYWhvbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbWVyaWRpYW4tcmVzaWRlbnRzLWNhbi1wdXQtb3V0LXVubGltaXRlZC10cmFzaC1hbmQtcmVjeWNsaW5nLXRoaXMtd2Vlaw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meridian residents can put out unlimited trash and recycling this week,"The City of Meridian is letting residents put out unlimited trash and recycling on your regular service day this week.

For best results follow these city guidelines:

Recycling will take place on your normal pickup week ( orange bags not eligible)

All unlimited trash and recycling must be contained or bundled in separate receptacles ( 4 feet and 30-pound limit)

Bulk items and non-freon appliances will be collected for free if scheduled before pick up days

Tires electronics liquids and household hazardous waste are not accepted

Freon appliances can still be picked up if scheduled later but will be the full cost: The city recommends scheduling your pickups with Republic Services at least 48 hours before your normal pick-up day- (208) 345-1265.

Tight ends coach Ron Middleton will handle Saleh's duties on Sunday. Middleton a longtime NFL and college assistant who previously worked with Saleh has been running the Jets' practices since Saleh tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday morning.

Saleh said Friday that he was feeling ""good"" and hopeful that he would test negative on Friday and Saturday allowing him to clear the league's protocols. But he admitted that the team was ""operating"" as if he would not be coaching the game.

The Jets still had 16 players including four from the practice squad on the reserve/COVID-19 list after 4 p.m. Saturday making them ineligible to play Sunday. That means the Jets will be without several key contributors including six starters because of COVID: left guard Alijah Vera Tucker right guard Laurent Duvernay-Tardif defensive end John Franklin-Myers defensive tackle Folorunso Fatukasi slot cornerback Michael Carter II and safety Ashtyn Davis.

Wide receiver Elijah Moore and tight end Ryan Griffin are also key players on the COVID list but both were moved there from injured reserve and wouldn't have played anyway.

The Jets are also likely to be without wide receiver Jamison Crowder (calf) who didn't practice this week and was listed as ""doubtful"" on the team's final injury report. The Jets also announced that quarterback coach Rob Calabrese will not coach Sunday because of COVID protocols and senior offensive assistant Matt Cavanaugh would cover his responsibilities.

Bottom line: rookie quarterback Zach Wilson faces a huge challenge without his head coach on the sideline and likely playing without his top three receivers both of his starting guards and his top tight end target.

It’s hard but it isn’t hard"" Middleton said when asked about the uncertainty caused by their COVID issues this week. ""You can only control the things you can control and you have no control over who’s going to pop or who you’re going to have. You just have to work the ones that you have and prepare with the ones that you have. Tomorrow isn’t promised to you. Live for the day and take advantage of it of the opportunity and situation that you’re in right then.""

Middleton said Friday that he had been mentally preparing to coach the game since Saleh notified the staff of his positive test about 45 minutes before the team took the field for its walkthrough on Wednesday.

Saleh chose Middleton because of his experience and their past relationship — Middleton and Saleh were together with the Jaguars for three seasons when Saleh was the linebackers coach there from 2014-16.

Middleton said that the plan was for him and Saleh to have an ""extensive"" conversation Saturday about how he'd be handling game-management situations like potential challenges and fourth-down go no-go calls. Middleton said he's monitored the in-game communication between Saleh and Matt Burke the Jets' game management coach. But he didn't reveal any details about the process because he had yet to have to conversation with Saleh.

This will be Middleton's first time acting as a head coach during a game — he said earlier this week that his closest prior experience was running a practice at Duke where he was an associate head coach.

The circumstances are strange and less than ideal but the 56-year-old said that he eager for the opportunity to coach if Saleh couldn't return.

""Very much so looking forward to it"" Middleton said. "" You know earlier in my career that [being a head coach] was the goal. And as you age your goals change take different paths and what not. But yeah I’ve always wanted to be a head coach and I just appreciate Robert giving me this opportunity to get a taste of it. It’s been great.""

Middleton smiled when he was asked if he planned to mark the occasion with a fiery pre-game speech Sunday.

""I don’t know"" Middleton said. ""I think I’m a pretty emotional person. I’m very passionate about football. I usually just let it happen so I don’t have anything planned. ... I’m just going to let it happen.""

During his interview with Josh Martinez Rollins talked about getting hooked by the main event of WrestleMania VI and his favorite memories of New York. You can see highlights below (per Wrestling Inc):

On the match that turned him into a wrestling fan: “I would say Hulk Hogan vs. Ultimate Warrior at WrestleMania 6. That’s probably the one for me that got me like stuck stuck. I was a fan a little bit before that but that was the one. I have the image of the video cassette tape burned into my brain of WrestleMania 6. So that would be the one where I was like ‘yeah this is it for me.’”

On his best memories in New York: “There’s a few obviously that come to mine. Maybe we will go chronologically here in reverse. The Edge match at the Garden the last time we were there was a really special one to me. I mean I know it was a somber ending. But it was a really fun atmosphere and a cool opportunity to have. We don’t do television tapings there that often anymore so that was really really fun for us.

“Then you go back to Barclays and The Shield’s first match against Team Hell No and Ryback which was pretty special for all of us and got our careers in the mainstream kicked off in the right way. Then winning the Ring Of Honor World Championship in the Hammerstein Ballroom was about as special as it gets” he said. “I think that one might have been actually the Manhattan Center to be honest when I won it. But either way those are three off the top of my head that are defining moments of my career.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyZXN0bGluZ2luYy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEyL3NldmVyYWwtbWF0Y2hlcy1jYW5jZWxlZC1mb3ItdG9uaWdodHMtd3dlLW1zZy1ldmVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Several Matches Canceled For Tonight's WWE MSG Event,"Several Matches Canceled For Tonight’s WWE MSG Event

PWInsider was told that WWE is currently working out alternative plans for MSG that include WWE Hall of Famer Edge wrestling.

As reported earlier Tommaso Ciampa is set to defend the WWE NXT Championship against Pete Dunne at MSG. The match was reportedly already planned to be added to the WWE Live Holiday Tour events for this week for the RAW-branded shows.

Tonight's event in Tampa is also expected to see changes to its card. The matches were Drew McIntyre and The New Day vs. Roman Reigns and The Usos and Charlotte Flair vs. Sasha Banks in a Street Fight for the SmackDown Women's title.

The changes to the Holiday Tours are reportedly due to the recent COVID-19 outbreak in WWE. It was noted that the RAW brand had been dealing with several positive cases.

RCL,Royal Caribbean Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vZ2NhcHRhaW4uY29tL29keXNzZXktc2Vhcy1jb3ZpZC1vdXRicmVhay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Odyssey Of The Seas Skips Planned Stops On Covid Outbreak,"By Jill R. Shah (Bloomberg) Royal Caribbean Cruises diverted a ship from planned stops in Curacao and Aruba after cases of Covid-19 broke out on board the second such report in less than a week.

The Odyssey of the Seas has 55 confirmed positive cases among guests and crew members amounting to 1.1% of the total number of people on board the cruise company said Thursday. All of the cases involve fully vaccinated people who reported no symptoms or mild symptoms.

The company has also identified close contacts and placed them in quarantine before testing. The ship sailed with 95% of the people on board fully vaccinated. On Dec. 19 another Royal Caribbean ship arrived in Miami after an outbreak.

“The decision was made together with the islands out of an abundance of caution” Lyan Sierra-Caro a company spokeswoman said in the statement.

The fast-spreading omicron variant is complicating the cruise industry’s attempt to recover from last year’s shutdowns. As the pandemic spread in early 2020 some countries refused to let exposed passengers disembark at ports. Competitor Carnival Corp. this week predicted a return to profit in the second half of 2022.

Odyssey of the Seas has no more scheduled ports of call and will have “sea days” until its scheduled return on Dec. 26 to Fort Lauderdale Sierra-Caro said.

Shares of Miami-based Royal Caribbean fell less than 1% to $79.02 at 11:31 a.m. in New York. The stock was up 6.4% this year through Wednesday’s close.

Royal Caribbean requires pre-cruise testing for all guests weekly testing of all crew members and vaccinations for all crew and guests age 12 and older among other safety measures the company said.

© 2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvMjAyMS8xMi8yNS9jaHJpc3RtYXMtY3J1aXNlcy1jb3ZpZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruise ships confirm outbreaks as omicron spreads and coronavirus upends travel plans,"Ashley Peterson had a different mental image of her Christmas break than what actually transpired: The 34-year-old thought she would finally visit the Caribbean reef-lined island of Bonaire the 99th destination in her quest to travel to at least 100 countries. Instead her cruise ship the Carnival Freedom sailed past its destination Wednesday after a port turned away the boat because of coronavirus infections onboard. At least six sailings on Royal Caribbean Holland America Carnival and others last week were altered by coronavirus outbreaks as cruise ships prepared for pre-pandemic levels before sailings were paused. Although vessels that have resumed cruising have beefed up coronavirus precautions — requiring vaccinations and testing passengers — the wave of new infections fueled by the quickly proliferating omicron variant has knocked the devastated industry and alarmed cruisers.

“We’re sailing on a petri dish” Peterson said. “I feel like I just spent my past week at a superspreader event.”

Carnival did not respond to a question from The Washington Post about how many people have tested positive on the ship that was denied entry to Bonaire and Aruba but it said “a small number of people infected aboard the Freedom ship have been isolated from other passengers and crew.” The ship which ported in Miami on Sunday for another sailing had 2497 passengers and 1112 crew members on board.

The cruise company said it is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health authorities at its destinations to determine where its boats can travel and seek alternative destinations.

“The rapid spread of the Omicron Variant may shape how some destination authorities view even a small number of cases even when they are being managed with our vigorous protocols” according to the company’s statement. “Some destinations have limited medical resources and are focused on managing their own local response to the variant.”

The ship is among dozens under investigation or being monitored by the CDC.

Some cruise companies have said they will alter rules in response to the rise in cases. Royal Caribbean announced it will not be accepting new bookings until Jan. 10 after dozens of people tested positive on Royal Caribbean’s Odyssey of the Seas and Symphony of the Seas based in Florida. The ships have experienced a surge in cases over the past week at a greater average rate than the United States overall. The Odyssey of the Seas turned away from Curaçao and Aruba returned to Fort Lauderdale Fla. on Sunday.

Peterson and four other Carnival Freedom passengers who spoke to The Washington Post spent much of their Christmastime avoiding public areas of their ship unsure of how many people have tested positive or unwittingly spread the virus. One passenger from a recent voyage on the same ship — who isolated in a hotel in Miami because he tested positive the day after the cruise — told The Post that his six-day Caribbean vacation has become a month-long ordeal because he cannot travel home to Canada.

Sitting in her stateroom on Christmas Day Peterson paused to listen to a ship-wide announcement wondering whether it would answer the questions she has about the infections onboard her ship.

“Oh they’re just talking about the weather” she said. “They come on every day; you think they’re going to tell us something about covid and it’s ‘We’re passing by this island and the weather is 82 degrees.’ ”

Cruises which for some can be idyllic sojourns have borne a nightmarish side of the pandemic beginning when people on ships at the start of the pandemic spent days at sea when port after port denied them permission to dock.

As the pandemic approaches its third year cruises are embarking with precautions.

The mitigation measures in place aboard Holland America Line’s ship the Koningsdam were “as good as it gets” according to Paulette York who was a passenger on the voyage that left San Diego for Mexico on Dec. 19. However after 21 crew members tested positive the boat was turned away from Mexico’s Puerto Vallarta.

York of La Quinta Calif. said that passengers had complied with mask requirements and tested negative and she expressed frustration that port authorities did not allow the ship in. Still the retiree said she enjoyed other parts of the cruise visiting Cabo San Lucas and Mazatlán and watching a pod of dolphins.

“Holland America is doing everything to keep us all safe” York wrote in a message Saturday the day before the ship returned to San Diego.

Travel vlogger Austin Hamawy said he expects cruises to be better prepared for a coronavirus resurgence after months of preparation.

Boarding the MSC Seashore which reported 28 cases among 4714 guests and crew Hamawy noticed people were standing close to one another for long periods. He recorded a TikTok video to document the crowd gathering at the ship’s public areas.

“The elevators are full the Jacuzzis are full the swimming pools are full the theaters are full the dining rooms are full” he said in an interview. “Everywhere you go there’s a lot of people. And it’s very difficult to avoid that on a cruise ship.”

The company said the MSC Seashore was not anywhere near capacity during her previous cruises. “We had a total of 4714 guests and crew members on board compared with a maximum total capacity of 7280 persons” the company said in a statement.

Two days after the boat disembarked Thursday Hamawy said he felt some symptoms of covid-19: a sore throat and a high temperature. On Christmas he quarantined at home in Fort Lauderdale.

“We have an extended family and we’re all planning a big celebration and that came to a grinding halt” he said.

Canadian resident Brian Curtis who disembarked the Carnival Freedom the same day Peterson boarded in Miami also did not make it to a family Christmas gathering. The day after getting off the ship he tested positive extending the trip with his wife and 18-month-old daughter two weeks more than they had planned. The 34-year-old will end up paying an additional $3000 to $4000 to wait out his family’s isolation in Miami he said.

Curtis canceled his next scheduled cruise in January saying he wants masking and hand-washing to improve on ships before he cruises again.

“We thought it would be safe by now but obviously it’s not where it needs to be” he said. “I wouldn’t want to travel on a cruise anytime soon.”

The infections on Curtis’s trip including the one he discovered after the voyage ended were not disclosed to passengers on the ship’s next trip.

Carnival Freedom passenger Angie Jones 39 said that if she had known about the cases from that previous voyage — Curtis’s trip — she would have canceled.

Time on the ship with her husband her children and her sister’s family has mostly been confined to their rooms since news of the outbreak that prevented the ship from visiting Bonaire and Aruba. She said they have stopped going to the theater for performances to avoid crowds — though she said there were fewer shows since the outbreak.

“Just the fear of the unknown also has ruined our Christmas cruise in so many ways” Jones wrote in a message.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvdXMtbW9uaXRvcmluZy1jb3ZpZC1oaXQtaG9saWRheS1jcnVpc2Utc2hpcHMvNjM3MDk1Ni5odG1s0gFVaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3VzLW1vbml0b3JpbmctY292aWQtaGl0LWhvbGlkYXktY3J1aXNlLXNoaXBzLzYzNzA5NTYuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Monitoring COVID-Hit Holiday Cruise Ships,"U.S. authorities on Sunday were monitoring dozens of cruise ships hit by COVID-19 cases while sailing in the country's waters with several of them reportedly denied port in the Caribbean.

Over 60 vessels were under observation after ""reported cases of COVID-19 have met the threshold for CDC investigation"" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

The Washington Post reported that several cruise liners were denied port at their scheduled destinations.

One of them the Carnival Freedom was turned away from the Caribbean island of Bonaire the Post reported.

""We're sailing on a petri dish"" said Ashley Peterson a 34-year-old passenger on board cited by the Post. ""I feel like I just spent my past week at a superspreader event.""

In a statement to AFP Carnival confirmed that ""a small number on board were isolated due to a positive COVID test.""

""The rapid spread of the omicron variant may shape how some destination authorities with limited medical resources may view even a small number of cases even when they are being managed with our vigorous protocols"" the company said without providing further details.

The Carnival Freedom arrived in Miami Sunday morning debarked all guests and ""will depart on its next voyage as planned"" the company said adding if it was denied entry to a certain port it would work ""to find an alternative destination.""

It added the CDC was ""fully informed and supportive of our protocols and operational plans.""

Earlier this week 55 people tested positive for COVID-19 aboard a Royal Caribbean International cruise the company said.

The infections spread among passengers and crew members on the ""Odyssey of the Seas"" despite 95% of the people on board being vaccinated against the coronavirus according to Royal Caribbean.

The ship did not dock at the Caribbean islands of Curacao and Aruba the last scheduled stops on its eight-day voyage out of precaution.

It returned to port at Fort Lauderdale Florida on Sunday.",,,,,,

Please enter a valid email address.

Two generations of boxing are coming face-to-face in Arlington Texas in just about two months and neither Mike Tyson nor Jake Paul Is hiding their age.

Tyson 57 and Paul 27 began their press tour for their much-anticipated fight on Monday at the legendary Apollo Theater in Harlem New York. And despite just being miles from where Tyson grew up the crowd seemed pretty split between the two.

The July 20 bout will mark Tyson’s first fight in over four years when he fought Roy Jones Jr. in an exhibition (Paul was on that undercard against Nate Robinson). It will be a sanctioned professional fight which Tyson hasn’t participated in since June 11 2005 against Kevin McBride.

Formerly known as the ""Baddest Man on the Planet"" Tyson has been posting clips of his training and make no mistake his power is still there.

But he’s no spring chicken.

Of course there are doubts whether at his age he can last the eight rounds each of which will be two minutes.

DEONTAY WILDER SCARED FOR MIKE TYSON'S WELL-BEING IN JAKE PAUL FIGHT: HE'S TOO OLD FOR THIS'

Once a man who exuded more confidence than anyone Tyson obviously knows that Father Time is undefeated and he was brutally honest about how he feels physically.

""My body is s--- right now"" he admitted on Monday. ""I’m really sore.""

That confidence Tyson once had Paul has it all if not more.

The YouTuber-turned-boxer has made the sport the most popular it has been since Tyson’s heyday. He’s done it in a much different way but it’s not hyperbole when one says this may be the biggest fight in modern history.

It’s almost ironic that Paul is going from boxers hardly anyone ever heard of in his last two fights (Andre August and Ryan Bourland each of whom were first-round knockouts) to arguably the best ever.

So when a fan asked Paul if he could ""take a hit"" from Tyson that confidence was on full display.

""They call him Iron Mike Tyson but I’m Titanium Jake Paul.""

Prior he said ""I'm going to show the world that I can outbox Mike Tyson prove everyone wrong and show that I will be the one doing the killing.""

Despite how his body feels though Tyson gave Paul a fair warning.

""Once he’s in that ring"" Tyson said ""he has to fight like his life depends on it because it will be.""

Paul is 9-1 in his career with his lone loss being via decision to Tommy Fury.

Duke University/Instagram Jerry Seinfeld gives the commencement address at Duke University on May 12 2024

Jerry Seinfeld has some apologies to offer nearly two decades after the release of Bee Movie.

On Sunday May 12 the Seinfeld alum 70 gave a commencement address to the graduating seniors at Duke University in Durham North Carolina — where his son Julian currently attends and his daughter Sascha previously graduated from.

During his speech the comedian took time to reflect on his 2007 animated film Bee Movie — specifically one controversial element of the storyline.

""I made a cartoon movie about bees you may have watched as a child"" Seinfeld said in a video captured by an attendee and shared on TikTok.

""If any of you felt slightly uncomfortable about the sexual undertones in the relationship between Barry B. Benson and Vanessa the florist who saves his life I would like to apologize for that now"" he continued earning laughs from the crowd. ""I may not have calibrated that perfectly.""

Fans of the DreamWorks kids' movie have previously made long-running jokes about the romantic tension between Seinfeld's character in the film Barry (a bee) and Renée Zellweger's character Vanessa (a human). Back in October 2021 Seinfeld addressed the same issue during an appearance on The Tonight Show apologizing once again for the innuendo.

""I apologize for what seems to be a certain uncomfortable subtle sexual aspect of the Bee Movie"" he said at the time. ""[It] really was not intentional but after it came out I realized this is really not appropriate for children. Because the bee seems to have a thing for the girl and we don’t really want to pursue that as an idea in children’s entertainment.""

Seinfeld's commencement speech at Duke also drew public attention when anti-war protesters walked out of the ceremony and booed from the audience when the TV star took the podium according to NBC News and CBS News.

Seinfeld has been making a slew of public appearances in recent weeks in support of his newest movie Unfrosted which marks his feature-film directorial debut. Speaking with PEOPLE at the premiere of the movie on April 30 Seinfeld opened up about taking on the role of director for the first time in his career.

""You don't want to think about that this is a really big important job. Like the pilot never wants to come on the PA system and go 'I'm going to try and get this plane in the air.' You have to be confident"" he said.

The Covid-19 pandemic is far from over. But life in many ways has returned to something resembling normal for many. That’s in large part because there are now multiple coronavirus vaccines including one from Pfizer.

And that’s one of the main reasons CNN Business has named Pfizer (PFE) CEO Albert Bourla as the CEO of the year. Bourla joins previous winners Marc Benioff of Salesforce (CRM) Target (TGT) CEO Brian Cornell and Chipotle’s (CMG) Brian Niccol.

CNN Business considered several other influential CEOs for this year’s honor including Lisa Su of AMD (AMD) Ford’s (F) Jim Farley Marvin Ellison of Lowe’s (LOW) David Solomon of Goldman Sachs (GS) Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Sundar Pichai and yes Time Person of the Year Elon Musk of Tesla (TSLA)/SpaceX.

But Bourla was our choice for all that Pfizer has done in a year where Covid vaccines went mainstream (vaccine was even named word of the year by Merriam-Webster) and helped stabilize America’s economy — and the world’s for that matter.

“Pfizer did a lot of good [for] humanity and we are very very proud of it” Bourla said in an interview with CNN Business. “Not only were we able to save so many lives … but we are enjoying high levels of corporate reputation right now. People like us.”

Hoping to get Covid pill approved in early 2022

Pfizer isn’t the only company that has developed a vaccine. But the Big Pharma leader even more so than its European partner BioNTech (BNTX) or rival vaccine developer Moderna (MRNA) has become synonymous with the fight against Covid.

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first approved in the United States for 5- to 11-year old kids. But many parents of even younger children are now waiting to hear about when a vaccine might be approved for babies toddlers and pre-schoolers.

Bourla said he understands the frustration of parents who are fully vaccinated but cannot get their youngest kids protected.

“We’re working very intensively on that to make sure we can bring a solution for that” Bourla said.

“We are looking at different doses well below the doses that have been used [for adults and older kids.] We know that it will be safe. What we are looking to see is if that will protect them by giving the lower dose” he added.

But Pfizer announced after the interview with CNN Business took place that it is still evaluating whether three smaller doses of its vaccine will be effective for kids under 5 after finding two child-sized doses were not producing the expected immunity in 2- to 5-year-olds.

In addition Pfizer has developed a pill that could drastically reduce the risk of severe complications hospitalization and death for people who contract the virus. The Food and Drug Administration announced following the interview with Bourla that it had approved Pfizer’s Paxlovid oral treatment.

But Bourla stressed to CNN Business that the pill is not meant to be a substitute for the vaccine.

Ready to launch an Omicron-specific vaccine if needed

The recent rise of the Omicron variant has created concerns around the globe about the efficacy of the current vaccines. But Bourla told CNN Business that he believes its and BioNTech’s vaccine will control Omicron “quite well” especially if people have received two doses and the booster.

He conceded however that it is possible Pfizer will need to launch a new vaccine to specifically target Omicron or any other future variants. Bourla said Pfizer is already developing a shot aimed at Omicron and that he believes it could be tested and submitted to regulators for approval by March.

If Pfizer needs to produce Omicron-specific shots that will not slow the manufacturing of the existing vaccine Bourla said.

“We are aiming for a four billion [dose] annual manufacturing capacity of our current vaccine. And if we have to switch between the two the old and the new we still will make four billion. We don’t expect that we will lose any volume” he said.

Bourla also acknowledged that there are cynics who question whether Pfizer is just trying to make as much money as possible from the vaccine.

After all Pfizer said in its latest earnings release in November that it generated $13 billion in revenue from the vaccine in the third quarter and that it now expects $36 billion in revenue from it for the full year.

Bourla told CNN Business that it is charging poorer developing nations less for the vaccine than it does to wealthier countries. But cost isn’t the only challenge. He said some countries such as those in remote parts of Africa are “lacking basic infrastructure.”

“They don’t have centers to vaccinate people particularly in remote places. They do not have enough nurses” he said. “Sometimes they are lacking syringes sometimes they are lacking refrigerators so that they can store the vaccine. So this is unfortunately the situation.”

Bourla is hopeful the World Health Organization and the public-private vaccine alliance Gavi will be able to help resolve some of these issues. He also said the company is looking into drone delivery more to ensure that people get the vaccine more quickly.

“We are doing everything we can to find ourselves on the right [side] of history” he said.

Bourla also continued to stress that the vaccine is safe and that the only way for life to return to normal is for people to get the shots.

“I don’t see any reason why next year will not be a normal year if we do the simple things that are available for us” Bourla said. “If we have very big numbers of people that don’t want to do a third dose or don’t want to vaccinate at all that’s a problem.”

More to Pfizer than the Covid vaccine

Pfizer and Bourla aren’t resting on their laurels.

The company has also been at the forefront of developing many other promising blockbuster drugs such as blood thinner Eliquis breast cancer treatment Ibrance and rheumatoid arthritis pill Xeljanz as well as the Prevnar family of pneumonia vaccines.

Bourla is fully aware that for a drug company to remain successful it has to have even more promising drugs in the pipeline.

Several of Pfizer’s current top sellers are due to lose patent protection in the next few years. Once they expire that opens the door for cheaper generic drugs to compete with them.

That’s a big reason why Pfizer announced plans for a nearly $7 billion deal earlier in December to acquire Arena Pharmaceuticals (ARNA) a company developing drugs to treat immuno-inflammatory diseases. The acquisition came just one month after Pfizer completed a more than $2 billion purchase of cancer drug maker Trillium Therapeutics.

“It’s challenging to multitask” Bourla said. “But let’s not forget what else we are working on. There are so many medicines for cancer for other infectious diseases for cardiovascular diseases for other diseases.”

“We are heavily invested right now in cancer” Bourla added. “The biggest percentage of our R&D investment goes into oncology right now.”

Investors have rewarded Pfizer which ironically enough was booted from the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2020 just a few months before its vaccine was approved. Shares are up nearly 65% in 2021 — more than any Dow stock — and are not far from a record high.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vaGFici5jb20vZW4vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNTk3ODczL9IBLGh0dHBzOi8vaGFici5jb20vZW4vYW1wL3B1YmxpY2F0aW9ucy81OTc4NzMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Christmas is here and there is GNOME Desktop Environment extension to improve festive mood,"🎄 It's not snowing in my region but I really like ""true"" winter holidays ambience and I'd like it to snow at least on my laptop.

Companies are looking to Nevada for 'white gold',"Inside an empty office building in downtown Reno on a cool morning in December Richard Morrison looked out across Virginia Street which cuts across town. The office space is being developed for NeoLith an offshoot of Schlumberger a global oilfield services company.

But in Nevada it’s not oil that the company is after.

Hundreds of miles away in the Clayton Valley outside Tonopah NeoLith is looking for lithium a key ingredient needed to move away from combustible engines and toward electric vehicles. In this venture its strategic partner is Panasonic Energy of North America which operates out of the Gigafactory what the company says is “the largest lithium-ion battery factory in the world.”

Morrison who grew up in Reno and graduated from McQueen High School and then UNR moved away from Nevada to work for Schlumberger in Texas focusing mostly on oil projects. When an opportunity to work on a lithium project in his hometown arose Morrison jumped on it.

“We need domestic sources of these critical minerals in order to have a successful energy transition” he said in an interview earlier this year. “Right now we get a vast majority of lithium outside of the U.S. In fact there's only one operating commercial mine currently. It's important that we bring on new sources and Nevada has one of the best resources in the nation.”

That operating commercial mine is in Nevada. In fact it’s in Clayton Valley the same area that NeoLith is exploring. The project known as Silver Peak is operated by global lithium company Albemarle. It spans thousands of acres with prominent shiny blue ponds dotting the landscape.

Instead of blasting through the ground the project pumps brine to the playa surface and lets it evaporate capturing lithium from the leftover product. Brine mining is one of the conventional methods for extracting lithium yet globally it is often criticized for its water consumption and massive land footprint. That’s why Morrison’s company is exploring an alternative technology — Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) — aimed at decreasing the impact on land and water use.

When it comes to DLE Morrison said “it’s definitely time for a technological revolution.”

Today a variety of newcomers are looking to compete many casting their lithium projects as more environmentally friendly than conventional methods with a large footprint. It’s important because end-users are increasingly placing a greater emphasis on a sustainable supply chain.

The International Energy Agency reported in May that the energy sector is quickly becoming a major driver of demand for minerals. The agency has said that by 2040 technologies used to move away from fossil fuels including electric vehicles and large-scale batteries could drive nearly 90 percent of the demand for lithium.

Right now much of the lithium consumed in North America is mined and processed overseas. Most of our lithium supply comes from Australia Chile and China which also leads other countries in processing minerals considered critical for the energy transition. Officials from both political parties including President Joe Biden have emphasized creating a domestic supply chain to secure these minerals over the long-term.

NeoLith is not the only company setting up shop. Across western Nevada — in Reno Fernley and Carson City — companies are buying warehouse space and constructing miniature chemistry labs. They are also poaching engineers and experts from the electric-vehicle world the battery world the oil and gas industry Tesla and other mines across the West.

Nevada this year was ranked the most attractive province for mining in the world. And Nevada has ample federal public land increasing the accessibility of ore deposits. Tesla’s presence in Northern Nevada makes the state all the more compelling. Over the past few years at least two top Tesla employees have left to lead Nevada-based companies focused on lithium recovery.

That includes JB Straubel a Tesla co-founder and its former chief technology officer. After he left the company he started Redwood Materials a Nevada-based company that has its sights on creating a circular supply chain for the minerals needed in the energy transition. In Carson City Redwood has built a laboratory a warehouse and recycling processing equipment as it continues to grow. Its goal: Rather than mine recover minerals from America’s junk drawers.

“Increasing our nation’s production of batteries and their materials through domestic recycling can serve as a key enabler to improve the environmental footprint of U.S. manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries decrease cost and in turn drive up domestic adoption of electric vehicles” Straubel said in September after Redwood announced a strategic partnership with Ford Motors.

An emphasis on domestic supply

The lithium rush is not new but it has accelerated in recent years as auto manufacturers and global economies have committed to producing all-electric vehicle fleets in the coming decades. Since 2015 Nevada mining officials have tracked claims thought to be associated with lithium brine. Because of how lithium mining claims are staked they are sometimes difficult to track.

That said the Nevada Division of Minerals estimates there are about 10989 claims presumed for lithium brine. The division estimates there is a similar number of claims for hard-rock lithium mining. Hard-rock mining unlike brine mining involves digging underground to extract ore.

“It is something we have been tracking and trying to quantify” said Mike Visher the division’s administrator (the state agency plays a role in regulating certain types of lithium exploration).

The Center for Biological Diversity which monitors the impact of development on wildlife and plants created a map showing proposed lithium projects dotting much of rural Nevada.

“We’re in the midst of a ‘white gold rush’ the likes of which hasn’t been seen in 100 years — and we have no plan” said Patrick Donnelly the center’s state director and the map’s author.

Donnelly urged state officials to develop a plan with a technological and geographical analysis.

The emphasis placed on new mining for some projects has prompted significant concerns and scrutiny from environmentalists and rural communities that are no strangers to extraction. Some communities are reluctant about being on the frontlines of the global energy transition. This is especially true with efforts to permit hard-rock lithium projects and create new surface mines.

Much of this proposed mining activity would take place on the ancestral homelands of Western Shoshone Northern Paiute Southern Paiute and Washoe tribes. An estimated 79 percent of the country’s lithium reserves are within 35 miles of Native American reservations according to research conducted by MSCI a financial analysis firm that assesses sustainable investments.

Payal Sampat a director at mining watchdog Earthworks said new extraction whether in the U.S. or globally often amplifies inequities “basically imposing harm on vulnerable communities that have neither caused the climate crisis nor are likely to benefit from this transition.”

Visher said it’s important that operators approach projects with “their eyes wide open.” It’s not only about finding ore. It’s also looking at the biological cultural and social impacts of a project.

“You can choose to close your eyes to it and just focus on the commodity” he said. “But if you do that you risk losing the ability to mine because you didn’t evaluate all the issues at play.”

In the hunt for “white gold” what some call lithium because it appears as a white powder after it is processed miners have found support from the Biden administration. For years the United States has relied on extraction from other parts of the world often tying the supply chain of key products to countries with little transparency poor labor practices and a history of exploitation.

The administration has actively sought to bolster the domestic production of critical minerals in demand as part of the energy transition: lithium graphite cobalt nickel copper and rare earth elements. That means more extraction and with known deposits Nevada has emerged as one of the most ideal places for extracting and recovering some of these minerals especially lithium.

“If we zoom out to the national level and look historically mining has been offshored more and more over the last few decades” said Thea Riofrancos an assistant professor at Providence College who has studied mining across the world. “To make the policy decision that the whole supply chain for EVs starts in the U.S. — and that supply chain begins with mining — is a shift.”

It’s especially important given the federal government’s role in permitting and regulating mining across the American West. Through agencies like the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service the government controls more than 65 percent of the land in Nevada. If miners want to develop a claim they must get permits from federal land managers.

The state plays an important role too overseeing water rights bonding and reclamation when mining is complete and permits meant to ensure that water quality is not degraded by mining.

Gov. Steve Sisolak has also pushed for the development of new extraction. In October KTVN 2 News in Reno reported Sisolak as saying the state was “trying to advance the mining of lithium so that the entire country can benefit from the production of batteries and moving forward.”

The state climate strategy drafted under the Sisolak administration lays out the policy this way: “Several entities are considering investments or have already secured rights to a lithium claim in Nevada. This would certainly lead to expanded job opportunities. Of course the environmental impact of mining to the landscape and water resources must also be carefully considered.”

Different operators different approaches

Exactly how the lithium rush unfolds remains an open question. What happens when projects conflict with existing uses of land and water? What are the environmental impacts? What do the new projects mean for local communities? Are regulators prepared for an influx of permitting? And how much lithium can be recovered through recycling rather than through new mining?

A number of companies are taking different approaches to those questions and Nevada’s lithium mining industry is far from a monolithic sector in agreement on what approach to take. Each method for recovering lithium comes with its own set of benefits challenges and tradeoffs.

All those questions are set against increasing demand and high lithium prices. The end users including auto manufacturers are actively monitoring potential projects several experts said.

“It's hard to see how that supply-demand gap will close within the next few years” said Cameron Perks a lithium analyst for Benchmark Mineral Intelligence which collects data for the industry.

At the same time large corporate end-users and household automakers are emphasizing their interest in projects with strong Environmental Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) goals.

“What the projects show is that there are a variety of types of lithium deposits and extraction technologies” Riofrancos said. “None of these projects has no impacts but the impacts vary.”

Morrison with NeoLith sees promise in a process known by its industry acronym DLE. Direct lithium extraction he argued would do away with pumping large amounts of brine into ponds for solar evaporation a practice that could cause major damage to playas across the West. The evaporation method can also take several months as operators wait for the brine to evaporate.

DLE uses a closed-loop system. Brine a liquid solution containing a significant concentration of salts and minerals is removed from a groundwater aquifer then processed in real time and injected back into the aquifer with only an estimated 15 percent water lost in NeoLith’s process.

“It's a continuous process” he said “so it will happen in days versus 18 to 24 months.”

The company plans to put about $15 million into a pilot plant in Clayton Valley. Once it tests out its technology NeoLith is hoping to invest in a much larger production facility.

There is another advantage to DLE: A skills transfer. Some of the same skills required for the oil and gas industry — the evaluation of subsurface conditions — is used in DLE projects. As the energy transition continues DLE like geothermal could be an opportunity for oil engineers.

“Specifically in this space the skills transfer pretty well” he said.

DLE is still emerging and more research is being done to bolster its feasibility. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory is currently offering a prize for improving DLE projects.

Visher with the state’s division of minerals said more research is needed to support the critical minerals supply chain. He said miners can run into gaps with data collection and technology.

“It takes decades to get a breakthrough that drives the next resurgence” he said.

Other companies are eyeing DLE outside of Clayton Valley. Exploration groups are also looking in Railroad Valley which runs through Nye County and into White Pine County.

Vincent Ramirez the CEO of 3PL Operating came from an oil background working for years as an exploration geologist with Shell. With the company Ramirez is turning to lithium and he’s looking at brine deposits beneath Railroad Valley which he described in an interview as sitting on “the very bullseye of where [a] giant lake evaporated and left salt deposits.”

Ramirez has ruled out conventional brine evaporation saying he wanted to avoid “a big messy operation.” Ramierz added “That's just not going to happen for many many reasons.”

Instead 3PL Operating is looking at a closed-loop system that aims to consume only about 18 percent of the water it is asking state regulators for permission to withdraw from the aquifer beneath Railroad Valley. Ramirez said 3PL Operating is working with firms that are developing DLE and he believes there is a lot of crossover with the oil and gas industry.

“Everything I've done for this project can be easily imitated in five minutes by anybody with my background” Ramirez said. “From an oil and gas perspective I'm not particularly innovative.”

Mining experts have said that although DLE has potential as a more sustainable alternative to conventional operations (greatly reducing a project’s environmental footprint) it could take time to fully develop the technology and it might not always work depending on a brine’s chemistry.

In addition some water users have expressed serious concerns about how the DLE projects could conflict with their rights. After 3PL Operating filed an application to pump an estimated 101400 acre-feet of brine (more than 80 percent of that would be injected back into the aquifer) state wildlife managers three federal agencies and the Center for Biological Diversity filed protests with the state. They raised concerns about water quality and how the pumping could affect the natural hydrologic patterns of the groundwater basin as well as critical springs in the area.

One of the protests came from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Duckwater Indian Reservation about 25 miles from the project uses water connected to groundwater under Railroad Valley.

3PL Operating has said it will submit a water monitoring and mitigation plan.

In the case of NeoLith its competitor Albemarle the only company operating an active lithium mine in the United States filed a protest challenging its water rights. In its protest Albemarle argued that NeoLith’s applications to use water are “premature incomplete and fail to provide the necessary detail needed to fully understand the impacts of the proposed water usage.”

Nevada’s top water regulator the state engineer will ultimately rule on the protests.

As some operators are pushing the development of DLE there are several companies pushing forward with open-pit mines that resemble the types of surface extraction used for other metals such as gold and copper. Lithium is already mined this way in Australia and China. Companies developing these projects argue that they are needed in the U.S. to secure a domestic supply.

The most high-profile project Thacker Pass claims to sit on the largest known lithium deposit in the United States. The proposed mine would span roughly 5545 acres over a project area that includes about three times that amount of land. At the base of the Montana Mountains Thacker Pass sits on land that is sacred to members of the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe.

Thacker Pass Peehee mu’huh in Paiute is a place used to grow traditional foods and hold ceremonies. The area is also considered valuable sagebrush habitat for wildlife including the Greater sage grouse. Many tribal members have a deep generational connection to the area slated for new mining. The mine would sit near a 1865 massacre site where at least 31 tribal members were killed (a court ruled in November that newly-presented evidence documenting a massacre in the area did not “definitely establish that a massacre occurred” in the project area).

Under a permit from federal land managers Lithium Americas the company behind Thacker Pass plans to begin an archeological survey of the area next year.

""We are working directly with Fort McDermitt Paiute Shoshone tribal members to include them in the cultural preservation work at the site"" the company said in a statement. ""While there’s no evidence of human remains there this work will allow for discovery and protection should unexpected artifacts be found.""

The People of Red Mountain a group of tribal members opposed to the mine the Reno Sparks Indian Colony environmental groups and a local rancher have all mounted legal challenges to a federal approval for the mine which was given the green light under the Trump administration. Federal District Court Judge Miranda Du who did not issue an injunction on preliminary work has yet to rule on the merits of that case but plans to do so before mine construction begins.

(David Calvert/The Nevada Independent)

In December the People of Red Mountain and the Reno Sparks Indian Colony presented the court with a new complaint. It alleges that in permitting the project federal land managers violated a series of laws that are meant to protect sacred and culturally important sites.

“These sites hold the history culture and ancestors of the Great Basin Tribes” Arlan Melendez chairman of the Reno Sparks Indian Colony said in a statement after the new complaint was filed.

Lithium Americas is continuing to push forward with permitting even with the ongoing lawsuit. The company said it continues to work with concerned residents in the surrounding area. Two small communities Orovada and Kings River Valley sit on each side of Thacker Pass. Residents of each have expressed wariness about what a fully-functioning mine might mean.

Lithium Americas has offered to relocate a school in Orovada (next to a road where mine trucks would travel) fix an unsafe highway turnoff and commit to air and water monitoring. It also said it conducted an equipment operator training for the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe with about 15 tribal members in attendance.

“When we have newer extractive industries oftentimes communities are less receptive because the initial phase of mining development is really disruptive economically environmentally and socially” said Riofrancos who has focused her recent work on Nevada lithium projects.

Meanwhile the Biden administration’s U.S. Bureau of Land Management has continued to defend the approval of the project in court. And the White House cited Thacker Pass in a recent press release. The press release touted the administration's approval of a permit for the mine.

It’s not the only project to gain attention and pushback. Ioneer an Australian-based company is working to develop a project known as Rhyolite Ridge to mine lithium and boron near Tonopah. But the deposit sits beneath the only known habitat of Tiehm’s buckwheat a plant species that is distributed across roughly 10 acres of land in the Silver Peak Range where the mining would occur. Federal wildlife managers have proposed endangered species protections for the plant.

At the same time the project shows the struggles the Biden administration is facing in balancing competing priorities. Ioneer which is moving forward with federal permitting advanced into a final stage for a federal loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. The loan the company said this month would be worth up to $500 million. Earlier this year Ioneer also announced a $490 million deal with Sibanye-Stillwater a global mining company headquartered in South Africa.

Sampat with Earthworks said the decision by policymakers to emphasize traditional mining is obscuring other more sustainable pathways to create a supply chain that could contribute to the global effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions. She said the mining industry as a whole has a poor track record when it comes to environmental and social responsibility. And there are still loopholes on the books that allow some mining firms to avoid regulations and cleanup rules.

She encouraged policymakers to think critically in order to “remake our materials system” saying global economies could chart an energy transition without “the human and environmental costs that we are currently on a pathway of incurring as a result of destructive mining.""

One option she said is to invest more in and prioritize recycling. In April the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney prepared a report for Earthworks showing the potential for reducing demand for new lithium mining through more recycling. Other strategies might include encouraging more public transportation and reducing demand for cars.

""There is a wide range of secondary-use technologies and policies we could be employing — and we're not there” Sampat said specifically describing the approach in the United States.

A circular supply cycle?

But in a Carson City lab this year Mary Lou Lindstrom was working on just that approach.

On a Wednesday in October Lindstrom a UNR graduate who worked previously at Panasonic and with rare earth minerals stands in Redwood Materials’ small laboratory built to break down consumer products through a series of chemical processes. The lab looks similar to those built to further process mine ore. But the major difference is the starting product: Recycled goods.

Lindstrom said her job at Redwood is in many ways the “culmination of all my previous experiences coming together in the perfect format.” It brings together mining and batteries.

Among the reasons that Redwood Materials decided to locate its business in Carson City — in addition to the proximity to California and the Tesla Gigafactory — is the state’s expertise with minerals said Alexis Georgeson vice president of communications and government relations.

The idea behind the company as Straubel the former Tesla co-founder has put it is that the largest critical minerals “mine” might actually be in our landfills. In a warehouse down the street from Redwood’s lab and office the company is collecting dozens and dozens of boxes filled with consumer electronics and cathodes from lithium-ion batteries that are no longer in use.

The products run the gamut from medical equipment to old laptops all waiting to go through a series of mechanical processes before the key minerals in them can be recovered and reused.

Redwood Materials’ ultimate goal is to create a closed loop domestic supply chain. Whereas right now much of our supply chain is currently offshored to other countries Redwood wants to create a more sustainable and resilient long-term system where waste is commonly recycled. Already the company has partnered with Panasonic to recycle materials from the Gigafactory and Envision AESC which operates a battery plant in Tennessee. Amazon was an early backer.

Redwood Materials is already looking to go one step further: Battery materials manufacturing. The company plans to announce a site next year and produce enough cathode material by 2025 for roughly one million vehicles. Cathode materials are a key element of lithium-ion batteries.

The conventional wisdom in the past was that recycling was cost prohibitive compared to new mining for minerals. But with battery demand projected to soar in the coming decades recycling companies are betting they will be needed to fill projected gaps in battery materials and to meet demand for an energy transition that occurs as sustainably as possible.

Recycling is not without its impacts or limitations either. One is a logistical question: Do we have the infrastructure to get “waste” from America’s junk drawers to recycling plants? And some forms of recycling have been criticized for leaving large environmental footprints.

Miners argue that although recycling could play a role the technology is not at an advanced enough stage to make a major dent in the demand for minerals. In addition others note that there are simply not enough battery packs in existence to fill the demand for electric vehicles.

Yet the number of spent batteries is also forecast to skyrocket as electric vehicles start to come offline throughout the next decade or two. In a report this year the International Energy Agency said recycling could decrease the primary mineral supply demand by 10 percent by 2040.

Recycling’s promise experts said could depend significantly on what governments do in setting up a legal framework and regulations for a critical minerals supply chain. The European Union for instance already adopted a regulation for batteries that have reached the end of their life.

Redwood Materials is not the only company led by a former Tesla employee that has entered the recycling space in Western Nevada. American Battery Technology Company led by former Tesla engineer Ryan Melsert is also building a lithium-ion battery recycling plant in Fernley. It boasts an “advanced” hydrometallurgical process that sets it apart from other competitors.

Recycling is important Melsert said “because [of] the speed to market.” The company hopes to bring minerals back into the supply chain quickly through recycling. But American Battery Technology Company is also looking at extraction with mining claims in central Nevada. On Tuesday the company announced that it had staked an additional 122 claims near Tonopah.

Merlsert said he sees Nevada playing a key role in lithium recovery and the supply chain for batteries especially with its geologic potential and the presence of the Gigafactory nearby.

“Every time you build one of those nodes it helps nodes in other areas” Melsert said.

Policymakers appear onboard with Sisolak singling out lithium potential in his State of the State address at the beginning of the year. But questions remain as to whether the state government is prepared for an increase in activity and if there is a plan for managing the “white gold” rush.

“If government officials and industry actors have their way Nevada will be converted into a key node in this broader national plan to create a domestic EV supply chain starting with mining going through to refining battery manufacturing and then EV manufacturing” Riofrancos said.

But perhaps the most important lesson I’ve learnt in recent years is that digital transformation is not simply a tech discussion; it’s a business output discussion that will be judged solely on the value technology can provide.

Digitalisation is driving growth in companies in terms of changing their businesses changing how they work with their employees and how they address their customers and drive operations. My goal primarily is to put customers at the centre of everything and bring strategic value to them.

The Middle East has been my hyper growth region and I believe it will be the fastest growth engine for ServiceNow because of our market equation.

As a female senior leader to give back and to create a space for emerging females to take the stage is vital for me. We cannot deny that we are in a male dominated world. But being a female gives me a different prism in terms of being unique and creating a different kind of connection. When I was younger it was difficult and I did face challenges and that’s why it’s important for me to create the space and to push other females and support them. We need to create an environment that’s truly diverse which is supported by men to promote females in this technology industry.

Attracting women in tech is one of the biggest challenges. We need to create a diverse space – a flexible and hybrid working environment. Flexible working is so important when a female needs to embrace a family and a career while also pushing themselves to provide that kind of environment to everybody.

Leaders be it male or female need to push women from a young age into STEM. The tech industry needs female workers. The image of tech is not sitting behind a computer coding but to be in front of customers and partners. There is plenty of space in technology for females to come and embrace this career.

As a woman my goal is to make sure we get this message across louder than ever before. Personally I spend a lot of my time speaking about diversity in forums women forums webinars and ministries. As a company ServiceNow is supporting and creating the environment of openness making sure we value and uphold diversity. We are looking into expanding the talent pool and creating a pleasant environment of remote and hybrid work models.

In the 100-foot-long mural which sits at the entrance of the private high school in Hyattsville and is visible from Baltimore Avenue heading north to College Park Art Department Chair Vaughn Holsey retells the life story of St. John of Matha a 12th century Catholic saint. The mural which extends as high as 12 feet is lit up at night with a dramatic rotating light display.

Born to a noble family in France the saint dedicated his life to buying and freeing enslaved Christians who had been captured by raiders and later founded the Order of the Most Holy Trinity.

The Trinitarians established a monastery in Hyattsville in 1931 because of its proximity to Catholic University followed by a small high school in 1946 for young men interested in the priesthood which later expanded to DeMatha.

Working with DeMatha alums Jovanni Portillo-Holsey and Brandon Green Holsey started painting the mural in June.

The mural features John of Matha holding broken chains symbolizing freedom and a white stag which he saw in a vision and which is the school’s mascot.

The project was sponsored by Sherwin-Williams.

Text description provided by the architects. Selah House a small (2247 SF) home for a soon-to-be-retired doctor is designed with mature environmental strategies that in its next life will become part of a nature preserve. Great care was taken to locate the house in an existing clearing with a “light touch” removing very few trees. Designed for a 100-year life all decisions regarding design material and systems were optimized for an environmentally engaged home.

The program is simple - living kitchen bedroom bath with two special spaces a private garden and a writer’s loft. The house is designed for inhabitants to be intimately connected to the cycles of the day weather seasons and abundant local flora and fauna. Standing in the center of the warm maple paneled interior you are only eight feet away from the courtyard to the north and the view through the trees and across the valley to the south. When the sliding glass doors are open in the main bedroom the room becomes a sleeping screen porch in the forest. From the writer’s tower it seems as if you can touch the moon and stars brilliant in the black sky.

In designing the Selah House the architects set the project in-between witness and the environment: the house is both the frame and foil for the interaction. The design is responsive in this relationship between a visitor and the full environment of the site. The siting form location of rooms views movement of the sun through seasons the weather and the wildlife are in a dynamic conversation to elevate awareness surprise and insight. Selah is designed with mature environmental strategies that will become part of a nature preserve in its next life.

What are the biggest and best shopping malls for foreigner in South Korea?

1. Times Square Mall

Although one might think that this mall lends its name from the famed commercial intersection of Manhattan Times Square Mall has a unique and historic story of its own.

A MUM has shared her own take on a traditional Christmas dinner - and people have been left very divided over it.

Mum-of-two Amy Spilman from Derbyshire posted a photo of her “alternative” food table she made for her kids and partner yesterday.

Although it featured many of the beloved classics like a turkey and pigs-in-blankets there were some unusual extras.

Amy included a homemade cheese board crisps pickles feta stuffed peppers and mini pizzas.

Writing in the Facebook group Family Lowdown Tips & Ideas page she explained: “Am I the only one that doesn't do a Christmas Dinner?

“It always puzzles me why when everyone says Christmas is about spending time with your loved ones and how it's for the kids that everyone opts for one of their loved ones to be stuck in the kitchen near enough all day cooking a big dinner that the kids don't want to eat because they just want to play with all their new toys.

""I'll make a big roast any other day of the year but Christmas day is party food and turkey cobs (rolls or whatever you call them) and a day to enjoy with my family definitely not stuck in a hot kitchen peeling spuds!""

Many people were left split over the unusual food table.

Some said ditching a traditional roast is preferable as you get to spend more time together as a family rather than cooking in the kitchen.

One said: ""We have pizza for Christmas dinner-no complaints from kids I get to spend time with them instead of stuck in the kitchen-everyone’s a winner!""

Another added: ""I used to do the big Xmas dinner. But over the past few years I've realised our food doesn't have to be the stereotype Xmas meal.

“I make foods everyone in my family enjoys! More relaxed Christmas and everyone is happy x.""

Others said it is better to prep the Christmas meal the night before or days in advance to prevent being bogged down on the day.

One wrote: ""That’s why you prep it Xmas eve when the kids are in bed. You serve starter and pudding in paper bowls and plates so the only pots you have to wash are the same as any other toast dinner day.

“And you all muck in so it’s much quicker and you’re spending time doing it together!""

Amy told Tyla: “When people assumed I wasn’t able to cook a roast I wasn’t offended I suppose it is quite logical to assume that the reason for that is because they're not very confident when it comes to cooking.

“However I went to catering college spent three years working in kitchens and I am no chef but I cook home cooked meals for my family more or less every day.”

She also claims she was put off one year “stressful” and “chaotic” year when she had to cook a three course meal for 11 people at Christmas.

She added: “Christmas day is a chilled out day we're not working to strict time schedules we don't have to do any food prep on Christmas eve we have food available to pick at all day and the rest of the day is spent having fun opening presents and being with family which to me is much more important than sitting down to have a huge Christmas Dinner that the children don't want to eat because they want to play with all their new toys.”

Sometimes though you see resorts that are packed to the gills with people and lift lines that stretch back up the hill.

If you’re looking for amazing skiing and snowboarding without the crowds of the Front Range resorts consider these ski resorts in Southern Colorado. Most reside within the towering San Juan Mountains which are some of the steepest in the state. Whether you’re craving a little solitude or just want to find some untouched snow for first tracks these southern sleeper resorts serve it up and will have you coming back year after year.

Ski Resorts in Southern Colorado

The south part of Colorado’s Rockies provide both large ski resorts like Telluride and tiny ski areas like Chapman Hill. The former has a variety of top notch terrain perfect for anyone. The latter are best reserved for true beginners and their family members. At these small town ski areas the thrills are high but the vertical is low. If you’re looking for a lot of skiable acreage stick to the first six below.

Here’s a list of the big ski resorts in Southern Colorado:

1. Telluride Ski Resort

Telluride with little argument is the top ski resort in Southern Colorado. The vertical here is insane 4425 feet. There’s more than 2000 skiable acres and an above tree line lift-served summit elevation of 12570 ft. This means prime bowl skiing in the San Juans. Everyone will be able to find a variety of terrain in this family-friendly mountain.

There are ski slopes that ride all the way into downtown Telluride which is a gem of a ski town. A free gondola is provided to get you between downtown and the Mountain Village so you’re covered no matter where you stay. The well thought out ski slopes of Telluride are a pleasure to ride and one memory you’ll cherish for years to come.

2. Purgatory Resort

Durango’s hidden and oddly named gem Purgatory is a locals’ delight. The lift lines are short the snow quality is light and dry and the mountain has a plethora of trails to explore. There’s more than 1300 skiable acres and a 2000 foot vertical. You’ll enjoy rolling groomed runs and expansive views of the San Juans some of the most iconic mountains in Colorado.

Purgatory Resort has a fun base area with several places to eat and shop as well as sleep. The ski area is located about 30 minutes north of downtown Durango where you’ll find every amenity you could use on your mountain holiday. If you’re looking for a big fun ski resort that’ll suit a range of levels at a reasonable price consider the slopes of Purgatory.

3. Wolf Creek Ski Area

A locals’ favorite mountain you’ll still see a large amount of tourists at Wolf Creek especially from Texas New Mexico and other southern states that can drive up. It’s made up of a whopping 1600 acres of “the most snow in Colorado” with 77 different trails. Beginner enjoy a slew of rolling cruisers across the whole front side. Experts can hike up the summit in about 20 minutes to enjoy crazy cornice drops and deep powder stashes. There’s also solid tree skiing and more brief difficult terrain at the waterfalls.

The base lacks lodging at this ski area but has a big cafeteria style restaurant and bar. The prices for both food and lift tickets are affordable. The local hot springs town of Pagosa Springs is 30 minutes west 24 miles or stay on the east side of the Continental Divide in South Fork which is 5 minutes closer 20 miles.

4. Silverton Mountain

Colorado’s expert only winter playground Silverton Mountain lies deep in the San Juans. It’s high altitude riding with a lift served elevation of 12300 feet. Backcountry safety backpack is required including beacon probe and shovel.

With 400+ inches of light snow on average and the steepest runs in the state you’re in for a rewarding challenge if you’re prepared. There’s only one chair lift that accesses all double black terrain. The ski area has no amenities aside from a small base lodge. Downtown Silverton is only 15 minutes away.

5. Monarch Mountain

Tucked away in the middle on of Colorado on the side of the Continental Divide this resort is the only ski area on this list that Denver is farther from than Colorado Springs. While Breck is a shorter drive for Colorado Springs locals than Monarch the latter is much quieter while the former contends with EPIC passholders and floods of tourists. The closest town restaurants and amenities is in Poncha Springs twenty minutes east on Highway 50. Salida is the nearest real city and address of the resort. Though there is a bit of lodging on the highway between Poncha and resort.

While Monarch can’t compare in size to others it boasts a considerable 800 acres of varying terrain. Difficult runs and powder stashes can be enjoyed by hiking up to the top of Monarch Mountain. There’s a gift shop and a couple places to eat in the small base village.

6. Crested Butte Mountain Resort

Purchased by Vail Resorts in 2018 Crested Butte is an easy place to like. The mountain is wicked looking with a variety of terrain for everyone. The lift served vertical is 2775 feet which is spread across 1167 feet skiable acres.

The mountain town has a great feel to it with dozens of cool businesses in its picturesque downtown. There’s also a mountain village with a smaller set of shops and restaurants but a lot of resort owned lodging. The latter often equals discounted lodging with ski ticket deals. It’s located about 4.5 hours from Denver weather pending.

Here’s a list of the small ski areas in Southern Colorado:

7. Cranor Hill

As one of only a handful of Colorado small town run ski areas Cranor makes a great place to learn the art of skiing for cheap prices. This local Gunnison ski area got its start in the 1960s. It’s worth noting that this ski area only opens an average of 1 in 3 seasons. It relies on natural snow needing 16 inches of snow base to open. By mid-January it’s either opening or its not.

The vertical of 305 feet covering 45 acres. This is more than enough though for true beginners to work on their craft among others in the same boat. The base area has a classic lodge for selling tickets and concession food. Cranor Hill is mainly a locals’ learning hill though the family friendly ski area welcomes everyone with its charm. If you’re planning a Crested Butte ski holiday you’ll pass Gunny on the way so consider it for a morning or afternoon of affordable turns before the bigger playground at CB.

8. Chapman Hill

Chapman Hill is a locals’ winter playground right in the heart of Durango. The tiny ski hill has a surprising amount of pitch and can be quite the challenge. It’s a solid amount for young skiers and ski racers to practice.

The ski area is open December to March weather pending. When they do open they stay open for skiing and riding 7 days per week. It’s a bit of an after school mountain with weekday hours 3pm to 7:30pm and weekends 11am to 5pm. Durango’s beautiful historic district lined with shops restaurants and lodging is only a few blocks away from the resort.

9. Hesperus Ski Area

Another smaller Durango area resort is Hesperus. It’s the 3rd Durango ski area on our list so it’s clearly a great town for beginners and families looking for a wide variety of ski resorts at reasonable prices. It opens most seasons and actually offers pretty versatile terrain. There is something for everyone here to discover. It’s located about 20 minutes from town.

The vertical of 700 acres makes you put in a workout on their 160 acres. Beginners and intermediates will have a lot to explore at good prices. They have expert runs too with steeps moguls and some trees. One huge bonus to Hesperus Ski Area 80% of the skiable terrain is lit for it night skiing!

10. Lee’s Ski Hill

If you can’t make the Swiss Alps or Telluride perhaps the Switzerland of America. Ouray may seem like a sleepy winter town compared to its summer heydays but the snow brings its charms and Ouray has facilities to accommodate. Lee’s Ski Hill is one of them situated in the heart of town. However it only accommodates beginners.

One single trail down the 75 foot vertical has its bumps and surprises. One rope tow accesses all of it. Generally it opens from late December through February weather pending. If open hours are noon to 5pm on weekends and holidays as well as after school weekdays. Other Ouray attractions include hot springs ice climbing wall epic snowmobile and snowshoe trails.

11. Lake City Ski Hill

Probably the most isolated town on our list but certainly not the farthest from the front range lies Lake City. It’s the type of town you hope to stumble upon on a road trip 5 hours from Denver. Like its San Juan Mountain neighbors Silverton and Ouray (via the summer only 4×4 Alpine Loop drive) Lake City is a secluded alpine village with a cool historic district and access to wilderness of all kinds. The tiny ski area is situated just past the downtown on CO 149.

Lake City Ski Hill has a surprising 247 vertical which is small but a great learning mountain. The pitch is suitable for beginners with a few different run choices to keep it fresh. There’s not much going on in the winter attracting tourists to town except for an epic ice wall for climbing and incredible snowmobiling. There’s enough lodging shopping and restaurants to keep your holiday exciting.

12. Kendall Mountain

Silverton’s second ski area is the exact opposite of its first. Where Silverton Mountain is expert only extreme terrain Kendall Mountain is beginner only easy learning. It’s located within the town of Silverton. The expert mountain is 15 minutes drive. Maybe mom watches the kids and dad takes a guided ski day at Silverton Mtn.

The vertical is a respectable 240 acres across 35 skiable acres. The base elevation at 9300 feet might still get your lungs going though. The base lodge has a place to warm up and enjoy some concession food.

Developed on the remnants of a summer camp under the southern edge of the Palisades the secluded suburban neighborhood east of River Road has aged beautifully over the past century. Once a decidedly low-rent bungalow community the colony has become a high-end cooperative holding some of the most sought-after homes on the Hudson.

Edgewater Colony isn’t home to sprawling estates though. Its tidy homes crowd small lots that since the mid-1900s have remained unmerged due to the rules of the community.

Decidedly inconspicuous the riverside community is hidden from the main drag by forest. It's also outshone by the towering Colony Apartment House in Fort Lee. Edgewater Colony is so low key that its private roads aren’t mapped on Google Street View. Its residents like it that way said Danielle Fenimore of Foremost Management the colony’s management company.

“It’s a little hideaway” she said. ""It is pretty cool that the people on Shore Road on the cliff have an unobstructed view of the city and no one even knows they're there.""

Marked on the south end by the Caribbean House apartments and on the north by Palisades Interstate Park Edgewater Colony has a history akin to the lake communities of New Jersey’s northern Highlands. The colony transitioned from summertime resort to year-round bedroom community.

Origins as a retreat for city dwellers

In 1878 the riverside just south of Palisades became home to one of the state’s great country resort hotels the Fort Lee Park Hotel and Pavilion. Built to capitalize on a port that shuffled George Washington to New York City during the American Revolution the resort lured city dwellers each weekend. The resort's controlling company boasted its own side-wheeled steamship and the promise of picnicking performances billiards and bowling at historic Burdett’s Landing.

The revelry only lasted 20 years. In 1898 fire claimed the hotel’s majestic portside pavilion and ended the hotel's run. Traces of the once-famed octagonal structure are rumored to remain. Foundation stones were allegedly incorporated into a home on Shore Road.

Amid the ashes of the resort and under apathetic ownership a summer commune took root. It was called O’Brien’s Camps after Harry O'Brien a town councilman and the property's manager. The campground gained a new name around 1920 when retired Fort Lee police sergeant Patrick Hartnett replaced O’Brien as the new estate manager.

For about $30 a season Hartnett permitted vacationers to build makeshift shelters on the riverfront. Hartnett’s Camps gained a reputation for poor sanitary and health conditions and for inviting municipal intervention and tax appeals from the controlling estate.

Helping hand:In a giving mood for the holidays? These North Jersey shelters nonprofits could use help

The community began to take its modern shape during the construction of the George Washington Bridge when day workers built their own bungalows. Due to the establishment of Palisades Interstate Park in 1900 the colony’s homes remain the first waterfront residences south of the iconic bridge. They exist as rare single-family homes with unmarred city views.

Today some of the homes in Edgewater Colony date back decades. Others represent the latest in modern architecture. Weathered cedar shingles live alongside translucent garage doors.

“After 9/11 people moved out of the city and the colony really took off” Fenimore said. ""You have a lot of different types of homes [and] all walks of life down here. I don't believe there's anything like it.”

When it started to form in the early 1900s the colony drew locals and out-of-towners alike. Even when the borough shut its beaches in late July 1931 over fears linked to elevated pollution in the Hudson Hartnett’s Camps welcomed Edgewater residents and city dwellers The Record reported. Barges controversially docked along the shore.

Throughout the 1930s the camp association held an annual carnival at the end of each summer with swimming races a community tug-of-war and the crowning of “Miss Edgewater.” A July 1937 report in The Record said 120000 people visited Palisades Interstate Park and Hartnett’s Camps one hot summer day.

In the handful of years after Hartnett’s death in 1940 about 100 families remained on site all year according to The Record. Rumors of their eviction started in 1946 when one of the controlling landowners John Goetchius died and willed his interest in the campground to a school in New Hampshire.

While the bequest didn’t force a mass migration from the colony it did leave Morgan Goetchius as the only surviving family member with an interest in the land south of Palisades Interstate Park. The following year the Goetchius heir moved to divest.

In 1947 the estate offered the roughly 120 residents the opportunity to buy the property for $150000. Of them 94 agreed to divide the parcel into cottage-sized lots they would collectively own.

Transition to cooperative living

The following year Hartnett’s Camps became Edgewater Colony Inc. a cooperative housing company. Colonists own their homes. They maintain their “areas” by mowing lawns and maintaining their gardens. But there are no official property lines. And they don’t own the land.

The company now governed by a nine-member board of directors owns the 26 acres and is responsible for its nearly $550000 annual tax bill. Rather than control deeds the company sells shares. Since its founding the cost has been $1300 per share or lot. People can own more than one. There’s one key restriction: Homes can only occupy a single lot.

""One couple they built two homes next door (to each other)"" Fenimore said. ""They wanted to connect them by tunnel. The board said 'No way.'""

The limitation has not prevented tear-downs in the exclusive riverside community. It has however curbed the size of the million-dollar homes that sprout along its winding private streets.

There are other rules akin to co-op apartments. Tree removal requires special permission from the board. Home improvement upgrades require neighbor approval —mainly to avoid obstructing views Fenimore said. Shared maintenance fees cover trash pickup snow removal and infrastructure repairs. Divesting requires a board supermajority.

Though the colony hasn’t been interested in selling it has had prospective buyers. In 1972 Glick Corp. of New York City collectively offered the community’s then-116 homeowners $12 million a transaction denied by fewer than 10 ballots The Record reported. Anecdotally it was the old-timers who refused to move.

The payout at more than $100000 a home was appealing to many. Home prices at the time ranged from $25000 to $75000. Today homes are more in the range of $500000 to $4 million.

The company’s plan was to build a high-rise complex of 2500 riverside apartments on the colony. Unlike other properties east of River Road Edgewater Colony sits on solid rock rather than a mushy riparian (waterside) zone.

Edgewater's mayor in the early 1970s Francis Meehan spoke out against the potential for increased density citing the potential impact on infrastructure. The opposition didn’t stop Glick Corp. officials. They came back in 1974 with a $13 million offer. Six naysayers prevented the required two-thirds majority needed to sell according to The Record.

As of Sunday evening more than 1300 flights with at least one stop in the United States and over two times as many around the world had been canceled according to FlightAware which provides aviation data.

Sunday’s bleak track record followed thousands of global flight cancellations on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The cancellations threatened to disrupt travel plans at a time when many fly to spend the Christmas holiday with their families. In the United States the tradition appeared to rebound this year: Roughly two million people passed through screening checkpoints each day last week according to the Transportation Security Administration and the numbers on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day were nearly double the equivalent figures last year.

As of 1 p.m. the tracking site FlightAware.com listed 2681 flight cancellations worldwide for Saturday 948 involving flights into or out of the United States.

On Friday 2380 flights were canceled worldwide — 690 involving U.S. flights and 86 at LAX.

The scrapped flights were largely blamed on airline staffing shortages caused by the latest surge in coronavirus cases fueled by the Omicron variant. Weather issues were also causing some of the cancellations.

“We know some airline cancellations across the country are in the news. At LAX today our flights are showing over 90% on time right now with 25 cancellations out of 1028 scheduled flights” LAX tweeted at 9:23 a.m. Friday.

Five hours later the airport added: “We have seen some additional cancellations this evening so please check your flight status with your airline for the latest. Arrive early we will be busy tonight! Check parking at http://parking.flylax.com and @FlyLAXstats.”

LAX had not commented on Saturday’s cancellations as of late Christmas morning.

Five cancellations were listed Saturday at Orange County’s John Wayne Airport and none at Long Beach Airport or Hollywood Burbank Airport.

Workers at stores on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston and Harvard Avenue in Brookline sent a letter to Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson last week about their intent to unionize.

“We see unions as the best way to make Starbucks a place to have a sustainable career and a true partnership” the letter stated. “We stand firmly in our belief that a union can provide our hard-working partners the justice and equality they deserve while also enriching the company” the letter added.

Ash O’Neil a barista at Boston's Commonwealth Avenue store told Yahoo Finance Live last week that “We obviously were inspired by the baristas in Buffalo and to take initiative collective action to ensure that our voices are heard.""

They added that “We all really feel that Starbucks is a great company to work for and we just [want to] make it better by amplifying the voices of the partners on the ground.""

In the letter to Johnson workers noted that understaffing — a widespread issue amidst the service sector worker shortage — has been a concern in stores throughout the Boston area causing some store locations had to close or reduce hours earlier this year.

Boston baristas 'a bit worried'

A broad push to unionize has spread across the country and engulfed one of the world's most recognizable coffee brands. In addition to Buffalo and Boston more stores in Arizona and Seattle are seeking to organize with Starbucks Workers United a branch of the Service Employees International Union.

Ahead of the Buffalo vote Starbucks lobbied hard to keep workers from unionizing. Dozens of executives flooded the stores with their presence and held meetings trying to persuade workers to vote down the measure. Massachusetts workers are preparing for a similar campaign by Starbucks corporate.

Story continues

A regional director already sent out an email to workers in that area acknowledging their union petition and are planning ""listening sessions"" with workers in early January.

“They basically said that they're going to create a space for us to ask one-on-one questions and for us to get all the facts from them which we are a bit worried about because given what's happened in Buffalo” O’Neil said.

“We're pretty certain that they're probably just gonna be giving us a lot of stuff about how bad unions are for us” the barista said.

Kylah Clay a barista at Commonwealth Avenue store in Boston told Yahoo Finance that district and regional officials have come to the store ""multiple times"" to meet and greet with workers. With the vote coming up ""..we do expect to see them much more often now after the holidays” she added.

Three more store locations in Buffalo are still waiting for their union elections to be scheduled while three store locations tallied their votes earlier this month with one outright winning their election. The second cafe store voted down the measure while results of a third were still pending because of a challenge to the process.

Last week the union formally challenged the results at the two stores. A NLRB spokesperson said that the challenged ballots and unfair labor practices will need to be investigated and that there may be a hearing on this in the coming weeks. There’s no timeline yet on when votes from the other stores will be scheduled the agency added.

Last week Starbucks wrote a letter to all employees this week insisting that the company would ""bargain in good faith with the union that represents partners in newly-unionized Buffalo store. ""Our hope is that union representatives also come to the table with mutual good faith respect and positive intent"" they added.

“We want an opportunity to meaningfully and actively participate in our workplace. I think each store is unique and their needs are different for each Starbucks. But ultimately I think we just want that chance to voice those needs” Clay told Yahoo Finance.

“When I ask the barista to please remake my drink because it looks about three shades lighter than NC40 and she says it was already made correctly” a text overlay on the video reads.

https://www.tiktok.com/@conniecantu/video/7042509305311939845?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1

The TikToker shows her first beverage then pulls out a second drink that is a slightly deeper shade of brown. The audio accompanying the video to which she lip-syncs says “that was embarrassing I really hope you’re embarrassed.”

Some users called the video “condescending” and said it was unnecessary when all she had to do was ask for the drink to be remade.

“Embarrassing?” one commenter wrote. “IDK mistakes happen. They will gladly fix the mistake. It’s not embarrassing. Just kinda a condescending audio.”

When another user implied that they thought it was a bit ridiculous that she was having a service worker remake a drink because it wasn’t the right color she clapped back saying that it was an expensive drink and she expected it to be made correctly.

“Or imaging paying extra for changes like coconut milk bc you can’t do dairy and not only they get the order wrong you get charged for it” she wrote. “Repeatedly.”

Other commenters agreed with her saying that if she paid for a drink to be made a specific way it should be made that specific way and produce the same results every time.

“Hi I’m a barista and espresso drinks should always turn out the same color” one commenter wrote. “If the espresso messed up—not your fault. We should remake it for you.”

When another commenter agreed that something was up with the drink and it looked like the espresso had been incorrectly prepared they asked the poster to kindly let someone know. The poster said she did but was frustrated with responses she consistently received over her drinks.

“I do let them know kindly” she wrote. “It’s just frustrating when they tell me I’m wrong or act like I’m being too picky. Moooost times they remake it no problem.”

Some Starbucks Locations Are Open on Christmas Day But Check Before You Go

Starbucks which is the world’s largest coffee chain doesn’t have a standard policy about whether individual locations should stay open or remain closed on Christmas Day. It’s up to specific stores to make those decisions.

A Starbucks media relations spokesperson confirmed with Heavy via email:

Store hours vary by location and stores may occasionally adjust their hours based on business and customer needs. We recommend customers look for specific store hours using the Starbucks® app or by visiting our website store locator: Starbucks.com/store-locator. The Starbucks app continues to be the best way for customers to find a store check store hours order ahead and use contactless payment.

A few examples of Christmas Day hours for specific stores listed in the online locator tool include:

Starbucks Holiday Drinks Are Served While Supplies Last

The holiday menu is always popular at Starbucks. There isn’t a set end date for these items but it’s safe to assume they’ll be around for only a few more weeks. Individual locations sell the holiday items as long as the supplies last. The holiday drinks include:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHkxMDAuY29tL3ZpcmFsL2JhcmlzdGEtcmVtYWtlLWRyaW5rLWZvdW5kYXRpb24tc2hhZGUtYjE5ODI1OTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woman made barista remake her drink because it didn't match a foundation shade,"There are picky eaters and then there are people whose preferences and quirks are unreasonable and many feel that this TikTok user went overboard.

TikTok user @conniecantu shared a video where she slammed a Starbucks employee for making her drink a lighter color than she wanted.

“When I ask the barista to please remake my drink because it looks about three shades lighter than NC40 and she says it was already made correctly” the text overlay on the video reads.

Beauty lovers will recognize NC40 as a popular MAC foundation shade.

The TikToker is seen in the video holding one beverage before pulling out a second coffee that’s a notably darker shade of brown. The audio of the TikTok is a well-known sound on the platform that says “that was embarrassing I really hope you’re embarrassed.”

The video has since earned 523.8K views.

As it turns out and by the looks of the comments the general consensus seems to be that perhaps she should be the one that’s embarrassed.

“Embarrassing? Idk mistakes happen. They will gladly fix the mistake. It’s not embarrassing. Just kinda a condescending audio” one person wrote.

Another user took note of the reference to the foundation shade writing “nc40 isn't a standard measurement tbh. like who would know what that looks like?”

“Make it yourself then if u want it made the way you want” one user slammed.

“Coming from a Starbucks barista they made your drink right but the expresso machines probably didn’t pull the shots right. Kindly let us know” one apparent barista wrote to which the original poster responded by saying it’s a reoccurring issue “I do let them know kindly. It’s just frustrating when they tell me I’m wrong or act like I’m being too picky. Most time they remake it no problem.”

Indy100 has contacted Starbucks for comment."

SAINT MICHAEL Minn. — A former St. Michael mayor was killed after he was struck by a Wright County Sheriff's Department patrol car on Thursday night.

According to documents obtained by KARE 11 the Wright County Sheriff's Office requested help from Minnesota State Patrol to investigate a fatal crash involving a 2018 Ford Explorer from the county sheriff's department just before 8 p.m. Thursday.

The documents say the squad car was responding to calls of a medical emergency when it fatally hit 84-year-old Harry Welter in a driveway on the 400 block of Main Street in St. Michael. He was transported to the Maple Grove Emergency Room.

In a release put out by the City of St. Michael Welter is described as a longstanding public servant who spent time as both the municipality's mayor and a city council member in the '80s and '90s. The release also says he was a veteran of the Saint Michael Fire Department and served for 23 years.

""He also volunteered to clean the Great River Regional Library at the Colonial Mall for free in the early 2000s"" the city says. ""He was a true public servant and will be greatly missed by his St. Michael community.""

Wright County released a statement Monday stating the deputy in question has been placed on paid administrative leave and has served the department since September 2020.

Documents state the vehicle's airbag did not deploy and alcohol was not a factor.

The incident report described road conditions as snowy and icy.

Crews from the St. Michaels Fire Department and Allina Ambulance also responded to the incident.

The Minnesota State Patrol is cited as the lead investigative body in this case and will be releasing any further information.

The Wright County Sheriff's Office says it ""offers their deepest condolences to the family and friends of the victim.""

First State Bank-Abilene on South Treadaway Boulevard has roots to a bank founded 115 years ago in Menard on the far western edge of the Hill Country.

But in First State Bank-Abilene's DNA are strands – in the form of the logo and some former executives – of the once-influential First State Bank founded as Abilene's third bank in 1948.

That First State Bank is long gone with the 20-story Enterprise Building the tallest structure dotting the city skyline a remnant of its legacy.

A snapshot of Abilene banking history

Given the evolutions in Bryan Stephenson's 53-year banking career his current title of transition officer at First State Bank-Abilene following its sale Nov. 16 seems appropriate for reasons other than moving operations from one owner to another.

More:New owners of Abilene State Bank-Texas have long-term plans for growth in digital age

His offices through the years have ranged from a lofty view from the city's tallest structure to a tin building once home to an oilfield services company.

Stephenson had been CEO of First State Bank-Abilene since June 2003 when he worked with a group of investors to purchase Bevans State Bank in Menard. The group included Jim Fitzhugh who served as president.

The Menard bank had about $14 million to $15 million in assets Stephenson said.

""We branched that bank up here to Abilene"" he said.

With the additional location came a new name – First State Bank-Abilene – and a moving of the charter from Menard to the city. In 2014 the bank opened a loan production office in Dripping Springs west of Austin.

The bank's first Abilene location was a former oilfield services company lot on South Treadaway Boulevard that included a ""decent-sized tin building"" Stephenson said.

""The first few customers that walked in looked around and said 'Is this really a bank?'"" Stephenson said with a laugh.

The accommodations quickly changed.

""We proceeded immediately to start building this building"" Stephenson said of the current home. ""We moved into this building I believe in 2005-06 and tore down the old metal building and built our motor bank.""

Ties to another First State Bank

Stephenson came out of retirement to shepherd the acquisition of the Menard bank and manage it's transition and growth as First State Bank-Abilene.

""I had some friends here in Abilene that wanted to start a new bank ... but starting a new bank is a real effort to put it politely"" Stephenson said.

A lawyer with experience in buying and selling banks recommended buying one instead he said.

Stephenson started making cold calls to banks within a 100-mile radius of Abilene leading to the Menard transaction.

Those friendly connections that fostered the creation of First State Bank-Abilene evolved from Stephenson's previous years at First State Bank.

He joined First State in 1980 when it was at its zenith. Chartered in November 1948 with $150000 in capital stock the bank topped $500 million in assets in December 1981.

It started in a one-story structure at South Fourth and Chestnut streets – the first bank south of Abilene's railroad tracks and the first to offer a drive-in teller window. The bank moved in April 1961 to a new four-story building across the street at South Fourth and Oak streets. East and west wings were added in 1977.

The bank literally towered over the city after executives spearheaded the construction of the 285-foot First State Bank Tower across the street in the 500 block of Chestnut Street. The bank moved into the building in May 1984 and took over seven of the 20 floors. It continued to own the four-story building leasing space to tenants.

In 1981 the charter was approved for Independent Bankshares Inc. a holding company with First State Bank its wholly-owned subsidiary. By mid-1984 Independent Bankshares included eight banks and maintained executive offices on the seventh floor of First State Bank Tower.

First State Bank's assets reached $577 million the first quarter of 1984 according to a bank publication released to celebrate the tower opening.

The crash

Five years later First State Bank was closed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation a victim of plummeting oil prices and a collapsed real estate market that caused almost 700 bank failures from 1987-89 primarily in the Southwest according to a report at FDIC.gov.

First State Bank assets totaled $265.4 million when NCNB Texas National Bank took it over Feb. 17 1989. The new owners payed the FDIC a $520000 premium to receive the transferred assets and agreed to a $160 million purchase price according to Reporter-News files.

Independent Bankshares continued to operate its other seven banks with Stephenson selected to run the holding company he said.

""We did a whole lot of different things from 1989 until 2000. The company had been cleaned up fixed up and in 2000 we sold that organization to State National Bancshares"" Stephenson said.

After six months with the new bank holding company he retired. That lasted two years when friends asked him to get back into banking.

""Jim Fitzhugh and I grew up at the old First State Bank so there was connections there. The few shareholders we have were all associated from a customer point of view – and probably at some level maybe a shareholder point of view – at the old First State.

""So there was actually quite a bit of connections but it was never a partnership or ownership sort of thing"" Stephenson said.

As for that logo when First State Bank was taken over by NCNB Texas National Bank ""they didn't pick up any of the First State Bank stuff"" Stephenson said.

In 2003 when First State Bank-Abilene came to life ""everybody liked what we called the flying F (logo). Nobody was using it and we just adopted it"" Stephenson said.

Moving on

The First State Bank Tower was owned by First State Bank Tower Ltd. which defaulted on its loan.

The 20-story building that cost about $24 million to build was sold to John Hancock Mutual Life at a foreclosure sale in January 1990 for about $8 million according to Reporter-News files.

Additional ownership changes followed for the structure today known as the Enterprise Building.

Taylor County in 1990 acquired First State Bank's four-story building at South Fourth and Oak streets for about $600000. Todaym the building is the Taylor County Plaza and state government services include vehicle registration and elections office.

Changes continue to transform the banking industry Stephenson said. There are more regulations slimmer operating margins because of low-interest real estate loans and more customers preferring digital engagement over face-to-face for their financial services he said.

""I've got 30-something-year-old kids and I literally don't know that I remember them saying they went in a bank branch. They might have never been in one in their life"" Stephenson said. ""Our customers down in Austin are of that age group. And they don't really have a desire to go into a bank branch either.""

The new owners of First State Bank-Abilene have long-range plans to grow the bank and one of the first is adding digital platforms for the next generation of customers.

Stephenson said he expects to continue with the transition efforts with the new owners for about three months. Next up: a permanent retirement far removed from spreadsheets and federal guidelines.

""I've got a little ranchette. There's always something broken down there. I swear I'm never gonna buy another thing with a battery on it because everything I've got has a dead battery and a flat tire. So I've got to get all that fixed"" he said.

NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- Parishioners donned face masks as they filled the pews of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan Friday to celebrate another Christmas shrouded by the threat of COVID-19.

In addition to encouraging masking the church said mass attendees would not be making the sign of peace traditionally a handshake exchanged among those nearby.

Also sacramental wine which symbolizes the blood Jesus Christ shed was not distributed during communion and fonts which normally hold communal holy water were empty.

""It was very special especially since we didn't get to go to our own church service. It was a quick in and out"" one parishioner said.

St. Patrick's which is the seat of the Archbishop of New York did not implement any capacity restrictions despite a recent dramatic rise in COVID cases across the state.

""We are cautious kind of staying in our bubble. We all tested before we came out to make sure we are being safe"" another parishioner said.

The Archdiocese also did not plan to make any changes to the Christmas mass schedule which included evening mass on Christmas Eve midnight mass on Christmas as well as masses throughout the day.

It was an exciting day as the phone was the original Samsung Galaxy Fold and I was about to start life with it connected to what was billed as the latest and fastest cellular connection available.

More than two years later I now know one of these two technologies would reveal itself to be exciting enjoyable and beneficial while the other would turn out to be a massive waste of time and money.

Despite the Galaxy Fold’s shortcomings I quickly fell for it but for all its hype 5G has barely made any impact on my life at all and having it enabled on my phone in December 2021 is as pointless as it was more than two years ago.

Before going further I’ll point out that my experience almost certainly won’t precisely mirror your own. You may have better coverage in your area and you may have traveled around more for example. But I also expect it’ll still be difficult to actually name a specific benefit that exclusively came from 5G during this time regardless of whether the 5G symbol has been glowing brightly on your phone.

I remember the first time the 5G symbol showed up on my Galaxy Fold. It has stayed in my mind because not only did my first taste of 5G not come when I was connected to the network I paid for monthly but I wasn’t even in the same country. I had just gotten off a flight to Japan and was standing in Haneda airport in Tokyo using a Japanese SIM I’d purchased for use during my stay. I assume I had stumbled on a test site as 5G wasn’t prevalent in Tokyo at the time and I never received a 5G signal again after I left the airport.

The fact I had to travel thousands of miles before 5G eventually showed up on my Galaxy Fold set the tone for my continued use. I knew when I entered into the contract that my local area didn’t have 5G but as I lived a few miles from the U.K.’s second busiest airport I thought there was a good chance coverage would be slightly higher on the list for my network operator than somewhere in the countryside.

Today more than two years later there’s still no 5G coverage there. A town about 20 minutes away has a 5G signal which I used for a recent test. If I travel into London which is about 90 minutes away then 5G shows up more regularly but it’s certainly not all the time. It’s also shockingly inconsistent as I discovered when I performed a 5G phone test in another town. Despite a 5G logo showing on all the phones at the time I was informed in a conversation with a chip maker later on that the phone may not have actually been using a 5G connection at all.

Do I have hope 5G will come to my phone soon? I moved home late last year and according to my carrier’s coverage map my closest 5G location is a city about 30 minutes away by car. Right now as I write this I have one bar of 4G signal on my Galaxy Z Fold 3 at home so I’m not expecting 5G to arrive in the near future if this is the best it can do with 4G a technology that has been around since 2012. Not that it matters as I’ll now explain.

The pandemic and 5G

Barely six months into my shiny data-laden 5G contract the coronavirus pandemic happened. I’m prepared to give 5G a break for it not having much impact on my life during 2020 but my willingness to give 5G the benefit of the doubt only goes so far. For example our enforced time at home seemed like a great opportunity for networks and companies to show what 5G could do for services like virtual reality and videoconferencing but alas all we got was silence.

I did go out of my way to seek out a signal on more than one occasion and have visited more places in 2021 where 5G is easier to find. Each and every time outside of exclaiming surprise that I’m actually getting 5G on my phone (yes it’s still rare enough that it’s an occasion) I couldn’t list one benefit from it being there or one service app or experience that I could try out to really make use of it at all.

There is quite simply nothing to do with 5G. In 2019 I would have added that it’s early days and benefits will surely start to arrive in the future. After all that’s what we were being sold. It’s very nearly 2022 and I can’t recommend one thing to do with 5G on your phone that will even competently demonstrate how it’s markedly superior to top-level 4G let alone something so cool that it will blow your mind.

You could run a speed test and bask in the knowledge that the numbers on the screen will be a bit higher than the ones that would show on a 4G phone’s screen. You could download an app a podcast or a show from Netflix faster than with 4G but it’s never really that much faster in my experience. I also see some hideous lag using 5G as the modem phone and network all dither around sorting out the signal before a download kicks in — which negates the supposed speed benefit over just downloading with 4G.

There is quite simply nothing to do with 5G.

In 2021 5G lets you scrub through a YouTube video with very little lag webpages appear practically instantaneously and yes files do download quickly most of the time. That’s great except I saw all this when I first tested 5G in the U.K. and in Monaco and that was in summer 2019. Expecting something more than this now isn’t a big ask.

Am I expecting too much?

I’ve paid for 5G for two years so I don’t think it’s asking too much for it to appear on my phone once in a while or to have something specific to try out when it does. After all I’ve been hearing about how amazing 5G is (will be?) for even longer than that. Samsung called 2018 the “Year of 5G” at Mobile World Congress and gave attendees of the industry event a “glimpse at how user-centric 5G networks will soon transform our homes cars cities and more.”

It said 5G would help us move around in autonomous cars while watching ultra-high-definition movies inside let us play streaming games at home with one-millisecond latency and enable us to live in smart cities where 5G nodes were fitted inside street lamps. “A large portion of the 5G technologies that will enable the services being introduced at this year’s MWC are already at the commercialization stage” Samsung excitedly wrote at the time making it sound like these innovations were right around the corner.

Samsung concedes some of these advancements required the wide adoption of Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) networks and didn’t actually give a time frame for its predictions. But here we are coming up to three years after the presentation and FWA is still very much a work in progress with the benefits still discussed only as possibilities for the future. And Ookla’s mean latency speed for mobile networks in the U.S. in 2021 is 39 milliseconds. Still some way to go then.

In the same year the GSMA a mobile industry trade body put together a paper on the “socio-economic benefits of 5G services” in which it concentrated on mmWave 5G signals. It predicted 2024 would be “the year when 5G is expected to begin displaying a measurable impact on growth.” That’s just two years away now but Qualcomm — the loudest voice in the mmWave space — is still talking about mmWave in terms of “typical use cases” and not real situations and listing benefits that sound like science fiction. For example have you used 5G-driven augmented reality to see real-time stats and player information at a sports event recently? No me neither.

I’m sure it will all happen one day but Opensignal’s mid-2021 5G performance report showed that even for those people who do have access to a mmWave 5G signal they’d be connected to it less than 1% of the time and that was across AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon. It seems you could change the published date on both Samsung and the GSMA’s reports from 2018 to 2021 without fear of them reading like old news.

Whether you care or not it’s here

I cannot name one time I have been glad to have 5G on my phone. If I had stayed with a 4G contract in 2019 the following two years would have played out in exactly the same way. Even if I could get a 5G signal on a regular basis none of the transformational tech it’ll hopefully one day deliver is available for me to use or even test out. Simply put 5G has been a complete waste of my time and money and any advantage to having it over just a really good 4G signal is almost nonexistent.

Today almost all smartphones that cost more than $250 have a 5G modem inside and practically all phone contracts come with 5G data too. The days of paying a premium for 5G do seem to have passed as the technology has become mainstream. What a very good thing this is because while we may have access to 5G in 2021 we are still waiting for a reason for it to exist.

Today many rely on satellites for communicating in rural areas whether on ground or sea. Gilat Satellite Networks an Israeli satellite communications ground segment provider has so far connected 1.7 million terminals around the world to provide internet. And it’s latest focus? Providing inflight connectivity connecting 4G cell towers enabling communications for ships at sea and more noted Dubi Lever CTO of Gilat in an interview with CTech. Lever has been with the company for over two decades and has seen the industry evolve and expand to additional markets. “People used to think that the satellite industry was just a niche industry but now it’s become center-stage” he said.

“Most satellites are of the GEO (geostationary) variety that orbit about 36000 km (22200 miles) above the Earth’s atmosphere and used for communications but we’re now seeing an explosion of non-geostationary satellite constellations. We aspire to provide global connectivity. Jeff Bezos Elon Musk and Richard Branson have some high-level plans and there are a lot of investments and plans for going into space but we’re also very well-positioned and prepared for the NewSpace era” Lever added.

Not to be confused with Gilat Telecom an offshoot that provides broadband services Gilat Satellite Networks designs and manufactures the ground segment for communication satellites. The company was established in 1987 and went public on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and then the Nasdaq in 1992. Today it employs over 1000 people worldwide including at its headquarters in Petach Tikva where it develops satellite modems. It also has a subsidiary in the U.S. WaveStream Corp. which develops high power amplifiers for transmitting high powered signals from satellite gateways. In addition Gilat designs flat panel antennas for mobile applications and communications-on-the-move. It also provides equipment for consumer internet to homes in France the U.K. and Russia. The company builds central stations termed “hubs” and remote terminals that connect through satellites to the hubs. That equipment is split between gateways where modems antennas and amplifiers are installed; data centers where data processing such as encryption and compression is implemented; and Network Operating Systems (NOC) where Network Management Systems (NMS) are installed.

While traditional cellular connectivity demands companies install cellular towers in different areas by deploying fiber optics cables doing so in rural areas is difficult: laying down fibers is costly and takes time. As an alternative Gilat enables cellular backhauling which connects cell site air interfaces to wireline networks that connect to data centers enabling phone users to access content and applications accessed by mobile users. Currently it provides cellular backhauling over satellite to all mobile network operators in Japan working with SoftBank NTT Docomo Inc KDDI and Rakuten. In the U.K. it cooperates with British Telecom and with T-Mobile in the U.S.

“Satellite connectivity can be done within days” Lever said “and our greatest challenge with providing 4G was to ensure that users had high speeds for broadband connectivity and high quality voice calls.” The company’s satellite services enable high voice quality when making phone calls in the air. “People would think that the quality of a voice call - which travels up to a satellite located 36000 km in space and then back to Earth - would be unpleasant but we’ve proved them wrong” he said.

Satellite operations are important to our everyday lives explained Lever since they can enable communications in remote locations. “If hikers are on a trek in the desert and in distress they need to be able to alert authorities” Lever continued “but the farther away you move from main roads the more likely you are to lose cell service connectivity.” Satellite terminals can be dropped in remote areas such as nature reserves enabling people to connect to a local modem with their cellphones and help alert rescue services. “Israel is a small country and that’s why we’ve got pretty good infrastructure in terms of connectivity. There are still some ‘black spots’ or areas where people lose coverage like on the way to Eilat or in Judea and Samaria” he noted.

Potential applications for a local Israeli satellite network are vast. A local satellite network could solve problems such as enabling remote learning during the Covid-19 pandemic for Bedouin nomadic communities assisting civilians and the military driving through areas prone to terrorist attacks by enabling them to call for support when needed or interacting with cameras at rail and road intersections that can monitor traffic and roadside assistance. Lever noted that such a network was recently set up but the terminals haven’t been deployed yet.

Global warming is another area where satellite communications are paramount. The growing number of hurricanes forest fires or tornadoes caused indirectly by global warming and other effects on the climate have impacted local cell phone infrastructure. “A lot of these storms such as severe flooding in the U.K. leave a lot of terrestrial cell phone infrastructure damaged and that’s why having satellite backup is essential” Lever said. He recalled that Japan has partnered with Gilat to provide satellite backup coverage in the event of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis. “Our dependency on communications is so high and due to global warming the potential exposure of terrestrial infrastructure to damage exists” he said adding that while satellite services cannot replace terrestrial terminals in terms of speed it’s wise to have them as backup.

Currently many companies have different types of satellite constellations floating above the Earth’s atmosphere at varying altitudes for different purposes. MEO constellations hover at medium-Earth orbit some 8000 km (4900 miles) above the atmosphere can operate with less than 10 satellites for global connectivity. LEO (lower-Earth orbit) satellites hover at a distance of between 500 km-1500 km (310-930 miles) and need anywhere from several hundreds of satellites to tens of thousands to provide global coverage for broadband communications.

While there aren’t a lot of operational MEO satellites today Gilat recently partnered with SES (Société Européenne des Satellites) a large Luxembourg-based satellite operator to develop a ground segment for its next-generation offering which will be launched to space in 2022 termed mPOWER. MEO satellites can provide connectivity in remote areas where laying fibers isn’t feasible such as for maritime operations at sea like cruise ships. “You can’t exactly lay cables that connect to ships” Lever said but noted that Gilat enables connectivity for military applications cruise ships fishing vessels merchant ships and more.

And the company has far-reaching aspirations around the world to help connect remote regions. In non-satellite related news recently Gilat signed agreements valued at $16 million to operate regional transport-networks to support terrestrial connectivity over fiber and WiFi to mountainous regions in Peru.

Lever believes that Israel’s uniqueness in terms of its growing space tech ecosystem stems from its innovative mindset as well as its flexibility and adaptability. “We know how to innovate. Many people in this industry have served in different military units and have this DNA instilled in them to solve problems no matter how hard. We’re also very flexible and hard-working” he said. In the satellite equipment market most of the major players are U.S. companies he recalled such as ViaSat Inc. Hughes Network Systems and ST Engineering iDirect. “And then there’s Gilat: we’re agile customer-oriented and know how to do a lot with very little.”

Unlike its European counterparts which are part of the European Space Agency and receive governmental support and funding Israel does not partake in this exclusive club. Lever believes that this factor makes Israeli companies strive to work harder to offer more solutions services and innovate better. “Gilat” he added “is a one-stop shop for all needs for ground satellite segments for satellite communications and we bring more to the table than meets the eye.” So what’s next on the horizon? The company plans on offering its next-generation satellite platform that is more dynamic and uses cutting-edge technology in terms of processing power. Next-gen satellites will be software-defined and able to change coverage and power distribution within minutes with enormous capacities of transmitting up to 1 terabit of data per second. “As satellites go-digital we’re getting closer to the future.”",,,

Chen has been targeted by foreign sanctions over the crackdown targeting the Uygurs and other Muslim minorities in the region that he spearheaded prompting allegations of widespread human rights abuses from the United States and other Western countries.

Xinhua said Chen would be appointed to another post adding that he would be replaced by Ma Xingrui the governor of Guangdong province.

Guangdong is an important springboard for promotion in the Communist Party system. It remains unknown who will take over the post of Guangdong governor.

The changes are part of a wider reshuffle ahead of next year’s party congress where a new Politburo Standing Committee – the country’s top leadership body – will be unveiled.

Chen 66 one of the 25 members of the Politburo is the most senior Chinese official on the US sanctions list.

He was sanctioned last year “in connection with serious rights abuses against ethnic minorities” in Xinjiang which reportedly include mass arbitrary detention and severe physical abuse targeting Uygurs and other mainly Muslim minorities in the region.

In 2016 Chen was promoted to become party secretary of the region where the United Nations estimates about one million Uygurs have been detained in re-education camps. China describes the facilities as vocational skills training centres necessary to combat “extremism”.

Previously he had been the party chief in Tibet another region with a history of violence and uprisings against Beijing’s rule. Just months after his appointment in 2011 the region started advertising for another 2500 police officers.

Ma his replacement as Xinjiang party chief has been governor of Guangdong since 2017 having previously served as Shenzhen party boss from 2015.

The 62-year-old is also one of the country’s top scientists with a background in the aerospace industry.

After serving as general manager of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation he was made director of the China National Space Administration in 2013 where he commanded China’s first successful lunar surface mission Chang’e 3.

Veterans of the country’s space programme have been promoted to important political roles in key provinces in recent years and Ma’s new role is likely win him a ticket to join the Politburo in the coming congress.

Wu Qiang a political analyst in Beijing said Chen’s replacement was likely to have little impact on policies in Xinjiang.

“The replacement cannot be called a response to international pressure” Wu said. “The pressure does exist but what Beijing did is the opposite – as Chen might be promoted to a higher level and the governance model in Xinjiang might be copied elsewhere in the country.”

However a Beijing-based expert on Xinjiang issues who declined to be named said the replacement might indicate the government wanted to add some new elements to its policy in Xinjiang arguing that “replacement definitely means new thoughts”.

Professor Song Xiaozhuang from Shenzhen University’s Centre for the Basic Laws of Hong Kong and Macau said Ma’s Guangdong experience might aid Xinjiang’s economic development as well as help fend off overseas accusations of “forced labour”.

“Guangdong’s economy has led the country in many aspects including in GDP. Ma is very familiar with the issue of ‘forced labour’ from his dealings with foreign investment from all over the world” Song said.

On Thursday US President Joe Biden signed into law a measure that will effectively ban all imports from Xinjiang saying it showed its determination to “combat forced labour” in the region.

My car is a 2019 Model 3 Performance picked up in November 2019.I'd been having some issues with mine where I'd be parked on my sloped driveway press the brake pedal the headlights would be pointing too low. Then if I'm on flat ground and press the brake pedal they'd be pointing too high and blinding people. I'd have to constantly re-run the headlight alignment in the Service menu which would resolve this and set them to a good just below level position. Low enough that they're not blinding anyone high enough that I can actually see.Since then I've had my headlights aligned by Tesla Service as I was getting really tired of having to run the headlight alignment so often or even pull over to the side of the road to run it as I'd forgot and I'm blinding everyone.Now that they've been aligned by Tesla Service they point very low down. The focus of the beam is probably about 1 car length ahead. I live in Cumbria so there's very low light pollution with this new alignment I can see basically nothing. Would you want to be on a dual carridgeway doing 75mph when you can only see 1 car length in front of you...? It feels really sketchy compared to my manual alignment which with the rather flat alignment could see maybe 4-5 car lengths ahead with ease.In the message concluding the service they said the headlights will slowly adjust based on vehicle weight and driving style could anyone explain this? The weight part makes perfect sense but driving style? Acceleration? Cornering? I have no idea what they mean by this but I've never seen them adjust based on how I drive in the past or maybe it's just slow adjusting so I haven't seen it happen.I'm going to give it a few weeks to adjust like they said it should but I wanted to see if other people have had any similar experiences. The pre-refresh headlights have honestly been nothing but trouble for me. My dad's 2014 Peugeot is able to adjust them based on the angle of the road but my 2019 £52k car has a beam pointing at the ground with the same lighting distance as halogen bulbs...To be clear... I absolutely love the car! ...In the daytime when I don't need auto high beam to function (as it turns off for retroreflective signs but turns on for traffic) and I don't need headlights most of the time.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzI2LzIyODUzNTczL3Rlc2xhLW1vZGVsLXMtZXhwbG9zaW9uLXJlcGFpci1iaWxs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla owner blows up Model S instead of footing $22600 repair bill,"When faced with a repair bill that costs half of what you paid for your car do you go through with the expensive repair bring it to the junkyard or sell it for parts? Finnish Tesla owner Tuomas Katainen decided to do something a little more extreme — but arguably a lot more satisfying — when faced with such a situation: he watched his car go up in flames as noted in a report from Gizmodo.

Katainen handed his 2013 Tesla Model S over to Pommijätkät a group of explosion experts on YouTube who loves to make things go “boom” after he was quoted $22600 for a battery replacement. “Well when I bought that Tesla the first 1500km [932 miles] were nice” Katainen recounted. “Then error codes hit.” After Katainen brought his Tesla to a mechanic he found out that the only way to fix the car would be to replace the entire battery pack which would cost him at least 20000€ or around $22600.

The group behind Pommijätkät strapped 66 pounds of dynamite to the car and parked it in an old quarry

I think anyone would be pretty frustrated at that point considering that the base price for a new 2013 Tesla Model S started at $57400 later increasing to $59900 when the car first came out. Even a standard used model currently goes for around $30000 at the lowest. That’s probably why Katainen picked up the Tesla from the shop and told the mechanic that he’s going to “explode the whole car away.”

For context these cars come with an eight-year (or up to 150000 miles) battery and drive unit warranty but the warranties on older models are starting to expire revealing the potential cost behind a full battery replacement. In September Electrek reported on a Tesla owner in need of a battery replacement on a Model S that was no longer under warranty. As noted in the report he was quoted $22500 from Tesla but ended up getting a repair for $5000 from a third-party shop. Katainen’s quote was also from Tesla and it’s unclear whether he had access to an alternative repair service.

Either way the group behind Pommijätkät strapped 30kg (66 pounds) of dynamite to the car and parked it in an old quarry in Jaala Finland. Even Elon Musk was there — well at least in spirit. A crash test dummy outfitted with a helmet thick winter jacket and a picture of Musk’s face was dropped in by helicopter and then stuffed in the driver’s seat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3JvYWRzaG93L25ld3MvdGVzbGEtaG9saWRheS11cGRhdGUtc29mdHdhcmUtdjExLWxpZ2h0LXNob3cteGxpZ2h0cy1kZXRhaWxzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla's holiday update includes design-your-own Light Show open to all,"Feature-packed over-the-air software updates loaded with fun and functional new capabilities for Tesla vehicles have become an annual tradition for Elon Musk and the company at year's end. On Tuesday Roadshow published the first emerging details about the company's latest installment v11.0. Then on Friday the EV manufacturer revealed further information detailing capabilities far beyond functional upgrades like a new Hyundai-like automatic blind-spot camera display and improved navigation. Yes even in the midst of the legal controversy around Passenger Play v11.0 includes new games for Tesla Arcade including Sonic the Hedgehog Sudoku and The Battle of Polytopia. But there's also a new feature available for everyone -- even those who don't even own a Tesla.

The latter is an update to Tesla Light Show a function we've seen in the past that enables Tesla audio systems to play holiday favorites like Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy (The Nutcracker Suite) paired with a synchronized light show. Now Tesla opened up the capability to support XLights an open-source free software that allows users to create their own vehicular light show on a computer. That file can then be uploaded to compatible Tesla vehicles using a USB drive. The rub is you can't use XLights to engineer light shows for non-Tesla vehicles but you can compose your own sound-and-light performances for friends' or clients' cars.

(Note: It's worth pointing out that the idea of an automaker actively encouraging users to upload a personalized version of any software to their vehicles is unusual. Even within XLights' presumably limited parameters most car companies' cybersecurity teams would frown upon the idea of opening up any part of their vehicle's electronic architecture to outside programming. It's tempting to view this as a sign of Tesla's confidence in the hack-resistance of its software but even if you don't it's further proof that Tesla marches to the beat of its own drummer.)

Other v11.0 features revealed in Tesla's official blog post include an updated user interface for models powered by Intel Atom processors. Inspired by the latest mid-cycle refresh updates to the Model S hatchback and Model X SUV these features include a Saab-like Dark Mode a user-definable app launcher and a rationalized control menu.

Music buffs will appreciate a slew of small updates too including five levels of Immersive Audio that now include an Auto adaptive setting that features manual subwoofer control.

Finally for those living in cold-weather climates there are also new frigid-friendly features including automatic front seat heaters that activate based on cabin conditions and HVAC settings. This appears to function similarly to the remote-start-activated cabin preconditioning function found on Stellantis' vehicles. The company says the function is now available using the Tesla App as well as via vehicles' center touchscreens -- even at a lower state of charge.

For all of the v11.0 details -- including new features not detailed here -- be sure to check out Tesla's new official blog update.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdGVzbGFub3J0aC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yNi9oZXJlcy10aGUtdGVjaC1iZWhpbmQtdGVzbGFzLW1hdHJpeC1sZWQtaGVhZGxpZ2h0cy12aWRlby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's the Tech Behind Tesla's Matrix LED Headlights [VIDEO] - TeslaNorth.com,"Newer (2021+) Tesla Model 3 and Model Y Performance vehicles feature adaptive headlights with an outer projector lamp that supports a matrix LED.

The new headlamps not only allow for a more powerful headlight with better low-light visibility but the matrix LEDs inside can even be programmed to project light in certain shapes or even form entire words. We first saw a preview of this at the Giga Berlin County Fair.

That is how the new Light Show feature baked into Tesla’s 2021 holiday software update projects the Tesla logo on some newer cars.

In a recently published YouTube video gftgrill fully tore down Tesla’s new matrix LED projector headlights revealing not only the complete disassembly process but also each component used.

Towards the end of the video the YouTuber gets around to stripping down the LED projector and finds that it is powered by Samsung’s ‘PixCell’ matrix LEDs.

We can even see a Tesla Model 3 in the PixCell LED promo video above.

Samsung’s PixCell LED-based Adaptive Driving Beam (ADB) solution for automotive headlights features 100 individually addressable pixels that are smaller and therefore more efficient than traditional headlamp LEDs.

According to Samsung the benefits of the PixCell LED stretch far beyond efficiency and include higher luminance better nighttime and poor-weather performance and reduced glare for drivers. And oh the pixels can be programmed to individually turn on/off to create specific patterns and words.

It’s unclear if Tesla will offer a retrofit for older Model 3 and Model Y vehicles that do not have the new matrix LED headlights. But eventually we expect the Long Range Model Y to gain the new headlight unit just like the Performance and the entire Model 3 lineup.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvdGVzbGEtcy1uZXctbGlnaHQtc2hvdy1sZWF2ZXMtYS1jb3VwbGUtb2Ytb3duZXJzLXdpdGgtbm9uLWZ1bmN0aW9uaW5nLWhlYWRsaWdodHMtMTc3NTMwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla's New Light Show Leaves a Couple of Owners With Non-Functioning Headlights,"Tesla vehicles can do quite a lot of things most people would categorize as ""useless” but another significant part of the population would say are ""fun."" There is a far machine for instance or a setting where you can make the navigation place your car (suddenly turned into a rover) on Mars.

SUV

Most of these can be enjoyed either by yourself or together with a group of people that's no larger than the number of seats in the car. The light show on the other hand is more like a full-blown performance for the entire audience which is probably why it's had so much success in the past.The feature was first introduced on the Model X electricand made full use of the vehicle's falcon wing doors not only its lights. Following the very recent update released by Tesla all Model 3s and Ys as well as 2021 Ss and Xs have access to a new improved version - one that allows the user to completely personalize the light show.It's amazing how grown people find these things entertaining and worth more than a second's thought. Having said that I've just finished installing over 30 feet of smart RGB LED strip in my living room that can react to the music played so perhaps I fall straight into the target demographics and I'm just in denial.Considering how owners took to some of the changes brought by the update the inclusion of this feature proved to be a wise decision from Tesla to help deflect some of the flak. Most grievances relate to the changes in the user interface with people either not liking the overall appearance or bemoaning the complicated menu navigation required to perform simple actions such as switching the windshield wipers on or off.However the update brought even more misery for a couple of owners . For them the one feature that was meant to make any potential niggle caused by the new update easier to get by proved to become itself a source of stress and headaches. The pair - one owning a Model Y and the other a Model 3 - claims that one of their headlights stopped working after running the show and the classic ""switch it off and back on again"" universal solution did nothing to solve the problem.We're not entirely sure whether they take comfort in knowing it's not a hardware problem since the headlights continue to work just fine during the show it's when they're actually needed that they fail to perform their duty but they probably should - it must be cheaper to mess around with a few ones and zeroes than replacing the LED assembly.Whatever the case turning your headlights into strobes is definitely not going to help extend the lifetime of those parts and yet we doubt this or the experience of these two owners (and possibly more silent ones?) are going to hold people back from allowing their vehicles to perform."

Technology executives say this year’s supply-chain bottlenecks which have hit parts for everything from iPhones to Ford F-150s are particularly acute in chips that don’t shuffle zeros and ones. Analog chips treat incoming information about temperature sound and electrical current more like a human would on a scale with many gradations.

Among the biggest analog chip makers is Dallas-based Texas Instruments founded in 1930. TI engineer Jack Kilby is credited with inventing the integrated circuit in 1958.

Students and engineers know TI for its hand-held calculators which it still makes. But its $170 billion market capitalization is built on its dominance in analog chips where it holds 17% to 20% of the world market this year according to Taiwan-based market research firm TrendForce.

While makers of sophisticated digital chips such as Intel Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. get most of the spotlight a lack of analog chips costing a few dollars apiece can hold up supply chains for products with tens of billions of dollars in sales.

Samson Hu co-chief executive of Taiwan-based laptop maker Asustek Computer Inc. recently lamented that his factory assembly lines were getting disrupted by a shortage of analog chips managing battery use or amplifying sound effects. He used an abbreviation for the term “integrated device manufacturer"" a class of companies including analog-chip makers that design and make their own chips.

“The uncertainty as we have observed lies with a certain big American IDM company "" Mr. Hu said in November on an earnings call. He didn’t name the company but industry officials said that based on Mr. Hu’s description of the big company’s products he was talking about Texas Instruments. A spokeswoman for Asustek declined to comment and representatives for Texas Instruments didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.

Mr. Hu said he expected supply from the American company to remain tight until its capacity expansion next year. TI has said a new $6 billion factory is set to open in Richardson Texas in the second half of 2022.

Apple Inc.’s chief executive Tim Cook talked in an October earnings call about the billions of dollars in sales opportunities Apple is losing because parts shortages mean it can’t make enough iPhones and other devices. Mr. Cook referred to “legacy nodes"" a term for older production processes that encompasses analog chips and some digital chips.

“The chip shortage is happening on legacy nodes"" Mr. Cook said. “Primarily we buy leading-edge nodes and we’re not having issues on leading-edge nodes. But on legacy nodes we compete with many different companies for supply.""

Besides Texas Instruments major analog-chip makers include Analog Devices Inc. of Wilmington Mass. and two European companies Infineon Technologies AG and STMicroelectronics NV.

Industry executives and analysts say TI’s problems in meeting demand resemble those of other companies but that it tends to get more attention because of its leading position.

Texas Instruments says it is doing its best to serve customers and acknowledges that some aren’t getting everything they want. “Clearly we’re well below where we want to be"" in inventory said Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi in an October earnings call.

The company has new capacity in the works that it says will require tens of billions of dollars in investment with construction starting next year on two factories in Sherman Texas.

At a September investor conference Chief Executive Rich Templeton cited this road map in asking for patience. “You cannot change your capacity footprint in substantial ways inside a year or two"" he said. “We’d love to have more capacity now. But there’s a lot of things in life you’d love to have.""

Texas Instruments has 15 manufacturing sites world-wide. Apple includes TI on its supplier list and names eight TI locations including Texas Maine Taiwan Japan and China’s Sichuan province. People involved in the Apple supply chain say TI parts have been one factor in shortages of products such as the iPhone this year. Apple declined to comment.

TrendForce the research firm said in a December report that analog-chip makers have a backlog of orders from automotive customers stretching to the end of 2022. Consumer-electronics makers are also dealing with monthslong waits and higher prices it said.

The world’s biggest and most valuable chip makers—Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Samsung and Intel—have spent tens of billions of dollars on new capacity. Generally these chips have remained plentiful.

Yet of the 50 or so chips crammed into the latest high-end smartphones only four or five fall into the leading-edge category say executives and analysts in the industry. The others include analog chips that perform tasks such as powering the phone’s display or managing its battery charger.

The analog-chip makers tend to design manufacture and sell chips themselves which is why they are included in the category of integrated device manufacturers. Advanced digital chips by contrast are often designed by one company and made by another typically a specialized “fab"" such as TSMC.

In volume terms about 80% of the world’s semiconductor production comes from IDMs said Zhao Haijun co-chief executive of China’s biggest contract chip manufacturer Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.

At an industrial forum in November in Shanghai Mr. Zhao said major IDMs were four to five months behind in meeting demand and usually didn’t build much wiggle room into their plans.

“A shortage of 5% could lead to a crazily surging price"" he said. “This is precisely the result of inflexibility along the supply chain.""

Yet analog-chip makers have been cautious about expanding because of the industry’s history of booms and busts. Texas Instruments executives have said they want to be disciplined in addressing customer demand.

“At some point they’ll have too much product and that’s what creates the cycles in our industry"" said TI’s investor-relations head Dave Pahl on an earnings call in October. “So it won’t surprise us if the cycle comes to an end at some point. We’ll be prepared for that.""

This year we have added some iconic trademarks to round out the list. This tradition was originally made popular in 2018 and updated in 2019 with a holiday feature by IPWatchdog Founder Gene Quinn: The Most Iconic (and Patented) Toys and Games of All Time. The original post included iconic toys such as “the Video Game Console Barbie doll Monopoly Rubik’s Cube Battleship Super Soaker Hoola Hoop Slinky Play-Doh Easy Bake Oven Game-Boy Frisbee YoYo Lego blocks Transformers Tricycles Bicycles Scooters Tonka trucks Rocking Horse Twister Simon Magic 8 Ball Erector Set Etch A Sketch Bunch-o-Balloons and Mr. Potato Head.” Last year an updated list was published: More Iconic (and Patented) Toys and Games: A 2020 Update including updates to the prior list such as the Red Ryder BB gun Teddy Ruxpin Little Tykes Toy Coupe Koosh Ball Furby Mousetrap Game Lite-Bright Stretch Armstrong Lincoln Logs and Skip-It.

Here are a few more that have brought smiles to the faces of so many on Christmas Day over the years.

Elf on the Shelf

The Elf on the Shelf Christmas tradition has been around since about 2004 when Carol Aebersold filed two trademark applications one for the words “The Elf on the Shelf” and one for this elf drawing of the beloved Elf on the shelf. It was registered for goods such as elf dolls and children’s books sold as a unit. The stylized version of “the Elf on the Shelf” was filed in 2008 and assigned U.S. Registration No. 3553223.

According to tradition and the story the accompanies the Elf on the Shelf doll the elves are Santa’s helpers and they keep an eye on children and report back to Santa each night when they fly back to the North Pole. Each morning children are delighted to wake up to find their elf in a new spot in the house. Parents have become an active part of the tradition by “helping” the elves find new places to hide or play around the house. Countless articles have been devoted to ideas for making your Elf on the Shelf the most interesting elf in the neighborhood such as making your elf a sled out of candy canes or tangling your elf up in dental floss.

Mounted Mechanical Fish

In the late 1990s and early 2000s it was rare to find a person who did not know of or own a mechanical singing fish mounted on a plaque. Those who were very lucky even woke up on Christmas morning to find one under the Christmas tree! The one pictured to the left was the subject of U.S. D440525 issued April 17 2001 to Think Tek Inc. Think Tek’s mechanical mounted fish was marketed as the Boogie Bass and sung songs and played back phrases while moving around and opening and closing its mouth. Several other similar products were introduced around the same time period but none of them including Think Tek’s patented version was nearly as popular as the Big Mouth Billy Bass which is protected by trademark Registration No. U.S. 4944012. Big Mouth Billy Bass is arguably the most successful product ever produced by Gemmy Industries. The animatronic singing fish played Al Green’s “Take Me to the River” and “Don’t Worry Be Happy.” According to an interview statement by Al Green the use of his song in the popular singing fish had earned him more royalties than any other recorded versions of the song.

Chatty Cathy Talking Doll

No list of iconic toys is complete without a talking doll! The Chatty Cathy Talking Doll was introduced in the early 1960s and was marked with patent number U.S. 3017187 titled “Multiple Speech Phonograph.” The patent related to a phonograph that may be embodied in a doll. According to the patent a child may cause the doll to speak or pronounce a number of different sentences by pulling of a drawstring. The first Chatty Cathy Talking Doll had blue eyes and blonde hair and she randomly recited 11 phrases such as “I love you” and “Tell me a story.” Such talking dolls have been the subject of many little girls’ dreams (and possibly some nightmares as well). Recently Chatty Cathy served as the inspiration for a talking doll character named Gabby Gabby in Toy Story 4. Gabby Gabby had a dark side that is said to be inspired by another spin off of Chatty Cathy an evil doll named Talky Tina who appeared in a 1963 “Twilight Zone” episode. Chatty Cathy is also the subject of several dead trademarks and one pending U.S. Trademark Application U.S. 88620210.

Speak & Spell

The Speak & Spell was created by Texas Instruments and sold between 1978 and 1992. U.S. Patent No. 4516260 for an “Electronic Learning Aid or Game Having Synthesized Speech” is one of Texas Instrument’s patent’s directed to the Speak & Spell. What began as a three-month feasibility study with a $25000 budget became the invention of the Speak & Spell “marked the first time the human vocal tract had been electronically duplicated on a single chip of silicon” and a primitive version of the synthetic speech technology that drives things like Alexa today. The Speak & Spell remained poplar throughout the late 1970’s and 1980’s and was boosted by its appearance in the movie “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” where it was used by E.T to “phone home.”

Pogo Stick

For over 50 years the perfect gift for any energetic and determined child has been a pogo stick. The first modern two-handed pogo stick was issued in February 1955 to G.B. Hansburg as U.S. Patent No. 2793036. The object of the ‘036 invention was to provide a pogo stick that was “neat compact and durable and not likely to become deranged even with long use which may be made from relatively inexpensive components and readily assembled at low cost and which in addition to functioning in the manner of a conventional pogo stick may readily be set for adjustment of its recoil to an amount which depends upon the weight of the user to prevent injury to the latter due to excessive recoil action.”

Dominos

Dominos is an iconic game that has been played by young and old for many years. One particular colored set was patented on May 29 1883 as U.S. Patent No. 278646 wherein each number was distinguished by a separate color. As shown in Figure 1 the spots are distinguished by different shading or coloring. Alternatively the spots may be colored alike and the spaces between the spots may be distinguished by different shading or coloring.

Flying Ring

The flying ring patented on October 16 1973 as U.S. Patent No. 3765122 is a ring shaped flying toy including an annular skirt and a central circular opening. When the ring is “tossed by a person and caused to spin about its axis while traveling through the air an air stream flowing over the toy’s leading edge will be guided by the deflector surface downwardly into the central opening and thereafter directed beneath the toy’s trailing edge to support the trailing edge in flight.”

View-Master

Originally the View-Master was developed as much for adults as for children. The device described in U.S. Patent No. 2189285 was marketed from 1939 to 1950 and was sold alongside View-Master reels which featured scenery of interest to adults. Claim 1 of the ‘285 patent recited in part “[a] disk … having fourteen windows formed therein in each of which is mounted a transparency means for viewing a pair of diametrically opposite transparencies simultaneously means for moving said disk to expose in alternate succession whereby a cycle of views can be shown in repeated succession without inversion.” In the late 1940s the View-Master Model C was marketed towards children and was the subject of U.S. Patent No. 2511334 titled “Stereoscopic Viewer.” The ‘334 patent issued to Wilhelm Gruber in June 1950. The patent was directed to “a stereoscopic device adapted for viewing stereoscopic pictures arranged in circular or disc form whereby the disc can be inserted and removed with a minimum amount of effort skill or care on the part of the user.” In particular the device was designed to be easy to use for a child. View-Masters continue to delight adults and children alike and are still available from many retailers.

Sock Monkey

The Sock Monkey has been an iconic toy for generations and was made using a particular type of socks called “Nelson Red Heel Rockford Socks” for which Nelson Knitting Company was awarded trademark Serial No. U.S. 71532152. On July 14 1953 Helen Cooke was awarded Design Patent No. 170008 for a sock doll design which claimed the classic Sock Monkey. Cooke filed suit against a man named Stanley Levy for selling dolls of a design not made by Cooke. Levy contacted Nelson Knitting Company and the Company gathered evidence that others had been making similar dolls for over two years prior to the filing of Cookes’ patent. Cooke eventually settled the case against Levy and sold the sock monkey doll patent to Nelson Knitting for $750 in 1955. Nelson began including instructions for making the Sock Monkey on every package of Rockford Red Heel Socks.

Electrification components are part of GM’s effort to extend the performance and benefits of zero-emissions technology to new industries and serve as a natural extension of GM’s growth strategy.

This initiative will help organisations meet the growing demand for zero-emissions technology while achieving their own sustainability targets.

The company estimates that the total addressable market for electrification components could be close to $ 20 billion by 2030 as a growing number of industries introduce their own emissions reduction goals.

According to the company the initial EV component sets that it will begin introducing include Chevy Performance and Aftermarket GM Powered Solutions Ground Support Equipment and Marine Propulsion.

Chevy Performance Aftermarket

GM says that the upcoming Electric Connect and Cruise eCrate Package represents an exciting opportunity for the company to extend EV technology to the aftermarket enabling customers to work with qualified installers through its electric Specialty Vehicle Modifier (eSVM) programme who have been appropriately trained to replace a vehicle’s traditional internal combustion engine with a fully electric propulsion system.

GM’s demonstrated proof-of-concept electric conversion vehicles include the E-10 pickup K-5 Blazer-E eCOPO Camaro and Project X built-in collaboration with Cagnazzi Racing’s eCrate Solutions Group. Now an electrified 1972 El Camino SS developed with Lingenfelter Performance Engineering in Brighton Michigan represents the first independent installation of the concept eCrate package and ushers in the next generation of EV components from Chevrolet Performance as the program prepares to launch in 2022.

GM Powered Solutions

GM Powered Solutions will begin introducing tailored electric component sets and will leverage the resources of the company’s Powered Solutions team to actively identify opportunities that could benefit from electrification and will work to integrate the latest EV technology into custom applications strategically. This effort will extend the company’s commitment to an all-electric future through its current GM Marine On-Highway Off-Highway and Industrial segments and help enable additional enterprises to reach their own emissions targets utilising GM EV components and systems.

Ground Support Equipment

In a strategic collaboration with Textron Ground Support Equipment Inc. the vehicle maker will provide EV components to electrify Textron GSE’s TUG line of baggage tractors cargo tractors and belt loaders. The company will provide technology to Powertrain Control Solutions which will integrate the components into lithium-ion electric powertrains for TUG equipment assisting in the electrification of ground support equipment for use in airports globally.

Marine Propulsion

In addition to supporting existing marine customers the company’s strategic investment in Seattle-based electric watercraft company Pure Watercraft represents an opportunity to bring EV technology to the marine industry and help preserve the enjoyment of the outdoors for future generations. The two companies will develop and commercialise battery-electric watercraft to accelerate the transition to electric mobility.

Additional extensions include GM’s Hydrotec fuel cell commitments and co-development agreements Ultium Platform applications and co-development agreements Ultium Charge 360 BrightDrop and Ultifi software platform.

Leveraging over 100 years of engineering and manufacturing expertise GM intends to apply the learnings from one component set to the development of others resulting in a larger portfolio of product offerings across a far-reaching set of applications.

According to Travis Hester Vice President Electric Vehicle Growth Operations GM the company has an established strategy a network of integrators and co-development agreements to apply an extensive array of components and solutions to a broad range of customers and use cases. As companies across many industries look to reduce their environmental impact the automaker is uniquely positioned to serve as a leader not only through exciting new EVs across its brands but through additional technology applications. “We look forward to bringing customers – existing and new – along with us on our zero-emissions journey” he says.

In the future the company will look to implement the latest in EV technology regardless of battery generation or chemistry to electrify a wide range of applications across industries.

“Our customers will benefit from GM’s vast network of resources support and experience as an innovator in the electrification space. As we advance our Ultium Platform and other zero-emissions technologies we anticipate smaller more affordable and more flexible components and offerings over time” he adds.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL3VzLWFybXktcm9ib3RpYy1jb21iYXQtdmVoaWNsZXMtZ2V0cy1ncmVlbi1zaWduYWwtZm9yLWZ1dHVyZS1iYXR0bGVzL9IBY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL3VzLWFybXktcm9ib3RpYy1jb21iYXQtdmVoaWNsZXMtZ2V0cy1ncmVlbi1zaWduYWwtZm9yLWZ1dHVyZS1iYXR0bGVzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unmanned Revolution! US Army’s Robotic Combat Vehicles That Tasted ‘Success’ In Afg Iraq Gets Green Signal For ‘Future Battles’,"The US Army had received the light and medium prototypes of the Robotic Combat Vehicles (RCV-L and RCV-M) from industry teams in 2021. Once the services received these prototypes a small team began working on the prototypes to prepare them for a full company-level evaluation in the near future.

The US Army had held a major prototyping competition in May 2019 for developing robot combat vehicles which were believed to provide the country with an edge in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The Army selected QinetiQ North America as the winner of the contract for building four RCV-L prototypes and Textron for building four RCV-M prototypes according to a service release on January 9.

“Robots have the potential to revolutionize the way we conduct ground combat operations. Whether that’s giving increased firepower to a dismounted patrol breaching an enemy fighting position or providing [chemical biological radiological nuclear and explosive] reconnaissance we envision these vehicles providing commander’s more time and space for decisions and reducing risk to soldiers” Brig. Gen. Ross Coffman director of the Next Generation Combat Vehicles Cross-Functional Team (NGCV CFT) had said.

Shortly after the delivery of these prototypes soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division also conducted two weeks of live-fire testing of the RCV for the robot battle buddy which is expected to perform parallel to the next-generation combat vehicle as reported by Army Times.

The Alpha Company 1st Battalion 28th Infantry Regiment soldiers from Fort Benning Georgia held platoon-level live fires with the RCVs at Camp Grayling Michigan in late April 2021. These tests were first performed on a prototype platform before the delivery of the actual prototypes by the industrial developers.

During the live-fire testing soldiers used remote controls from behind a berm and located targets with the help of drone video feeds. Once the targets were located the soldiers struck these enemy vehicles with the M249 Squad Automatic Weapons M2 .50 caliber machine guns and Mk19 grenade launchers which were mounted onto the RCV stand-in.

The RCV-L is a diesel-electric hybrid vehicle with a gross weight of roughly 85000 pounds and a maximum payload of 7000 pounds. The vehicle can travel at a speed as high as 40 miles per hour. The RCV-M is also a diesel-electric hybrid vehicle and has a gross weight of 25000 pounds. This vehicle can travel at high speeds of over 25 miles per hour and is also equipped with a 30 mm cannon which is controlled remotely Defense News reported.

Modernized Equipment

According to reports several modernized military types of equipment such as robots tanks self-propelled artillery and infantry carriers are all going to be welcomed by the US Army in 2022. Many military experts are describing the coming year as “the year of the armored vehicle”.

According to Brig. Gen. Glenn Dean the Army’s program executive officer of ground combat systems the investments made by the Army in the past eight to ten years are all going to come into action in the year 2022. In a statement to The National Interest Dean said that the Army is going to begin the fielding of the Bradley A4 Infantry Fighting Vehicle to its 8th Brigade. The same brigade is also going to be the recipient of the upgraded Abrams tank.

All of these developments have been observed at a time when the Army has made various breakthroughs in the field of networking and artificial intelligence-based data processing and sharing as well as in reducing the time between the sensor and the shooter.

The Mobile Protected FirePower platform which is the Army’s light tank is also taking a huge step ahead as the service has begun making selections for its next phase.

Apart from these the Army is also set to receive its first upgraded version of the Self-Propelled Howitzer 155 mm artillery cannon. The Army has also made steady progress in the development of its Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle. The service has awarded various development deals to defense contractors to provide architecture designs for the new infantry carrier.

The Army is more focused on the aspects of digital engineering and computer simulations which are expected to form the conceptual and technological base for the service’s first Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle.

Each one of these advanced pieces of military equipment is developed keeping in mind a unique set of requirements and has a specific mission to perform. Many of these new combat vehicles are being developed for performing in a multi-domain battlefield which is an integral part of modern warfare and exchange surveillance and targeting specifics with fighter jets drones dismounted units and also Navy ships according to The National Interest.

“We need armored vehicles on the battlefield” Maj. Gen. Ross Coffman told The National Interest. “We need them in places of really really dangerous position. And ‘22 is going to launch the United States above any other country in the world based on the efforts that in the entire team we’re doing today” he added.",,,,,,,,,

Evans who served for 24 years in the United States Navy helped restart the local DAV chapter to help ensure that veterans have access to the benefits available to them.

As a member of the Navy from November 1968 until March 1992 Evans served as a sonar technician and achieved the rank of chief petty officer. Evans said he served on destroyers throughout his career.

""I just did my duty and didn't do anything extraordinary"" Evans said.

After retiring from the Navy Evans moved back to Siloam Springs and then worked for a time at Ozark Electronics in Gravette.

Evans spent a year there before moving on to Syroco as an electrician to help set up a department there. After spending several more years working for different companies like Marrs Electric in Springdale and Franklin Electric he began working for the Veterans Administration in Fayetteville.

He retired from the VA in 2013 after working for 10 years there he said. In 2002 Evans graduated from John Brown University with a degree in organizational management he said.

Evans joined DAV Chapter 50 in Siloam Springs and was a member until the chapter folded due to what Evans referred to as a ""power struggle"" according to an article in the Siloam Springs Herald-Leader on Jan. 28 2018.

Like many other veterans from the now-defunct DAV Chapter 50 Evans started attending the Springdale chapter. As a member of the Springdale chapter he became the go-to person in the western portion of Benton County so he had experience helping veterans in need Evans said.

In 2016 Evans had spoken to different members of the old Siloam Springs chapter and they all said they would like to see a new chapter of DAV in Siloam Springs Evans said.

""I knew there might be some interest in it so I asked around and asked the guys and so I said 'If you guys are willing I'll try to get it started'"" Evans said. ""So some of the other existing veterans here that were DAV members said that they would transfer into our chapter.""

The state chapter of DAV was excited at the prospect of starting a new chapter in Siloam Springs and agreed to Evans' request. It took a couple of years after Evans started the process for the club to be formed he said.

Part of the requirement to start a chapter involves getting 50 new members to join but in the case of Siloam Springs the national DAV organization waived half of the required number so Evans only needed to get 25 members to start the club.

Evans took it upon himself to start the process he said. In 2017 the state DAV and Evans set up a recruitment effort outside Siloam Springs.

He did not remember exactly when in 2017 the recruitment effort was held but said the state sent past state commander Richard Egan and its mobile unit to help with the process.

""He transferred a bunch of people in at the time so that we could have elections and officers"" Evans said.

In April of 2018 Evans received a letter stating that Siloam Springs had a new chapter of Disabled American Veterans he said.

The chapter was named Siloam Springs Disabled American Veterans Chapter 64 Evans said. At first Evans said he tried to get Siloam Springs' original chapter number back but the state denied his request. The next step was to have an organizational meeting which was held a month later Evans said.

""So we had an organizational meeting in May"" Evans said. ""We had their state adjutant come up and help run the meeting at that time there and just to help direct me on what I am supposed to do.""

For Evans being the commander was new for him he said. Evans had served as an officer for the Springdale chapter but taking charge was different he said.

Evans did all of the legal paperwork and in late 2018 the chapter received its nonprofit status which allowed the group to have fundraisers and apply for grants Evans said.

The state provided funds for Evans to help set up the Siloam Springs chapter of DAV he said. Little by little the Siloam Springs chapter began reaching out to help veterans in need Evans said.

When the Siloam Springs chapter began it had a little bit of money so the chapter only could help with $25 or maybe $50 to help here and there Evans said.

Today the Siloam Springs chapter can now help out a little bit better Evans said.

Presently the DAV chapter meets at 6 p.m. on the third Thursday of the month at the VFW hall Evans said. The chapter started out there but a lack of funds prevented it from remaining there Evans said.

The DAV chapter found a temporary home at John Brown University until the coronavirus pandemic started and the campus closed to the public Evans said.

The VFW voted to allow the club to return and meet at the VFW hall in exchange for help with other expenses Evans said. The pandemic provided other challenges for the chapter.

""We were not allowed to have meetings from the state at that point for quite a few months"" Evans said.

When the state did allow the chapter to meet it was at first limited to 10 people then 50 and 100 and then the number was reduced back to 10 Evans said.

After several false starts the DAV chapter started meeting again in June 2020 Evans said.

The future looks bright for DAV Chapter 64 Evans said. It is increasing membership and the current members are interested in doing different activities and fundraisers he said.

A popular fundraiser has been selling hot dogs at Atwood's. However the state limited the chapter to only one fundraiser a year in 2019 and the pandemic put an end to future fundraisers a year later. Plans are in the works to move the hot dog fundraiser to Tractor Supply Co. Evans said.

The DAV chapter also holds its Forget Me Not fundraiser at Harps in Siloam Springs and Gentry Evans said. The most recent fundraiser was on Nov. 17.

""We do it a couple three times a year at least"" Evans said. ""So it's very helpful.""

Every fall the DAV chapter hosts an annual Socks for Troops Evans said. Socks for Troops is a fundraiser in which people can donate socks or purchase socks to donate to DAV which would turn around and donate them to the VA home in Fayetteville Evans said.

The event is held from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31 Evans said. Anyone who wished to donate socks would bring them to Shoe Sensation where DAV has a box set up Evans said.

This year the VA home told Evans that it had a surplus of socks so Evans plans to donate them to the VA hospital which is also located in Fayetteville he said.

Evans said he wants people to know that DAV is here to help veterans with claims and benefits which is in the organization's mission statement. As a certified service officer Evans is able to help veterans to obtain the benefits they need he said.

This will be Evans' last year as commander of Siloam Springs' DAV chapter. Evans said he wants to get some new blood in the leadership. Evans plans to step down around June of next year he said.

Despite stepping down Evans will remain a member and will remain a service officer for the chapter he said.

""We're here to help the veterans in our community"" Evans said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbnJvZW5ld3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8xMi8yNi9wYXNzaW5nLXRyb29wZXItYnJvd24tZGlnaXRhbHMtdG9wLXN0b3J5LTIwMjEvOTAwNjQ1NjAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Passing of Trooper Brown was digital's top story of 2021,"A beloved Michigan State Police trooper losing his battle to COVID an inspiring story about a miracle child fighting a rare disease and some nefarious activity in Monroe County were part of this year's top 10 digital stories of the year.

The Jet

For New York City resident James Gilmer 28 long-distance travel by bus usually means something very specific: getting to and from his hometown of Pittsburgh during the holidays. It's a routine — and route — familiar from childhood when he and his sister would take Megabus to Manhattan to visit cousins for New Year's. Otherwise Gilmer now an artist with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater hasn't really been a regular bus rider apart from local commutes and occasional road tours to nearby cities with the dance company. ""I don't have anything against it"" he said referring to motorcoach leisure travel. ""But the specific situation of traveling from Pittsburgh to New York has a familiarity about it for me that doesn't exist anywhere else in terms of feeling comfortable aboard a bus.""

How to spend less on gas for your holiday road travel

Overspending uncertainty could spoil holiday travel fun in 2021

Here are the 10 most underrated national parks in the U.S. When it comes to consumer comfort levels bus travel often gets a bum rap. In the popular imagination buses are often the travel option of last resort. Given that bias said Florencia Cirigliano vice president of marketing for RedCoach — a luxury service with origins in Argentina that has operated in Florida since 2010 — her company saw an opportunity more than a decade ago. ""People here are used to bus travel but it's a different kind of bus travel"" she said. ""When we started people said 'What are you doing? Americans don't want buses.' ""But many people who would never get on a regular bus would probably jump out of their cars if they were given our kind of bus option"" Cirigliano said. Indeed someone's been riding buses — of all types — all this time in the U.S. According to Peter Pantuso president of the American Bus Association an industry group in 2019 nearly 3000 motorcoach companies provided a record 600 million passenger trips or so and employed about 100000 workers.

Then Covid hit. ""With point-to-point [buses] … overall it's probably about 50% of where it was in 2019 and slowly coming back"" he said referring to current passenger numbers. ""But every time there's a new variant you know the brakes go on and people pull back again."" Still Joseph Schwieterman professor in the School for Public Service Department of Public Policy and Sustainable Urban Development​ at DePaul University called this ""an exciting time"" in the industry which serves twice as many U.S. travelers as Amtrak. ""For the first time we have three big national brands: Greyhound Megabus and now FlixBus"" he said. (FlixBus USA parent FlixMobility acquired Greyhound on Oct. 21 but the brands have not been integrated.) ""They each feel pressure to keep up with the latest tech conveniences [such as] mobile boarding passes and bus tracker programs and Megabus even has reserved seats"" said Schwieterman. ""All three also stress value — rival service at an attractive price.""

One trend that's picked up steam in the last five years is business- or first-class motorcoach lines that offer point-to-point service along with limited luxury seating; food and drinks; and in some cases on-board attendants. They are also competitively priced compared to rail and air offerings on similar routes and are often highly discounted in comparison. ""There's a whole new breed of business-class services that are wooing airport-weary flyers"" said Schwieterman. ""The sweet spot is a distance of between 125 miles and 250 miles — maybe 300 on the absolute upside — where it's short enough that a bus trip doesn't take an eternity."" One obvious candidate is the New York-to-Washington corridor. The approximately 225-mile-long route is already served by airline shuttles Amtrak and several discount motorcoach lines yet new entrant The Jet launched direct first-class service between Hudson Yards in Manhattan and D.C.'s Metro Center in November starting at $99 one way.

Luxury motorcoach operater The Jet offers passengers its exclusive motion-canceling ""HoverSeat"" on New York-Washington trips. The Jet

That fare on a route where a business-class airline ticket can run $250 and up gets passengers a reserved ""HoverSeat"" motion-canceling seat with a 45-degree recline fast-streaming Wi-Fi; on-demand attendant service; and access to a large upscale restroom. In a nod to both comfort and Covid-awareness the number of seats was reduced to 14 from a planned 19; rows are spaced 6 feet apart; and a state-of-the-art UV air filtration system was installed. The JetSet rewards program will launch soon as well. The real standout aboard is the HoverSeat the first-ever application of existing commercial technology to passenger service according to Chad Scarborough founder and CEO of The Jet. An active independent seat suspension reads what's happening beneath riders 100 times per second — and reacts accordingly. ""If it feels a bump it measures the bump and then moves the seat in the exact opposite direction to counteract it"" he said noting that leg rests and tray tables move in sync with the seat. ""So you end up just kind of floating for the whole ride … seeing the bus bounce around you.""

Rethinking intercity bus travel

Scarborough said he wanted to completely rethink intercity travel. ""We're trying to eliminate all the pain points [and] create a true first-class experience from booking through destination — but at a very reasonable price"" he said. The Jet is offering two nonstop departures a day between New York and Washington between Friday and Sunday. Scarborough hopes to scale up to four departures per day every day of the week come spring and is also considering other point-to-point nonstop services in the two metro areas. Other motorcoach lines have been offering deluxe direct services for years. C&J Bus Lines recently upped frequencies of its existing services between New York and three cities in New England. Its buses to Portsmouth and Seabrook in New Hampshire and Tewksbury Massachusetts feature first-class double or single seating power outlets Wi-Fi and a self-service refreshment galley. For its part RedCoach — which has transported more than 25 million business and leisure travel passengers in the last decade on its existing Florida routes —expanded on Oct. 15 to Texas connecting Austin Dallas and Houston (with stops in Waco and College Station) with its fleet of 27-seat first-class or 38-seat business-class motorcoaches. Maximum one-way fares on Texas routes range from $60 to $120.

""When people try our seating and experience the comfort the Wi-Fi [and] the convenience of our [drop-off] locations compared to flying and going through the TSA and all they're kind of hooked"" said Cirigliano. What's more unlike airlines RedCoach doesn't charge for seat assignments or luggage (two pieces and a carry-on are allowed for free) and some routes offer on-board refreshments. The firm also offers a loyalty rewards program called RedRiders. The Covid-19 pandemic may have hit many transportation companies hard since March 2020 but RedCoach never stopped operating its lower-density coaches and the de facto on-board social distancing thanks to fewer seats became a selling point she said. Now rising gases prices are making the line's routes look even better to many Texans and Floridians who might other drive themselves. ""With all the wear and tear the mileage and how much it costs to fill your tank [driving] adds up"" Cirigliano said. ""We're luxury but also affordable and we want to make this concept available to everybody.""

This weekend and next weekend will mean crammed airports across the U.S. but it’s not holiday passenger surges that are driving airport usage and air travel needs in Kearney.

It’s month-by-month everyday increases in passenger volume and jetliner usage that have planners trying to predict how much larger Kearney Regional Airport should be to meet future travel needs.

As the number of passengers flying from Kearney Regional Airport continues growing so does the need for a larger terminal — and possibly larger aircraft.

On the drawing board for Kearney is a 22000-square-foot terminal that’s large enough to accommodate more and more passenger arrivals and departures TSA security protocols and the likely possibility of continued passenger growth.

In August Kearneyites got a preview of changes that likely are in store for their airport including additional paved parking and a significantly larger terminal.

A $12 million federally funded rebuild of the airport’s main runway was completed several year ago. The new 50-passenger United Express jetliners now serving Kearney are making good use of the runway improvements with daily flights to Denver International Airport and O’Hare International Airport in Chicago.

Adding flights to Chicago has boosted air travel out of Kearney as enplanements for 2021 illustrate.

With just one month to go in the calendar year 2021 boardings stand at 22411. Passenger volume is really taking off and likely will exceed 23000 enplanements according to figures provided by Kearney’s Assistant City Manager Eric Hellriegel.

The current passenger volume nearly doubles the numbers of just a few years ago when prop-driven 19-passenger aircraft flew from Kearney to Denver.

Passenger volume has significantly increased with the 50-passenger jetliners and as the boardings continue to climb it may soon be time to upgrade to larger 70-passenger aircraft according to discussions a few months ago.

All of those additional passengers mean additional baggage so the terminal will have new baggage handling equipment to handle the greater volume. The section of the terminal for preflight TSA checks also will be larger as will be the secure waiting area for passengers who have been screened.

""This is my third time traveling on Christmas Day and every time it's been like this. It's been alright"" Tommy Richardson of Fort Lauderdale said.

Air travel is up 60% from this time last year. During the 2021 Christmas holiday about 925000 people will fly in and out of Philadelphia international. Sisters Hazel Cross and Maggie Sheldon just spent a week with family and are now heading to Houston.

""We just thought it would be less people. People have gone to be at Christmas so it would be less of a headache and easier to travel"" Sheldon told CBS3.

There are no hiccups with their flight but staff sick calls and exposure to COVID have led to flight cancellations and delays across the nation. More than 900 flights were cancelled Saturday nationwide after nearly 700 flights were cancelled on Christmas Eve.

At PHL the 34 delays and 15 cancellations are mostly American Airlines followed by a handful of Delta cancellations.

(Xinhua/Tang Yi)

BRUSSELS Dec. 25 (Xinhua) -- It may not be unusual for people in Europe to come across the idea of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) on news media but it is highly likely that few have a clear idea about how the grand initiative is changing their lives.

LONGTIME PAIN IN THE NECK

An epic itinerary for holiday goers in Croatia is a drive along the coastline.

Along the picturesque hillside road beside the Adriatic Sea the drive can take one to most of the hotspot towns such as Zadar Split and Dubrovnik a must-go especially for Game of Thrones fans.

The journey can be satisfying except for one nuisance -- expect to wait in the car for hours under the scorching sun because of a border check.

The coastline of Croatia is cut off between the towns of Ploce and Dubrovnik by a narrow land of Bosnia and Herzegovina where border check points are set up. Travelers to Dubrovnik by land have to pass two check points one at each end of the 20-km-long road.

For ages this severed part of land has been a pain in the neck for people in Croatia which has long desired erecting a bridge over the sea to close the gap.

A DAUNTING PROJECT

In 2007 Croatia started to build the bridge but had to leave it unfinished due to a shortfall of funds in 2012.

After nearly four years of construction several piers were left in the water and the bridge was still nowhere in sight.

Croatia never gave up the project. After it became a member of the European Union in 2013 Croatia tapped EU fund for the bridge. With an investment of over 400 million euros (453 million U.S. dollars) Croatia revived the project.

Coincidentally China launched in the same year an initiative to bridge infrastructure gaps in countries across the Asia-Pacific region Africa and Central and Eastern Europe aimed at boosting economic growth and promoting shared prosperity through cooperation. The initiative is now widely known as the BRI.

Afterwards a wide range of countries benefited from the initiative with new roads ports and bridges built.

In 2018 the China Road and Bridge Corporation along with other Chinese companies won the bid for the 2.44-km-long sea-crossing bridge.

On July 28 the Croatian lands which used to be divided were connected together for the first time after the last missing part of the bridge was put into place.

It took the Chinese companies three years to piece the bridge together. It now takes minutes to drive from one end of the bridge to the other.

SILENT CONTRIBUTOR

While the bridge will vastly improve travel in Croatia other BRI projects are saving lives in Europe.

It wasn't long ago when Europeans were scrambling for masks surgical gowns and other protective gear at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. When sea freight was disrupted due to backlogs at ports and air freight was severely cut at the peak of the pandemic the China-Europe freight rail provided a much-needed lifeline.

Covering over 170 cities in more than 20 European countries the China-Europe freight trains have brought in hundreds of thousands tons of medical supplies including masks surgical gowns and other necessities to Europe.

MAKING EUROPE GREENER

Chinese companies involved in the BRI have never hesitated to bring their state-of-the-art technology to countries that need it most. In some European countries Chinese companies are playing a proactive role in helping local economies become greener.

Shanghai Electric Power Company has taken on the ambitious task of turning the Gozo Island of Malta into a carbon neutral territory in the country.

Through years of cooperation with local partners since 2014 the company brought its expertise to Malta overhauling and upgrading the power grid in the country and making frequent blackouts a thing of the past.

Given the EU's pledge for carbon neutrality by 2050 member countries including Malta have begun to take action to reduce emissions.

By installing an energy storage system on Gozo Shanghai Electric plans to transfer the electricity yielded by solar power and wind power stations to the system and make it carbon neutral. It is the first ""carbon neutral"" energy storage system in the country.

Meanwhile Chinese electric vehicle company Nio is witnessing a growing popularity with its products in Norway launching its first model ES8 in the Nordic country on Sept. 30.

Gunnar Birkenfelter founder of a car-sharing company in Norway wasted no time adding the ES8 to his fleet. He said roughly 10 percent of his company's cars are of Chinese brands.

Birkenfelter said Chinese automotive brands were of high quality and he wouldn't hesitate to recommend them.

Nio has committed itself to Norwegian market with a plan to install four battery swap stations in 2021 and more in the future.

The scale of the BRI's involvement in Europe continues to deepen with Chinese investors and their local partners closely collaborating across a variety of sectors. The BRI will ignite enormous change on the continent over time and impact the lives of Europeans for years to come.

""My flight out tomorrow is at 6 a.m. and this will be closed until 8 a.m."" said Jordan Simon standing in line to get a COVID test at SFO. ""I think it's a terrible line I think it's a terrible line for sure. From up there it says if you're here it's a three-hour wait. So this is like a five-hour line.""

Simon showed up the day before his flight to southeast Asia because he wasn't sure he could get a test before his flight on Monday. The airport offers walk-up testing in the international terminal but warned some people in the afternoon they would be unable to take a test before day's end.

""It's stressful absolutely stressful. We're just trying to take it as it comes and that's all you can do"" said Sandra Brown who planned to travel to Vancouver Canada with her family on Sunday. ""We've already had to re-book once today because our flight was canceled so I don't know what the availability would be to re-book for tomorrow because it's just a cascading backup of delays.""

Testing requirements affected the entire family at the airport even those young enough to avoid the requirement waited while their relatives tried to get their COVID-19 result.

""I waiting for my mother to get COVID testing and so is my father and sister and it's pretty harsh waiting for three hours long"" said Adhi Esturi. ""I really want to go to France but sometimes I don't think it's worth it.""

Others traveling to international destinations Sunday said they tried to get a test in advance only to learn their result was not valid and needed another test at the airport.

Passengers waiting for the chance to get tested said they were already prepared for their trip to be delayed again if they did not get through in time. It was not worth it for some of these passengers. For others it was the price they had to pay to be with family this holiday season.

""I will have to re-book I assume I don't know. We'll have to figure it out"" Sandra Brown told KPIX.

Over at the domestic terminals it was a lot quieter without many lines. Airlines canceled hundreds of flights on Sunday across the country once again impacting travelers around Christmas as the Omicron variant forced employees to miss shifts. Short-staffed flights kept planes from taking off on time for multiple days last week. There were only a handful of cancellations listed at SFO on Sunday."

He is cooking but more so the chef and director of operations at the Truist Culinary and Hospitality Innovation Center is teaching.

The class before him today is not the typical student he sees but an Osher Lifelong Learning class seeking direction about breads and rich dough.

Scheidhauer for his part looks entirely calm. He vacillates between jokes and rules and warnings and factoids about yeast flour and baking.

This is the last time he’ll stand in a classroom. After 28 years of shaping and leading the culinary program at Greenville Technical College Scheidhauer is stepping away from the classroom. At the age of 58 he is young but the seasoned chef is nothing if not astute at understanding timing and for him now is the time to go.

Scheidhauer steps away from nearly three decades of teaching leaving behind a career that has included building the Culinary Institute of the Carolinas and shaping the curriculum and within the past five years building the Truist Culinary and Hospitality Innovation Center (CHI). Both have evolved from needs Scheidhauer saw in the community. The former a need for more professional culinary training in the Upstate and the latter a need for quick jobs training and continuing education to fill a need within a growing industry.

He leaves behind a career full of accolades a legacy of culinary prowess that touches nearly every part of Greenville’s culinary scene.

“I hope what I do every day is a reflection of him” said Patrick Wagner who was one of Scheidhauer’s first students and who has worked alongside the chef as a culinary instructor at Greenville Tech for two decades. “Anybody you’ve worked with who’s been a mentor a teacher been involved in your life in so many different ways it’s kind of like you making somebody’s recipe and you can still tell it’s their recipe even though you’ve made it your own.”

A natural talent in the kitchen

If you ask Scheidhauer how he got to where he is he smiles throws his head back and laughs.

It is an infectious laugh that perhaps hides and reveals all at once.

To begin you must look at the chef’s hands. Scheidhauer has always been good with his hands. Those hands helped him learn to type 45 words a minute when he first made the transition to teaching and they helped him learn to ice cakes with precision and speed.

His father was equally skilled. As a kid growing up in the Southern Hills area of Pittsburgh Scheidhauer thought he’d follow in his father’s path perhaps working a solid trade like electrician or plumber but at the age of 13 the young chef wanted to make some money and that led him to a local bakery.

Scheidhauer loved working.

“It was the idea that I could become self-sufficient and non-dependent” said Scheidhauer who was one of six kids. “My dad worked so hard. It wasn’t really helping him; it was helping him not have me to depend on him.”

By the age of 15 Scheidhauer had saved enough money to buy his own car.

“Couldn’t drive it yet” he said with a laugh.

At the bakery Scheidhauer was immediately drawn to the cake decorators. He was fascinated at the way they moved creating such intricate designs but with a sort of athletic speed.

One day he asked if he could try it himself. He took a container of icing and a piping bag home and spent hours practicing on the back of a sheet pan. He’d pipe flowers and other decorations then scoop up the icing return it to the piping bag and try again.

Not long after Scheidhauer began working alongside the decorators and he grew more fascinated with baking and pastry.

It was also at this time that Scheidhauer met the teacher he lovingly calls “Mrs. C.” Mrs. C was a high school food sciences teacher who saw something in the young student and she urged him to consider a culinary career.

With Mrs. C’s help Scheidhauer was able to split his day working at the bakery and school. Under her guise Scheidhauer was able to compete in culinary competitions (then only for local trade schools).

At 16 Scheidhauer won first place in a wedding cake contest beating out the college-age culinary students.

“I just found a passion” Scheidhauer said. “I have a lot of respect for teachers because of that and was one of the reasons I wanted to give back.”

Carving a culinary path

When Scheidhauer talks about his life he has kind of a matter-of-fact way of sharing that belies the true effort it has taken to get where he is. He has devoted 44 years to the culinary profession he can do almost anything in a kitchen and do it with a speed that is inconceivable to the average person.

But Scheidhauer appears much more comfortable explaining the science of flours than himself.

It was Mrs. C that helped Scheidhauer apply to the Culinary Institute of America becoming the first in his family to go to college.

There his passion grew as did his skills. He was voted most likely to succeed an honor that remains one of the more meaningful honors of his life.

Post-graduation Scheidhauer worked at various restaurants and then found his way into the prestigious corporate club scene. He followed a job to Greenville in 1990 with Club Corporation of America becoming the executive chef at The Commerce Club.

It was during that time that Scheidhauer first connected with Greenville Technical College. Back then the school’s culinary program relied on industry professionals to teach many of the cooking techniques.

Wagner then a student remembers being a little intimidated by having Scheidhauer as a teacher.

“It was like man the chef from the Commerce Club is gonna teach our class” he said reminiscing. “That was a huge deal.”

Even then Wagner saw something special in the chef who would one day be a colleague.

“I think that one of the things that has really done well for Alan it’s the magic of knowing how to motivate somebody” Wagner said. “You want the same goal out of everybody. Some people need encouragement some need a hand dragging them along. Some need to be pushing somebody. He has that intuitiveness.”

While Scheidhauer enjoyed teaching the decision to do it full time really came down to family he says. As an executive chef Scheidhauer had missed being a father. The demands and the hours of the job meant he’d essentially missed the first four years of his son Jordan’s life.

Teaching he reasoned would allow him more work-life balance. It proved to provide him much more.

When Scheidhauer joined the team at Greenville Tech in 1993 the college’s culinary program was focused more on the hospitality side than the culinary arts side of the business.

But Greenville was growing and so was the need for more robust culinary program.

In 2008 when the college acquired the northwest campus then president Dr. Thomas Barton asked Scheidhauer to help move the culinary program to that campus. Scheidhauer took it as an opportunity to grow the program.

He spent countless months researching other programs around the country and designing a space that would best fill the needs of students and that could evolve with a changing culinary landscape.

The final design included intricate but functional instructional kitchens and recasting the program to offer more culinary arts. Scheidhauer renamed the program too The Culinary Institute of the Carolinas a title that conveyed professionalism and distinction.

“Even an expert in their field does not guarantee you can teach that is a skill in itself” said Dr. Keith Miller current president of Grenville Technical College. “Alan brings the background and the expertise in the culinary field but what gives him the ability to relay that information to the student is completely his approach. His approach is not condescending. He believes very strongly that everybody can be successful in the career they choose.

“His expectations are though that you have to put in the work to make it happen.”

Filling a new need

On a recent Monday Scheidhauer is reflecting on Greenville’s changing culinary scene. The landscape has grown exponentially he says pushing the need for trained talent but there is only one executive chef in a kitchen. The need for culinary skills crosses many arenas from not just restaurants but hotels hospitals schools country clubs and grocery stores.

Scheidhauer has always pushed students to think broadly about opportunity and he has always done the same. That is how the Culinary Institute’s sustainable agriculture program came to be and it is partly how the CHI came to be too.

The community and the industry needed access to quick jobs training and continuing education. Scheidhauer along with a team of food and beverage experts and college officials thus conceived of CHI. The newest piece of the Greenville Technical College culinary program sits at Poe West in the heart of West Greenville.

CHI is distinct for its ability to offer classes for both people within the industry and outside of it. The duality allows CHI to offer scholarships to people seeking professional job training but not necessarily a two-year culinary degree.

Scheidhauer is clearly proud.

But you have to know when to step away he says. This is not an end but a chance to learn more — piano is on his list among other things. And as with his decision to go into teaching the one to step away from it is rooted in family.

Now he has grandchildren.

“It’s time to be grandpa” he said letting forth a deep laugh.

“When I started learning this business there were so many things it was like I can’t get bored doing this” Scheidhauer said. “There are so many different avenues for me to learn.”

Scheidhauer pauses and then finishes his thought.

“There still is.”

55-year-old Mike Tyson is still fit enough to enter the boxing ring and trade haymakers. He faced former two-division champion Roy Jones Jr. in an exhibition in 2020 after a 15-year-long hiatus from pro-boxing. Hence it verifies Tyson to have followed a lifestyle like an athlete.

Although ‘Iron’ has admitted to being a regular smoker now he still keeps a check on his diet and fitness drills. He shocked several people by revealing his gigantic physique ahead of the Roy Jones fight. Meanwhile several more fighters have called him out and a right payday can bring back ‘Iron’ to action.

Amidst all of it Tyson leads a busy life outside the ring too and has recently revealed the diet that helps him sustain it all. While he followed a very strict food habit back in his prime time the former heavyweight champion follows it to this day.

In an exclusive interaction with Westword when asked about his current diet Tyson said “Mostly rice and beans. Could be an Impossible burger. Could be some bison.”

“I eat very little meat; probably like 2 percent of my food is meat. I think it would be refried beans or hummus.”

Matthew Stafford had his first three-interception game since Sept. 10 2018 when he was picked off four times for Detroit against the New York Jets. But the Rams (11-4) still had more than enough to win their fourth straight game and pass Arizona (10-5) for first place in the NFC West.

Kirk Cousins had 315 yards on 27-for-38 passing with a touchdown to K.J. Osborn with 8:21 remaining that cut the lead to 27-20. But his interception in the end zone in the first quarter loomed large all afternoon.

Alexander Mattison filled in for COVID-19-absent Dalvin Cook and had 70 total yards and a score for the Vikings (7-8) who failed for the fourth time this season to push their record above .500.

Anthony Barr picked off Stafford twice both deep in Rams territory and the Vikings turned them into 10 points. Stafford went 21 for 37 for 197 yards and a fourth-quarter touchdown pass to Odell Beckham Jr. but he was out of sync for most of the game with several other throws that could've been intercepted.

Cousins was the sharper quarterback coming off a couple of rough games but he still couldn't get the Vikings a win. Only one of their first nine possessions went longer than 15 yards — that ended with Travin Howard picking off Cousins in the end zone after a pass intended for Osborn was deflected in tight coverage by Darious Williams.

That was the fourth interception in the last three games for Cousins. He was picked off only three times in the first 12 games.

Jalen Ramsey kept Justin Jefferson on lockdown much of the game but he still had eight catches for 116 yards. He passed fellow LSU alum and pal Beckham for most receiving yards in a player's first two seasons (2851). Beckham had 2755.

Cooper Kupp had a 37-yard reception on third down in the fourth quarter to help put the game away. He had 10 catches for 109 yards to become the first player with at least 90 receiving yards in 14 games of a single season. Antonio Brown (2014) and Michael Irvin (1995) did so in 13 games.

Vikings receiver Adam Thielen returned from a two-game absence with three catches for 40 yards but he aggravated his ankle injury twice and barely played in the second half. Cook was joined on the COVID-19 reserve list by backup quarterback Sean Mannion and backup offensive tackle Rashod Hill.

Special to the Detroit Free Press

Images of the era are searing.

In one a gaunt man holds a hand-lettered placard that reads “WORK IS WHAT I WANT — NOT CHARITY. WHO WILL HELP ME GET A JOB?”

The stock market crash of 1929 hit the nation like a sucker punch. Shocked by the unexpected calamity both ordinary wage earners and businesspeople braced themselves for the worst. The following years proved so draconian that by 1933 Detroit’s city government was forced to meet its payroll with scrip — a substitute for real money.

Detroit essentially printed its own greenbacks authentic-looking bills that still circulate today — among collectors.

Leading the city during one of its darkest hours was an empathetic guide Mayor Frank Murphy the former Recorder’s Court judge who would go on to serve as Michigan governor U.S. attorney general and a U.S. Supreme Court justice.

During his tenure Murphy saw his role as similar to that of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Intimately attuned to the plight of the unemployed Murphy established the Mayor’s Unemployment Committee that set up soup kitchens and vegetable gardens to serve needy people. Murphy even dined with jobless men at free-food sites.

Detroit also had a Welfare Department one of the few such municipal agencies in the nation. In 1932 the department assisted homeless families by placing them in vacant homes owned by the city. The support was urgently needed. According to the Free Press by the summer of 1932 landlords threatened some 100 tenants per day with eviction.

Massive layoffs at each of the Detroit automakers made the city's situation especially acute. Eighty percent of Detroit’s manufacturing capacity stood idle. By 1933 Michigan’s jobless rate stood at 34% while Detroit’s rate of tax delinquencies was the highest in the nation.

Amid the financial carnage Roosevelt took Michigan in a landslide in 1932 making FDR the first Democrat to carry the state since Franklin Pierce in 1852. Determined to respond with bold action the new president also saw his role as counselor to the nation.

“When you get to the end of your rope tie a knot and hang on” Roosevelt told Americans.

A run for the money

As the Depression wore on Detroiters in early 1933 began to withdraw from their accounts to tide themselves over. The First National Bank of Detroit was forced to honor some $250 million in withdrawals. Collectively as much as $3 million weekly was flowing from the city’s financial institutions which also included the Guardian National Bank of Commerce and the Union Guardian Trust Company. If these institutions were to fail experts believed the remaining banks in Michigan — and eventually the nation — would soon follow.

As an emergency measure Michigan Gov. William Comstock declared a state bank holiday at 1 a.m. Feb. 14. Intended at first to last only eight days it was extended to March 6. On that date the newly inaugurated Roosevelt alarmed at panic withdrawals nationwide imposed a national bank holidaywhich remained in effect until March 13. These measures put a pause on all banking activity avoiding potentially disastrous bank runs until a permanent solution could be found.

While the bank holidays allowed the institutions to avert insolvency they left a huge problem — how were people supposed to survive without access to their cash? The solution was one of last resort: scrip — also known as promissory notes — that would circulate as an alternate medium of exchange.

On Feb. 25 even before Michigan’s holiday was declared the Detroit Clearing House Association announced its intention to begin issuing scrip to its member banks. Counterparts in other cities soon followed.

On March 5 City of Detroit Controller Charles Richter revealed a city scrip program to pay municipal employees. While born out of emergency the effectiveness of the program stands out as a civic success story albeit a stopgap one.

The program paid all municipal salaries including those of police and firefighters in scrip in place of cash. City merchants willing to accept the alternate currency could redeem it as payment against outstanding city tax debts.

The city even allowed tenants whose landlords’ taxes were in arrears to present their scrip at the City Treasurer’s Office. A receipt would be issued that satisfied the person’s rent obligation with the funds being credit toward the owner’s tax debt. The scrip document’s fine print states that it was technically a municipal bond thus avoiding the legal prohibition against a local government issuing its own currency.

At first the business community embraced the program wholeheartedly. Period ads in the Free Press from businesses as varied as boarding houses to the J.L. Hudson Co. promote their willingness to accept the scrip.

“City Scrip Accepted for Room and Meals—Barlum Hotel Cadillac Square at Bates St” reads an ad from May 1933.

Publix Theaters a national operator of movie houses advertised its acceptance of city scrip at its three Detroit venues the Fisher the Riviera and the Michigan.

But after a short time several downtown businesses collected far more of the ersatz cash than they anticipated.

“City scrip has been coming in so rapidly that we that we now have accepted almost sufficient to pay our entire city tax bill for this year” Hudson General Manager Oscar Webber said.

Hudson began accepting scrip only for payments on charge accounts. Soon after Detroit Edison and Michigan Bell Telephone followed suit.

Times were different

Fortunately the situation was only temporary.

By the first half of 1934 the city’s fortunes had improved as tax receipts had more than doubled from 1933. After July the city terminated the issuance of new scrip but would continue to credit scrip still in circulation against outstanding tax bills. If the presenter had no tax debt the notes could be redeemed for cash.

Although it worked during the Depression years as a response to the banking crisis a hypothetical scrip program during a financial calamity in the 21st century would not be feasible. Wayne State University law professor John Mogk explained such a move would be devastating for the city’s bond and credit ratings. Also factors contributing to the city’s cash position are very different than in 1933.

“Today the city benefits from a diverse array of funding sources including the municipal income tax utility tax and state revenue sharing — none of which existed in 1933” Mogk said.

To gain the confidence of the public city of Detroit scrip notes were engraved documents of high quality and mimicked the appearance of real cash. Notes were issued in denominations of $1 to $1000.

Today surviving specimens can be found in antique shops and on various collectors’ websites. A $1 note in good condition can go for as much as $50. Not a bad interest rate!

Just don’t try to use one to pay your light bill.

But that might not mean much on Sunday.

Stafford is in his first season with the Los Angeles Rams (10-4) who take on the Vikings (7-7) at U.S. Bank Stadium. He had played the previous 12 seasons with the mostly woeful Detroit Lions and had a 74-90-1 overall record as a starter.

“I always thought he was a top-tier quarterback in this league’’ Vikings cornerback Patrick Peterson said on the podcast All Things Covered that he co-hosts with former NFL cornerback Bryant McFadden. “He just happened to play for the Detroit Lions.”

Stafford last was on a team that defeated the Vikings in October 2017. He then lost his next six meetings with them by an average margin of 11.3 points.

But Stafford’s situation got much better when he was traded last March to the Rams who have an abundance of talent. His wide receivers include Cooper Kupp who leads the NFL with 122 catches and 1625 receiving yards Odell Beckham Jr. a three-time Pro Bowl selection who is starting to regain his old form after some struggles in Cleveland and steady Van Jefferson.

“He’s obviously got more weapons’’ said Vikings coach Mike Zimmer.

At least the Vikings have plenty of familiarity with Stafford who has thrown for 4142 yards this season with 35 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions. The Vikings went against him two times a year with he was with Detroit a period Zimmer called “forever.’’ And Zimmer said his style of play this season has been “very similar.”

“He’s one of the toughest quarterbacks I think I’ve ever played’’ said Vikings co-defensive coordinator Adam Zimmer. “He takes a bunch of hits and keeps on getting back up. He gets back up and slings the ball. He’s got a great arm is very mobile in the pocket and I think he’s really thriving in this system.’’

When Stafford was with Detroit the Vikings had plenty of success in sacking him. They dumped him a team-record 10 times in a 2018 game and six other times sacked him five or more times.

But that was against the Lions’ offensive line and when he had their receivers. Much has changed since then.

“He finally has a solid team around him that can help him win and not just put everything on his shoulders and he can just go out there and play … stress-free football’’ Peterson told reporters.

On Sunday it will be seen how much stress Peterson has. He was asked on the podcast about covering Kupp.

“They move him everywhere’’ Peterson responded. “You pray. You literally pray because he can find the holes in the zones.”

RAMSEY’S RESPONSE

Vikings star wide receiver Justin Jefferson said he has “circled” on his calendar his first matchup against Rams star cornerback Jalen Ramsey and that he considers it a “statement game.”

Ramsey responded to what Jefferson said.

“I saw it. … He wants to be an extreme competitor’’ Ramsey said. “He wants to prove that he’s one of the best in the league and he’s trying to get my respect calling me one of the best in the league. But we all know how these matchups go. Sometimes you get ‘em sometimes you don’t. I live for them as well. … I haven’t had this day circled. … I try to play every game the same.”

Nevertheless Ramsey has plenty of appreciation for Jefferson.

“He is a heck of a football player and regardless of our matchup he’s already one of the best in the league’’ Ramsey said. “I do have a lot of respect for him but we’re going to get after it for sure.”

ROSTER UPDATES

The Vikings did not elevate fullback Jake Bargas from the practice squad on Saturday making it likely that fullback C.J. Ham listed as questionable with a hamstring injury will play against the Rams. Wide receiver Adam Thielen who has missed the past two games with left high ankle sprain also was listed as questionable and he is likely to return against the Rams.

The Rams will be without starting left tackle Andrew Whitworth who was placed Saturday on the COVID-19 reserve list. The Rams brought up wide receiver Brandon Powell and defensive back Grant Haley from the practice squad and activated running back Buddy Howell off injured reserve for possible use against the Vikings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy56YW5lc3ZpbGxldGltZXNyZWNvcmRlci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIxLzEyLzI2L3B1YmxpYy1yZWNvcmQtbXVza2luZ3VtLWNvdW50eS1yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS10cmFuc2ZlcnMvODg5NzgxNDAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Public Record: Muskingum County Real Estate Transfers,"Zanesville Times Recorder

One driver said the riders confirmed to him that they were in the U.S. illegally. Another said he deduced their immigration status based on the circumstances such as getting picked up with bags alongside large groups in remote locations near the border with destinations at hotels. Fox News granted both anonymity so they could speak freely.

""I just will get a notification of a pickup head down to the location and there will be a group of 20 plus immigrants standing on the corner waiting for Ubers"" one driver told Fox News. ""It’s legit in the middle of nowhere.""

The drivers told Fox News that many of the illegal immigrants ask to be dropped off at local hotels in the Yuma area.

Fox News asked Uber a series of questions such as whether the ride-share company was aware that illegal immigrants were using its services to travel to the U.S. interior or what it had done to assist its drivers. An Uber spokesperson's response didn't answer the questions besides indicating that drivers can cancel rides if they feel unsafe and can call the police to report suspicious activity.

But a second Uber driver pointed out that he won't know whether riders are illegal immigrants when he accepts the trip. He said law enforcement gave him a warning for transporting illegal immigrants.

""Technically it’s illegal to transport illegals"" the driver told Fox News.

Instead the Uber spokesperson detailed efforts the company took to combat human trafficking saying the company provided its drivers with educational tips.

The surge in Uber pickups began within the last several weeks according to the drivers just as the Biden administration announced a plan to reimpose the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy which requires asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while awaiting immigration court dates in the United States.

Yuma Arizona

Yuma Mayor Doug Nicholls said he'd heard that illegal immigrants were receiving rides from Uber drivers.

""This is new. This is not something that is a normal standard operating procedure"" Nicholls told Fox News. ""The MPP [Migrant Protection Protocols] or the ‘Remain in Mexico’ program coming back online is correlated to roughly where this happens.""

He said the latest surge overwhelmed Border Patrol for a few days causing a backlog that led illegal immigrants to give up on waiting for agents to apprehend them after a few hours and instead continue on their journey through Uber.

Nicholls also told Fox News that Uber has not reached out to his office about illegal immigrant pickups.

The second driver told Fox News that he believes most of the illegal immigrants he picks up are asylum seekers. He said riders sometimes ask to be delivered to U.S. authorities where they can then be processed and given a court date.

""They … just set the destination to the Border Patrol headquarters"" he said.

""We’re kind of put in between a rock and a hard place because it’s coming through the app and then we don’t know that they’re illegals until you start talking to them"" he continued. ""You find out and it's like too late now I'm not just going to drop them off somewhere.""

He said one group he drove had little kids with them and another included an elderly woman who couldn't walk well.

""You feel bad for them"" he told Fox News.

Dawed Mekonene 30 was charged on Dec. 20 with sexually motivated kidnapping battery by strangulation with intent to commit sexual assault and two counts of sexual assault police said shortly thereafter.

The female victim told police she ordered a ride on Dec. 16 and Mekonene arrived in his green Toyota Camry the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said.

""During the ride the victim fell asleep in the backseat of the vehicle and woke up as Mekonene began to sexually assault her"" police said. ""After the assault the victim was driven to the originally requested destination.""

The victim whose age was not provided reported the attack to police shortly after 1:15 a.m. on Dec. 18.

The Las Vegas Review-Journal identified Mekonene as a driver for Uber and said the company provided police with Mekonene’s drive records which show that the trip started in the area of the Las Vegas Strip and ended at an apartment complex about six miles away. But Uber records show Mekonene allegedly ended the trip midway through but restarted it after 22 minutes at which point he dropped the victim off at her originally requested stop the report says. The woman was reportedly from out of state.

Arrest records obtained by the news site describe the terrifying series of events detailing how the woman dozed off about five minutes after the trip began and awoke during the back-seat assault. He allegedly then strangled the woman until she fell unconscious.

When they arrived at the woman’s stop he ""pulled her out of the car and threw her clothes and other belongings at her"" the report states noting that the drop-off events were caught on surveillance footage.

Mekonene was still in jail as of Sunday morning. The local district attorney’s office ultimately dropped the kidnapping charge against him but without the three other counts. Records show he was ordered held on $200000 cash bail on Thursday. He is due back in court on Dec. 30.

Las Vegas Justice Court records did not identify an attorney for Mekonene but indicated he was being represented by a public defender. Mekonene’s public defender could not be reached for comment Sunday using a phone number provided in court records.

This Florida drone delivery start-up plans to offer Uber-like deliveries.

By Jim Magill

Everyone is familiar with delivery services such as Door Dash and Uber Eats which allow consumers to order deliveries of food by accessing an app on their smart phone. Now a small Florida-based start-up company is hoping to offer the same service nation-wide featuring delivery by drone.

Zing Drones is gearing up to train potential Part 107 pilots in the use of the company’s winch technology developed for use on DJI Inspire 2 drones. At the outset Zing will employ its own pilots to fly company-owned drones with the ultimate goal of enlisting private drone pilots who will act as independent contractors using their own drones to make deliveries Ian Annase Zing Drones founder and CEO said.

Annase said the company plans sometime next year to hire a regional flight manager to begin the training process. As the company expands its operations into different U.S. cities additional flight managers would be hired.

“We want the pilots to go through some training with Zing before they start flying with us to make sure they know how to operate the winch” he said. “The pilots if they have an Inspire 2 — that’s our go-to drone for home delivery — we would be able to attach our piece of hardware to it.”

Once trained these pilots would then fly on fixed schedules determined by the flight manager in their respective areas.

Funding a drone delivery start-up

The company which hopes to begin making commercial deliveries next year is currently earning revenue through sales of its drone kits including the winch hardware and the drone. “We have the ordering app linked up in Stripe” Annase said. “We’ve done a few demos around the United States just showing what the platform can do.”

Zing raised $75000 last year in a pre-seed round of funding and is currently raising equity with a crowd-funding campaign through an online fundraising site a common strategy used by other drone start-up companies. Annase said the company hopes to raise $10000 through this method.

“Once we get to $100000 we should start ramping up” he said. The company’s ultimate goal is to raise $750000 in equity funding.

Zing has conducted several test deliveries under the FAA’s Part 107 which allows a drone pilot to fly over a body of water while maintaining a visual line of site with the aircraft. In one such test conducted in New Orleans a pilot flew a payload of beignets over the Mississippi River. The company plans to begin doing Part 107 deliveries in the small Tampa Bay community of Tierra Verde within the next month or two.

The next step for the drone delivery start-up is to obtain the Category 3 certification from the FAA which would allow its pilots to fly over people in order to make deliveries in suburban areas within a one-mile radius of the flight’s point of origin Annase said.

“Right now we’re very limited under Part 107 which is very location-based” he said.

The ultimate goal for Zing is to obtain the right to conduct package delivery by drone through the FAA’s Part 135 air carrier certification “the only path for small drones to carry the property of another for compensation beyond visual line of sight” according to the FAA’s website.

Once Zing gets the go-ahead to make commercial drone deliveries under Part 135 customers will have two options to order their drone-delivered meals: By placing their order through the Zing ordering app which is available in the App Store; or they call up any restaurant that offers drone delivery as an option.

“Either way it gets loaded into our system and once the order is ready for pickup the pilot would take off from their fixed location and go to the restaurant” Annase said. Once the drone is hovering above the restaurant the pilot will deploy the winch device to lower a hook down to an employee at the restaurant who would attach the delivery order.

The pilot will then use the winch to bring the food up to the drone to be flown toward the waiting customer. Once it arrives above its designated destination the package will be lowered down again using the winch.

“The way the hook works is it automatically drops off the package with gravity. There doesn’t have to be anybody under it to receive it” Annase said. He said the delivered products could be dropped off in the customer’s yard or directly into a smart-mailbox system. Zing is currently working with two smart- mailbox companies to set up their systems in neighborhoods where the company plans to initiate its direct deliveries.

The drone would then return back to its home base where the pilot will swap out the drone’s battery to prepare it for the next delivery.

Zing’s patent-pending winch system is designed to be attached to existing drones. “The one we built for the Inspire 2 is going to be a universal platform” Annase said. With the addition of an adaptor plate the winch can be fitted onto any similarly sized drone.

As designed the winch can lift a payload of about 5 pounds but it can be customized to handle heavier payloads in accordance with the individual customer’s needs. “We can adjust the torque” he said. “It’s a tradeoff. We can lift more weight with it. It’s a matter of the use case and how fast they need [the payload] to be dropped off.

While Zing plans to begin its delivery operations in its home state of Florida the company eventually hopes to expand its business model to cities across the U.S. “We’ve done demos with this platform in Ontario California; Los Angeles Detroit Miami and St. Petersburg” Annase said.

Then some of the credits began getting clawed back (“revoked”). At this point it looks like this is just a mistake and the rest of the credits will probably get clawed back soon. Bummer!

Happy Holidays from American Express! Many (or all?) Amex Gold cardholders received an extra $10 in Uber Cash last night.

I received a notification from Uber Eats just after 6pm on Christmas Day advising that I’d received my $10 monthly Amex award and that it’ll expire on January 1. I ignored it at first as I assumed it was simply a delayed notification as I knew I’d already received our $10 credits for December on the night of November 30.

Nick subsequently messaged asking if anyone else had received this additional $10 credit. That prompted me to check my Uber Eats app and to my surprise I saw that I had indeed received a $10 bonus amount. It seemed strange that we only received one credit though because we have two Amex Gold cards registered on my Uber Eats account and so receive two $10 credits each month. Sure enough 1.5 hours later another $10 appeared.

Considering the day that Amex Gold cardholders received these $10 bonus credits I’m assuming that these were unexpected Christmas gifts rather than it being some kind of glitch. Personal Amex Platinum cardholders already receive a bonus $20 Uber Eats credit in December on top of the $15 they receive as standard so it’ll be interesting to see if this $10 bonus for Amex Gold cardholders is a one-off gift or a permanent enhancement. Having said that perhaps there was some kind of Amex intern working on Christmas Day who was worried that the bonus Uber Eats credits for December hadn’t gone out not realizing those are only meant to be for Platinum cardholders rather than Gold cardholders. Whatever the reason getting an extra $10 per Amex Gold card is a nice little bonus to end Christmas Day with.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTAzNDMzMDkvVWJlci1kcml2ZXItY2hhcmdlZC1yYXBpbmctcGFzc2VuZ2VyLVZlZ2FzLXJpZGUuaHRtbNIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTAzNDMzMDkvYW1wL1ViZXItZHJpdmVyLWNoYXJnZWQtcmFwaW5nLXBhc3Nlbmdlci1WZWdhcy1yaWRlLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas Uber driver is charged with raping sleeping tourist,"An Uber driver was charged with raping a female passenger who fell asleep before waking up as she was attacked during a ride in metro Las Vegas according to authorities.

Thieves smashed through the glass front doors of the Ulta Beauty at the Peninsula Shopping Center on Indian Peak Road said Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Sgt. John Apostle before grabbing numerous pieces of merchandise and stuffing them into a waiting car.

The break-in occurred at around 6 p.m. on Friday Apostle said. Sheriff’s officials didn’t know Sunday whether the store was open on Christmas Eve or if any shoppers or staff were there at the time.

Sheriff’s deputies stopped the car in Harbor City at around 6:30 p.m. and Apostle said deputies found items from the cosmetics store inside. One person with the car was arrested but was not identified Sunday.

Officials haven’t said how many people they’re looking for in connection with the crime.

My teens were the acne-fighting years; my 20s the great glow quest; and my 30s are all about neck and décolleté skin care. Yes with things like tech neck sun spots and collagen loss rearing their ugly heads I’ve waged a beauty battle so to speak enlisting all manner of skin care specifically designed for the sub-chin region.

The thing is despite all the products out there the neck and chest are still way too often overlooked and typically neglected until the 11th hour. A shame since many say it’s more susceptible to signs of premature aging due to the delicacy of the skin in that area. Sun damage crepiness and collagen breakdown are all common symptoms of neglected necks and décolletés. And I don’t remember ordering any of these things.

“On the neck the skin starts to crepe and not just because the skin starts to thin out [as we age] but because our facial muscles start to sag and out neck is holding everything up” says Tera Valdez esthetician and co-founder of microcurrent skin care company NuFace in a recent Instagram Live post. “So naturally when those muscles start to sag everything [beneath it] starts to loosen.”

Yikes. For this reason I’m on a constant quest to defy gravity and keep the area taught and smooth as can be. Over the years I’ve developed a nice arsenal of tools creams serums and masks for the space below my jawline — and I make sure to carve out a few extra minutes each day to ensure the region gets just as much love as my face.

Because the skin is so delicate and prone to dryness I’ve learned that rich hydrating formulas are the best way to go so I opt for products with buzzy ingredients like hyaluronic acid antioxidants and peptides. In a Jan 2021 article on neck care products board-certified dermatologist Dr. Ava Shamban told TZR that the neck has thinner skin and fewer oil glands than the face making skin-protective ingredients like ceramides and peptides crucial.

Also just like the contours of the face tools and devices can (and should) be employed for the neck and chest area to keep the skin firm and lifted. I’ve long sung the praises of microcurrent wonder the NuFace Trinity for the face and I’m happy to report it also works its sculpting and tightening magic on my neck and décoletté.

On Christmas Eve 1.7 million people were screened at airport checkpoints according to TSA figures. The day before 2.2 million were.

That’s a 166 percent increase over the same two days in 2020 when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged Americans not to fly on account of that winter’s COVID-19 surge.

This year officials have only asked that Americans be “prudent” with their travel plans in the face of the Omicron variant.

The two-day total is 76 percent of air travel volume for those days in 2019 the numbers show.

The new variant’s late-December surge has coincided with hundreds of flight cancellations with United Airlines blaming staffing shortages stemming from the spike. “The nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation” a rep for the carrier said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A mix of Maryville High and Northwest Missouri State students local residents and out-of-town working professionals have united to form the Maryville Mutineers Maryville’s first official paintball team.

“Creating an official paintball team was always a part of the business plan when starting this company” Chelsey Clark The Fields Paintball co-owner said. “It’s a great opportunity for the players because it gives them a chance to compete at a level above our local facilities and brings a lot of positive exposure for Maryville from the paintball community.”

Clark said the team consists of a lot of new talent mixed in with some experienced tournament players and are coached by Cody Morrison.

“(Cody) has a long history of playing on different paintball teams in tournaments and also coaching” she said. “You’ll find him around the park not only teaching The Mutineers but also helping out new players and of course getting in on some games himself.”

The Maryville Mutineers are registered through the Paintball Leagues International and will compete in a variety of tournaments through the state and the Midwest including the Midwest Paintball Players League this spring.

The team gets together every other weekend to officially practice but Clark said team members come in as often as The Fields is open for practice and play to hone their skills.

Clark said The Mutineers are currently looking for sponsors to help with mileage lodging food jerseys paint and more.

“We’re looking for different sponsors to help alleviate those costs from our individual team members” she said. “We don’t want anyone on the team to feel like they can’t participate just because they can’t afford to travel to the different tournaments.”

Clark along with David Baker started their Mobile Paintball operations in April of this year and then opened The Fields park in October.

They offer open play paintball equipment rentals low-impact kid’s paintball private party reservations and a pro shop. The park is open year-round and includes a kid’s course woodsball speedball hyperball and recball.

During an economic depression causing mass unemployment and grinding poverty landlords tried to hike rents by 33 percent. With their cry to “fight the landlord as they had the Czar” the tenants won a partial victory with rents significantly reduced for two thousand households.

The movement established a tradition of militant working-class housing campaigns that eventually contributed to winning vital rent controls that still protect millions of the city’s tenants today. As the COVID crisis continues New York City renters are again organizing against rapacious landlordism.

The 1907–8 rent strike was led by a remarkable woman Pauline Newman who had arrived in the United States from Lithuania in 1901 aged about nine (her birth certificate was lost along the way). She was one of 2 million Jews who arrived in the country between 1881 and 1924 escaping antisemitic pogroms. Still a child she started work first making hairbrushes and then in the notorious Triangle Shirtwaist Factory.

Newman had been exposed to radical ideas in her homeland where one trade unionist commented that “behind every volume of the Talmud was a volume of Marx.” Still young she argued against gender segregation in the synagogue and demanded the schooling that was often denied girls. Her political education continued in America through the pages of the mass circulation Yiddish-language socialist newspaper the Jewish Daily Forward and in discussion groups that included some of the left luminaries of the time.

Pauline Newman was the epitome of “intersectionality” long before the term was coined. She became known as “the East Side Joan of Arc” combining housing activism with trade unionism socialism the fight for women’s suffrage and gender and sexual equality. As a gay woman who raised a child with her partner and assumed a nontraditional style of dress she lived in a way that challenged patriarchal orthodoxy and died in 1986 after a lifetime devoted to the struggle that saw her go from “the garment shop floor to positions of influence in the American labor movement” according to Annelise Orleck’s 1991 book Common Sense and a Little Fire.

The legacy and contemporary relevance of Pauline Newman abounds. Inspired by the 1907 rent strike in November 1909 she helped build the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union (ILGWU) and its “Uprising of 20000” against the exploitation of the textile industry. After two hours of indecision at a mass meeting at the Cooper Union one of the workers Clara Lemlich Shavelson famously said “I am tired of listening to speakers. . . . I offer a resolution that a general strike be declared — now!” Once again the strikers’ demands were only partially met — but their women-led grassroots campaigning challenged both the employers and the male-dominated union hierarchy leading to a wave of industrial action by textile workers across the United States.

The tradition of working-class New Yorkers fighting for a better life extended beyond housing. ILGWU members were also heavily involved in a succession of protests and boycotts against excessive food prices beginning with a boycott of Kosher butchers in 1902. As the New York Times put it “when East Siders don’t like something they strike.” In 1914 the ILGWU founded the Union Health Center to provide medical care to its members; they also promoted education projects in the same period including the successful Workers’ University.

By March 1911 Pauline Newman was working with the US Socialist Party alongside Eugene Debs when the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire killed 146 workers. The negligence of the factory’s bosses was yet another example of the corporate manslaughter that still puts working-class lives at risk from the sweatshops of Dhaka to Grenfell Tower. But the ILGWU kept up the struggle for better conditions at work and at home. The union was part of a highly significant movement to build cooperative housing developments for New York City workers several of which survive today: the Penn South development in central Manhattan for example was sponsored by the ILGWU and continues to provide 2820 truly affordable homes in the heart of one of the world’s most unaffordable cities.",,,,,,,,,

Without access to timely routine checkups and testing during the wait period particularly for pregnant parents and newborn babies health conditions can worsen and have lifelong consequences researchers at the Centre for Gender and Sexual Health Equity at the University of British Columbia found.

With clear evidence of the harm done to mostly poor and racialized migrants by B.C.'s policy a coalition of 19 migrant rights poverty reduction civil liberties and labour groups are calling on the province to repeal the policy permanently.

“We can talk for days about the health impacts of the policy” said Omar Chu an organizer with Sanctuary Health in the Lower Mainland. “And at the same time it's also an emotional impact of people who struggle for permanent residence they're not eligible for the universal public health care that so many Canadians consider a core value.”

When someone moves to B.C. whether from another province or from another country on any type of visa they are not eligible for basic provincial health coverage for the remainder of the month they arrived plus two additional calendar months.

B.C. is the only province that has such a wait period without exceptions for newborn babies and pregnancy-related and emergency health care as is the case in Quebec and Ontario. Other provinces don't have a wait period. New Brunswick abolished its waiting period in 2010.

As the pandemic struck in March 2020 B.C. removed its waiting period for three months in response to the pandemic and extended MSP coverage briefly to temporary foreign workers.

When the measures ended in July 2020 Health Minister Adrian Dix defended the waiting period.

“We have a 90-day rule which means people cannot just come here and on the first day get health care and get that health care at the cost of everyone in B.C.” he said. “It's fundamental to the way that we run our public health-care system in B.C.”

The Tyee has reached out to the premier's office and the Health Ministry for comment.

Chu said advocates have been seeking an end to the waiting period for decades and the pandemic has shown how urgently change is needed.

“With cases spiking again there's no reason we should be disincentivizing people from accessing the health-care system” he said.

In an open letter sent to Premier John Horgan Opposition Leader Shirley Bond and Dix Sanctuary Health and 18 other organizations said the policy violated a number of human rights' conventions.

“Immigrant women perceive and experience the policy as deeply xenophobic making them feel unwelcome and perpetuating mistrust and barriers to accessing needed health care for women” read the letter.

Racialized immigrant and migrant workers often have jobs in front-line services food processing and manufacturing where they are more likely to contract COVID-19.

The pandemic has also caused delays of months and years in processing visas work and residence permits. Migrants' eligibility for MSP lapses each time their status does.

If someone's student visa expires before their work permit is granted due to pandemic delays Chu said that lapse means they have to wait three months all over again for coverage.

And many can't afford or aren't eligible for private insurance to fill the gap as pregnancy and other common health issues are considered pre-existing conditions and not covered.

The wait period for health coverage also applies to newborn babies whose parents are not yet eligible for MSP.

Study co-author Shira Goldenberg director of research education at the centre and an assistant professor in global health at Simon Fraser University said the lack of care for women and children during the waiting period leads to more expensive and invasive care being required once they are insured.

“There are health-care needs that can't wait like pregnancy and that puts families in an impossible situation” Goldenberg said in an interview.

“Many women ended up with more significant issues due to care being delayed.”

While some agencies can help fill the health-care gaps the need to find workarounds increases the sense of racism and xenophobia many of the 47 women interviewed for the study said they faced in the health-care system.

The result is that migrants feel less deserving of care and less likely to seek it when needed in the future Goldenberg said.

Both Chu and Goldenberg hope the province acts urgently on this evidence as the Omicron-driven fifth wave surges in B.C.

“The waiting period policy doesn't align with the values that I think most British Columbians think we hold in terms of being an inclusive and welcoming province and then here we are having one of the most xenophobic health-care policies in Canada” said Goldenberg.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiGWh0dHBzOi8vYXZhcy5tdi9lbi8xMTE5MDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gov't aims to offer quality health services says VP,"Vice President Faisal Naseem has said the government aims to offer quality health services eliminating the need to travel abroad to seek medical services. He made the remark on Friday evening addressing at a function held to mark the 10th anniversary of national health insurance provider Aasandha Company.



Speaking at the ceremony the Vice President said during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic many had to depend on health services available in the atolls due to challenges in traveling to the capital and abroad for medical needs. While the situation at that time made clear the importance of decentralizing the healthcare system the government is working on establishing tertiary hospitals in the atolls he said.

Faisal urged concerted efforts by government offices and institutions to improve access to public services. Public services must be provided without discrimination he said.

OUInsider.com presents all the discussion including right here with linebacker DaShaun White defensive lineman Reggie Grimes and cornerback Woodi Washington.

Q. DaShaun just wondering as a guy who's a senior a team leader here what have the last few weeks been like? Does this feel like a normal bowl game given all you guys have been through and if it does at what point did it start to feel that way?

DASHAUN WHITE: I don't know if any of the last few months having normal but I would say for me it's really just been about enjoying the moment embracing all the opportunities I have with my teammates the coaches. Just spending a lot of time with them on and off the field. It's as simple as that to me.

Just trying to make the best of every situation with this team and we've got one last one to go after and that's the one we're focused on and honestly just can't wait to be able to go out there and hit the field with these guys.

Q. DaShaun to lose Coach not looking too far into the future but it's probably been a strange transition what you just talked about part of it is knowing he's the guy you've been closest to among the whole coaching staff and now he gets this moment to call plays and then he's moving on. What's that feel like personally?

DASHAUN WHITE: It's a little confusing to be honest with you. I love Coach Odom to death. I'd do anything for him. I've tried to do my best for him and I think that we've complemented each other very well over the years.

I'm really looking forward to this last one. That's kind of what everything boils down to with me. I'm really just trying to enjoy this last experience with everyone that was a part of this team that has been so close to my heart for honestly so long. Yeah that's what I'm really looking forward to.

Q. Reggie with the opt-outs and stuff you've kind of taken a leadership role. How has that been now that you're here reflecting on the last couple of weeks as the voice of the defensive line and stuff like that?

REGGIE GRIMES: It's been great. This whole transition has been kind of smooth. I think guys have taken to me well and this is -- we all have one common goal and that's to win wanting to make plays to be the guys that we came here to be. You don't come to Oklahoma to not be a dude; you know what I mean? I think it's been great. It's been an easy transition. We're having fun.

Q. Woodi what's it been like playing for Bob Stoops and the preparation for this game? What was your relationship with him like if there was one at all before November 29th? And I also want to ask you about Isaac Stoops what's it like having him around?

WOODI WASHINGTON: It's been great. Obviously Coach Bob Stoops' resume speaks for itself. He's been doing great things for however long and as far as Isaac and even Drake I kind of worked out with them during quarantine when we had the COVID outbreak. Those are great guys. I love Coach Stoops and I love his family.

Q. Reggie and DaShaun you guys I think are around some of the coaches that decided to come back for this game. What have you seen in just the challenge? They obviously wanted to be here. They wanted to coach you guys. But they're probably thinking about moving and new housing and families all those sorts of things logistically. Have you noticed any stress or do you sense them sort of able to balance it all?

REGGIE GRIMES: Not necessarily. I think it's more of focus on the main thing and that's this next game. It is a little bittersweet just realizing that they won't be our coaches next year but they'll still always be our family. As far as that's concerned we're just going to go out and play balls to the wall for them.

DASHAUN WHITE: Really agree with him. I'll keep it at that. I agree with him.

Q. Woodi just wondering what your early impressions are of Brent Venables the guy who will be leading this program moving forward and the staff he's putting together and all that or have you mostly been focused here on the Alamo Bowl?

WOODI WASHINGTON: I've just been focused on this next game kind of like Reggie said. We all have one common goal and that's to win but as far as Coach Venables it's kind of like Coach Stoops his resume speaks for itself. He did a great job at Clemson a great job when he was here at OU the previous time. Right now I'm just trying to focus on this next one.

Q. Woodi I want to follow up on that question. I know that you want to look towards this game only but I've got to ask you I know you're a guy who has an opportunity to move on if you'd like. Do you know about your future? Is this going to be your last game at Oklahoma or are you still trying to decide that?

WOODI WASHINGTON: No I'm definitely coming back next year.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Además mantener la piel bonita e hidratada es una de las máximas preocupaciones de la rutina de belleza de muchas personas.

En Estados Unidos ya son muchos los que han empezado a hacer frente a este problema de fácil solución con la crema para manos más recomendada por dermatólogos de este país que además arrasa en Internet rozando las ansiadas cinco estrellas de Google. Se trata de Working Hands de la marca O’keeffe’s con ingredientes hidratantes que garantizan mejorar la piel seca en pocas horas.

Se habla de ella como ‘crema milagro’ y se insiste en la poca cantidad que hay que usar para reparar las manos sin engrasarlas. En EL PAÍS Escaparate la hemos encontrado en Amazon México donde también arrasa en ventas y queremos contarte todo sobre su éxito. En esta plataforma online acumula cerca de 49000 valoraciones y 4.7 sobre 5 estrellas.

La crema para manos ‘milagro’

“Alivio garantizado para manos extremadamente secas y agrietadas. De albañiles a enfermeras de padres ocupados a esteticistas trabajar cada día con las manos puede ser bastante duro para la piel. Tener la piel seca y agrietada puede resultar molesto especialmente para aquellos trabajadores que dependen de las manos en su trabajo diario. Por eso hemos fabricado un producto específico para estas personas” explican desde la marca.

Detrás de su éxito está el ranchero californiano Bill O’Keeffe y su hija Tara farmacéutica quienes hace 20 años lograron dar con la fórmula original de esta crema para solucionar la sequedad crónica que padecía éste en las manos a causa de su trabajo. Ambos entendieron que abordar la piel severamente seca desde un enfoque basado en la humedad era una táctica natural: la tierra seca y estéril necesita agua.

Muchos de los usuarios de Amazon México que la han probado afirman su eficacia. “Simplemente maravillosa”. “¡ME ENCANTA! Sin dudarlo la compraré nuevamente será mi crema para manos de por vida”. “Me encantó sí es milagrosa; además de que mejora la apariencia de las uñas y cutículas. La recomiendo mucho”.

“He probado de todo para mis manos ya que se resecan mucho; he usado vitacilina pomada de la campana crema Vasenol crema Lubriderm cremas de glicerina cremas para manos miel con azúcar y limón etc. Esta crema es milagrosa ya que en 24 horas notas una mejoría. El producto tiene un olor muy suavecito casi imperceptible que a mi parecer es cítrico y la textura es como pastosa pero no es pegajosa; de hecho no te deja las manos ni grasas ni pegajosas. Está excelente”.

Una fórmula única sin perfume e hipoalergénica

Working Hands contiene una alta concentración de glicerina que absorbe y retiene la humedad que es necesaria para una piel saludable. Además su fórmula no grasa y sin perfume es hipoalergénica y apta para todo tipo de pieles e incluso también personas con problemas de diabetes (sin ácidos ni urea que pueden alterar este tipo de pieles).

Además de hidratar la piel de las manos de forma inmediata esta crema ‘milagrosa’ crea una capa protectora en la superficie de la piel y atrapa esa humedad a nivel celular para prevenir su deshidratación futura. Por otra parte aunque el frasco no es muy grande según aseguran sus usuarios una pequeña cantidad sirve para reparar ambas manos durante todo el día.

Los estudios muestran una ligera elevación de la temperatura de la piel durante la noche esto permite una mejor penetración de la humedad; por lo tanto la hora de acostarse es el mejor momento para aplicar Working Hands y promover la curación.

Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Pie de foto Este producto se popularizó tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial cuando los países intentaban reconstruirse y escaseaba la comida.

Con más de ocho décadas en el mercado la marca de carne enlatada Spam registró ventas récord en el 2021 por séptimo año consecutivo.

El buen desempeño de la empresa fue destacado por Jim Snee presidente de Hormel Foods compañía estadounidense propietaria de la marca en una conferencia de prensa para inversionistas tras la publicación de los resultados del grupo una vez finalizado el periodo de octubre.

El producto lanzado en 1937 se hizo muy popular entre sus clientes por ser relativamente barato y tener una larga vida. Durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial fue distribuido por toneladas y se usó para alimentar tanto a las tropas estadounidenses como a los civiles europeos de las naciones aliadas.

Spam también fue altamente consumido los años posteriores al conflicto cuando muchos países intentaban reconstruirse y los alimentos escaseaban.

Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Pie de foto Las recetas con Spam alrededor del mundo son variadas. En la foto arroz con piña y Spam.

Con el paso del tiempo este producto se convirtió en sinónimo de un ingrediente barato en Occidente pero se vio como un ¨manjar¨ en la región de Asia-Pacífico lo que explica en parte el éxito de la marca en los últimos años.

El Spam fue llevado a Corea del Sur por el ejército estadounidense durante la Guerra de Corea en la década de 1950 como un intento de abordar la falta de alimentos durante el conflicto. Sin embargo el producto fue tan absorbido por la cultura surcoreana que se convirtió en uno de los platos favoritos del país: el ""budae jjigae"" o ""estofado militar"".

Durante el Año Nuevo Lunar se vende en emporios y supermercados como un artículo de lujo en un empaque especial utilizado por los coreanos como obsequio.

Esta comida enlatada también tiene un gran mercado en el estado de Hawái donde se encuentra en el menú de varios restaurantes del archipiélago. Allí se consume en el desayuno con huevos y arroz. También en otros platos de arroz frito o como una especie de sushi el ""Spam musubi"".

De la lata a los correos electrónicos

Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Pie de foto El producto es considerado un ¨manjar¨ en algunos países asiáticos.

La popularidad que ganó después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial la convertiría años más tarde en sinónimo de la bandeja de correos electrónicos no deseados.

La razón según el etimólogo Graeme Donald la relación se remonta a un sketch del grupo de humor británico Monty Python de la década de 1970 en el que una pareja va a un restaurante donde cada elemento del menú tiene como ingrediente el Spam. Aunque la mujer deja claro que no le gusta la comida enlatada el asistente repite con voz chillona: ""Spam Spam Spam Spam ..."" mantra repetido a coro por un grupo de vikingos que también están en escena.

El uso de la palabra como sinónimo de mensaje molesto y no deseado comenzó como una broma entre los usuarios de Internet pero rápidamente se volvió universal como informó la estación de radio estadounidense NPR en una entrevista con Finn Brunton autor de Spam: A Shadow History of the Internet ( ""Spam: una historia secreta de internet¨).

La marca aprovechará este tiempo para preparar el asalto eléctrico que está por venir y desarrollar con cierta tranquilidad la tecnología que deberán emplear sus próximos modelos. Es lógico pensar que el Jaguar I-Pace será el punto de partida aunque solo sea por la experiencia adquirida con su diseño y su comercialización.

La situación actual de la marca contrasta mucho con la imagen que daba hace unos 10 años cuando parecía estar más fuerte que nunca y se permitía el lujo de presentar coches como el Jaguar C-X75 un automóvil que cerca estuvo de pasar a producción aunque finalmente solo se hicieron algunas unidades para una película.

Estaba animado por un grupo motor híbrido de nada menos que 850 CV. Un motor que combinaba un cuatro cilindros con doble sobrealimentación (turbo y compresor) de 16 litros inspirado en la Fórmula 1 que rendía 502 CV a 10.000 revoluciones. Un motor de carreras asistido por dos motores eléctricos que cuando se presentó eran los que mayor densidad de potencia y par ofrecían del mundo. Dos motores que añadían al cómputo final otros 390 CV.

Seis unidades para una película de James Bond

Cuando Jaguar decidió fabricar este espectacular coche se contó con la ayuda de Williams Advanced Engineering pero finalmente la crisis que comenzó en 2008 acabó por afectar también a la firma británica y se vieron obligados a detener el proyecto fabricando tan solo seis unidades para la película Spectre 007 de James Bond. Además ya por aquel entonces se estaba fraguando el despegue del coche eléctrico y la marca decidió centrar los pocos recursos que tenían en esa nueva tecnología (de ahí salió el mencionado Jaguar I-Pace).

Así por tanto el único privilegiado en conducir un Jaguar C-X75 fue James Bond el agente secreto más famoso del cine. Pero no eran como se esperaba estos coches recibieron algunos cambios. Por ejemplo el motor no era el brutal grupo híbrido de 850 CV era un bloque V8 de 575 CV procedente del Jaguar F-Type SVR al tiempo que su habitáculo apenas se puede diferenciar del que podemos encontrar en cualquier coche de competición ya que no tiene nada que no sea necesario para conducir. Sin ir más lejos el volante ni siquiera tenía airbag.

El chasis tampoco era lo que se esperaba pues Williams Advanced Engineering creó un marco tubular al que ancló las suspensiones el motor V8 y los paneles de la carrocería que ahora sí eran calcados a los del prototipo. Sin embargo no todos los C-X75 de la película Spectre son iguales porque cuatro de los seis ejemplares fueron destinados a acrobacias es decir estaban destinados a las escenas de acción donde no tendrían buen final. Los otros dos se emplearían en diferentes escenas y secuencias.

Siéntete como el malo de James Bond a los mandos de un Jaguar C-X75

No obstante puedes sentirte como el malo de James Bond conduciendo un Jaguar C-X75 a todo trapo por las calles de tu ciudad siempre que tengas el dinero suficiente claro. El portal Pistonheads tiene una de las unidades a la venta concretamente el chasis 007 y a tenor de las imágenes es evidente que no fue uno de los coches de acrobacias sino no de los usados para las imágenes de los protagonistas y de primer plano. Eso explicaría los dos pequeños agujeros que tiene en el capó (realizados para sujetar las cámaras).

Esta unidad cuenta con todo lo mencionado anteriormente es decir un chasis tubular de acero y el motor V8. También equipa suspensiones específicas para rallye de un POrsche 911 GT3 frenos AP Racing y un freno de mano hidráulico para que las derrapadas sean más fáciles. Acabó en manos de su propietario actual después de la grabación de la película vendido directamente por Jaguar-Land Rover. El precio es de 864.000 libras más de un millón de euros.

Just ask EJL Wireless Research founder Earl Lum about his recent trip to San Diego America’s eighth-largest city and a showcase market for Verizon’s 5G mmWave network which it calls 5G Ultra Wideband.

Following a thorough study of Verizon’s mmWave small cells including coverage and performance Lum sees only very extreme use cases for the high-frequency spectrum. He doesn’t expect mmWave to be abandoned but rather significantly deemphasized particularly for Verizon as it ramps up an expansive mid-band 5G deployment.

Will Verizon’s mmWave Push Subside?

Verizon came out early and strong for mmWave spectrum mostly because that’s the only significant spectrum asset it had to start with at the dawn of the 5G era. “They had nothing else so they went all-in on it and they couldn’t back out” Lum said in a phone interview.

Verizon has the largest mmWave footprint of any U.S. operator but it spent heavily to earn that designation and it’s unlikely to ever get a return on that investment he said.

The operator said it deployed 14000 mmWave small cells this year and CEO Hans Vestberg recently claimed at least 5% of Verizon’s urban area traffic would be carried on its mmWave network by the end of this year. He further claimed in markets where Verizon has an established 5G mmWave footprint at least 20% of customer traffic traveled over mmWave in the third quarter of 2021.

MoffettNathanson analysts at the time concluded Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband service “currently accounts for just one half of 1% of the time 5G users are connected.”

Balancing the benefits and costs of mmWave with physics remains a nagging point of contention among industry and financial analysts. It can serve gigabit-plus speeds lower latency and fantastical use cases but the economics don’t bear out.

‘Crazy and Not Realistic’ for Mass Market

“At some point it gets crazy and not realistic” Lum said. “You’re never going to get full coverage across a city unless you deploy like 10000 of these things.” Especially across a large city like San Diego.

Coverage remains and will always be the biggest problem with mmWave. During Lum’s survey of 40 mmWave small cells in San Diego and 34 in nearby Chula Vista the average radius per small cell site was about 500 feet. And that was only in cases where he had a direct line of sight to the radio with no obstructions.

“Once you start going out into the real world where a building a tree whatever is going to shadow that signal then all bets are off. You’re never going to get ubiquitous coverage. It just can’t ever be achieved because it would take so many sites to do” he said.

“These beams only go so far because of the frequency band and your phone only has enough juice to go back to the network” Lum added. When the signal strength of that mmWave beam degrades devices automatically switch back to sub-6Ghz a common occurrence for Lum in San Diego.

“In one case I walked 50 feet away from the cell and I already dropped off the mmWave coverage” he said.

Leveling that performance to the per-site costs for mmWave small cells significantly narrows its use case according to Lum even for fixed wireless access (FWA) which Verizon sells as 5G Home Internet. One site he surveyed in Chula Vista covered 11 single-family homes and one church.

Costs Offset mmWave Benefits

Now consider the costs. A mmWave small cell radio costs between $7500 and $10000 depending on volume and the metal pole those small cells are mounted on can cost between $35000 and $50000 according to Lum. Most sites also require a geological survey electrical bypass and fiber trenching he added.

Verizon hasn’t said it plans to make mmWave service available in every pocket of the country. It generally promotes the high-frequency spectrum for urban environments large venues transportation hubs private networks and FWA.

However in cases where a small cell covers fewer than a dozen homes as prospective FWA customers “we won’t live long enough to make enough to pay for the pole let alone the radio equipment” Lum said.

Individuals that buy a 5G device and expect to use ultimate mmWave performance on a daily basis “will be severely disappointed in any of the cities that [they] go to” he emphasized. Home broadband service is great where it’s available and reliable he added.

Lum said he did everything he could during his tests to give Verizon’s 5G mmWave network “the absolute benefit of the doubt” including pointing his phone directly at the antenna.

Following this experience Lum foresees a more narrow path for mmWave with it largely relegated to niche use cases. Especially great use cases include open factory floors where small cells can hang from the ceiling pointing directly down at all the robots and machinery he said.

“It was never really meant to be everywhere on a small cell pole in my opinion because of the limitations of the reach.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3dtdC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8zZy1uZXR3b3Jrcy10by1zaHV0LWRvd24taW4tMjAyMi13aGF0LXRoaXMtbWVhbnMtZm9yLXlvdXItcGhvbmXSAV9odHRwczovL3d3bXQuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzNnLW5ldHdvcmtzLXRvLXNodXQtZG93bi1pbi0yMDIyLXdoYXQtdGhpcy1tZWFucy1mb3IteW91ci1waG9uZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3G networks to shut down in 2022: What this means for your phone,"KALAMAZOO Mich. ( ) — A new year could mean a necessary upgrade to a new phone. Major mobile carriers will be shutting down their 3G networks in 2022 rendering older phones useless.

The retirement of the 3G network is to make room for more advanced networks like 5G which is much faster.

Once the 3G network is shut down 3G cell phones will not work.



In addition some older 4G phones that do not support HD Voice (VoLTE or Voice over LTE) will also stop functioning. This means users will not be able to make or receive calls and texts even to 911.

Data services will also be unavailable on those devices. AT&T said it will shut down its entire 3G network by February 2022.

T-Mobile which merged with Sprint said it will fully retire Sprint's 3G network by March 31 Sprint's 4G LTE network by June 30 and T-Mobile's 3G network by July 1.

Verizon said it will completely shut down its 3G network by Dec. 31 2022.

The Federal Communications Commission said other carriers like Cricket Boost Straight Talk and some Lifeline mobile service providers use the networks of AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon. As a result phones under those carriers could also be affected.

The major mobile carriers have each set up web pages with more information on their plans to phase out their 3G networks. The web pages include lists showing which phones are affected.









Those who need to get new phones to avoid a loss of service are advised to ask their providers about trade-in offers to upgrade at a discount or no cost.

A Verizon employee says users should log into their accounts to see what upgrades they are eligible for.

Verizon said it initially announced it would shut down its 3G network in 2019. But the carrier pushed back the date to help its customers transition to newer devices.

Verizon said more than 99% of its customers are on the 4G LTE or 5G network and less than 1% are using 3G.

The FCC said the retirement of the 3G network will not only affect phones but other electronics like medical devices tablets smart watches SOS services in vehicles home security systems and other products connected to the 3G network.

The theme “Joy to the World” blended with the beautiful foyer that sparkled with holiday decorations.

Pianist Vince Torbey played Christmas carols as President Pam McCredie welcomed the 110 guests arriving for the festivities.

Following tradition of attendees bringing a toy for the “Spark of Love Toy Drive” long tables overflowed with stuffed animals toy trucks footballs tablets books dolls and other toys.

Each year volunteers from the Fire Department travel in fire trucks around the community delivering toys on Christmas morning. Barbara Jordan and Linda Frame led the members in carols at the end of the luncheon.

Fire Chief Xavier Espino and firefighter and Program Coordinator Brian Fisk both spoke to the ladies at the luncheon about how Spark of Love began who benefits and how and when the toys were delivered.

Long Beach Yacht Club Sand Dollars

For the last 30 years or so the wives of past Long Beach Yacht Club commodores — also known as The Sand Dollars — have held an annual Christmas luncheon. It has become so popular that it sells out the week it’s announced.

It’s a spectacular event for the Long Beach Yacht Club which established in 1929.

There’s always live music; this year it was the dulcet tones of Porter Singletary. But delicious dining and libations also starred.

There is also an abundance of opportunity to indulge in shopping at the bazaar. The clubhouse buzzed with excitement and the enthusiastic voices of the 231 beautifully clad women. Joan Knight reported she took four very large bags of toys and more than $800 to the Stramski Children’s Developmental Center at Miller Children’s Hospital.

Las Damas de las Plaza

Las Damas de la Plaza supporters of the Community Hospital Long Beach Foundation celebrated the holiday season on Dec. 15 at The Grand by collecting a treasure trove of toys and gift certificates for the Spark of Love Toy Drive.

An impressive 30-feet table space was filled with a display of unwrapped toys bikes games and more than $1100 worth of gift certificates for youngsters from toddlers to teens.

Sandy French Las Damas president and Vice President Janie Ransom coordinated the day’s festivities starting out with entertainment by musician Michael Sullivan performing holiday music and carols with members of Las Damas joining in.

LB Firefighter Spark of Love Coordinator Will Nash joined the festivities.

“So nice to have our LB firefighters join us to collect all the donations” Fran Bylund Las Damas coordinator said in welcoming him. “Together we are making the holidays a little brighter for the kids in our community.”

Heartful Hands Toy Drive and Fundraiser

Heartful Hands was founded 18 years ago by Rick Loveall in memory of his mother Francis Cooley.

She loved the holidays and especially Christmas telling Rick to “always remember to give back and support others.”

Rick chose Jonathan Jaques Children’s Cancer Institute to help and support the Adopt-A-Family Program.

Late last month Heartful Hands held its 18th Annual Toy Drive and Fundraiser at the Hotel Maya. The event attended by 230 guests raised $25000. The raffle — with donated items ranging from vacations to Bose speaker systems — was enthusiastically supported.

Guests were greeted with a champagne bar and entertained with multiple bands and DJ in an al fresco setting with beautiful views of Long Beach. Following delicious dining desserts were provided by local favorites Miss Priss Cupcakes and The Pie Bar.

Gifts and gift cards were delivered on Nov. 20 to the Jonathan Jaques Children’s Cancer Institute for distribution to families in need. Monetary donations will be distributed throughout the year to children and their families affected by cancer sickle cell leukemia and other serious blood disorders.

Naples Island Snow Village

An enchanted Naples snow village — winner of the Naples Island First Place Award — has been on display for the season in the canal courtyard of Lynn Gesner as a fundraising project benefitting the Steel Magnolias and Musical Theatre West.

Lynn’s son Jack joined in the project as Santa Claus.

Also for a fee brief private seatings were available for refreshments and the opportunity to enjoy the village up front and personal.

Tony and Gary turned trash into treasure — and ordinary things that were once forgotten were transformed into extraordinary memories.

The group raised well more than $10000 for the Steel Magnolia’s charity the Stramski Center at Miller Children’s and Women’s Hospital and Musical Theatre West.

The village is more than just enchanting.

It’s a lesson in recycling ingenuity and creating magic out of the ordinary.

It began years ago when Anthony Gagliardi created a village entirely from recycled items. He and another creative wizard Gary Lee Wolf created a 20-foot long village sparkling in white.

The duo with the aid of Carl Lee and Karen Gagliardi recycled the recycled village into an entirely new snowy village. Looking closely you can see the village is created from Gatorade bottles martini glasses barbecue skewers 5-gallon jugs toothpicks GI Joe soldiers plumbing washers a radiator clamp thumbtacks odd pieces of jewelry — and so much more.

Don’t miss the opportunity to see it. It’ll be open to public view until Jan. 1 at 212 Rivo Alto Canal.

From Leena Nair to Jayshree Ullal they have all broken the glass ceiling.

Indian women are establishing their identity in varied spheres globally by heading several big industries from beauty to technology and everything in between. By breaking the glass ceiling of the male-dominated spheres across the globe they are revolutionising these spaces and making it more inclusive and accessible for women.

These women are redefining gender stereotypes and work culture thereby inspiring others to take up more such roles. Here’s a look at a few Indian women CEOs who are currently leading the global workforce across different industries.

1. Revathi Advaithi



Revathi Advaithi (54) is the CEO of Flex one of the world’s largest manufacturing companies and a global supply chain. She assumed her role as the CEO in February 2019 and has been managing the company’s strategic direction and technological innovation. Advaithi is also an independent director for the board of directors of both Uber and Catalyst.org. She serves as a member of the MIT Presidential CEO Advisory Board.

Born and brought up in India Advaithi holds a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science in Pilani India and an MBA from the Thunderbird School of Global Management Arizona. She is also a champion of women in STEM fields and is also responsible for sustainable manufacturing solutions across various industries and end markets.

2. Sharmistha Dubey

Sharmistha Dubey is the 51-year-old CEO of the Match Group a $40 billion technology conglomerate that owns and operates several online dating applications like Tinder OkCupid Hinge and PlentyOfFish.

Born and brought up in Jamshedpur she says she was an introvert which made her a keen observer of human behaviour. This came in handy when she joined the Match Group around 15 years ago and later took over as its CEO in 2020. She holds a bachelor’s degree in engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology and later obtained her MS from Ohio State University.

3. Reshma Kewalramani

Reshma Kewalramani joined as the president and chief executive officer of Vertex Pharmaceuticals an American biopharmaceutical company in 2017.

While the last quarter of the year has been a very good one for stocks overall there hasn't been much holiday cheer for smaller companies.

As of December 21 with a handful of trading days left in 2021 the benchmark S&P 500 index has climbed 7.9% in the fourth quarter but the small-cap Russell 2000 has gained just 0.1%. The smaller and more economically-sensitive companies that make up the Russell 2000 index have been hit hard by fears about the new COVID-19 variant as well as projections of higher interest rates.

V,Visa Inc,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL2ZvcnR1bmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMjYvdmlzYXMtY2ZvLXN0YXJ0ZWQtYXMtYW4tZW5naW5lZXItYnV0LWVuZGVkLXVwLWluLWZpbmFuY2UtYW5kLWhlLWhhcy1ncmVhdC1hZHZpY2UtZm9yLWFueW9uZS1sb29raW5nLXRvLW1ha2UtYS1jaGFuZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Career Rewind: Career Rewind: Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu's path changed from science to finance by following four steps,"Vasant Prabhu’s career path:

CFO Vice Chair at Visa (present)

CFO at NBCUniversal

CFO Vice Chair at Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc.

CFO EVP and President of E-commerce at Safeway Inc.

President of the Information and Media Group at The McGraw-Hill Companies

SVP of Finance and CFO at PepsiCo International

VP Strategic Planning at Frito-Lay International (PepsiCo)

Partner Media and Consumer Companies at Booz Allen Hamilton

Associate at Booz Allen Hamilton

“If you had told me when I was 21 that I would spend more than half my career being a CFO I would have said ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m an engineer and I love marketing and media” Vasant Prabhu vice chair and CFO at Visa Inc. told me. “I tell people—build your skills build your relationships build your reputation. But stay flexible in terms of what you’re willing to do because you never know what your next opportunity is going to be.”

Prabhu a C-suite executive at a global credit card and payments powerhouse may have started out as an engineer but his curiosity for business changed his path from science to finance with a few twists and turns along the way. For the past 21 years he’s had CFO roles at public companies. “I guess I just have been the sort of person where you throw me into the water and I’ll figure out how to swim” he said. “I’ve never been fearful.” Like when his love of travel took him to Giza in Egypt in 1982. Prabhu wasn’t afraid of an impromptu climb to the top of a pyramid he told me.

Four factors to consider in your job search

“I was six months in the U.S. and had never lived outside India” Prabhu explained. “I didn’t know anything about business.” He was pursuing an M.B.A. at the University of Chicago when Paul Branstad a senior partner at the management consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton hired him as a summer intern. Chrysler led by CEO Lee Iacocca at the time was his client during the internship. “I was shocked that someone would actually pay me to go and learn how businesses worked” he said. But the “most profound thing was that someone would bet on me.” That has been a theme throughout his career. “If someone wants to take a chance on you at first you might say why me?” Prabhu said. “That’s what I did many times.” But he advised: “just take it.”

Prabhu was eventually hired as an associate at Booz Allen Hamilton. Consulting was “a fabulous place to start a career” because he learned how various businesses operated including company culture he said. Prabhu rose up the ranks to become a partner serving media and consumer companies. He enjoyed his job but wanted to play a major role in creating value at an organization rather than advising companies how to do so. “I decided okay it’s time to leave” he said. “And I was very deliberate about which company I went to work for.”

Prabhu said he began considering four factors in a job search:

-Choosing an industry or business you’re passionate about

-Making sure the company has a reputation for having good talent

-Working with a group of people you trust and respect

-Figuring out how you can make an impact

“You’ll be very successful” he asserted. “You’ll get the promotions you’ll make the money and not only that you’ll just be happier.”

His checklist led him to PepsiCo. In the early 1990s “Pepsi had a reputation for being this incredibly well-run company with some really smart people in very interesting businesses” Prabhu said. In the 1980s Steve Jobs recruited John Sculley who was VP and president of PepsiCo to become CEO at Apple Inc he noted. In 1992 Prabhu was hired as VP of strategic planning for Frito-Lay International. “It proved to be the best decision I ever made” he said. “Everything I know today about being a CFO I learned Pepsi.”

He was at the company for about a year when then CEO Roger Enrico and Fred Reynolds Prabhu’s boss asked him to take on the roll SVP of finance and CFO for Pepsi Cola International. He was 31 years old at the time. At first Prabhu thought why me? He still had much to learn about finance. But the execs thought he could do the job Prabhu said.

“At Pepsi we don’t think of CFOs as ‘financial people’” he recalled the execs said to him. “We want good businesspeople; we want people who can be operationally focused. You’ll be fine.”

Much is currently being discussed about the evolution and broadening the CFO role. But PepsiCo was ahead of its time in its philosophy for a finance chief he said. “A lot of other companies have caught up with them and now do define CFO jobs that way” Prabhu said.

He became a chief for the first time. “I realized this is a great job because it’s very broad in scope” he said. “You can get involved in anything you want to and have a lot of impact.” It’s a position that creates value for the whole company and allows you to work in a wide range of industries Prabhu said.

Leading at the onset of the dot.com boom

After a few years at PepsiCo Harold Whittlesey “Terry” McGraw III then CEO of McGraw-Hill Companies approached Prabhu about taking on the role of president of the information and media group he said. McGraw-Hill was one of his clients while working at Booz Allen. The position included overseeing TV stations B2B trade publications and the flagship magazine BusinessWeek. (Bloomberg L.P. bought the magazine in 2009 and renamed it Bloomberg BusinessWeek.)

The job met his four criteria. “My first passion has always been the media business” he said. Prabhu knew McGraw-Hill’s culture and team well from his consulting days he explained. McGraw was someone whom he liked and respected. And Prabhu saw a way to make an impact. “It was 1998 just as the internet was taking off” he said. “I saw this incredible opportunity that existed to digitize these [print] businesses.” Although “it was very hard to leave Pepsi I felt this was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up” Prabhu said. “Terry bet on me. I’d never run a business before let alone businesses like these that were quite substantial.”

Under his lead the group started to make the pivot by creating BusinessWeek online Prabhu said. “We tried to get a whole bunch of the businesses to move to digital” he said. But it was the early stages of the dot.com boom. For instance Amazon just went public in 1997 AOL was “still a big player” and Google and Facebook didn’t yet exist Prabhu said. “I would say nobody at that time [understood] how devastating the impact of digital media would be on the traditional print media” he said. “Everyone thought that they needed to add a digital component to their business. But didn’t realize how significant the change would be over time.”

As the leader of the media group Prabhu shouldered this responsibility to a greater degree than if he were the finance chief. “The big difference between being CFO and being president is there’s a much larger component of people management” Prabhu said. “The role is more operational. And the hardest part of any leadership role is managing change which is hard because it’s risky. It’s uncomfortable. And often people are threatened by it.” His role as president made him a better CFO later on Prabhu said.

Now with digital experience Prabhu’s work at Booz Allen Hamilton again resulted in a job offer he couldn’t refuse. “Steve Byrd the CEO of Safeway was someone I had met in my consulting days” Prabhu said. “Steve asked me if I would come and be his CFO as well as help him create an internet business or two. I’d never been the CFO of a public company. And I’d never been in the supermarket business. But Steve took a chance on me.” In 2000 Prabhu began the role of EVP CFO and president of e-commerce which checked all of the boxes on his job criteria list. Plus it offered the added bonus of living in California.

“We launched Safeway.com but it turned out it was very early for that” he said. “Consumers were not really looking to buy groceries online in those days. Right now they’re much more comfortable doing it especially through the pandemic. But we did launch something else called Safeway marketing services. It was a way to use the company’s data as a marketing tool for other businesses. That proved to be an idea that had legs. It went on to become Blackhawk Network Holdings Inc. [a digital payments company].”

Time for travel

Barry Sternlicht CEO of Starwood Capital Group was previously the CEO of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide a company he founded in 1995. In 2004 the hotel industry trailblazer asked Prabhu to join his team as vice chairman and CFO he said. “Barry was a very fascinating person to me” Prabhu said. “He was a was a creative innovative guy. He created the W Hotel brand for example.” Learning from Sternlicht combined with Prabhu’s love of travel and an opportunity to work on Starwood’s changing business model checked all the boxes on the list.

“I thoroughly enjoyed the hotel business” he said. “There are days when I still miss it. It’s a fun business.” Starwood’s several brands including Sheraton Westin W Hotels and St. Regis had operational real estate and loyal program dimensions he said. “The people who work in hotels are very interesting” Prabhu said. “And I used to meet all these fascinating people who owned hotels all over the world. I loved that.”

Prabhu was responsible for all financial functions information technology and various corporate functions. He stayed with the company for a decade amid many changes. “I had as many as four CEOs there” he said. “They say when the CEO changes the CFO is the first to go because the CFO is often the person CEO likes to pick. I’ve been able to survive those [changes]. I’m on my second CEO at Visa by the way.” If internal and external stakeholders and the board feels like the finance chief is a valuable member of the team and the CFO accepts adapting to the new leader’s style it seems to work out Prabhu said. And a bit of luck helps as well he said.

The road leads to Visa

In 2014 Prabhu returned “back to my first love which was the media business with a great group of people” as CFO for NBCUniversal headquartered in New York he said. Charles Scharf who was the CEO of Visa at the time was persuasive in recruiting Prabhu for CFO role at the San Francisco-based company he said. “Charlie was willing to bet on me even though I’ve never ever worked in a business like this” he said. “I’ve been in hotels and media. But he was willing to trust me with it.” An added bonus was the job location Prabhu’s beloved California. “I’m never leaving California again” he quipped.

“What I found appealing about Visa was there was this incredible iconic brand global in scope that had this great history and was at an interesting trying time in its in its evolution” he said. “The world around it was changing. And this was opening up some extraordinary opportunities. But at the same time there were also threats.” Again the job met all of his criteria and Prabhu began as finance chief at Visa in February 2015. He compared it to the climate he faced in media in 1998. “The decisions we make today will determine how successful this business is 10 years from now” he said. “And we’ll determine the shape of the industry.” He continued “given that I’ve been doing this for a long time I thought it’d be a great opportunity to use everything I’ve learned.”

Five years ago Visa was essentially enabling payments to merchants Prabhu said. “Today we can enable any kind of money flow” he said. “You can send a remittance to someone else in some other country. We enable a lot of startups to scale because of our network.” Visa announced in December the launch of its global crypto advisory practice within its consulting and analytics division. “As a CFO you play a role in the formulation of the strategy but it’s always a team effort” said Prabhu who became vice chair of the company in May 2019.

Working closely with CEO Alfred F. Kelly Jr. on strategy and ensuring the whole organization is on the same page is a pivotal part of Prabhu’s job he explained. That includes ensuring a culture exists for “thoughtful risk taking” he said. But at the same time he must create a “culture of accountability that people have to deliver on what they said they were going to deliver” all while finding the right talent along the way he said. “I’ve upgraded my team over the years” he explained. “You have to hire people who will be talent magnets themselves so that they’ll upgrade their own teams.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhcGludG8ubmV0L3Rvd25zL3N1bW1pdC9zZWN0aW9ucy9oaWxsdG9wLWhhcHBlbmluZ3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvaGlsbHRvcC1lbGYtc2NhdmVuZ2VyLWh1bnQtd2lubmVycy1hbm5vdW5jZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'HillTop Elf Scavenger Hunt' Winners Announced | Summit NJ News TAPinto,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.tapinto.net/towns/summit/sections/hilltop-happenings/articles/hilltop-elf-scavenger-hunt-winners-announced on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhcGludG8ubmV0L3Rvd25zL3N1bW1pdC9zZWN0aW9ucy9oaWxsdG9wLWhhcHBlbmluZ3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvaGlsbHRvcC1lbGYtc2NhdmVuZ2VyLWh1bnQtd2lubmVycy1hbm5vdW5jZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The late South African archbishop Desmond Tutu. (AP) -

ARCHBISHOP Desmond Tutu who described Trinidad and Tobago as a rainbow country similar to his own beloved South Africa has died. News of his death came on Sunday. He was 90.

Tutu a Nobel Peace Prize-winning icon and former South African president the late Nelson Mandela visited TT in May 2004 to lobby support for South Africa's bid to host the 2010 World Cup.

Foreign and Caricom Affairs Minister Dr Amery Browne said ""He was a good friend of TT having described our country positively to the world as the true rainbow nation after visiting our shores. Trinbagonians from all walks of life will remember him fondly and with enduring admiration.""

Browne described Tutu as a shining light of humanity for decades and a central figure alongside Mandela in the fight against apartheid in South Africa.

""My generation grew up in an era in which Desmond Tutu dominated world headlines and we were inspired by his journey from being a schoolteacher to becoming the very first black Archbishop of Cape Town to serving as a global diplomat and advocate for peace human rights truth and justice.""

Beyond the role Tutu played in abolishing apartheid in South Africa Browne remembered him as a humble iconic figure who was a global diplomat for peace human rights truth and justice.

""Archbishop Tutu stood out as a voice of reason when he stood against the Gulf War and on numerous other occasions when he embodied the conscience of the world.""

In extending condolences to Tutu's family and the South African people Browne said Tutu lived a life of meaning and purpose ""that must provide example hope and inspiration for the future.”

Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar in a statement said Tutu's ""extraordinary life is testament to the fact that the greatest weapons against injustice and evil are truth forgiveness and a heart filled with love.""

Even after apartheid ended in the early 1990s Persad-Bissessar recalled Tutu continued to be a beacon of hope to the South African people as he led that country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

She said this helped to heal South Africa by confronting the hideous crimes committed against its people under the apartheid regime.

""He fought to ensure the evil ideology of racial segregation must never be allowed to ever happen again.""

While the world collectively mourns his death Persad-Bissessar said ""Let us also celebrate the ideals and principles for which he fought; equality peace truth and justice.""

Anglican Bishop The Right Rev Claude Berkley said Tutu's death was ""a tremendous loss to the Anglican community in general and the Anglican Church in South Africa in particular.""

He described Tutu as a ""bastion of institutional knowledge and experience of the church’s mission and ministry especially in terms of social justice truth and reconciliation and theological reflection.""

Tutu Berkley continued was a contemporary and great friend of Bishop Clive Abdulah the first local bishop of the Anglican Church in TT.

""He was a man of great faith who confidently spoke truth to power and lived the Christ-centered discipleship life at great sacrifice and even to the point of placing his life at risk on many occasions.""

Berkley agreed with descriptions of Tutu as someone who had faith that dissipated fear in his tireless campaign against apartheid and to promote civil and human rights.

He also recalled that Tutu preached a very stimulating sermon at the Holy Trinity Cathedral in Port of Spain during his visit to TT in 2004. In that sermon Berkley said Tutu likened his vision of South Africa before and after apartheid to one’s encounter with Jesus Christ before knowing Christ and after knowing him.

""One remembers feeling like a dwarf in the presence of such a great giant of a priest theologian and disciple of Christ even though the Archbishop was not particularly huge in stature. Berkley expressed the church's condolences to Tutu's family the Anglican Church in South Africa and the South African people.

Housing Minister Pennelope Beckles a former TT United Nations representative described Tutu ""as a giant who remained grounded in his humble beginnings.""

She said ""As a man of God he did not hesitate to use his office and position to speak out against and draw the attention of the world being meted out on the black South Africans by the apartheid regime. Beckles added that Tutu's life was an example of how human beings should treat each other with decency and respect.

Oropouche East MP Dr Roodal Moonilal remembers first hearing about Tutu in the mid-1980's while he was a UWI student. He also remembers being part of national and regional campaigns at that time inspired by Tutu and other South African activists to highlight inequality and racial discrimination.

""The Archbishop was a beacon of the anti-apartheid movement along with the iconic “Madiba” (Nelson Mandela) Walter Sisulu Oliver Tambo and many others. His grace and courage to speak is a lesson for all those who suffer without awakening.”

Describing Tutu as an inspiration to the radical student movement of his time Moonilal said the UNC was born out of the struggle which Tutu and others inspired.

Tobago House of Assembly (THA) Deputy Chief Secretary Watson Duke said Tutu ""has become a symbol of black conscious struggle to the African diasporas throughout the world and more so South Africa.""

His first knowledge about Tutu was as chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee under Mandela. Duke said ""As a beacon of light he shun bright over the 70s 80s 90’s etc. His going home to rest at 90 years of age is only fitting for such a hard and enduring worker for peace love and justice among African diasporas.""

Energy Minister Stuart Young said ""Archbishop Tutu was one of the individuals in my lifetime that had a lasting positive impact."" He remembered as a young boy reading about Tutu's advocacy for the end of apartheid and the rights of Palestinians."" He said ""His time on earth was definitely for the betterment of humanity.""

Pointe-a-Pierre MP David Lee also remembered Tutu's description of TT as a rainbow country. One of Lee's hopes for 2022 is ""that our people really take heed to his words.""

In a statement Caricom said Tutu's strong moral voice was a very significant factor in the successful struggle against apartheid in South Africa.

Caricom also said Tutu's leadership of South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission during the sensitive transition period after the end of apartheid further elevated his national and global esteem.

And like that of the holiday season itself its promise is a little overstated.

The exhibition traces often in granular detail the disparate elements of the European aesthetic movements that Disney animators some 600 strong by the end of the 1930s swept into its movies: French Rococo in “Beauty and the Beast” (1991); Gothic Revival architecture in “Cinderella” (1950) late medieval and Early Netherlandish art in “Sleeping Beauty” (1959) 19th-century Germanic Romanticism in “Snow White” (1937). All these stories originated in Europe so the idea that the Disney machine rooted its visual interpretation in European art isn’t that much of a leap as say staging “Hamlet” in Y2K-era Manhattan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhdWdoaW5ncGxhY2UuY29tL3cvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMS8xMi8yNi9sZW9uYXJkLW1hbHRpbi13YWx0LWRpc25leS1mYW1pbHktbXVzZXVtLWV2ZW50LXJlY2FwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Event Recap: Leonard Maltin Shares Highlights from his Disney Work During Walt Disney Family Museum Virtual Talk ...,"Hollywood historian film critic and Disney fan Leonard Maltin recently joined the Walt Disney Family Museum for an hour-long virtual conversation about his career and new book Starstruck: My Unlikely Road to Hollywood. Held on December 15th the event included a moderated conversation with the virtual audience giving fans of Leonard Maltin a chance to ask him questions about his Disney work.

As a child Leonard Maltin was exposed to classic films and shorts through their television broadcasts. With few books published about filmmaking one of them being Bob Thomas’ The Art of Animation the young fan started his own fanzine about film using a minigraph machine to produce it and mailing it out to subscribers. Leonard Maltin was sick and home from school the day Walt Disney died hearing the news on the radio and feeling like he needed to do a special piece in his fanzine. Using the phonebook he called the Walt Disney Productions office in New York City and spoke to publicist Arlene Ludwig for the first time (daughter of Irving Ludwig who ran Buena Vista Distribution for Disney) who became a lifelong friend of his. She sent him photos to include with his annotated filmography of Walt Disney.

First published in 1973 Leonard Maltin spent two years writing The Disney Films a comprehensive book about Walt Disney’s film career with essays and information on every theatrically released feature film produced during his lifetime. “There was a continuity to his career” Leonard explained about what set Disney’s filmography apart from other studios even family-run ones like Warner Bros. He explained that with the family atmosphere at Disney by the 1960s it had become a multigenerational place of employment for families. On top of that Walt Disney was the most recognizable movie mogul thanks to his weekly TV appearances. Three revised editions of The Disney Films were published most recently in 2000 adding chapters about each decade of post-Walt studio output.

As an expert on Disney’s film and television output Leonard Maltin pitched an idea to the company to commemorate Walt Disney’s 100th Birthday a DVD collection of classic content with hosted introductions and behind-the-scenes bonus features. Greenlit by then Studio Chairman Dick Cook the Walt Disney Treasures series allowed Leonard Maltin to curate collectible box sets of content Disney fans thought might never be released. One of the highlights for Maltin was “On the Front Lines” a collection of World War II shorts and the feature film Victory Through Air Power all of which had been marked “Do Not Show” at the studio.

After nine waves of releases the Walt Disney Treasures series came to an end in 2009 the same year Dick Cook left the company. “He was the godfather of that series” Maltin explained. “He was the reason it got made and when he left there was no one to champion the series.” Fans have often wondered what might have been if the series continued but the truth is that there were no concrete plans for additional releases when the series ended. However Leonard Maltin did have ideas one of which would’ve collected all of the “I’m No Fool” shorts from The Mickey Mouse Club accompanied by some of Disney’s educational films that spun off from it.

The last wave of Walt Disney Treasures releases gave fans the complete television series Zorro starring Guy Williams in its original black and white. The timing of the event came on the heels of the announcement of a reboot starring and produced by Wilmer Valderrama. “He’s an incredibly appealing character” Leonard Maltin shared about “The fox so cunning and free” who has been adapted on screen by numerous actors and companies over the years. “All the ingredients are there for great stories and there’s no reason they shouldn’t be done again.” As a fan of the Guy Williams series Leonard Maltin is optimistic that the new take will be done right. “I would be glad to see somebody tackle it again if they do it with heart if they do it with real commitment to the values and ideals of the series.”

A fitting part of the conversation was spent on Diane Disney Miller Walt Disney’s daughter who co-founded the Walt Disney Family Museum with her husband Ron Miller. Leonard Maltin first met Diane at Disneyland while participating in a panel discussion for Walt Disney’s 100th birthday. She had been asked about myths about her dad that she wanted to lay to rest and someone else made a joke causing the audience to laugh so loudly that Diane couldn’t be heard. When the laughter quieted Leonard asked Diane to repeat what she said. “Well he’s not frozen” she exclaimed receiving a laugh of her own. “I was blessed to call Diane Disney Miller a friend” Leonard Maltin shared adding that an entire chapter in Starstruck: My Unlikely Road to Hollywood is about how he got close to Walt Disney without ever meeting him through interviewing people who lived and worked with him. If he could go back in time to meet anybody it would be Walt Disney.

The Walt Disney Family Museum has made the entire event available on YouTube if you’d like to experience the full conversation. Starstruck: My Unlikely Road to Hollywood is now available and you can listen to Leonard Maltin and his daughter Jessie Maltin through their podcast Maltin on Movies.

That was our one and only big family Disney trip.

It was clearly a pre-internet trip so we'd sent away for the brochures read the books and drove from Texas to Orlando as $39 flights and easily accessible airline miles from credit cards weren't a thing in the early 1990s.

From Space Mountain to Mr. Toad's Wild Ride we rode absolutely everything that existed at the time during our weeklong visit. We stayed on Disney property at the then-still-new Disney's Caribbean Beach Resort. It was a grand trip and while it sparked my love of Disney World it took 2 1/2 decades for a return stay at a true Disney World resort.

Mostly because of budget I started my adult-era Disney visits sleeping on the floor of a friend's Orlando timeshare then Priceline-ing a $29 hotel about 30 minutes away from the parks. I graduated to using points at the nearby Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress and then eventually using free night awards to stay at the on-site Disney Swan and Dolphin.

Then things changed.

I finally returned to a real Disney World resort in 2017. And on that trip I shot for the stars living out my childhood dreams by booking Disney's Polynesian Village Resort. It had been a decades-old dream to stay at that themed resort right on the monorail and that stay forever changed how I experience Disney World.

Fresh off my fourth or fifth stay at ""the Poly"" I'm here to tell you why you might want to not stay there.

The reason? Just like when you turn left on the plane to enjoy first class it's hard to want to sit in the back again on your next flight.

And that's true now more than ever with the Polynesian fresh off a pretty substantial renovation that kept the classic soul of the hotel while modernizing the theme and rooms for today's guests.

The theme and rooms

Disney's Polynesian Village Resort is not bashful about its theme.

From the lei greeting to the piped-in island music and beyond once you step foot onto these grounds that Walt dreamed up you are in Disney's version of the South Pacific. As someone who loves all things Disney and island vacations this is a five-star combo.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

Once you have your welcome lei walk past the waterfall and through the lobby and you will have the option of relaxing on the open grassy area in the shade. Or if your tummy is rumbling perhaps you could even pick up a cool Dole Whip from the Pineapple Lanai that you'll encounter as you exit the lobby.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 Disney's Polynesian Village Resort. SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY 0 1

But relaxing with a Dole Whip under the shade tree with some Hawaiian music in the background is almost too perfect so you definitely shouldn't start your vacation by doing that.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy) 0 1

And you certainly shouldn't do that if you have kids who may also love this taste of Disney without the crowds and chaos of the parks.

When it's time to check in to your room be ready for a modern-meets-""Moana"" theme offering a little something for everyone.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

Just reopened with this look in the summer of 2021 the new Polynesian rooms have touches of ""Moana""-inspired decor hardwood floors many more outlets for charging your devices than before and all-new bathrooms.

For someone who wants modern conveniences but fun Disney touches these might be close to perfect. So you definitely don't want to stay in these rooms.

The amenities

You probably don't go to Disney World to stay in your room the whole time so odds are high you'll want to go for a swim in the Poly's main Lava Pool or maybe even relax in its secondary Oasis Pool.

Polynesian Oasis Pool. (Summer Hull for The Points Guy)

The Oasis Pool is certainly nice but the Lava Pool is the main attraction. It's open until 10 p.m. and has a zero-entry area a very impressive toddler play area and a 142-foot-long waterslide.

On top of all that you can see the Magic Kingdom fireworks from the pool itself which of course I'm sure you'd never want to do -- ever.

Day or night the Polynesian's pools are almost too good.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

Speaking of almost too good when you stay at the Polynesian you are very close to both the Magic Kingdom and Epcot.

For trips into the Magic Kingdom you'll probably want to take the monorail from the second level of the lobby. It will drop you off at the Magic Kingdom starting one hour before the park opens in the morning. Remember when you stay at a Disney resort like the Polynesian you get in 30 minutes early so the monorail starts dropping guests off at the parks half an hour before that time.

To get to Epcot it's potentially easiest to walk the five minutes to the Transportation and Ticketing Center to get a direct shot on the monorail from there. Otherwise you need to transfer from the lobby monorail to the Epcot monorail at the TTC.

Being able to clear security at your hotel and enjoy a monorail ride straight to the parks without the same hassle experienced by the guests of most other resorts is almost too good.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy) 0 1

When you are done visiting the parks at night and take the monorail back to the Poly there are still things to do.

First you can see the Magic Kingdom's evening fireworks not only from the pool but also from the beach area -- with the piped-in music timed perfectly to the colorful explosions in the air.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY 0 1

There are also outdoor evening movies dance parties and more on the lawn ensuring you can stay as active as you want into the nighttime hours without having to stray too far from your room.

The food

Disney's Polynesian Village Resort not only has one of the best pools and locations in all of Disney World but it has some of the best food and restaurants too. Again -- it's kind of too good.

Who wouldn't want a cool pineapple drink with dark rum?

Or maybe you prefer smothered pulled pork nachos or noodles with veggies from the quick-service Capt. Cook's?

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 4 (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3

Or let's say you are in the mood for a cheeky tiki bar. The Poly has that too: the infamous Trader Sam's Grog Grotto which is easy to miss if you don't know to look for it. Kids are welcome until 8 p.m. and then it turns into an adults-only spot -- which is very popular so plan accordingly.

Trader Sam's. (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

If sit-down restaurants are more your thing you're in luck here. You have a choice between Kona Cafe and the ever-popular Ohana.

Kona Cafe is generally easier to get into than Ohana and it has some great menu items like true Kona coffee in a press pot Tonga Toast (which is banana-stuffed French toast rolled in cinnamon sugar) sushi rolls and poke and noodle bowls to name a few options.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy) 0 1

Then there is Ohana which used to have a kids parade and character breakfast but is still a little subdued since its 2021 reopening.

But slightly subdued or not this is a very popular spot so make reservations 60 days in advance to have the best shot at grabbing a table. Ohana will serve you all-you-care-to-enjoy noodles salad dumplings wings chicken steak peel-and-eat-shrimp its famous bread pudding dessert and more.

And if you time your reservation carefully you can see the fireworks from the dining room.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

Having this plethora of some of Disney's best restaurant offerings steps from your room is probably just too enticing.

Why you really shouldn't stay here

After avoiding the ""real"" Disney resorts for decades once I stayed at the Polynesian for the first time in 2017 it was all over for me -- and my wallet. I've now stayed at most of the best hotels at Disney World and find it quite difficult to go back to the more affordable options that once served me well.

And while I love several Disney World hotels the Poly firmly sits in the very top spot.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

Enjoying the downtime at your resort as much as you do your time on the rides in the parks can get addictive so I caution you against giving it a shot.

Due to the current staffing levels and the pandemic I must note with sincerity this time the Poly isn't 100% perfect at the moment. Service was sometimes slow empty glasses were left around for too long and there's still no nightly housekeeping.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

But beyond those very real but hopefully temporary gaps don't stay at Disney's Polynesian Resort unless you're ready for it to be your best Disney experience ever. It is so good that it will be hard to stay elsewhere knowing how easy relaxing and enjoyable things can be at this on-the-monorail deluxe resort.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

Once I experienced how fun and easy Disney could be when you stay at the ""right"" spot I kept coming back. I'll barely stay off-property now that I've had a taste of the Polynesian good life.

Some dreams aren't as sweet in reality but this resort lived up to the decades of hyped expectations I had. That was true not only on that first 2017 visit but time after time and now once again as it is fresh off its remodel.

Just be careful when you start dabbling your toes into the best-of-the-best deluxe Disney resorts -- you may then not want to do Disney any other way.

Tips: How To Get Back in the Habit of Budgeting for Travel

GOBankingRates examined how admission fees have changed since the theme park opened in 1971 through 2021 according to data from AllEars.net. Then GOBankingRates used the Bureau of Labor Statistics' inflation calculator to determine the yearly rates adjusted for inflation. Prices for tickets or entrance fees to other Disney parks in the Orland0 Florida area were not considered; all data is for the price of general admission tickets to the Magic Kingdom at Disney World only. Admission prices between 1971-81 include sales tax and prices after 1981 do not.

All in all ""The Most Magical Place on Earth"" certainly sells some of the priciest theme park tickets around the globe.

“Thank you for everything” Yvonne Orji’s Molly proclaims to Issa Rae’s Issa in the series finale of Insecure on Sunday.

After more than a spell of discord and distance between the treasured friends last year and throughout this fifth and final season the four words from a now-married Molly deftly encapsulate and navigate the Prentice Penny-directed and Rae-penned episode titled “Everything Gonna Be Okay?” Aware of the debate definitions and competing perspectives that the end of Insecure will incite Rae Penny the writers and team took a long-tail approach with years playing out over the 10th episode of Season 5 through birthday celebrations.

Put it this way — and remember this last season of Insecure was one of my Top 10 TV series of 2021 — if you thought the “messy sh*t” to quote Kendrick Sampson’s Nathan that went down between Nathan and Lawrence (Jay Ellis) after the latter professed his love for Issa at the moving-to-Colorado party of Tiffany (Amanda Seales) and Derek (Wade Allain-Marcus) in the penultimate “Out Okay” episode was bracing the finale was prophecy fulfillment in action.

What you have said to Lawrence if Nathan hadn’t interrupted?

Girl it’s not too late if that’s what you really want. #InsecureHBO pic.twitter.com/EamrvVLd4c — Yvonne Orji (@YvonneOrji) December 27 2021

Of course this being the show that was spawned in 2016 in part out of creator Rae’s The Mis-Adventures of Awkward Black Girl web show it was far from all cakes and candles exploding or not. Amidst the passage of time and the emergence of loss literally and figuratively Orji’s Molly put a ring on her finger and was good with it and was very good with her friend Issa Dee and the journey their relationship had been on. Correspondingly as there were pregnancies and regretful moves among other primary characters and big moves for Dee’s the Blocc company Issa tells a still courting Lawrence that she’s alright with taking another chance on things working out for them.

And if that domestic bliss birthday scene at the end of the episode is any indication things are working out just fine.

With all that the very busy Rae who inked a lucrative five-year pact with WarnerMedia earlier this year spoke with me about how Insecure got to that end what she thinks about the reactions to the finale and what the Emmy-winning show’s legacy is for her.

DEADLINE: So you finished filming a while ago but now the finale is out in the world how does that feel?

RAE: I’m really just relieved that it’s out there that we were able to end the show on our terms and tell the story that we wanted to tell and I hope people appreciate where these characters ended up and know that this is more reflecting of a new beginning for them which is the approach we took to this finale. It’s just like what stories do we want to play out if this did get a Season 6 as our lives in the Insecure world continue. I know people are going to have a lot to say as they always do but I’m really proud of our finale.

DEADLINE: Was this the ending you always had in mind or if you don’t mind me asking with all the threads that entwined here was the finale a work in progress over this season? – and I’m not just talking about Issa and Lawrence ..

RAE: (LAUGHS) It was a work in progress for sure. I mean that bathroom moment with Issa and Molly was something that Prentice and I talked about from the jump.

That was just something that I visualized and he executed it so perfectly and beautifully but the elements of the finale definitely changed. At one point we wanted to jump five years into the future and show Issa and Molly in Morocco and tell that story. While sudden it did not feel like the right ending especially spending so much of our finale away from L.A. which has been a character in the show.

DEADLINE: And birthdays became one in the finale which really hung it together as a backdrop …

RAE: I thought about my own life and my own friendships and how hard it is as you get older to get together. So birthdays being a staple and almost a guarantee for us despite life’s circumstances to stay in touch and getting together gave me the path to tell the story of Molly and Issa not necessarily growing apart but like physically being unable to gather because of life’s circumstances and only get together through birthdays. It was a way to o show that they were just always going to be there for each other in some capacity.

DEADLINE: Series finales are so hard and I would guess even more so for a show like Insecure with its finely tuned balance developed over the years. I mention that because you mentioned that you think people are going to have a lot to say about the end as they have week after week and this is where I’m asking about Issa and Lawrence getting back together and in apparent domestic blended family bliss – you know the reaction is going to be strong to that with a lot of fans pounding their digital chests in social media rage. What’s your take on that reaction?

RAE: I don’t give a fuck how people react to it because to answer your question it was a journey for both of our characters to be honest.

DEADLINE: How so?

RAE: In the beginning of the season as soon as we got in the writer’s room that was a burning question and I was just like no they’re not ending up together. There was just no way and that was an argument. Like we had the argument that the girls have in episode seven about why Issa should have moved past Lawrence and move off Lawrence. Like Kelli and Molly used to say “I don’t want her to be a stepmom. I don’t want this for her.”

He’s clearly grappling with a lot of these issues. There’s going to be drama and I want better for my girl and so we had different endings in mind and different journeys for her. Then when I became Issa Dee and we started shooting the show there was just a part of me that really missed him and that wanted him. I realized that there was a happiness that she/I had with him and I stand by the fact that they should have broken up in that first episode because Lawrence was going to be in a toxic messy relationship and she was going to be wrapped up into all this.

But I am a firm believer that sometimes you need time and if it’s right for you and you want it then it can be yours.

Happiness being a choice has been a theme for these two characters for the last couple of seasons. I can choose to be happy with you and I want to choose to be happy with you and if it doesn’t work out then fuck you. I think that that’s what our character wants at the end of the day and I know audiences will have opinions. A lot of people hate Lawrence but luckily it’s not their relationship.

Uh oh Issa been thinking about Lawrence…… #insecurehbo — Jay Ellis (@JayREllis) December 27 2021

DEADLINE: The definitive. However another relationship a lot of viewers had with the show and through Issa Dee via Issa Rae and team was with Los Angeles. Over the years it’s become canon that Insecure is partially a love letter to friendship true and deep but the series was also a love letter to the City of Angels. As you said today L.A. has been a character in the show and that character got a big send off as much as Molly and Issa in some ways why was that last poignant drive around so important to include?

RAE: I remember being in Arizona last year trying to like think about what this finale was going to be and I was just driving and one of my favorite songs came on the radio which is ‘Rose in the Dark’ by Cleo Sol. That was what we ended up using for a song and I just got emotional thinking about how I wanted that final scene to be of her just revisiting her past and like literally driving on the journey to the landmarks that made her who she is and figure out where she is today.

You know L.A. has been such a character and these locations that she visited Prentice and I made up a list of the spots that we just knew meant so much to Issa and the show in general. It just felt right to also give that city a sendoff in the same way we were giving these characters the sendoff and thanks for noticing that.

DEADLINE: Thank you for that.

Issa as we come to the end of this year everyone’s looking back and years always feel like they encapsulate something but I was particularly struck by that final scene with the mirror because mirror Issa and real Issa have been obviously not the closest of sisters over the years to put it mildly …

RAE: (LAUGHS) No!

DEADLINE: Just sayin’ but looking at that final scene in the bathroom of Issa and Lawrence’s house and dinner with Lawrence’s son Elijah is about to be served it’s all good — mirror Issa Dee is gone. There is such a precision to this finale yet of everything you guys got in there it felt like that scene could have dangled yet you cut it short. So long question short why?

RAE: Across the show the bathroom mirror Issa in particular that’s always been a place where real Issa could be her real self where she wasn’t in the outside world. So there was always a separation of who she was in that mirror versus who she was outside. As the series progressed of course she started to lean on that mirror a bit more and it became a source of a lot of her insecurities. This show in its entirety has been the journey of her growing into this secure person. Secure in who’s she’s not who cures her insecurities and I think not having her rely on that mirror in the end was just a symbolic way to show that she was kind of good on her own. She’s now the same in the bathroom as she is in the outside world and she’s good with that.

DEADLINE: Which is so much of how this finale functions so well in my opinion – you get us to the place where the show circles itself. Now it is all done and a bit of time has passed on the finale for you and you have a full dance card of projects companies and initiatives what are you most proud of about Insecure?

RAE: Showcasing regular black people. Making regular black people compelling without some of the tropes and stereotypes that sometimes the industry deems compelling about our lives and our history. Also being able to also be a pipeline for other black creators and creatives and to inspire the industry to take a chance on other stories like this. I’m really really proud of that. The pipeline in particular is something we set out to do but to have such an influence in this way is not something that we pictured us being able to have.

DEADLINE: What other shows did you draw on for inspiration in getting Insecure to the finale you wanted it to have?

RAE: I mean I thought about a lot of my favorite finales that stuck with me. You know Fresh Prince is one. Six Feet Under is one Breaking Bad is one but also a lot of my favorite shows to me haven’t gotten proper ending. I just thought a lot about that a satisfying ending and there is a satisfying sense of closure but also I could see where this story could continue if I wanted to. I could still imagine what these characters with the exception of like Breaking Bad but Six Feet Under to me is like a representation of an ultra-satisfying finale in addition to like Fresh Prince.

DEADLINE: So is there any sense that we might see a return of Insecure in some form or another or some of these characters?

RAE: Not on my watch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvZ2VuZXJhbC9sYWVtbWxlLXRoZWF0ZXJzLW9sZGVyLWF1ZGllbmNlcy0xMjM0Njg3ODM5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Laemmle Theaters President on Bringing Older Audiences Back,"Older people who have historically been a core component of arthouse theater audiences have been more reluctant to return to to the cinema amid the pandemic compared to younger people. Now the leader of one of Los Angeles’ most prominent chains has raised an idea: Maybe it’s just too early to try to bring them back.

“It’s going to take some time to acquire an audience to reacquaint them with moviegoing. And you have to be careful — I mean how much effort do we put into outreach during this environment versus do we need to save our ammo until the coast is clear?” Laemmle Theaters President Greg Laemmle said in an interview last week with The Boxoffice Podcast.

Laemmle offered some insight into the state of his eight Southern California locations. He said the company has focused its efforts on catering to an audience that’s ready to get back to the movies.

“Some theaters are doing better than others and in part that’s about the age of the audience that will support those locations. Art films and films in general that are appealing to a younger audience are having an easier time at achieving a higher percentage of box office” Laemmle said. “The older audience is still very much on the fence.”

Laemmle said he saw “good momentum” between April and the beginning of July but then the surge of the Delta variant “just really kicked our ass.” Asked by host Rebecca Pahle about a movie that has performed particularly well at his theaters Laemmle said Wes Anderson’s “The French Dispatch” has been a standout. Released on October 22 the film has grossed $15.9 million domestic to date.

“It’s a name director and a younger-appealing audience” he said. “Unfortunately I can’t look at films like ‘Belfast’ films like ‘Spencer’ even films like ‘Titane’ to some extent and really see ‘God this would have done so much better in a pre-pandemic environment why is this film struggling to find an audience?'”

Laemmle said it’s all an uphill battle. And as the emergence of the Omicron variant has shown the pandemic is not over.

“That real effort to acquire the audience that has some reasonable concern about coming out maybe we just need to wait till it passes. It’s kind of like the riptide concept — the last thing you want to do is swim against the tide” he said. “The tide takes you where it’s going to take you eventually you’ll get out of that riptide and you can move to the side and then get back to where you need to get back. Save your energy until you can have some impact.”

Zooming out Laemmle talked about a broader philosophy of “meeting the audience halfway” through price and programming. One example: Laemmle knows there are larger populations of Farsi speakers near his Encino location so he’s more likely to program Iranian films there compared to in Pasadena.

“Maybe the traditional arthouse audience does not want to see a really great horror film indie horror film or they may not want to see a film from a country or a region or a language that is not something that is traditionally on their radar” he said. “But there is an audience that wants to see those films and you have to put them in a theater and give them a shot to see it and then obviously tailor your marketing.”

WM,Waste Management,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlY2xpbWF0ZW5ld3Mub3JnL25ld3MvMjUxMjIwMjEvcGxhc3RpYy1wb2xsdXRpb24tZ2xvYmFsLXRyZWF0eS1uYWlyb2JpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World Talks on a Treaty to Control Plastic Pollution Are Set for Nairobi in February. How To Do So Is Still Up in the Air,"Governments are taking steps to rein in plastic waste.

But none of what’s been done so far has been up to the challenge of a growing plastics industry fed by consumer demand for more plastic products resulting in a deepening global plastic waste crisis.

As a result there is now an intensifying focus on the possibility of a global treaty to control plastic pollution.

The next milestone in a diplomatic process that began in 2014 could come in February in Nairobi Kenya when the U.N. Environmental Assembly meets to decide if it will endorse the beginning of official negotiations over a plastics treaty.

Those efforts may have received a boost in late November when Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the Biden administration would join the talks. Blinken reversing a position from the Trump administration said the U.S. goal is to “create a tool that we can use to protect our oceans and all of the life that they sustain from growing global harms of plastic pollution.”

The chemical industry and environmental groups alike have welcomed U.S. engagement in formal treaty talks with environmental groups like Greenpeace citing the need for global solutions to a global problem and the chemical industry expressing hope that a treaty could help advance its vision of eliminating plastic waste. Separately the industry has opposed suggestions that there be a cap placed on plastic production.

In backing the treaty process Erin Simon head of plastic waste and business for World Wildlife Fund a conservation group that operates in 100 countries cited a 2020 Pew Charitable Trusts report that said without “immediate ambitious and concerted actions” the world by 2040 would see the annual flow of plastic into the ocean triple to about 29 million metric tons per year the equivalent of 2500 single-use plastic bottles for every meter of ocean beach.

“That would continue to obviously create huge impacts on species through entanglement ingestion and just messing up the ecosystems” Simon said. “It would continue to create issues for coastal communities and local fisheries” placing a significant toll on “public health and vulnerable communities in general who are already disproportionately impacted.”

Devil in the Details

Cities states and entire countries have banned single use plastics like grocery bags and straws. Some 187 nations though not the United States have agreed to restrict international trade in plastic scrap and waste. And Congress in November authorized $350 million for recycling and management of plastic waste including the first funding for the 2020 Save Our Seas 2.0 Act to boost research international cooperation ocean cleanup and waste management.

With a treaty the devil will be in the details and the hard work of getting enough countries to agree on the scope and provisions. Observers say the process could take years.

Conceptually the countries supporting a new plastic treaty seem to be dividing into two schools of thought said Björn Beeler the international coordinator for the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) comprised of more than 600 public interest nongovernmental organizations in 128 countries working to eliminate toxic pollutants.

One school of thought focuses on a “lifecycle” approach that would take into account the impacts of plastics from production to their use and disposal or recycling. It’s led by Rwanda and Peru with support from the European Union and could limit virgin plastic production and control the use of toxic chemicals that are added into plastic products Beeler said.

The other takes a “waste management” approach and would focus more narrowly on strategies to control plastic waste. This orientation has been defined under a draft resolution from Japan he said.

Environmentalists are pushing for restrictions on single use plastics like bags cutlery and straws making plastic producers responsible for plastic waste and enforceable national limits on the flow of plastics into the ocean.

Representatives of the pollutants elimination network said that to be effective any treaty also needs to ban toxic chemical additives in plastics. On Dec. 14 IPEN and another environmental organization seeking to fight plastics pollution International Pellet Watch released two reports that detailed the presence of chemicals found in plastic pellets spilled on beaches and recycled plastic pellets purchased from recycling facilities globally. The groups are working with partner organizations in 35 countries.

Health effects associated with the chemicals include cancer and hormonal effects that can lead to reproductive growth and cognitive impairment according to the reports.

“When you add chemicals to plastics they are not strongly attached” said Sara Brosché an IPEN science advisor and lead author of one of the reports. “So they can leach out. They will slowly move into the household dust” she said. When children put toys in their mouths she added “these chemicals can move out of plastic material” and dissolve in their saliva.

‘Bound up in the Health of Our Oceans’

It’s unclear what specifically the Biden administration wants out of a plastics treaty. But in making his announcement in November Blinken said countries will need to “develop and enforce strong national action plans to address this problem at its source. We recognize that different actors will have different capacities to act but every nation every community and indeed every individual has a role to play.”

He also said “the private sector in particular will need to do more.”

Human health and survival is “bound up in the health of our oceans” Blinken said adding that plastic is sickening and killing ocean animals. “And because plastics absorb toxins when we eat seafood we’re not only consuming microplastics but toxins as well” he said.

IPEN however is concerned that the United States one of the leading plastic producing nations in the world will side with an industry that emphasizes waste management and so-called “advanced” or “chemical” recycling. A National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine report in November concluded that so far chemical or advanced recycling is limited to energy intensive processes used to make fuel or other chemical products rather than new plastics.

“If a treaty promotes waste management and subsidizes chemical recycling which is basically plastic fuels waste-to-energy or building up waste management facilities then you begin to subsidize with public funds the responsibility of the private sector that’s making this product” Beeler said.

Industry’s Nod

In the United States the plastics and chemical industries have fought state local and Congressional efforts to ban plastics or cap plastic production. But the American Chemistry Council a major lobbying arm of the chemical industry and one that Beeler described as a “powerful actor in this whole conversation” has given a nod to Blinken’s announcement that the United States would back efforts to work on a global treaty.

“We are supportive of a global agreement among nations that will accelerate a transition to a more circular economy by expanding systems and infrastructure to collect and repurpose plastic resources” said Joshua Baca the American Chemistry Council’s vice president of plastics in a written statement.

Baca said U.S. plastic makers the International Council of Chemical Associations and the World Plastics Council support a treaty framework with principles that include having all nations agree to eliminating plastic waste while providing flexibility to meet the needs of individual nations. They also want widespread access to waste collection along with “recognizing the role plastics play in a lower-carbon future.”

The industry argues that plastics actually reduce emissions blamed for causing global warming for example by making products lighter and easier to transport and because plastic packaging better keeps food fresh longer reducing food waste and methane emissions. For a more sustainable future the Plastics Industry Association says “we need more plastic not less”

The industry’s position on plastics and global warming however runs counter to recent studies that show plastics production and disposal from production to disposal are adding to global greenhouse gas emissions and will only get worse.

The Center for International Environmental Law working with the Environmental Integrity Project FracTracker Alliance and others in 2019 concluded that the plastics’ and petrochemical industries’ worldwide growth plans could make it impossible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius the most challenging benchmark established under the 2015 Paris climate agreement.

The industry’s lifecycle emissions from natural gas extraction to plastics production and disposal was projected to rise to 1.34 billion metric tons per year by 2030 equivalent to the emissions from nearly 300 coal-fired power plants sized at 500-megawatts each the study found.

In October the group Beyond Plastics led by former regional EPA administrator Judith Enck published “The New Coal Plastics and Climate Change” which found that as coal plants close and petrochemical infrastructure expands in the United States the plastics industry’s contribution to climate change will exceed that of coal by 2030.

When the diplomats get together in February those from the United States may also find backing for strong action in the National Academies report which concluded that the United States the largest producer of plastic waste needs a comprehensive strategy by the end of 2022 to curb its devastating impacts on ocean health and marine wildlife. It offered several overarching recommendations including a national cap on the production of virgin plastic.

A Call for the Treaty

A mix of businesses some of which have been under withering pressure because of their use of single-use plastic packaging or bottles are joining the call for a treaty.

The World Wildlife Fund with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and Boston Consulting Group in 2020 published a “Business Case for a UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution.” The report observed that “many companies are facing increased reputational risks” from their use of plastics threatening their customer bases as well as their ability to attract employees. The report also noted that it was “no longer a question of whether regulation is coming but what regulation is coming.”

Regulations already on the books vary so much from jurisdiction to jurisdiction—including bans against plastic bans—that it has become “increasingly difficult for businesses to navigate the maze of heterogeneous regulations at global national and even subnational levels” according to the report.

The three organizations have a “manifesto” now backed by dozens of businesses acknowledging that plastic “plays an important role in our lives and brings many benefits” but that “mounting evidence shows this problem will continue to grow unless we fundamentally rethink the way we produce use reuse and dispose of plastic.” So far about 90 companies have signed on including financial institutions producers retailers and brand owners such as Fidelity International Sodexo Coca Cola and Procter & Gamble.

There has also been a series of summits this year about a plastics treaty between activists and industry representatives organized by The Ocean Plastics Leadership Network a 90-member group assisted by World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace that is working “not to achieve consensus but understanding and hopefully new ideas and collaborations” according to its website.

While a treaty could be years away Simon with the World Wildlife Fund said she expects there could be progress along the way in part because the process will further reveal the problems with plastic waste and potential solutions.

Because urgent action is needed she said “I’m going to be less caught up in how long it’s going to take and more about if the right topics are being discussed to signal the actions I need to see.”

“The conservation easement that is currently in place prevents the current owner from operating the property as a landfill or any other owner in the future” said LaShea Lofton Dayton’s deputy city manager.

In 2015 Stony Hollow Landfill asked the Dayton Plan Board to allow it to rezone about 29 acres of property south of its facility to establish a soil borrow operation.

The landfill located at 2460 S. Gettysburg Ave. needs soil for its daily operations to cover waste taken there for disposal and other purposes.

Explore Landfill request incites controversy

But the plan board on two different occasions voted to deny the request after neighbors complained with some residents saying the facility is ugly smelly causes pollution and hurts their property values.

Neighbors and plan board members however primarily were concerned that the landfill might try to expand its footprint for waste disposal increasing the facility’s lifespan.

The landfill which began accepting solid waste in 1996 originally was projected to fill up and close down after about 11 years.

However the landfill later received Ohio Environmental Protection Agency approval to expand and it continues to operate and isn’t expected to reach capacity and close for years to come.

But Stony Hollow Landfill has signed a conservation easement that says the soil borrow property cannot be used for landfill or waste purposes said Tony Kroeger Dayton’s division manager of planning and land use.

Under the easement Dayton and Moraine — which has property adjacent to the landfill — can inspect the site to ensure its compliance with the prohibition.

Currently Stony Hollow Landfill brings in soil using about eight to 12 large trucks each day which causes pollution and noise and wears down public roads city staff said.

The planned soil borrow operation could remove about 19000 trucks from public roads during the lifetime of the soil borrow area which is expected to be about three to six years said Peter Lucas Stony Hollow’s site engineer and soon-to-be manager of the facility.

Lucas said once soil extraction activities are complete the property will be revegetated and landscaping enhancements will screen nearby residential properties.

The Dayton City Commission last week approved Stony Hollow’s request by an unanimous vote.

Four of the five commissioners had to vote in favor of the request to approve it after the plan board’s denial.

Some people still oppose the project.

In a letter to the city commission Nathaniel and Shannon Stepps who live nearby said the landfill causes odors noise birds underground contamination and is an eyesore.

They said neighbors have suffered enough after earlier landfill expansions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy52Y3N0YXIuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8xMi8yNi9jaHJpc3RtYXMtdHJlZS1kaXNwb3NhbC1uZWFyLW1lLWVjby10aXAtaG93LXdoZXJlLXJlY3ljbGUteW91ci1jaHJpc3RtYXMtdHJlZS12ZW50dXJhLWNvdW50eS84OTk3ODk4MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eco-tip: How where to recycle your Christmas tree in Ventura County,"David Goldstein

Special to Ventura County Star

Even though Christmas tree recycling is an annual ritual differing rules dates and deadlines in various parts of Ventura County can make collection and drop-off confusing. The advertisements flyers and online outreach from each city are seen by residents of other areas but each resident needs to know their own city’s rules.

Other than grinding your tree and using the mulch or composting it on site the best “treecycling” method for the environment requiring the least amount of truck idling time and transportation is for you to cut your tree into four-foot segments and fit the pieces into your regular curbside yard waste recycling cart. As long as your tree is free of decorations stands or other items it will be mulched with your other yard clippings.

Fireproofed trees should be placed in garbage carts rather than yard waste carts and you must remove decorations and stands but trees flocked with fake snow are acceptable in all cities except Thousand Oaks.

If you will not cut your tree to fit into your cart free whole tree pickup on the regular day of collection is scheduled for these areas:

Harrison & Sons and Waste Management/GI Industries collection in unincorporated areas Camarillo Thousand Oaks Simi Valley and Moorpark Dec. 27 through Jan. 7. Note: Athens Services takes over in Thousand Oaks on Jan. 1.

Athens in Santa Paula through Jan. 8.

Port Hueneme Jan. 4-14 and Oxnard through Jan. 29.

If you set out a tree after a deadline or in an area without free collection you will be charged for special collection unless you make separate arrangements. In most areas you can make these arrangements by calling your refuse collector and requesting your annually allocated “free bulky item collection.”

If you live in a multifamily building without yard waste service ask your apartment manager to contract separately with your hauler for special service.

For businesses homes without curbside yard waste service and apartments without yard waste collection bins Christmas tree recycling drop-off sites are available during operating hours and will be free through Jan. 10 at the following locations:

Agromin Organics 6859 Arnold Road near Oxnard Monday-Friday 7 a.m.-4:30 p.m. and Saturday 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.

Agromin’s corporate office 201 Kinetic Drive Oxnard Monday-Friday 7 a.m.-4:30 p.m.

Peach Hill Soils’ retail site at Performance Nursery at 6101 E. Los Angeles Ave. Somis Monday-Friday 7 a.m.-4 p.m. and Saturday 7 a.m.-2 p.m.

Peach Hill Soils compost site 10765 W. Los Angeles Ave. near Moorpark Monday-Friday 7 a.m.-4 p.m. and Saturday 7 a.m.-2 p.m..

Agromin and Peach Hill offer free bags of mulch or compost to residents dropping off trees at these locations.

Here are some other options:

Waste Management’s Simi Valley Landfill and Recycling Center 2801 Madera Road allows free tree drop-off Monday to Saturday 7 a.m.-3 p.m. through Jan. 15.

Moorpark provides its residents with a free drop-off location on Marquette Street at Park Crest Lane through Jan. 9.

Santa Paula’s downtown train station drop-off is open through Jan. 8.

Oxnard residents may drop off trees free at the Del Norte Regional Recycling and Transfer Station through Jan. 29 at the scale house Monday-Saturday 6 a.m.-5 p.m. or at the buy-back center Tuesday-Saturday 9 a.m.-3 p.m.

In most areas residents can also put out extra trash after Christmas.

For example residents of unincorporated areas get free collection of up to two extra 50-gallon bags on their day of collection through Jan. 8.

Ojai residents may double their set-out using tied bags adjacent to trash carts and collapsed cardboard next to their recycling through Jan. 8. Moorpark residents can set out up to three extra bags of trash or recycling at no extra charge through Jan. 10.

Every year I’ve intended this list to highlight the beauty of the diversity across our state. I want kids here in Wisconsin to see role models of people who are succeeding to know that it’s possible for Black people to achieve great things here.

That’s exactly what our first five lists accomplished and what we hope to continue with this year’s list.

We can’t pretend though that this is just another year. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on our communities for nearly two years now — our health and our jobs and our financial wellbeing and our education system and all of these effects are most pronounced in our Black communities. Add to that the brighter-than-ever spotlight on the injustice of systemic racism — it’s been a tough couple years for everybody but even more so for our Black communities.

Many have responded to this extraordinary time by expressing an authentic desire to learn more about Black people get to know Black communities celebrate Black excellence. That’s what this list is — and has always been — about. This list is no longer just a list. It is also an invitation — an invitation to engage to create to make Wisconsin a better place to attract and retain leaders of color.

We have never intended this list to be exhaustive. Obviously no list has been because we keep finding more and more dynamic leaders doing real work across the private public and nonprofit sectors. This list will however introduce you to some people you’ve never heard of who are doing great things in other parts of the state or simply working behind the scenes doing the work without the accolades.

It was important for us to expand the way we think about influence and to highlight more of the people doing what it takes to improve their community. That’s one reason this list is entirely new every year — we considered anyone named on previous lists to be ineligible for this one even though most of the people on past lists continue to wield considerable influence.

Over the next five days I hope you learn something you didn’t know about some of the real leaders in communities throughout Wisconsin and that we might be able to make some connections and start conversations that really move communities forward.

Girard Ave. in Philadelphia is among the companies that use Vitable LLC to provide primary and urgent care to their employees. Here Tiffany Chavous Somerset's director is getting her annual physical as well as her blood drawn for TB testing by Vicky Tubens-Lowa a Vitable nurse practitioner. Read more

Joseph Kitonga is a 24-year-old from Delaware County who aims to reinvent the way primary care is delivered to hourly workers who lack health insurance.

His primary care service Vitable LLC has gotten strong reviews from employers and workers in child care restaurants and home care for its high quality and convenience. The firm has already signed up 10000 people in its current markets of Southeastern Pennsylvania and Delaware.

“The best part of all that is they come to you because when you’re sick you really don’t want to go nowhere” said Elaine Green a Somerset Academy pre-school teacher in Philadelphia whose school uses the service.

Kitonga who emigrated from Kenya to the United States with his family when he was 13 founded primary care provider Vitable LLC in 2019 while studying computer engineering at Pennsylvania State University and has been winning technology accolades and millions from investors.

Last year Vitable went through the prestigious Silicon Valley technology start-up accelerator Y Combinator and Kitonga won a fellowship from billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel’s foundation. The fellowship includes $100000 over two years for young entrepreneurs who skip college or drop out to build a business.

Forbes recently named Kitonga one of its 30 entrepreneurs under 30 years old to watch in 2022.

Vitable headquartered in Woodlyn with a second office in Northern Liberties sells virtual and in-person primary and urgent-care services to small employers of hourly workers charging about $50 a month per employee. The company has gained a foothold in a competitive arena joining such tech titans as Amazon.com in aiming to eliminate inefficiencies and inconvenience in basic care.

For all the technology accolades Kitonga’s business has a human focus inspired by the health-care travails of employees at Hosana Home Health Care a Delaware County company that his parents started in 2012.

“At their small business hourly workers made too much to qualify for Medicaid too little to afford comprehensive health insurance so they were stuck uninsured and overutilizing the ER” Kitonga said. “Vitable is built to be their primary-care plan that is both affordable and accessible.”

Patient convenience

Vitable has been a hit at Somerset Academy a child-care center and preschool on West Girard Avenue near Eighth Street.

“You don’t want to go to the doctors’ office. You don’t want to be bothered” when you’re sick explained Green a veteran pre-school teacher who has worked at Somerset for two years. “That’s what I like. Anytime I have an issue or a problem they’re always prompt always call and they even check back later. I like that.”

On Dec. 17 a nurse practitioner Vicky Tubens-Lowa who works about eight hours a week for Vitable was at Somerset doing required annual physical exams for Green and other staff members. Somerset employs 22.

“We absolutely love Vitable” said Tiffany Chavous Somerset’s director recalling how Vitable came to her house to check her for strep throat. Chavous also received her physical from Tubens-Lowa on the 17th.

Vitable’s approach attracted a $1.6 million investment led by SoftBank’s Opportunity Fund early this year and Vitable announced in October that it received $7.2 million in venture capital to expand. The next market will be Baltimore in February Kitonga said.

Philadelphia’s First Round Capital contributed more than 80% of the latest investment in Vitable which employs 22 and uses about 50 nurse practitioners such as Tubens-Lowa as independent contractors to provide much of the care. Vitable did not disclose its annual revenue or profitability.

First Round partner Josh Kopelman who chairs The Inquirer’s board said it’s important for a start-up founder to have a deep understanding of the problem the company is trying to solve which in the case of Vitable is serving low-wage hourly employees who often have poor access to affordable health care.

“Joseph connects to this on so many levels” Kopelman said. “This isn’t someone who won a business plan competition with a random idea. This is someone who is connected deeply with the problem.”

Primary care as hot spot for innovation

But Vitable isn’t the only company tackling primary care. There’s been a flood of investment over the last 10 years in primary care and telehealth by start-ups and giants such as CVS Health Corp. which has primary care HealthHubs planned for stores nationwide. Plymouth Meeting’s Accolade started to help employees of large companies navigate health care providers this year paid $380 million for PlushCare Inc. an online primary care provider.

“Within primary care what’s happening today is that all the big tech firms like Amazon and many of the digital first start-ups are getting into primary care because it’s relatively safe to price in the risk and to manage the population” said Paddy Padmanabhan  CEO of Damo Consulting near Chicago which specializes in digital health care. He said primary care can be very profitable under these new models depending on the health of the population covered.

Padmanabhan noted that Vitable’s approach to primary care — at small employers — is at the opposite end of the market from Amazon Care which is trying to sign up large employers for its hybrid of virtual and in-person primary care. In-person visits are available in only some markets.

Kitonga and Kopelman said most primary-care start-ups are designed as a convenience for employees of large companies people who already have good access to health care services.

“That is obviously the most profitable segment of the market but they left the long tail of the market small businesses the hourly workers completely underserved” Kitonga said generally of the industry. “For me that’s where the interest lay where I wanted to build this service for my parents and their employees. I think that’s where the problem is yet to be solved.”

Vitable’s backbone is a software system Kitonga and his employees built that allows the company to control the “end-to-end experience” including the app for members the electronic medical record of visits and the dashboard for employers said Kitonga who dropped out of Penn State in January 2020 and turned down a job offer as a software engineer at Microsoft Corp. to focus on Vitable.

Consumers can reach Vitable by phone email or through a smartphone app. After that initial contact Vitable’s algorithms route the patient to “the most appropriate care setting whether it’s a quick virtual visit or an in-home visit. All that enables us to have same-day visits available for members” Kitonga said. The service is not available for people 65 and older because of Medicare rules Vitable said.

Nurse practitioners such as Tubens-Lowa who also works in an urgent care center notify Vitable of their availability in two-week blocks. “It gives you a lot of flexibility. I can give them as much or as little time as I have available” she said.

What Vitable does for employers

Olive Baimba president of Elite Care & Staffing LLC in Upper Darby was thrilled to learn about Vitable in September 2020. Her home-care workers were facing months-long delays — because of the havoc COVID-19 caused in health care — in getting the annual physicals required to work as a caregiver.

Elite’s human resources director learned about Vitable when a company nurse practitioner came to their office building to give physicals at another home-care company based there. Elite soon signed up for the service and now has a three-year contract covering 150 full-timers Baimba said. Elite employs more than 300 overall.

“When we signed up it blew my mind. It was amazing their quality of service” Baimba said..

Some employers see Vitable as an added benefit that can help retain and attract workers at a time of widespread labor shortages.

That’s why Jon Myerow founder and partner at Tria which has three restaurants in Center City buys the service for his 65 employees. Tria also offers traditional health insurance gradually paying a greater percentage of the premium as employees’ tenure increases he said.

“Vitable is good for people both with health insurance and without health insurance” Myerow said. “It offers health care with no deductible and it’s incredibly convenient because they have nurse practitioners that go to the employees’ homes or workplaces or do telehealth. I’ve seen people using it who have Cadillac plans just because of its convenience.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

While the aftermath of the pandemic-induced disruptions have not fully ebbed the overall employment scenario is looking more positive now.""Omicron or not we have reason to believe that the days of complete shutdown are behind us. Everyone be it employees employers or government bodies have realised that a fine balance between lives and livelihoods will have to be struck"" Balasubramanian A Business Head (consumer and healthcare) at TeamLease Services said.The back-to-office trend is in full swing and companies are optimistic about their recruitment plans aided by robust economic growth rise in consumption levels and expanding vaccination coverage.""We are also witnessing an increased investment in private equity and M&A deals. The vaccination coverage is expanding and the shortage of skilled talent across sectors only indicates a buoyant job scenario in 2022"" Nitya Vijaykumar Sr. Knowledge Advisor at SHRM India said.Striking a note of caution Vijaykumar also said ""Only time will tell if the worst is behind us but clearly almost all sectors seem to be prepared for the future.""The growth that the white-collar employment space has been witnessing is expected to continue he said adding the hiring sentiment across conglomerates large companies and startups is also very positive he noted.According to the latest ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook Survey hiring sentiment for the January-March quarter in India is the strongest reported in eight years with 49 per cent of companies planning to add more staff in the next three months.As per the survey hiring sentiment in India improved by five percentage points in comparison with the prior quarter and by 43 percentage points when compared with this time one year ago.As we march towards 2022 candidates with specialised niche skill sets will be more in demand than ever. Technology will continue to be in vogue and pay a significant wage premium.""The key 'theme' for hiring in 2022 will be specificity -- hiring for specific roles focusing on the right profile. Recruiters will prioritise the 'who to hire' rather than 'what to hire'. 2022 will be the year of data-driven recruitment"" Siddhartha Gupta CEO of Mercer|Mettl said.""The combination of the pandemic 'Great Resignation' and the digitisation process has forever changed the way we define 'work'. The era of '9 to 5' 'Monday to Friday' is coming to an end"" Gupta said adding that ""the notion that productivity equates to the number of hours is outdated"".In 2022 employees will have leverage in the employee-employer relationship and recruiters will need to rethink their strategy to attract top talent. Companies will focus on transparent diversity equity and inclusion policies and will implement a 'Listening Culture' -- the formation of workplace guidelines and policies based on employee feedback.Moreover as talent attraction and retention remain a challenge companies are ready to go beyond just competitive salaries and are increasingly focusing on a wider range of benefits wellness upskilling and the overall employee experience.As companies are facing mounting challenges of attracting and retaining employees they are planning to give employees larger hikes around 7-9 per cent on an average and top performers can expect about 1.5 to 1.8 times the increments given to average performers experts said.According to the 'Salary Budget Planning Report' by global advisory broking and solutions company Willis Towers Watson salaries are projected to see a median salary increase of 9.3 per cent next year compared to the actual median salary increase of 8 per cent in 2021.India's projected salary increase is the highest in Asia-Pacific for the next year as optimism returns over improved business outlook in the next 12 months the report added.The sectors that are likely to be in focus in 2022 are IT technology telecoms communications media hospitality BFSI and real estate. Fintech Edtech  NBFCs FMCG and Pharma are some of the other sectors to watch out for. As capex picks up manufacturing firms are also likely to join the upswing.Experts believe that overall recruitments may reach pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022 unless Omicron or any new coronavirus variant hits hard. However this rebound in the job market will remain deeply uneven sector by sector. The industries that are impacted by the permanent shift to online activity and remote work will continue to feel the aftershocks of the pandemic.Going ahead organisations will continue to invest in technology and continuous reskilling of their employees. A large part of hiring across sectors is likely to happen within critical functions such as engineering information technology technically skilled trades sales and finance experts said.Amidst the pandemic-uncertainty both employees and employers have their concerns for the future world of work but they are sure about one thing the workplace will never quite look the same and they must evolve together.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Las Vegas has been advertising itself as the sports and entertainment capital of the world with a perfect mix of the two found in the north end zone of Allegiant Stadium.

That’s where you’ll find the Wynn Field Club an only-in-Las-Vegas stadium feature boasting a full-fledged nightclub at field level. The club made possible by a founding partnership deal between Wynn Las Vegas and stadium officials and the Raiders is open for all Raiders home games and other select Allegiant Stadium events that boast a large capacity.

The 10691-square-foot space was designed by Allegiant Stadium architect David Manica and features 29 booths 18 dining tables four bars dual DJ booths 39 televisions and a large LED screen to catch the action inside and out. The space can fit 719 guests.

Club General Manager Hunter Beaty is a veteran of the Las Vegas nightlife industry who said the focus is making the facility live up to the standards of the popular XS and Encore Beach Club locations under the Wynn Nightlife umbrella.

“Everything as far as before and after the game is what we do but obviously when the football game is going on the centerpiece of the stadium is the football game” Beaty said.

“We want to make sure that our guests get a chance to see the game but we want to offer them something that might be a little bit before or after. This is something not seen anywhere else in the country. Other places have nightclubs in their venues but they’re often up in the rafters. They’re not the length of the end zone at field level.”

Club experience

The club has a dedicated entrance on the east side of the stadium allowing patrons to skip the madness at the main gates. Wynn also offers customers who have table reservations at the club transportation between the stadium and the casino.

Fans in the club have routinely become part of the action when the Raiders score a touchdown in the end zone most notably in Week 1 when Derek Carr connected with Zay Jones for the winning touchdown on “Monday Night Football.”

Multiple Raiders were mobbed by fans as they leaped onto the wall bordering the club with the rest of the team running over to join in the celebration.

“The first game of the season couldn’t have worked out any better for us” Beaty said. “The game-winning touchdown scored by Zay Jones then he literally runs across the entire venue with our fans within inches of him. … We’ve had a lot of that and it’s been really exciting.”

Patrons can gain access to the club either by purchasing general admission access or by making table reservations.

Prices for both vary with NFL games this season ranging from $500 to $750 depending on the game. That gets the customer into the stadium and the Wynn Field Club and access to the standing room-only spaces that offer some of the best views of the game.

Then there are the more costly table reservations that come with a minimum spend by those who choose the elevated experience.

The minimum varies by event and table location with tables able to host from 10 to 15 people. For the Garth Brooks concert in July Wynn Field Club listed minimum purchases for tables as between $2000 and $15000 before fees and gratuity. The price for the $15000 minimum-spend table in the front row jumped to $20578 when a venue fee gratuity and sales tax were added in.

“For concerts it might be a little bit lower. For Raider games it’s obviously our peak business but it really just depends on the event” Beaty said.

Dining options

Clubbers also have an array of food options available to them ranging from the game day menu that features almost two dozen items including Charlie’s Famous Pretzel ($19) chicken tenders ($22) and Baja blackened shrimp tacos ($26).

Then there’s the table service menu that must be ordered five days in advance of an event. That premium menu includes offerings such as a tiered shellfish tower that serves four people ($260) and Black Gold a 250-gram serving of Kolikoff golden osetra caviar ($1500) that serves from six to eight people.

“Part of this deal was we wanted to be as Wynn as possible so the Wynn culinary team from the hotel takes care of all the food and beverage inside the venue” Beaty said.

Mixing of fans

During the Dec. 5 game against Washington fans in the club could be heard boasting about having “the best seats in the house.” One clubgoer rooting for Washington suggested that all Raiders games be converted to home games so every fan base could experience the club and the stadium.

No matter who the customer is cheering for during the game the bottom line is they have been taking to the unique stadium space with enthusiasm.

“The biggest takeaway we have so far is that people love to be in the space from start to finish” Beaty said. “If you come at halftime we have a line out the door and we tend to hit capacity at every single game.”

Star power

Various celebrities have joined in the action in the club including former Raider Darren McFadden rapper Lil Jon former NFL star Chad Ochocinco Chumlee of “Pawn Stars” fame and UFC fighters like Jose Aldo and Alexander Volkanovski.

Superstar DJs like Marshmello and Diplo also routinely make appearances with Diplo playing an hour set at the after party of the Dec. 5 game.

“It’s a cool environment after the game” Beaty said. “You’re either celebrating or you’re drinking your sorrows away from your team losing. Either way we have fans from both teams hanging around after the game enjoying the music.”

Any fan with a ticket to the game can attend the after party provided the club hasn’t reached its capacity.

Raiders President Dan Ventrelle said the club “brings a truly unique Las Vegas atmosphere to Allegiant Stadium. As leaders in developing nightclub experiences Wynn helped us bring luxury and impeccable service to the space with proximity to the field that makes it an incredible environment for fans.”

Amber Naqvi a grateful immigrant IT professional and solar-software firm owner this fall had solar systems installed at Liberty's two campuses at 2100 Emerson Av. N. and 3700 Bryant Av. N.

""It's quite a Christmas present"" said the Rev. Alika Galloway who added that the solar array fits Liberty's mission as a seven-day-a-week center for spiritual and physical healing health and wellness technology community gardening and youth programs.

Eventually the two Liberty Church complexes will be able to pay their $8400 combined electric bill pretty much thanks to solar power that they will sell to Xcel Energy. The array will generate up to 120% of their energy needs and yield extra revenue during sunny months.

Congregation members and neighbors noticed Black technicians and trainees from Bloomington's Go Solar installing the solar arrays this fall.

Naqvi invested $450000 in the solar installations for the Liberty churches another church a couple of nonprofits and a small business in the diverse low-income Minneapolis areas hit hard by the 2020 riots that followed the police killing of George Floyd.

Liberty Community Church at 2100 Emerson Av. N. is one of six Minneapolis establishments whose electric bill will be covered by solar energy thanks to a partnership with Lake Street Solar’s Amber Naqvi.

""My wife and I created a company Lake Street Solar to help enable some places that may not have the funding to do solar on their own"" Naqvi said. ""We decided to do the projects through Minnesota Interfaith Power and Light and we want to be part of the rebuilding in Minneapolis.""

Jeremy Kalin a Minneapolis attorney and veteran solar finance expert structured the transaction for Naqvi. The installations are at Liberty's two locations; Thee House UV Beth-El Church; Lundstrum Center for the Performing Arts Centro De Trabajadores Unidos En La Lucha (CTUL) and Woodland Stoves.

The transaction calls for the beneficiaries to pay back Naqvi's Lake Street Solar created for this and future community partnerships less than half the installed cost of the systems.

They will not pay anything upfront and will only pay Lake Street Solar for what the solar panels produce and at a 5% discount from what the church would normally pay to Xcel Energy for the same power.

Naqvi as the owner will claim related federal tax credits for up to 26% of the projects' cost. In seven years Naqvi will sell each system for $1 to Liberty Church and the other recipients. The beneficiaries essentially get free electricity for the lives of the solar systems.

""We are grateful for this gift and meaningful investment in our community"" said the Rev. Ralph Galloway Alika Galloway's husband and also a Liberty pastor. ""As people of color of African descent ... our cultural practices celebrate and activate sustainable practices.""

Naqvi and Kalin brought in Minnesota Interfaith Power and Light (MNIPL) which works for racial and environmental justice. MNIPL already had relationships with the Galloways and a few other solar projects on the North Side including nearby Shiloh Temple and neighboring Masjid An-Nur Mosque in 2018.

""That paved the way for people to get excited about solar as part of the North Minneapolis landscape and helped promote energy democracy at the policy or systemic level"" said MNIPL Executive Director Julia Nerbonne.

Naqvi 53 is a Pakistani immigrant who graduated from Minnesota State University Moorhead and worked in IT for the former Anderson Consulting and IBM before starting a consulting business with partners. He sold his shares last year to focus on solar.

Naqvi also is the founder of a solar-software firm in Eagan called Solar Informatics. In just a year of operation it has a roster of more than 400 customers.

""We are building a construction-management software that I think will be better than what's in the market today"" Naqvi said. ""We're only 30% to 40% done with our product roadmap. We've created automation and processes that once were manual.""

He's the sole investor in the company which now has 20 employees. He aims to double its revenue in 2022 and generate positive cash flow.

Naqvi a soft-spoken technologist also wants to see solar spread to lower-income neighborhoods and employ minority workers. There will be more projects.

Solar power which generates less than 2% of Minnesota's electricity is expected to reach 10% by 2030 according to the Minnesota Solar Energy Industry Association. Minnesota's overall renewable energy industry tops 60000 workers in solar wind conservation software and other areas.

""I owe a lot to Minnesota and we all benefit from the great program that allows international students such as me pay in-state tuition at Minnesota State universities"" said Naqvi who also has taught at Metropolitan State University and volunteered on economic-development initiatives.

""We want to expand solar in places where there is a lack of solar investment"" he said. ""The individuals who take advantage of tax credits tend to be corporations and people with deep pockets. We wanted to work with organizations that don't have the cash. And MNIPL already was doing this work.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyYWluZXJkZGlzcGF0Y2guY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9ob2NrZXktdHdvLWJyYWluZXJkLWJyb3RoZXJzLXNoYXJlLWljZS1hcy1vZmZpY2lhbHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hockey: Two Brainerd brothers share ice as officials,"Whatever sibling rivalry Morgan and Bronson Shepherd have they don’t show it come game time.

Morgan 36 and Bronson 32 are both hockey officials from the lakes area and a part of the Central Lakes Hockey Referee Association. They also referee college games in the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.

“It’s very helpful” Morgan said of working with his brother. “I’d say being the older brother we’ve had our battles on the ice but I think we both know each other and want to do a good job. I think we both understand how each other sees a game and it clicks.”

There are two different types of officials in hockey. The referee wears orange sleeves and calls penalties and does line changes. The linesman doesn’t wear orange and calls offsides initiates face-offs and icing but doesn’t call penalties.

On Dec. 9 the two brothers worked together at Essentia Health Sports Center when the Brainerd Warriors hosted the Northern Lakes Lightning in boys hockey. Morgan was the referee and Bronson was the linesman.

“It’s an absolute blast” Bronson said of working with his brother. “He’s kind of the main reason I got into reffing. He’s a huge mentor to me and how I’ve grown as an official. We give each other feedback and I think we see the game in a similar way so it makes things go pretty well and it’s fun to travel with him.”

Morgan was a 2004 Brainerd High School graduate who played on the hockey team and Bronson was a 2008 Brainerd graduate who also played hockey.

Morgan got started officiating after his playing days were over in 2012.

“I just wanted to stay involved in the game” Morgan said. “I’d been playing hockey since I was four or five years old. Played high school junior and college hockey and when I got done I didn’t like mentally playing still after college and wanted to stay in the game.”

Morgan now serves on the board of the Central Lakes Hockey Referee Association.

Bronson started officiating when he lived in the Twin Cities. When he moved back to the lakes area last year he joined the Central Lakes Hockey Referee Association which just started and the two brothers started doing games together.

“I played hockey at Brainerd and at Concordia-Moorhead and (refereeing) was a way to get back into the game” Bronson said. “My brother Morgan was officiating and he kind of pushed me to do it and it’s been fun. I started doing squirts and now I’m doing college so it’s been a fun ride.”

Both Morgan and Bronson have found working games together has made their relationship stronger.

“Spending time with my brother in the car on the way to games and just talking about the game and just being together really” Morgan said. “If we didn’t ref we probably wouldn’t spend that much time together so it’s good to be a part of the game and work with my brother.”

Bronson added: “We talk on the phone like if we don’t do a game together he’s the first person I call when I get into the car. When he typically doesn’t have a game he’ll watch my game and if I don’t have a game I typically watch his game. We talk hockey a ton and that shows how much we care and how good of a job we want to do. Our relationship has really grown and it’s fun to share a hobby with your brother.”

Morgan said he typically refs two to three high school games a week and four to 10 youth hockey games a week. Typically Bronson and Morgan are paired up for two games a week.

For their day jobs Morgan works at Bernick’s and Bronson works at Takedown Gym.

Morgan has refereed two state tournaments in his nine years officiating — one girls and one boys. He also worked the U15 National Tournament in Dallas last year for USA hockey.

“You go to all these small rinks and do these big games at small rinks but you get in front of the Xcel Energy Center and one of the games I had was 19000 fans for a state semifinal game. It was pretty cool” Morgan said.

Bronson has officiated section finals but hopes to get to the state tournament this year.

Both Bronson and Morgan said they’ve heard their fair share of hecklers from parents and fans. The key is blocking it out of their mind during a game.

“That’s part of the game and part of growing and mentoring officials” Morgan said. “It’s not for everyone and the biggest thing is blocking that out. Sometimes you can’t block it and things need to be done but there are a lot of crazies out there.”

Bronson added: “That’s why I think officiating is tough on the younger officials and it’s tough to retain officials and grow areas to actually have games going on. I’ve heard a lot and it is one of those things that as you grow up as an official you tune those things out.”

Morgan serves on the board of the Central Lakes Hockey Referee Association and loves seeing younger referees involved.

“It’s rewarding to work with younger officials and see them grow” Morgan said. “Their confidence level when they go on the ice from calling their first penalty to calling their 100th penalty. And just seeing the confidence build.”

...

In only the past week the NHL announced that its players would not participate in the Olympics the United States-Canada women's hockey exhibition game at Xcel Energy Center was canceled and Wolves forward Karl-Anthony Towns and Vikings running back Dalvin Cook were ruled out for their upcoming games.

These are all COVID-related decisions that have affected the local sports scene. The surging omicron variant is cutting a swath through the sports world.

But what's interesting — or perplexing or troubling — is how professional sports leagues are now all over the spectrum of virus management with their health and safety protocols. Times have changed since March 2020 when sports leagues were unified with safety measures at the outset of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Here's a brief rundown of how some leagues are handling the pandemic:

Football: Infected? Vaccinated? No problem. Suit up.

Basketball: We're not shutting down! Sign replacement players! Who cares if Joe Johnson is 40 years old? Lace 'em up.

English Premier League soccer teams: This is madness! We need to shut down the league in the name of safety. The league: No.

Hockey: Pause the season! Go home for Christmas. Don't get infected Wild and Blues players we need the Winter Classic to go on!

Who's right? Who's wrong? Who's walking a fine line between what's practical and what's plausible? One would think that sports leagues would compare notes or commissioner-source some ideas on how to proceed safely even if each sport has its own particular set of challenges.

The NHL has postponed 64 games after outbreaks among various teams — which reflects an abundance of caution. The NBA and Premier League have postponed games as well but each league appears determined to navigate through the blizzard of infections. The NBA is looking to reduce the number of days an infected player has to quarantine a reasonable approach based on data.

The NFL has determined that if a player's viral load is at a certain level he's infected but not contagious and can play. Also vaccinated players don't have to be tested unless they (wink wink) self-report symptoms.

If you or I get sick we're asked to isolate for 10 days.

Once again the NFL is brandishing its shield and stopping at nothing to ensure its multi-billion-dollar machine operates at full throttle. Meanwhile Texas A&M and Hawaii pulled out of bowl games because of positive tests transfers and other developments.

Sports' place in society is unquestioned. We all want to watch and opine about the games. But the games should be played with health and safety a priority as we ride out the pandemic. Not all leagues appear to be doing so.

Big Ten test ahead

After the New Year we'll find out exactly what the Gophers men's basketball team is made of when it runs into the Big Ten portion of the schedule.

But you have to like what you have seen so far.

After last year's team took way too many three-pointers — making just 28.4% of them — this group is sinking 36.5% from behind the arc.

Despite the new faces this team takes care of the ball — except for the 28-turnover outbreak against Texas A&M-Corpus Christi.

The Gophers play pretty good defense and have been tough on the perimeter holding opponents to 24.8% shooting on three-pointers.

Are these sustainable traits or numbers that will wither in the pressure cooker that is Big Ten basketball? Will a lack of size catch up with them? That remains to be seen. But these Gophers make you want to tune in to see where this goes.

Twins' Followell exits satisfied

Vern Followell was hired as an area scout by then-Twins scouting director Larry Corrigan before the 1989 season. Two seasons later he was part of a World Series-winning organization. Followell thought he was at the right place at the right time — he just wished there had been a couple more trophies along the way.

Back in the days of the 3½-inch floppy disks Followell helped develop a system into which scouts could feed their reports a precursor to modern databases. He eventually moved into pro scouting and was widely respected throughout the league.

Now Followell 64 is retiring after spending his entire career with the Twins.

""I feel lucky about that"" Followell said. ""We had some great times and fought through some things. I probably will miss the guys talking about it arguing about it. [But] it's a good time for me to go.""

... AND TWO PREDICTIONS ...

Cook's absence too much

The Vikings already faced a daunting task on Sunday in trying to stop Cooper Kupp Aaron Donald and the Rams. With Dalvin Cook out it makes it even tougher. Rams win 30-20.

They'll be great outdoors

A Wild team excited to play an outdoors hockey game at Target Field will dominate the Winter Classic from start to finish and down St. Louis 5-2 to start the new year on a winning note.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9qYWNrLWphYmxvbnNraS1wYXJhbHl6aW5nLWhvY2tleS1pbmp1cnktbWlubmVzb3RhLWxvcy1hbmdlbGVzLWtpbmdzLTEwLXllYXJzLWFnby82MDAxMzAyOTMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 years after a paralyzing hockey injury Jack Jablonski is calling own shots in California,"Jack Jablonski exudes confidence in front of the camera an almost giddy smile on his face as he introduces the latest guest on his online hockey show: former NHL pro Paul Bissonnette who now works as a TV analyst.

""Welcome back to another episode of 'Tradin' Jabs' "" Jablonski says smoothly opening the show from Southern California where he interviews everyone from current players to new prospects in his job for the Los Angeles Kings. Then he talks as if Bissonnette is an old friend: ""Biz how ya doin'?""

With the camera focused tightly on Jablonski's face viewers can't see that he's sitting in a wheelchair paralyzed from the chest down and needing help with small tasks such as inserting the ear buds he wears during the show.

This was not how Jablonski dreamed of joining the pros as a boy skating in rinks all over the Twin Cities. But now 10 years after he suffered a broken spine in a Minnesota high school hockey tournament he has forged a different path into the NHL. He relishes his new role as an insider in the sport that both shattered him and helped him build a new life.

""I think if you would have asked me ... where could you see yourself in 10 years as I was in the hospital ... I couldn't have asked for a better possible situation than I am in right now"" he said in an interview acknowledging the large cast of supporters helping him along the way.

Of course Jablonski would give anything to take back that moment on Dec. 30 2011 when a body check sent him crashing head-first into the boards. But now at 26 he has learned to make the most of the things he can control.

Jablonski works full time helped coach youth hockey and speaks out as an advocate and fundraiser for paralysis research through a foundation bearing his name. He keeps his muscles strong with regular physical therapy and he has been enrolled in a clinical study with hopes of getting some movement back in his fingers so he can gain more independence.

""Work life is great. Social life is good"" Jablonski said. ""I'm just happy to be able to be a functioning adult that can contribute to society and can contribute to an NHL organization.""

Orchestrating his days

For nearly every home game Jablonski uses a joystick-like control on his motorized wheelchair to roll into the Staples Center — newly renamed Crypto.com Arena — ready to analyze the game he loves.

From up in the press box he hunches his shoulder to move his arm and wrist quickly typing laptop keys with his pinky knuckle updating the Kings' website with game highlights.

After the final buzzer sounds Jablonski wheels into an elevator and down into the bowels of the arena where he joins a scrum of reporters in the locker room to ask questions for post-game interviews. Later he writes a game recap for the website.

With an official title of associate digital media content specialist Jablonski has been working a hybrid schedule for the Kings during the pandemic — some days at home and others in the team's El Segundo offices. He researches players and prospects records video interviews and writes feature stories for the team's website on his iPhone.

Jablonski and a full-time caregiver moved into a small accessible apartment in Hermosa Beach — not far from team headquarters — shortly after he graduated from the University of Southern California.

He has learned to schedule his days carefully in advance knowing his injury makes last-minute changes complicated. The caregiver helps him get out of bed get dressed and eat. There are medications and other extra needs that require attention every day. And he has to figure out who can drive his specially equipped van if his caregiver is busy.

Besides navigating bills and insurance and everything else that comes with adulthood Jablonski mixes in three physical therapy sessions each week. Sometimes therapists move his legs while he stands harnessed atop a treadmill; other times they stretch and work his arms all with the goal of keeping his muscles strong.

Like everyone else he has also learned to navigate outside problems that the world throws at him.

The COVID-19 pandemic hit just after he moved away from his network of college friends. During lockdown he frequently sat in a patch of sun in his 12-unit apartment building's small courtyard where he pushed himself to greet his neighbors. He knew from college that strangers can be uncomfortable around his wheelchair so he was deliberate about getting to know people. His neighbors became a new circle of friends.

""When people see who Jack is then he becomes more confident"" said his mom Leslie Jablonski.

And while the warm California air is good for Jablonski's body which doesn't easily regulate temperature it was difficult for him to live halfway across the country when his mom faced a difficult health scare of her own; cancer spread rapidly from her eyelid into her eye socket in 2020.

Jablonski called his mom frequently trying to give her the encouragement that she gave him during so many dark days 10 years ago. Channel your energy away from worrying he told her. Focus on treatments and healing.

She's OK now and the whole family is grateful.

""Having been through hell and back personally I felt like I was able to kind of help my mom keep a positive mindset"" he said.

Now he wants to lend support to other paralysis patients everywhere.

Emerging voice

Jack's voice boomed over a crowd of supporters at his foundation's annual gala in fall 2019 — his first as the evening's main speaker.

""You've heard a lot about me over the last eight years but so far you haven't heard a lot from me"" he said as part of a recorded introduction. ""I feel it's time.""

""That's when I noticed that things changed"" said Robert Dollarhide the foundation board's vice president and a longtime family friend.

Up until then Jablonski had gone to fundraisers and other public events but he was shy about the attention. Thrust into the spotlight after his injury he was grateful for an outpouring of support that sustained him but he sometimes felt compelled to stay upbeat despite bouts of depression. High school sports teams held events in his honor. Professional sports figures visited his hospital room. His story was a frequent feature on social media and local news.

Family friends formed what is now the Jack Jablonski Foundation less than a year after his injury to raise money for research. While he used to defer to the adults around him board members said he now gives his opinion on fundraising strategies and asks questions about studies wanting to make sure money goes to the most-promising research.

Foundation board member Dr. Anne Moore who served as the doctor for Jablonski's high school team said she has seen him become more introspective.

While he still hopes to walk one day he now can ""appreciate smaller goals along the way and still strive for those big ones"" Moore said. ""I think he is much more comfortable in his skin. He's done a lot of soul searching.""

Jablonski says he sees that he can do a lot of good by using his public platform.

""Having a voice that so many people with paralysis don't is such a fortunate opportunity"" he said. ""I've matured and grown up and I've kind of realized that a little bit more.""

So at the 2019 gala he took the stage to advocate and explain research the foundation was helping to fund: putting electrodes on the skin at the spine to stimulate the upper body and gain back some movement.

""I cannot use my hands to open a door. I cannot use a cup. Can't use a fork"" he told the crowd sitting at round dinner tables at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul. ""I need to get my hands working again and so do hundreds of thousands of other people living with quadriplegia just like me.""

The first of a two-part study saw various quadriplegic people drink water out of a cup turn keys or put a card into a cash machine. Jablonski has been accepted into the study too. He'll be in the second phase which he hopes to begin in January.

""If you were to ask anyone with quadriplegia ... the first thing that they'll ask and want back is independence and hands — hand function"" Jablonski said recently. ""And that's the answer for me too.""

Meanwhile Jablonski said he'll keep doing what he can to move forward.

Someday he might want to became part of a team's hockey operations he said describing how it would be fun to help place players and figure out roster moves. But his injury has taught him not to live ""too far into the future"" he said. He knows all too acutely that things can change in an instant.

""You never know what's going to happen. ... I think it's a matter of focusing on now and making sure that I'm staying healthy and I'm being active and I'm in a good place mentally"" he said. ""You just have to focus on what you can control.""",,,
