Current position: Principal scientist Gfree Bio

Education: BS chemistry and French University of Southern Mississippi; PhD theoretical organic chemistry University of Texas at Austin

Holloway on her accomplishments: “Because of my design role I was included on the patent for the HIV protease inhibitor indinavir and gained some notoriety as the lone woman among five chemistry co-inventors. At that time women were not well represented in the physical sciences. Fortunately that is changing. The number of women in computational chemistry has risen steadily during the course of my career. As ‘a rising tide lifts all boats’ a rising tide of women scientists is having a significant impact.”

What Holloway’s colleagues say: “Kate has had a remarkable career at Merck and in the field of computational chemistry. Her contributions to the field of computational chemistry and drug discovery as well as marketed drugs are second to none in the industry. Many of us enter the pharmaceutical industry to have an impact on human health; Kate has had an impact on four marketed drugs—a standout accomplishment among computational chemists. Her work on Crixivan at the peak of the AIDS outbreak was critical for the survival of many individuals. Kate’s contributions to the HCV protease field are manifest in Vanihep and Grazoprevir which have helped move HCV into the curable category of diseases. Kate’s early studies as a part of the HIV integrase team laid the foundations for Isentress.”—J. Chris Culberson Workflow Informatics

He did not win a nickel at the Memorial in July his first tournament after winning the Travelers Championship. DJ did not win a dime at the 3M Open the event after the Memorial.

He won 2438536040 pennies across his other tournaments. (Over 2 billion!)

Or 487707208 nickels.

Or 243853604 dimes.

Or 24385360 singles — and 40 cents.

Johnson in 18 tournaments last year earned $24385360.40. GolfTV recently broke down his PGA Tour earnings — $23954307 in 17 events — to show what he made per round hole and stroke. We’ve included his lone European Tour start to those stats the Saudi International in late January and early February along with a few other numbers.

In 2020 as first calculated by GolfTV Johnson made $392694 over his 61 Tour rounds. And $21816 over his 1098 holes. And $5703 over his 4200 strokes. (Such an even number!) When you include his four rounds at the Saudi International where he finished second and won $431053.45 (when converted from Euros) DJ made $375159.39 over his 65 rounds $20842.19 over his 1170 holes and $5455.34 over his 4470 strokes.

Of course those numbers go up if you take out the Charles Schwab and the Memorial where Johnson missed the cut and the 3M where he withdrew after the first round. Over the 15 total events where Johnson cashed he made $406422.67 over 60 rounds. And $22579.04 over 1080 holes. And $5962.19 over 4090 strokes.

DJ also made $88352.76 for his 276 birdies. And $1283449.02 for his 19 eagles. Across his 17 PGA Tour events (and using his $23954307 total) DJ made $46969.23 for his 510 fairways hit (out of a possible 853). And $31109.49 for his 770 greens hit. (The stats for these categories from the Saudi International were not readily available.)

He’s not done making money either. In 2021 Johnson plans to pocket more pennies. And nickels. And dimes.

“Yeah I feel like I’m not going to dial anything back” Johnson said after his win at the Masters his final tournament of 2020. “ I feel really good about everything that I’m doing. I feel really confident in the golf game. You know I want to — my goal is to play for about I don’t know keeps getting shorter but eight nine maybe 10 years.

“So until then I’m going to work my butt off to be as good as I can.”

THE HAGUE--The Dutch government is providing a US $3 million mortgage loan with a market-based interest rate to Windward Islands Airways (Winair) to safeguard the connectivity between the Caribbean parts of the Kingdom.

Dutch Minister of Infrastructure and Water Management Cora van Nieuwenhuizen announced the loan on Thursday December 31 in a letter to the Second Chamber of the Dutch Parliament. She also did so on behalf of State Secretary of Home Affairs and Kingdom Relations Raymond Knops who will be visiting St. Maarten next week.

Minister Van Nieuwenhuizen State Secretary Knops and State Secretary of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy Mona Keizer decided positively on the request of St. Maarten Prime Minister Silveria Jacobs to secure a US $3 million (2.7 million euro) mortgage loan for Winair. The Dutch government has a minority share in the airline of 7.95 per cent. The other 92.05 per cent is owned by the Country St. Maarten.

The Winair building at the airport will serve as collateral for the loan which is partly financed by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Kingdom Relations BZK (1 million euro) and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management IenW (1.7 million euro). Prior to approving the loan the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy EZK carried out an assessment.

“The issuing of this loan is based on the necessity of maintaining the air connectivity with the Caribbean Netherlands islands. The support is provided in the form of a mortgage loan with a repayment term of 18 months which can be extended to a maximum of 6 years with mutual approval” Van Nieuwenhuizen stated in her letter.

Risk mitigating measures are not necessary because it concerns a mortgage loan with collateral. The loan can be repaid at any time and contains a number of “hard conditions” where it concerns connectivity between the islands and the payment of bonuses and dividend stated the minister.

“The most important condition is that Winair during the duration of the loan must maintain the air connectivity between St. Maarten St. Eustatius and Saba with at least two flights per day as soon as the COVID-19 travel restrictions have been lifted” stated Van Nieuwenhuizen.

Winair may also not pay bonuses to its management and board and not distribute dividend to its shareholders as long as the loan has not been repaid. The mortgage loan which involves a market-based interest rate of 4.41 per cent per year places all immovables belonging to Winair under the so-called first mortgage right.

According to Minister Van Nieuwenhuizen the financial aid for Winair is essential. The COVID-19 pandemic is deeply affecting Winair’s operations as a result of sharply diminished flight frequency between the three Windward Islands and also between St. Maarten and Aruba Bonaire and Curaçao.

The air connections between the islands are in jeopardy the minister noted. “Winair the only airline that maintains connections with all six Caribbean parts of the Kingdom and the only airline that keeps a regular frequency with St. Eustatius and Saba has run into financial problems because there are barely any revenues while the expenditures continue.”

A situation has evolved whereby the insular connectivity of St. Eustatius and Saba with St. Maarten and Bonaire is in direct jeopardy stated Van Nieuwenhuizen. For this reason Prime Minister Jacobs had asked financial support from State Secretary Knops in order to maintain a regular air connection between the three Windward Islands.

“The vital importance of connectivity in St. Maarten St. Eustatius and Saba is a given. Residents of the Caribbean parts of the Kingdom must be able to travel to and from their island. And even though the current pandemic asks people to limit their travels there are many reasons why travelling is necessary” stated Van Nieuwenhuizen who mentioned medical travel transport of students or other essential travel.

Maintaining the air connections is also important in light of the transport of goods mail and the COVID-19 vaccines. After the coronavirus pandemic the inter-island air connections will be important as well for the unrestricted transport of residents and tourists. Islands that are easily reached by air contribute to a speedy revival of tourism and as such to the local economy.

The issuing of this mortgage loan to Winair shows that the connectivity between the islands remains fragile the minister pointed out. The development for the middle-long term strongly depends on the progress of combating the COVID-19 pandemic. This matter is being discussed between the Dutch government the St. Maarten government and Winair.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vYmVlYm9tLmNvbS9iZXN0LXNraW5zLXdyYXBzLWlwaG9uZS0xMi1wcm8v0gE2aHR0cHM6Ly9iZWVib20uY29tL2Jlc3Qtc2tpbnMtd3JhcHMtaXBob25lLTEyLXByby9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Best Skins and Wraps for iPhone 12 Pro You Can Buy,"The soft-textured finish coupled with the unmatched elegance that comes with skins is here to stay. While skins may not offer the full-on protection from drops like protective bumper cases or the shock-absorbing wooden covers or the vintage leather suits nothing can beat their ultra-sleek design that hardly adds any bulk (or should I say zero bulk) to the smartphone. And when you add the luxury to design your own skins using a variety of textures they make a strong case. If you prefer skins over cases here are the 10 best skins and wraps for iPhone 12 Pro you can buy in 2021.

Best iPhone 12 Pro Skins and Wraps to Buy

When it comes to skins I prefer to have a wide variety of textures so that I can get full freedom to mix and match. And guess what accessory makers have left no stone unturned to live up to specific taste. From leather to stone to wooden to marble you have plenty of textures to choose from. On top of all you can also get the skin for the triple-camera frame and even the MagSafe charger should you wish to go for full-on customization.

1. Slick Wraps Marble Series

If you have set your sight on the premium iPhone 12 skins Slick Wraps Marble Series is for you. Made of top-grade 3M vinyl the skin features a marble pattern that gives it a stunning look. Due mainly to the textured finish the wrap feels comfy to the touch while also offering a better grip. The company claims that the skin offers bubble-free installation and goo-free removal.

On the protection front Slick Wraps Marble Series can live up to the expectation. Though the wrap can’t deliver much when it comes to enduring impact it can fight out scuffs with ease. Despite being priced comparatively at the higher-end the Marble Series seems worth a serious look.

Buy from Slick Wraps: $24.12

2. dbrand Signature Skin

dbrand Signature skins have always been top-notch. So there is no question of missing out on them.

As it battles a revenue shortfall of Shs250b Uganda Revenue Authority enforcement (URA) team says it has uncovered a group of people who are forging documents in order to evade taxes.

The authority cites an importer who submitted invoices to of 32 motorcycles with each valued at $380 (Shs1.3m) through a clearing agent Jinca Enterprises.

However the invoices were found to be falsified. The actual value of each motorcycle according to URA is $2500 (Shs8.3m). The import value was under-declared by Shs7m.

“Over the last few months we have found out that a lot of document forgery was going on” Ms Agnes Nabwire the assistant commissioner in charge of Enforcement at URA told reporters on Monday.

“What we found after investigations carried out on Thursday last week included stamps of foreign companies registered in China. These stamps were used on documents to alter valuations of imported goods” she added.

At least six stamps of Chinese companies were found with one clearing agent Jinca Enterprises.

Ms Nabwire said documents being forged included shipping details the bill of lading invoices bank slips and receipts. The documents help companies under declare their goods hence resulting in less or no tax payments.

URA reveals that one of the clearing agents imported motorcycle spare parts valued at $97000 (Shs323m) but that invoice was never declared meaning no tax payment was made.

The documents URA has found indicate that forgeries were being made in Uganda yet the origin of the goods was in countries such as China.

However the tax body says it cannot exactly quantify the revenue shortfall caused by the document forgeries.

“We are analysing and investigating to ascertain the actual amount lost in this trade. However we are strengthening our intelligence in order to recover this money considering the challenges in the market” Ms Nabwire said.

Companies found to have taken advantage of document forgeries could end up paying more tax than they paid as URA investigates how entrenched the problem has been over the years.

Clearing agents are licensed by URA and if any is found to have breached the conditions then they could be deregistered.

No one was injured but video shows the huge chunk crashing down near people.

SAN DIEGO — Fears have been growing after chilling video of a bluff collapse in Torrey Pines on New Year's Eve left many scared. Cell phone video shows the start of the cliff coming down before beachgoers started to scream and run.



“In the back of my mind it is always there you never can tell when one of those things is going to collapse and fall basically it's gravity and gravity never quits” said Dr. Pat Abbott Geologist.



Geologist Dr. Pat Abbott spoke of what to look out for when out at the cliffs. He says there's always a loud sound right before a huge chunk drops and it sometimes sounds like the pop of a gunshot.



""It usually has a noise to it a crack to let you know the rock is there it's been solid and has cracked or snapped and broken loose and if you hear that noise head for the water or look up.""

And we know it's definitely not the first time San Diegans have seen a dangerous bluff collapse. There have been numerous incidents in Encinitas Carlsbad Solana Beach Del Mar and La Jolla over the years.



The deadly Encinitas bluff collapse in August 2019 took the lives of three women of one family at Grandview Beach when a roughly 30-foot-wide chunk of the cliff dropped down. Dr. Abbott says bluff collapses are more common in very rainy years so to have a cliff falling now is happening an unlikely time.



“Here is a time where we haven't had much rain. The weather is warm it is one of the times where you would least expect something to go but again gravity never stops” Dr. Abbott said.



Just one day before this Torrey Pines collapse a picture shows a group of people standing in that very spot taking a picture by the ""Danger"" sign that warns against falling rocks. Still crowds came to Torrey Pines Saturday enjoying a hike at the beach. One family from Chula Vista was worried.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVsY24uY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZXMvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC90aGUtc29uZy1yZXR1cm5zLWJhdGF2aWEtbmF0aXZlLXNoYXJlcy10aGUtc3Rvcmllcy1iZWhpbmQtdGhlLWhpdHMvYXJ0aWNsZV9iZjY4ODMxNy0xMGIyLTUxYmYtOWZkYS03OWE1MWY3Mzk0NGYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The Song' returns: Batavia native shares the stories behind the hits,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

This year however things are far from normal and many parts of the park are closed to the public due to the Woodward Fire COVID-19 and road construction.

Since Point Reyes National Seashore is a favorite destination for many families we've put together a guide to what is and isn't currently open to the public in the park. This information is correct as of the date of publishing (January 2 2021) but things can change without notice so make sure you check the park's website at www.nps.gov/pore for updates before you go.

What's Currently Closed in Point Reyes National Seashore

The following areas are currently closed. Check the Point Reyes National Seashore website for more information and road closure maps. Additionally there are ongoing road construction projects in the park so expect delays in some areas.

Due to construction Sir Francis Drake Boulevard west of the Drakes Beach turnoff is closed to all traffic — vehicle bicycle and pedestrian — until further notice. This means attractions like the Point Reyes Lighthouse and Chimney Rock and South Beach are inaccessible.

All visitor centers and bookstores including the Bear Valley Visitor Center the Kenneth C. Patrick Visitor Center at Drakes Beach and the Point Reyes Lighthouse Visitor Center are closed due to COVID-19.

The area west of Highway 1 and Bear Valley Road south of Limantour Road and north of Steward Trail/Five Brooks is closed to visitors. This includes the Bear Valley Trail Kule Loklo and the Morgan Horse Ranch.

The Bull Point Trailhead parking lot is closed.

Campgrounds are closed and all camping is prohibited.

Beach fires are prohibited and no permits are currently being issued. Charcoal fires at picnic areas are also prohibited.

All ranger- and volunteer-led activites and events are on hold.

What's Currently Open in Point Reyes National Seashore

Fortunately many parts of the park are currently open to the public during the current stay-at-home order so the park is still a worthwhile day trip destination for family outdoor recreation."

Please do not export render or “bake in” the on-screen error messages render warnings and software watermarks that often happen during the course of an edit. I understand the reasoning why these are necessary and believe in the importance of telling the editor when something has gone wrong but leaving these intact during an export is a recipe for disaster as these often end up in the final output which inevitably make it to air.

What brings this to mind? On New Year’s Day I was watching the Kiss 2020 Goodbye concert by the rock band Kiss with my kids. It was a live concert event in Dubai and before the show started there was nearly an hour of preshow with some short documentaries around this mammoth show. At about 11 minutes and 17 seconds into the broadcast I see it: the tell-tale blue banner from the Adobe Premiere Pro Warp Stablizer with its ominous warning: Frame not analyzed for stabliziaion click Analyze.

It was quite a long shot and I was surprised that it made it to broadcast. And it didn’t get removed for the inevitable pre-show YouTube upload either so I got the screen-grab above! You can watch it yourself and try to catch this one and another one or two later in the pre-show.

If you think there needs to be a bit more warning so this doesn’t happen so easily then please vote in my Adobe User Voice Present an error message before output when a Warp Stabilizer watermark is on a clip idea so maybe we can get that at some point in the future.

If you try and export a Warp Stabilizer clip while Warp Stabilizer frames are in the process of being analyed you’ll get this error message:

But once the analysis is complete and you were to trim the clip where new frames haven’t been analyzed you’ll get the blue warning bar in the render. But further complicating this for Premiere is it seems like there is a warning both for an In Progress Warp Stabilizer on export as well as one that is Not Started. It almost feels like a bug within Premiere that you don’t get that warning with Status: Need Analyzing when you’ve trimmed a Warp’d clip to make it longer and you have new frames that haven’t been analyzed.

It would be great to get a message like this on output. I really like this idea:

There’s a number of reasons something like this could make it to broadcast. Often times the editor is rushed and changes are demanded up until the very last minute so there is no time to quality check the program before it goes to air. Actually that’s probably the most common reason. It can be embarrassing for the editor and the production company so it’s a good lesson as to why editors need time and people to QC a project before it goes to air. There has been many an editor yelled at for this very mistake when in reality the fault should like with the producers for not allowing adequate time to check the final output. This can become an excruciating exercise when the program is long.

Lest you think I’m being a jerk calling out the Kiss production for their Warp Stablizer mishap I had a similar situation of my own during a Christmas show edit I did in DaVinci Resolve. I had been working on this local broadcast Christmas show at my office where I have Resolve Studio. I had used one of the Studio-only features Patch Replacer to remove an annoying exit sign. Late in the evening I opened the project at home to make an output and send the file to the client. I had an issue at home as Resolve wasn’t seeing my dongle so it didn’t think I had the Studio version installed and generated a big ugly watermark where I had used the Studio-only Patch Replacer filter. I made a workaround and sent the file to the client for final approval.

The next day I got an email back with this screen-grab attached:

Little did I know that the Lens Blur filter I had used was Studio-only so that watermark went out in the final output. I am human and can make a mistake with the best of ’em.

What do I wish would happen in this situation? Ideally I’d like a warning message before a file is generated that there is going to be a watermark present as well as a way to quickly jump to it and fix it. Second to that I would prefer the NLE to render out the unaffected shot. I think that could cause much less damage in the end than a rendered watermark going to broadcast or the web delivery. But honestly the first option would be best.

Of course not everyone will agree with my idea of having the NLE render the original shot when the error message hasn’t been addressed. In a perfect world we would get a preference for this behavior between rendering out the baked-in error message or render out the original shot.

Not every piece of post-production software handles this kind of thing the same way. But every one of them should make some kind of provision for watermarked footage so the watermark doesn’t make its way into an output.

UPDATE 1/3/2021: I posted this article to Twitter this morning and it’s generated some good discussion. Seems to be two camps when it comes to this idea of not baking in the watermarks and error message on export: the I’ve had that happen and agree with this idea vs the editors should always check their work and there is no excuse for this ever.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZnN0b3BwZXJzLmNvbS9lZHVjYXRpb24vYmVnaW5uZXJzLWd1aWRlLXBob3Rvc2hvcC1pcGFkLTU0MTE3N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Beginner's Guide to Photoshop on iPad,"Photoshop on iPad has continued to grow and now offers a lot of the functionality of the desktop version while on the go.

Now that it's officially 2021 support for the software has ended and Adobe will begin blocking content from running in Flash Player beginning on January 12.



Flash's elimination should not heavily impact users because many popular browsers have already moved away from the format. Additionally iPhone and iPad users are not affected by the change as iOS and iPadOS have never supported Flash.

Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs offered his ""Thoughts on Flash"" in a 2010 open letter criticizing Adobe's software for its reliability incompatibility with mobile sites and battery drain on mobile devices. Jobs also said that Adobe was ""painfully slow to adopt enhancements to Apple's platforms"" and further innovation from Apple would not be hindered by a ""cross platform development tool.""

Stiff competition and lack of innovation have taken the sheen off the once-hailed Intel model.

A Bad Year

Currently INTC is one of the worst-performing tech stocks that traded below the $50-mark quite often this year. The recent trend has left analysts skeptical about the stock’s future prospects and the majority of them recommend holding it though the average target price points to a modest uptick. The company has underperformed the industry and lost several billion dollars in market value. On Tuesday the stock got a respite and made handsome gains after Intel’s management expressed its resolve to address the issues facing the company in response to concerns raised by an activist investor.

The virus outbreak has derailed the company’s growth initiatives highlighting the need for more effective measures to stay relevant in the rapidly changing industry. Rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) which got a major boost earlier this year after Intel delayed its 7-nanometer chips and Asian counterpart Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company have been making steady inroads into the global semiconductor market. Also Intel’s top customers like Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) are drifting to suppliers who offer cheaper solutions.

Long-term Prospects

While its earlier efforts to build a competitive solution for 5G did not yield the desired results the largely-untapped market for the high-speed wireless technology offers opportunities the company can count on. The answer to Intel’s problems lies in shifting focus to cloud-based solutions rather than banking on its prowess in conventional microprocessor and data center technology. That said its fundamentals remain strong — with an impressive balance sheet and cash flow — making the stock a good long-term bet.

We are actively executing against a diversified growth strategy and now have several multi-billion dollar businesses fueled by data and the rise of artificial intelligence 5G network transformation and the intelligent autonomous edge. We built these businesses by positioning the Company to grow share in the largest market opportunity in our history in a world where everything increasingly looks like a computer. Our ambitions are much greater and to realize them we must play a larger role in our customers’ success. Robert Swan chief executive officer of Intel

Weak Q3

In the most recent quarter the company’s finances came under pressure from COVID-related headwinds reversing the uptrend seen in the first half. In what could be a major disappointment for investors earnings dropped in double-digits to $1.11 per share in the third quarter reflecting a 4% decrease in revenues to $18.3 billion. But the results came in above the market’s prediction. While the core Client Computing segment stayed largely unaffected the other divisions contracted.

Initial estimates indicate that the downtrend continued in the final months of the fiscal year owing to the demand shifts and economic uncertainty. The management currently expects fourth-quarter earnings and revenues to be below the prior-year levels.

Stock Falls

Intel’s stock decreased by about 17% in 2020 going through several ups and downs. The shares traded lower during Wednesday’s regular trading after closing the previous session at $49.39.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kZWFkcG9vbC0yLW1hZGUtd2FkZS13aWxzb24tMTYyOTAwMzYwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Deadpool 2' Made Wade Wilson Incompatible With the MCU,"From Men's Health

While the Marvel Cinematic Universe might be known for its family-friendly attitude and wholesome image as befits Disney's branding there's change on the horizon as Deadpool is set to (eventually) suit up alongside Earth's Mightiest Heroes. After two R-rated juggernauts lorded it over the box office the Merc with a Mouth has officially come under the reins of Mickey Mouse.

As fans patiently wait for Ryan Reynolds to return to the role of Wade Wilson a fan theory pointed out how David Leitch's Deadpool 2 actually makes the foul-mouth fourth-wall-breaking mercenary incompatible with the MCU. Ironically it boils down to the convoluted storyline of Joe and Anthony Russo's Avengers: Endgame.

Posting on Reddit MCU fan u/Joonicks highlighted the moment in Deadpool 2 when the titular anti-hero and Josh Brolin's Cable manage to change the past. The movie plays out as Cable tries to kill Russell Collins (Julian Dennison) before he grows up to become the villainous Firefist and kill Cable's family.

When Cable arrives on the scene he's equipped with his cybernetic arm a heavy arsenal of weaponry and a torched teddy bear that belonged to his deceased daughter. Deadpool manages to successfully reform Russell before he becomes the big bad of Cable's apocalyptic future. The movie ends with Cable's future being altered and the burned bear returning to normal.

So what? This what: it is in direct contradiction to Endgame's explicit time-travel rules. In one of Endgame's deeper scenes Tilda Swinton's Ancient One explains to Bruce Banner how time travel creates an alternate timeline rather than affecting the future. According to Endgame Deadpool 2's time-travel trickery is in direct contradiction to the MCU.

Joonicks writes: ""Such effects were explicitly rejected in Avengers: Endgame. And so Deadpool exists in a different reality with different natural laws not just a different timeline.""

It's no secret that Endgame played fast and loose with its time travel. Despite mocking the flaws in the likes of Back to the Future the MCU's 21st entry backed itself into a corner with its own time-travel paradoxes. Even the Russos can't seem to agree with writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely on how the movie's complex time-travel rules really work.

Deadpool 2 works along the same line as Back to the Future and riffs on the idea of Marty McFly's photograph changing due to his meddling in the past. Of course the Deadpool 2 problem can easily be explained away in Deadpool 3: Wade Wilson is known for his many nods to the audience meaning a simple throwaway line could rectify the situation.

Story continues

Even though Avengers: Endgame is held in almost universally high regard critics have made no secret about the sometimes confusing laws of time travel. It seems that Captain America's last-minute decision to stay in the past could have some serious consequences and potentially kick-start the Marvel Multiverse. Although some might find it frustrating the whole idea of the Multiverse would also make for a neat introduction of Deadpool.

Just like his comic book counterpart Deadpool is known for his cartoonish antics when compared to the rest of the MCU. Aside from the R-rated nature of the Deadpool franchise in general Wilson's whole dynamic is very different to the usually serious MCU.

Across his two movies Deadpool has frequently poked fun at the absence of the X-Men – which led to Deadpool 2's memorable cameo from the X-Men: Dark Phoenix cast. If Deadpool 3 decides to address the time-travel conundrum it could easily be done with one of the character's many meta comments. Elsewhere it's likely that Deadpool 3 will also have to explain why Cable looks a lot like Thanos.

With fans eagerly awaiting the arrival of Fox properties like the Fantastic Four and the X-Men it looks increasingly likely that Reynolds' portrayal of Deadpool will be a lone survivor of the Disney merger. As Deadpool 3 continues to rumble forward chances are fans won't be seeing him back on their screens for quite some time.

Kevin Feige has already downplayed the arrival of the X-Men before 2025 meaning we'll probably have forgotten Deadpool 2's time-travel trouble by the time Reynolds slips into his spandex once again.

We obtained An. gambiae s.s mosquito larvae from a mosquito colony maintained at the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) Nairobi Kenya. This mosquito colony was originally initiated reared and maintained at Mbita Point Research and Training Centre of ICIPE Homa Bay County Kenya from adults collected in 1996 at Njagi village in south-east Tanzania [22]. The colony was transferred and used to establish the An. gambiae s.s colony we used for our study at ICIPE Nairobi Kenya in December 2000. This colony had never been previously exposed to any insecticide or growth-regulating xenobiotics including plant extracts and was thus considered susceptible to known insecticides and other xenobiotics. We followed standard procedures for rearing Anopheles mosquitoes [23]. We reared all life stages in an insectary (28 ± 2 °C 75–80% relative humidity) at the Animal Rearing and Quarantine Unit of ICIPE Nairobi Kenya. From the day of emergence we provided adult mosquitoes with a 10% sugar solution soaked in cotton wool. We fed 3-day-old adult female mosquitoes on bovine blood using an artificial membrane feeding method [24]. Approximately 2–3 days later we placed oviposition dishes in the cage containing gravid females. We placed the eggs on water and surrounded them with floating wax paper to prevent them from getting stranded on the sides of the hatching tray. We typically placed about 30 mg pulverized Tetramin fish food (Tetra GmbH Melle Germany) per pan of water twice daily (three times daily after reaching the third larval stage). We collected the pupae daily transferred them to bowls with water and placed the bowls in cages for adult emergence. For our study we maintained the larvae on 0.3 mg powdered Tetramin fish meal per larvae per day as recommended for An. gambiae s.s larvae [25] under the insectary conditions. This quantity of food was sufficient to sustain the larvae for 24 h while establishing minimal residual food that could potentially interfere with bioavailability of the extract to the larvae.

We exposed the larvae to curry tree leaf extract following the protocol of Mang’era et al. [11] with relevant modifications for our current applications. The extract consisted of a natural blend of alkaloid phytochemicals (neplanocin A 3-(1-naphthyl)-l-alanine lumiflavine terezine C agelaspongin and murrayazolinol) and induced morphogenetic abnormalities reduced locomotion and delayed pupation (8-day delay) in the larvae [11]. Briefly we initiated this process by establishing the temporal range of toxicity of specific phytochemical extract concentration (2 ppm) to late third-early fourth instar larvae (L 3 /L 4 ) of the mosquito. The temporal range was critical to our determination of optimal duration of exposure of the larvae to putatively elicit molecular responses to our extract at the L 4 instar larvae just before pupation. We selected this concentration (2 ppm) since we have previously identified it as sub-lethal to the L 3 /L 4 of the mosquito in an extract toxicity range (median lethal concentration) assessment [11]. For this purpose (establishing the temporal range of toxicity) we first solubilized the extract in absolute ethanol and diluted the resultant solution to 2 ppm in a total volume of 100 ml solution of distilled water (in a 250-ml glass beaker). Our overall ethanol concentration was 0.2% (v/v) absolute ethanol in the distilled water based on the quantity of absolute ethanol we initially used to solubilize the extract. We then placed 20 L 3 /L 4 instar larvae of the mosquito into the solution consequently exposing them to the extract and serving as our exposed treatment. We similarly placed 20 L 3 /L 4 instar larvae in 100 ml of distilled water with a similar concentration of absolute ethanol in a water beaker (in a 250-ml glass beaker) that served as our control treatment. The absolute ethanol concentration equivalence between the treatments potentially assisted in contrasting the effect of the extract from that of the solubilizing agent in downstream analyses. We prepared five replicates each of the treatment and control and monitored daily mortality and pupation of these larvae in both treatments under insectary conditions.

Our findings revealed peak pupation of the larvae 7 and 18 days post-exposure to our control and exposed treatments respectively (Fig. 1a b) suggesting that (i) the extract appeared to delay growth in the larvae and consequently the exposed and associated control larvae were potentially physiologically (L 3 /L 4 instar larvae) similar 7 and 18 days post-exposure (dpe) respectively. At this point 81 and 53% of the larvae had pupated or eclosed (Fig. 1a) for control and exposed larvae populations respectively indicating that the remaining respective proportions would potentially be appropriate L 4 instar larvae for further analyses in the definitive phase of our studies. The significant extension of larval phase (delayed pupation) by the extract exposure presented us with unique challenges in selection of the sampling points for the RNA extraction and subsequent RNA-Seq experiments. We reckoned that age-matching by sampling the larvae from either population 7 days post-exposure (peak pupation in control population) would constitute comparison between L 2 exposed and L 3/4 control larvae populations; hence the outcome/results would be confounded by differences in the physiological states between the populations. The alternative was to consider exposed and control larvae populations 7 and 18 dpe respectively as physiologically equivalent (both at L 3 /L 4 instar larvae developmental stage). The results from this approach would be confounded by the age differences between the larvae populations. Balancing these options and their consequences we selected the latter option since growth inhibition compounds typically have the most profound effect on insects at the L 3 /L 4 instar larval metamorphosis stage (physiologically matched) of their growth [26]. Consequently our molecular results would reflect responses to the inevitable combination of age differences between the larvae populations and the xenobiotic (extract) challenge. The exposed will hereafter refer to this larvae population (extract-exposed but not age-matched larvae population).

For assessment of molecular events associated with the exposure to the phytochemical extract we repeated similar treatments (exposed and control) but in 15 independent biological replicates of 25 larvae per treatment to enhance the odds of obtaining sufficient surviving larvae for the subsequent molecular studies given potential 55% mortality and 59% pupation as revealed by our preliminary studies (Fig. 1a) and the need to minimize crowding of the larvae in the beakers. We monitored and recorded larval survivorship at 24-h intervals indicating numbers of larvae alive dead or moribund and removed the dead larvae. Since we were interested in two biological replicates each for the control or exposed treatments for our subsequent RNA-Seq molecular comparative analyses we randomly and separately assigned five replicates from each treatment (exposed or control) into two groups of five treatments each. We performed these assignments 7 or 18 dpe for the control or exposed treatments respectively. From the 50 and 49 L 4 instar larvae survivors from control and exposed treatments respectively (Fig. 1b) we pooled surviving larvae in each group into two separate 1.5-ml reaction tubes constituting our two biological replicates of surviving larvae for subsequent RNA isolations and analyses. The replicates consisted of 25 25 25 and 24 larvae in each of control replicates 1 and 2 and exposed replicates 1 and 2 respectively. We quickly centrifuged the larvae in the tubes at 15300 rcf for 1 min (Eppendorf AG 5417R centrifuge Hamburg Germany) to pellet the larvae and facilitate removal of the residual water. We then snap froze the larval pellet in liquid nitrogen until RNA isolation.

Isolation and sequencing of An. gambiae s.s RNA

We isolated total An. gambiae s.s RNA from the two biological independent replicates (from control or exposed larvae) by mechanically crushing the larvae using disposable RNAse-free plastic pestles in ISOLATE II RNA Mini Kit buffer (Bioline Merdian Life Sciences London UK) following the manufacturer’s protocol. We then treated resultant total RNA with TURBO DNase™ (Ambion Life Technologies TX USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions to remove potentially contaminating DNA that could confound our subsequent RNA-Seq analysis. We verified the quality and integrity of the RNA samples using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Palo Alto CA USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We sourced services for cDNA library preparation from the total RNA and subsequent sequencing of the libraries from Macrogen Korea (Geumcheon-gu Seoul Republic of Korea). Therein cDNA libraries were prepared from 900 ng (per replicate) of high-quality total RNA (RNA integrity number between 8 and 9.7) using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT sample preparation kit (Illumina Hayward CA USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA libraries were then sequenced (101-bp paired-end read) on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer (Illumina Hayward CA USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Low-quality reads (< 100 base pairs) and adapter sequences in the libraries were then removed using Illumina build software (Illumina Hayward CA USA). Overall four transcriptome sequences were generated from our samples (two each for control or exposed larvae). We deposited the raw transcriptomes at the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) USA under study accession number PRJNA560504.

Identification and validation of responsive transcripts in An. gambiae s.s RNA to M. koenigii leaf extract

We separately assessed the quality of each library using FastQC software [27] and used the results to filter and trim out low-quality sections of the reads using CLC Genomic Workbench version 9.0 software (CLC Bio Aarhus Denmark). We then obtained the protein-coding gene set AgamP4.4 of An. gambiae s.s from VectorBase [28] and mapped the filtered and trimmed reads to the gene set (AgamP4.4) using RNA-Seq analysis procedures in CLC Genomic Workbench software version 9.0 (CLC Bio Aarhus Denmark) as described previously [29]. Briefly we mapped the reads through settings that allowed two mismatches per read (with a maximum of 10 hits per read) with at least 80% of each read matching the gene at 95% identity. We then used reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) mapped reads as a proxy for quantity (abundance) of transcripts [30] for (1) assessment of baseline transcriptional processes that underpin the larval developmental stage in the mosquito (in the absence of xenobiotics) and (2) comparison of relative expression of the genes between libraries from control and exposed larvae. We established the relative number of reads for each transcript in relation to the total read counts for each RNA-seq library to calculate the p-value based on Baggerly's test method following Bonferroni analysis [31]. We then determined the relative fold change (FC) of transcripts between the control and exposed mosquito larvae as a ratio of the RPKM values and normalized based on the number of reads obtained from each library using an inbuilt algorithm in CLC Genomic Workbench. The normalized values were used in this study. We considered transcripts differentially expressed (DE) between the libraries if they had a normalized value of at least (i) 1.5-fold change (ii) corrected p < 0.05 false discovery rate (FDR) (iii) ten RPKM and (iv) a support of ten unique read mappings. We defined fold change as a ratio of RPKM values between those from exposed and control larvae libraries. We thus considered and categorized these transcripts as specific to control or exposed larval libraries.

We also conducted gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses of differentially expressed transcripts in exposed relative to control larvae libraries using gProfiler [32] to establish pathways networks and interactions associated with transcripts induced or suppressed by the exposure of larvae to the extract. For these analyses we set our thresholds to a significance of p = 0.05 (to retrieve all GO terms under the biological process molecular function and cellular component) and ordered query to identify specific functional terms associated with the most significant changes for our query [33]. Since the extract predominantly induced morphogenetic abnormalities in the larvae [11] that we putatively associate a priori with cuticular metabolism [34 35] which changes with developmental stages in insects [36] we further focused our analyses on cuticular proteins (CPs). We consequently detected and classified putative structural CPs among the DE transcripts through blastp [37] searches against the AgamP4.4 gene set of An. gambiae s.s from VectorBase [28] and CutProtFam-Pred CPs family prediction tool [38 39]. The tool classified the CPs into protein families that (i) exhibited Rebers and Riddiford (R&R) Consensus sequences (CPR) [38 40] (ii) were based on a conserved region with a 44 amino acid motif (CPF) and (iii) were analogous to peritrophins with chitin-binding domains (CPAP). The tool further classified the CPR into RR-1 RR-2 and RR-3 subfamilies based on variations in their consensus amino acid sequences in the R&R domain [38] and identified cuticular proteins of low complexity (CPLC) which encompass CPLCA CPLCP and CPLCX among our differentially expressed transcripts.

Validation of transcriptome expression profiles using RT-qPCR

Reverse transcriptions of larval RNA transcripts

We further evaluated whether our RNA-Seq analysis results could be independently replicated using the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) technique as an independent tool. We randomly selected DE larval transcripts in our RNA-seq library and compared their relative fold changes to those we obtained for the same transcripts through RT-qPCR. Briefly we generated five independent biological replicates (exposed and control) of the larvae extracted and cleaned the respective total RNA libraries from our control and exposed larvae ab initio. We used the same methods and procedures we used to prepare the biological samples for the RNA-seq component of our study for sample preparations and total RNA extraction. We then reverse transcribed 1 μg of the total RNA using the iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (BIO-RAD Hercules USA) on the Arktik thermal cycler (Thermo Scientific USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Selection of candidate transcripts for RT-qPCR

We randomly selected eight DE transcripts for validation of differential expression. These transcripts were significantly induced or suppressed in the exposed larvae library relative to the control library to encompass and validate differential expression in both directions (up- and downregulated genes) of the libraries. We also selected four transcripts that were neutral (neither induced nor suppressed in the exposed library relative to the control library) as potential internal reference neutral/loading controls [41]. These reference transcripts consisted of CLIP-domain serine protease glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and two uncharacterized genes (Additional file 1: Table S1) from VectorBase [28]. We ensured that all these transcripts were abundantly expressed in the RNA-seq libraries (based on their RPKM values) to ensure that their expression levels would be within the sensitivity of our Stratagene MX3005P RT-qPCR machine (Agilent Technologies CA USA). We obtained DNA sequences of respective genes from VectorBase [28] using the respective gene IDs (Additional file 1: Table S1) and designed primers (Additional file 1: Table S1) from these sequences in silico using primer3 software [42]. In all cases we ensured that the melting (T m ) and annealing temperatures of the respective forward and reverse primers generated were similar as determined by pDRAW32 version 1.1.142 software (http://www.acaclone.com) (Additional file 1: Table S1).

Real-time qRT-PCR of genes for DE transcripts

We first interrogated reference transcripts for their stable expression by performing RT-qPCR in three technical replicates for each of the five biological replicates on our Strategene MX3005P RT-qPCR machine (Agilent Technologies CA USA) using Fast SYBR Green I Master Mix (Applied Biosystems Carlsbad CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We performed the PCR in reaction volumes of 10 μl for each replicate consisting of 1 μg cDNA template in three independent replicates with 5 μl of Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems Carlsbad CA USA) in the presence of 0.4 picomoles of specific primers for the respective candidate reference transcripts. We carried out the reactions in a RT-qPCR thermal cycler (Stratagene MX3005P Agilent Technologies CA USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We involved thermo-cycling conditions that included an initial step of 95 °C for 10 min 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s 55.0–63.2 °C (Additional file 1: Table S1) for 45 s and 72 °C for 1 min followed by one cycle of 95 °C for 1 min 55 °C for 30 s and 95 °C for 30 s for all the genes. We then assessed stability (non-differential expression) of these reference transcripts using BestKeeper software [43]. From this assessment we identified gapdh and CLIP-domain serine protease transcripts as less variable [with a standard deviation of crossing point (CP) of 0.56 and 0.65 respectively] among the reference transcript candidates. We thus adopted these two genes as our internal housekeeping transcripts for assessment of expression of the eight randomly selected transcripts. We then separately performed the RT-qPCR for each of these transcripts under similar reaction and thermocycling conditions as had been previously employed in the assessment for stable expression of the reference transcripts above but with gapdh and CLIP-domain serine protease as internal reference/loading controls.

Data analysis

We computed and compared relative expression (means fold changes and p-value) of the eight transcripts using Relative Expression Software Tool (REST)-384 version 2 software [44]. We then used these data to evaluate validity of the transcriptomes by comparing the fold changes obtained here (RT-qPCR) to those obtained earlier (RNA-Seq) for the eight genes through Pearson correlation analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,

1980s

Making cookies

Melissa Weller grew up baking cookies with her mother. “My mom baked with margarine because that was sort of the trend in the ’80s” Weller says. In college her parents encouraged her to do something science related so she got a degree in chemical engineering. “But I also loved France and I loved languages.” So she double majored in international relations and spent a year studying in France. “I was so enthralled with all of the different pastries and how good they were and I think the science part of me wanted to know how to make it all from scratch” she says. “I stuck with engineering but I think my heart was always in cooking in France.”

1995

Engineering her dream job

Upon graduating Weller received a job offer from Air Products and Chemicals where she entered a career-development program and rotated among engineering assignments. “None of them were good fits” she says. She enrolled in a course in San Francisco where she became enthralled with the cuisine and decided she wanted to work in a restaurant. So in 1999 she quit her engineering job and went door to door to restaurants looking for a job. She ended up hostessing at two restaurants in San Francisco to make ends meet. “It was a pretty stark reality from having this comfortable engineering job with benefits and a 401(k) and holidays off to all of a sudden making hardly any money at all” she says. She got nervous about her finances and decided to take a job in San Diego with the fuel-cell engine company Excelsis where she worked for 2½ years. When the company announced it was closing its US location it “was a blessing in disguise because I had a big severance package” Weller says. She called up one of the most highly acclaimed restaurants in San Diego and offered to work without pay if it would teach her to cook. The restaurant accepted.

2003

Beginning with bread

Weller moved to New York City to attend the French Culinary Institute. After graduating she worked for 2 years in the pastry kitchen at the Italian restaurant Babbo. She started experimenting with baking bread at home. “I’ve always said ‘How do you make that?’ I’m sure it’s related to my chemical engineering background” she says. Then she was hired as a dough pH tester at Sullivan Street Bakery where the owner used large batches of dough with relatively little yeast. The theory was that “at a certain point the pH would indicate when the dough was perfect for shaping into bread” she says. Weller started out using a pH meter once per hour to measure and graph the pH and eventually worked her way up to become Sullivan Street’s first-ever woman baker.

My shelves are cluttered with a fondue pot George Foreman Grill Crockpot and an Instant Pot. One of them might just have to find a new home now that the air fryer is here.

Is “air frying” healthy or does it belong in the crock category too?

First off frying food is unarguably one of the tastiest ways to eat anything. Broccoli mushrooms even Snickers taste great fried. However for those of you looking for an argument against intelligent design it just so happens that many of the tastiest things in our world are also the unhealthiest.

Research has found that people who eat fried potatoes — French fries hash browns etc. — more than twice a week were more than twice as likely to die early compared to those who don’t. The study didn’t show causality just a strong association.

Most people eat fried foods from restaurants. Often restaurants use the unhealthier oils because it is easier to create fried foods with that satisfying crunch. Oil loads on calories. And restaurants tend to over-salt foods. The oil and salt combo is linked to heart disease type II diabetes and high blood pressure.

Another element of frying starchy food particularly potatoes is the creation of the chemical acrylamide. This is a known carcinogen created from the amino acid asparagine reacting with the sugars in the food. The darker the frying process makes the food like that dark brown French fry the more acrylamide in it. Until now those were the best tastiest ones.

But is “air frying” even frying? Not exactly. It is more like a convection oven in which really hot air is blown by a fan around the food. The hot air gets the outside to get crispy while the inside stays soft (the perfect French fry). The food sits on a slightly elevated rack within the fryer so that air can get to all sides and that grease can drop away from the food to the bottom of the pan. It sounds healthier to have fat drip away from the food instead of having the food swim in it.

Oil is often lightly coated onto food before air frying. Using healthier oils and a lot less is estimated to cut calories by 70% to 80% when compared with traditional fried foods. A quarter-pound piece of chicken deep-fried will have more than 13 grams of fat in it whereas that same piece of chicken cooked in an air fryer will have less than 1 gram.

The question is do owners of air fryers reduce their consumption of fried food from restaurants or are they augmenting their weekly fried food intake by now making a lower-calorie version at home?

One study shows that air frying reduces the amount of acrylamide compared to traditional frying. Another study looked at air-fried fish and found that air frying compared to other forms of cooking raised the levels of cholesterol oxidation products. These chemicals are associated with heart disease and cancer. Air frying lowers the omega-3 fatty acids in fish too. This is the “good” fat in fish.

For some foods like meats frying isn’t healthy no matter what way you do it. The fried food purists will tell you that air frying doesn’t give as satisfying as a crunch or feel. And health food purists will tell you that there are healthier ways to eat anything you might consider frying. It is important to think of air frying as the alternative to deep frying and not a healthy alternative to roasting or baking.

If you’re going to make room on your shelves for an air fryer make sure that it is the deep fryer that takes a hike.

Now the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has invited stakeholders to execute a 36-month study that seeks to understand the potential long-term effects of contaminants through a comprehensive assessment of cabin air quality.

“The general objective of this research project is to enable step-advances in the analysis of the issues raised by contamination events resulting from oil leakage (including oil pyrolysis products) on board commercially operated large transport aeroplanes and the potential toxicological risks in light of the existing European standards and legislation on the quality of indoor air and professional exposure limits” says EASA in its ‘call for tenders’.

EASA explains that the contract awardee will collect evidence on the chemical substances involved in oil leakage events from aircraft engines or APUs and their impact on cabin air quality; develop a comprehensive understanding of the different scenarios for contamination that may be observed during flights “considering the complete aircraft bleed air system and air ventilation system”; and perform the toxicological risk assessment of the main identified chemical compounds among other tasks.

There is some disagreement in the aviation community over whether or not toxic cabin air is a real problem. But pilots cabin crew and consumer advocacy groups worldwide have long worried that oil fume events have caused everything from light-headedness and dizziness to vomiting and memory impairment or worse.

“Cabin air in most of today’s jet aircraft (the Boeing 787 being the most notable exception) is drawn from compressors in engine compartments. If a seal inside the engine breaks gases from engine oil and other toxic chemicals can mix with this ‘bleed air’ as it’s known producing noxious fumes that leak into the aircraft cabin. These occurrences have the potential to incapacitate flight crews” notes literature from the Air Line Pilots Association.

For its part EASA says the new cabin air study has received funding from Horizon 2020 the European Union’s funding program for research and innovation. Tenders or requests to participate in the project will be accepted until 31 March 2021.

“[The] Dutch Association of Aviation Technicians NVLT is glad that EASA is issuing this research tender to find out the contamination risk on board by engine oil fumes.

Updated 4 January

Sydney’s COVID-19 outbreak has ruined summer travel plans for millions of Australians as hard border closures and stay-at-home orders suck the festive spirit out of the season.

However those who missed out on their summer travel can still make the most of the year ahead.

New research from Instant Offices shows how Australians can plan their annual leave to effectively double their time off.

It comes as Australians increasingly look to local holidays. Airbnb country manager for Australia and New Zealand Susan Wheeldon told Yahoo Finance the holiday platform is seeing increasing numbers of Australians booking holidays with a special interest in local experiences.

Referencing an Oxford Economics report which found that Airbnb guests spent $9 billion in Australia in 2019 with $6 billion coming from Australian pockets Wheeldon said tourism has an important role in revitalising the Australian economy.

Mental health in 2021

More than half of Australians have described themselves as experiencing increased stress and anxiety the need for a break is even more important. According to flexible office space firm Instant Offices Australians work 10 per cent longer than workers in the UK and 20 per cent longer than German workers.

Professional feedback platform Blind also found that more than seven in 10 workers are experiencing burnout due to the coronavirus pandemic with the lack of separation between home and work life the biggest challenge.

Additionally research from the Centre for Future work found Australians are now putting in 5.24 hours of unpaid overtime every week up from 4.6 hours in 2019. That’s around $100 billion in lost income across Australia.

A former RAF base is offering the perfect alternative to an ordinary caravan at Skegness.

The new owner of RAF Wainfleet near Friskney has turned the coastal base into an Airbnb and it has been hailed as one of the most outstanding places for a staycation in the country.

LincolnshireLive reports that the tower at Wainfleet was identified as potentially the most unique Airbnb in the UK by Life is Art a visual art agency based in Leamington Spa.

The company went on a nationwide hunt to find the most unusual places to eat and sleep and the best properties were turned into a 3D virtual reality tour.

The Life is Art description said: ""Based near Skegness it’s perfect for a 'staycation' and can host up to 24 guests across five unique digs.

""All RAF themed you’ve got the five-storey converted watch tower three converted bunkers and a glamping pod made out of an old helicopter!

""Honestly there’s no point in us saying any more – just take a look you’ll be blown away.""

(Image: Steve Parsons/PA Wire)

The Tower which costs £160 per night can sleep six and as well as three king size bedrooms each couple has their own ensuite bathroom. There's also a hot tub.

But it's the fourth floor that's the jewel in the crown with a living area within the glass observatory overlooking the famous Dambusters' bombing range and 360-degree views over sand flats across the marsh to The Wash and out to the bracing North Norfolk coastline.

In a nod to the history the bunkers have been named after aircraft - Hurricane Spitfire and Lancaster. Also on the site is a Westland Lynx Helicopter which sleeps two and has a mini fridge and a television and a brand new addition - a Jetstream from the 43rd Squadron which will sleep five.

Farmer Will Roughton who owns the holiday lets said: ""It’s lovely to be recognised.

""It has been a real success. We opened the tower three years ago and converted the other buildings on the compound as we went along.

“We were aiming to be full for 30 weeks a year and it's been between 35 and 40. Last year we had just ten days that weren't booked.

""We added the Jetstream this year so we have yet to open to full capacity.""

The interior of the Jetstream was ripped out to create sleeping quarters and a pilot's seat for children to pretend to fly the plane.

Commenting on the Airbnb website one former visitor from Thurlaston in Leicestershire said: “Lovely unique place to stay.

“Well maintained perfectly placed to be secluded but close enough to the amenities of Boston or Skegness.

“The Barley Mow pub was a perfect distance to walk to and feel as if you’d earned your beer and excellent food.”

Another visitor from Oadby commented: “Great location we had a great time. Would book again.”

Across Queensland there were 20641 reported cases of ‘unlawful entry with intent’ on a dwelling which includes felons entering a home that is occupied compared to 22801 for the same period last year.

The sudden decline has largely been attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic which forced many Queenslanders to work from home or saw many lose their jobs.

The downward trend repeated across all but two Queensland police districts with a modest 2 per cent spike recorded on the Gold Coast.

Criminology Professor Martin Andresen said holiday homes and Airbnb homes may have been easy targets for criminals during the pandemic.

“Because of COVID a lot of people didn’t head to their holiday homes in Queensland while Airbnb properties in tourist areas sat empty” he said.

More than 1000 of 2814 reported break-ins in Townsville between January and November occurred in February (526) and March (502).

Break-in reports in Townsville dipped to as low as 107 in July.

“About a third of the break-ins were in just two months and that’s what is driving the difference in Townsville” the Griffith University lecturer said.

Townsville falls within the Northern region where there was a 12 per cent decline in burglaries in Mount Isa and almost 17 per cent fewer break-ins in the Far North.

Statewide the greatest decline in break-ins was 33 per cent at Moreton while the Wide Bay Burnett district was down 29 per cent.

A Queensland police spokesman said while reported break-ins had risen in Townsville in 2020 overall property crime had decreased in the district year-on-year (Jan-Nov).

“Police have conducted a series of targeted operations that have resulted in the arrests of a

number of property offenders responsible for committing offences within the district” he said.

“Police have also maintained a crime prevention focus by analysing the data and strategically aligning resources through targeted patrols.”

The decline in home burglaries has certainly flowed through to insurers.

NRMA Insurance alone said it experienced close to 50 per cent fewer claims for home theft between March and October this year.

The Insurance Council Of Australia said major insurers across the board had reported a significant decline in home theft claims from mid-March until the start of December.

“Notwithstanding the declining theft claims during COVID-19 evidence from insurers suggests that a growing percentage of consumers continue to leave their homes unsecured when not home” an ICA representative said.

Or follow us on Google News

Tesla has published its official 4th quarter 2020 and full-year 2020 vehicle production and delivery numbers. Details are below. They show that Troy Teslike whose estimates I wrote about yesterday was off by only 3142 for the full year. In other words not much changes from yesterday’s discussion but scroll down for the details and new CleanTechnica charts.

For the official figures only which do not include model-specific deliveries or production here are the tables provided by Tesla one more quarterly delivery graph (interactive version on bottom of page) and two vehicle production charts:

Perhaps the most interesting of all remains that fact that a small percentage of Tesla drivers are leasing their cars and SUVs — a stark departure from the overall premium-class vehicle market or overall auto market as a whole. As Paul Fosse wrote earlier this in 2019 “over 32% of cars are leased while in the luxury subcompact market it is 64%.”

Most noteworthy for the market though is that Tesla basically hit its guidance of 500000 vehicles a year (despite the pandemic) — and even got production up to nearly 510000.

More thoughts on regional and model-specific details based on highly informed estimates are here: 499550 Tesla Sales In 2020 (CleanTechnica Charts).

This article has been updated to add charts for Tesla vehicle production and more delivery graphs.

Here are interactive versions of the long-term quarterly Tesla delivery graphs above (tend to display better on a laptop/desktop computer than a phone):

Researchers biologists chemists process engineers formulators quality control experts and other professionals involved in drug development and manufacturing worked under pressure and sometimes socially distanced from other collaborators or team members.

The long hours and adverse conditions endured by drug development and manufacturing professionals have started to show results with the Emergency Use Authorization of two vaccines and two monoclonal antibody treatments and FDA approval of remdesivir. Nearly 50 drugs for other conditions were approved by FDA as 2020 drew to a close (1).

Drug development and manufacturing professionals participating in the 2021 Bio/Pharmaceutical Development and Manufacturing Employment Trends Survey sponsored by Pharmaceutical Technology (2) worked longer hours in 2020 than previous years with fewer salary increases. Respondents however said compensation was not a top priority and nearly two-thirds expect to stay in their same position in the coming year. (See the infographics for an overview of survey results.)

Bio/pharma companies were very busy during 2020 as evidenced by the increased workloads reported in the survey. Nearly 60% of respondents said they worked more hours in 2020 than in the previous two years compared with 38% in the previous survey.

Nearly 80% of the respondents reported some impact from the pandemic on their daily work. More than half of the respondents (53.2%) changed work schedules to enable social distancing at work. A similar number (53.9%) worked remotely from home. Nearly one-third of the respondents said they assumed additional responsibilities; 20% worked additional hours on pandemic-related projects and 10.3% switched to pandemic-related projects. Development programs were changed or reduced for 13.5% of the respondents. Work hours or responsibility were reduced for 18.6% and 5.8% said their position was eliminated.

After a difficult 2020 biopharma professionals have an optimistic outlook for the industry for 2021; more than three-quarters of survey respondents expect business to improve; 64.3% expect business at their employer to improve.

The compensation question

Satisfaction with compensation increased slightly in 2020 following a few years of downward movement. Almost 43% of the respondents said they were paid fairly or excessively in 2020 compared with 41.5% in 2019. A majority of respondents were not happy with their salary; 37.7% said their pay was at the low end of the salary range for their expertise and responsibility; 19.4% said they were paid below market value.

The percentage of respondents reporting salary increases continued a downward trend. Only 41.7% of the respondents reported a salary increase in 2020 compared with 55.4% in 2019 and nearly 63% in 2017 (2–4). A slightly greater percentage reported a decrease in salary (13.7% in 2020 vs. 11.4% in 2019). More people reported no change in salary (44.6% for 2020 compared with 33.2% in 2019).

Salary ranked second to last on a list of 13 factors contributing to job satisfaction in the 2021 survey down from fifth place in the 2020 survey. Compensation trailed factors such as challenging projects intellectual stimulation company’s potential for success supportive management and a good work/life balance as the “main reason I come to work.”

Though only 3000 fans were able to attend whether you watched the game at home or listened to the radio you can experience the sights and sounds from Ohio State’s amazing 49-28 college football playoff win against Clemson below. It was very much unlike a traditional college football playoff semifinal game.

Pre-Game

I arrived at the stadium at 4 p.m. CT on a media shuttle and went through security and multiple screenings. Blue dots marked the floor requiring everybody to remain six feet apart. The concessions were just being set up and stadium security were just finishing finding their spots in their respective sections the stadium was quiet and the field was empty.

It wasn’t until 5 p.m. that music came on and team managers for both Clemson and Ohio State took the field.

At 5:08 p.m. Clemson players came out of the tunnel in their dress clothes and walked across the field to their locker room. Ohio State came out and walked across the field at 5:21 PM. Fans had began entering and there were consistent cheers as Ohio State walked across the field.

A handful of Clemson players were out on the field stretching and running around. As the clock neared 5:30 a lot of Clemson players were warming up on its side of the field and a few Ohio State players began coming out. As a number of Ohio State players ran out to warm up there was a lot of noise coming from the Ohio State side of the stadium.

Every time an Ohio State position group ran out onto the field to warm up the Ohio State fans cheered. Clemson fans were quiet.

The corridors of the Mercedes-Benz Superdome were empty and dark. There were very few people walking around. In a stadium with a capacity of over 74000 the 3000 fans and parents in attendance hardly took up any space.

There were numerous announcements to mask up and stay two yards apart or maintain six feet of distance.

With 99 minutes to kickoff a countdown clock began in the stadium.

At 6:00 p.m. the stadium announcer officially welcomed the fans.

Ohio State was running through position warmups and you could hear the coaches and the players yelling. You could even hear the clapping and yelling of individual players in between the music that was playing. No Clemson fans were audible in warmups.

With just under an hour remaining the Clemson band played via a video on the scoreboard as if they would at a home game.

Ohio State’s marching band also played via the video board and the Ohio State fans clapped along. The marching band was in an empty Ohio Stadium performing Script Ohio. As Carmen Ohio played all Ohio State fans were standing swinging and signing along. The dance team performed its dance virtually as well.

Game

Families and fans sat in the lower bowl and the middle bowl. There were no fans in the upper bowl. Fans were scattered throughout a the sections from top to bottom. Few fans were scattered in the end zone sections.

There were fireworks when both teams came out onto the field. Both teams ran to the end zone to kneel and pray.

When big plays were made you could hear the crowd reactions. When there was a loud hit not only did you hear the fans but you could hear the contact between players and even the thud of when a player hit the ground. You could hear the foot of Blake Haubiel hit the ball kicking the extra points.

Buckeye players on the sidelines were waving their towels and turning to the fans to pump up the crowd. The entire sideline was involved. The Ohio State fans even got an O-H-I-O around the stadium chant going late in the second quarter.

The video board was very loud and there was fake crowd noise playing throughout the game. Videos and advertisements played on the big screen and fans were shown.

But some plays were awkwardly quiet. When you would expect to hear a roaring stadium you only heard the same amount of cheers from the fans as any other play.

Running back Miyan Williams got a lot of cheers from the fans after his 15-yard run.

Post-Game

Buckeye fans remained in their seats to watch the post-game trophy ceremony as Clemson fans quietly exited the building.

Clemson players remained on the field post-game as Ohio State sung Carmen Ohio. Their alma matter played after.

After the Ohio State team received its trophies and confetti sprayed across the field the players went over and saw their friends and families in the stands. After the quick visit and photo-session Ohio State players headed to the locker room and the fans exited the stands.

After changing in the locker room Clemson players slowly walked across the confetti-filled field in their sweatsuits.

As I exited the Mercedes-Benz Superdome at the early hours of the next morning the building was lit up Scarlet and Grey and both teams’ equipment busses were finishing loading up.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovLzI0N3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vY29sbGVnZS9vaGlvLXN0YXRlL2xvbmdmb3JtYXJ0aWNsZS9vaGlvLXN0YXRlLWJ1Y2tleWVzLWZvb3RiYWxsLXJvdXRzLWNsZW1zb24tdGlnZXJzLWluLXN1Z2FyLWJvd2wtbmF0aW9uYWwtc2VtaWZpbmFsLWdhbWUtY29sbGVnZS1mb290YmFsbC1wbGF5b2ZmLTE1ODM4MDE4Ny_SAbgBaHR0cHM6Ly8yNDdzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NvbGxlZ2Uvb2hpby1zdGF0ZS9sb25nZm9ybWFydGljbGUvb2hpby1zdGF0ZS1idWNrZXllcy1mb290YmFsbC1yb3V0cy1jbGVtc29uLXRpZ2Vycy1pbi1zdWdhci1ib3dsLW5hdGlvbmFsLXNlbWlmaW5hbC1nYW1lLWNvbGxlZ2UtZm9vdGJhbGwtcGxheW9mZi0xNTgzODAxODcvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sights and Sounds: Buckeyes barrel over Clemson in Sugar Bowl,"NEW ORLEANS – We have photos and postgame videos as No. 3 Ohio State defeated No. 2 Clemson 49-28 in the Allstate Sugar Bowl Friday night at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.

The third-ranked Buckeyes had 394 yards offense in the first half in building a 35-14 lead and then coasted to a 49-28 win over the second-rated Tigers in the Allstate Sugar Bowl national semifinal game at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.

With the win Ohio State (7-0) got its first ever win over Clemson (10-2) in five tries and also avenged a painful 29-23 loss to the Tigers in last year’s Fiesta Bowl national semifinal game. In addition to that redemption OSU also proved a point to Clemson coach Dabo Swinney who ranked the Buckeyes 11th in his final coaches poll ballot simply because OSU in his view did not play enough games in this pandemic-shortened season.

And best of all OSU also advances to the College Football Playoff national championship game to meet No. 1 Alabama (12-0) which defeated No. 4 Notre Dame 31-14 in the Rose Bowl semifinal game played earlier on Friday. The national championship game is set for Mon. Jan. 11 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens Fla.

This one did not start well as Clemson mounted two early scoring drives for leads of 7-0 and 14-7. But OSU stormed back with 28 unanswered points to seize control of the game.

OSU quarterback Justin Fields improved to 20-1 as the Buckeyes starter in slaying the Clemson dragon that had gotten the better of him and his team the year before. Fields took a hard shot to the back in the first half resulting in him missing one play and Clemson linebacker James Skalski being ejected.

Fields played through the pain and ended up 22 of 28 passing for 385 yards and six touchdowns against one interception. He also had 42 yards rushing on eight carries. He bounced back after a lackluster showing in the Big Ten championship game against Northwestern.

OSU running back Trey Sermon had 30 carries for 193 yards and a touchdown and also caught four passes for 61 yards. Sermon coming off a school-record 331-yard game against Northwestern in the Big Ten championship game made his first start with Master Teague missing the game presumably due to injury.

Receiver Chris Olave had six catches for 132 yards and two touchdowns.

Tight end Jeremy Ruckert also caught two touchdown passes while Luke Farrell and Jameson Williams each had one.

Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence who was 34-1 as a starter coming in got off to a fast start. But the OSU defense settled in and eventually got some stops. Lawrence ended up 33 of 48 passing for 400 yards with two touchdowns and one interception.

Running back Travis Etienne netted 32 yards rushing with a touchdown on 10 carries. He also had four catches for 62 yards. Wideout Cornell Powell had eight catches for 139 yards and two touchdowns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJpZ2xlYWQuY29tL3Bvc3RzL3RyZXZvci1sYXdyZW5jZS1tdXN0YWNoZS1pbnN1bHQtcmVwb3J0ZXItem9vbS1tdXRlLXN1Z2FyLWJvd2wtMDFldjB3cmpndG1q0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trevor Lawrence Had His Mustache Insulted By Reporter on an Open Mic,"During Trevor Lawrence's Presser somebody was unmuted and shared their opinion on Trevor's mustache.

Clemson was unable to make a return trip to the National Championship Game for the third consecutive season falling to Ohio State 49-28 in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans Friday.

Ohio State scored a touchdown on five straight possessions to close the first half in building a 35-14 lead. Travis Etienne playing in his final collegiate game picked up just 32 yards on ten carries and was never a factor.

Clemson’s defense entered the game with a stellar reputation and the statistics to back it up. The Tigers gave up just 17.5 points per game this season and held opposing teams to 2.8 yards per rush. But the Buckeyes were more than up to the task lighting up Brent Venables’ unit for 394 yards in the first half and 639 for the game.

Clemson (10-2) working without offensive coordinator Tony Elliott due to COVID-19 were unable to find a rhythm and keep pace with the streaking Buckeyes. Trevor Lawrence did produce moments of hope for the ACC Champions throwing for 400 yards and two scores but Buckeyes quarterback Justin Fields and running back Trey Sermon were even better. Fields completed 22 of 28 passes for six touchdowns and Sermon picked up 193 yards rushing and 61 yards receiving.

Click to skip ahead to see Billionaire David Abrams' Top 5 Stock Picks.

The value investing guru David Abrams is one of the most successful hedge fund managers over the last two decades thanks to his strategy of buying undervalued stocks and holding them over the years to maximize gains. After working ten years for Seth Klarman's investment firm Baupost Group he founded Abrams Capital Management in 1999 and he managed to outperform the broader market index with a 15% average return in the first fifteen years since inception.

The self-made billionaire who also made billions for his investors manages $10 billion of assets at present while the value of the 13F portfolio stands above $3 billion.

The hedge-fund manager David Abrams is one of the most admired value investors and he runs a concentrated stock portfolio. The billionaire likes to diversify investments towards foreign equity securities private and illiquid investments and debt.

He is a follower of Benjamin Graham's value investing approach. “I’ve observed a great many investors over the years and I’ve never seen a consistently successful one whose strategy was not based on a value approach—paying less for something than it is worth either today or in the future” David Abrams said.

The billionaire hedge fund manager's investment strategy also includes buying depressed companies with strong long-term fundamentals. This is clearly reflection in its strategy of buying half a million shares of TransDigm Group Incorporated early this year when aircraft components supplier was under pressure. The billionaire also added to his Facebook stake early this year in the wake of staying at home policies and increased his position in internet advertisement company Alphabet.

He also took a big stake in Energy Transfer Partners early this year and added to his existing position in the September quarter as shares of the energy storage and transportation partnership remained under pressure throughout this year due to pandemic related challenges.

At the same time the Boston-based hedge fund has also slashed its stake in drilling companies amid bleak future fundamentals.

While David Abrams' reputation remains intact the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 88 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

As Seth Klarman's protege continually re-evaluates investments based on the market conditions let’s start examining billionaire David Abrams' top 10 stock picks to see how he is seeking to outperform the markets.

10. Franklin Resources Inc. (NYSE:BEN)

The asset management holding company Franklin Resources Inc. (NYSE: BEN) is one of the long-running investments of billionaire David Abrams' 13F securities portfolio. Although the Boston-based hedge fund has reduced its position by 15% in the September quarter Franklin Resources is still the tenth largest stock holding of its portfolio.

Shares of Franklin Resources has been underperforming over the past five years amid sluggish financial numbers. Despite share price underperformance the company has extended its dividend growth strategy. It has raised its dividend every year since 1981.

9. AMERCO (NASDAQ: UHAL)

David Abrams has also been showing confidence in AMERCO (NASDAQ: UHAL) over the years. Abrams Capital Management has significantly raised its position in truck renting service several times since first initiating a position in 2016. It is the ninth-largest stock holding of Abrams hedge fund accounting for 6.35% of the overall portfolio.

Shares of AMERCO rallied sharply during the second half of 2020 after making a range-bound movement in the past four years. The latest share price gains are backed by robust year over year revenue growth of 14.8% in the latest quarter. Moreover AMERCO’s earnings per share came in at $13.58 in the September quarter up almost 90% from the year-ago period. Instead of investing all the profits back into the business the company returns cash to investors in the form of big special cash dividends.

8. Asbury Automotive Group Inc. (NYSE: ABG)

Automotive retailer Asbury Automotive Group Inc. (NYSE: ABG) is one of the favorite stocks of David Abrams’ hedge fund. The firm has been holding a stake in Asbury Automotive since 2017 and it currently accounts for 6.56% of the overall 13F portfolio. Boston based hedge fund is holding 2.1 million shares of Asbury Automotive valued at $206 million.

It appears that David Abrams has benefited from its Asbury position because shares of the Automotive retailer rallied 22% in the last twelve months extending the five years gains to 100%.

Other hedge funds are also showing interest in Asbury Automotive Group. It was in 24 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of June down slightly from an all-time high of 33.

Meanwhile Diamond Hill Capital is bearish about the future fundamentals of Asbury Automotive. Here is what Diamond Hill Capital stated about Asbury Automotive Group in an investors letter:

“Car dealer Asbury Automotive Group Inc. recently agreed to purchase a dealership in Dallas Texas to improve its poor new vehicle mix and geographic exposure; however the deal fell through because the business needs cash to survive the impact of the coronavirus. We believe the core Asbury business is weak (although well run) and that the slowdown in sales from the coronavirus will have a long-term impact on the business.”

7. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL)

Abrams Capital Management looks bullish over the largest advertising services platform Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL). The firm has been holding a position in Alphabet since 2018 and it currently represents the seventh-largest stock holding in its 13F portfolio.

Shares of Google rallied almost 29% in 2020 accelerating five years gains to 120%. Besides David Abrams the largest advertising platform is one of the favorite stock picks of other hedge funds. The Alphabet was in 150 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of September compared to the previous all-time high of 148.

Baron Opportunity Fund which returned 17.9% in Q3 2020 is among the bulls who expect Alphabet to outperform the broader market index in the quarter ahead. Here is what Baron Opportunity Fund stated in an investors letter:

“Considering solid Fund inflows we added to long-term holding Alphabet Inc. to maintain its weighting in the portfolio. Alphabet is the parent company of Google the world’s largest search and online advertising company. We increased our position in Alphabet this quarter as a protracted COVID-19-related recovery in travel and brand advertising presented an attractive buying opportunity. We are encouraged by improving trends in both search and YouTube driven by durable tailwinds to e-commerce and local advertising as well as the continued shift of video advertising dollars away from linear television as consumers increasingly cut the cable TV cord. We believe Google is becoming slightly more disciplined in capital allocation than it has been historically. Lastly Google Cloud which this quarter achieved a $12 billion revenue run rate under the leadership of Thomas Kurian is having increasing success competing with larger vendors due to its strengths in security open-source and data analytics.”

6. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE: TEVA)

The pharmaceutical company Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE: TEVA) is the fifth-largest stock holding of Abrams Capital accounting for 6.89% of the 13F portfolio. The firm first initiated a position in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries during the third quarter of 2017.

Shares of Teva Pharmaceutical underperformed over the past couple of years amid declining revenue and widening losses.

Hedge funds are showing low interest in Teva. It was in 33 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of the third quarter of 2020 down sharply from the all-time high of 81.

Miller Value Partners recently commented about the reasons behind Teva’s underperformance in an investor’s letter. Here is what Miller Value Partner said:

“Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) declined 26.9% during the quarter as the market continues to be concerned on opioid liabilities as well as price fixing lawsuits. The company report 2Q results with total revenue of $3.87B below consensus of $4.024B but reiterated 2020 company guidance of $16.6-17B (consensus of $17.041B). The company reported 2Q Adjusted EBITDA of $1.108B versus $1.099B expected and reiterated 2020 Adjusted EBITDA of $4.5-4.9B ($4.637B consensus) and adjusted EPS of $2.30-2.55 ($2.53 consensus) and Free Cash Flow of $1.8-2.2B. The company was hit after the US Department of Justice alleged in a lawsuit that TEVA provided illegal copays from 2006-2015 on a drug to treat MS. The allegation is $300mm of false claims which TEVA would be liable for 3x that in potential damages if they were to lose in court.”

Can you use ethernet with your Chromecast with Google TV?

While wireless internet is super convenient it isn't always the most stable and that may lead you to wonder does the Chromecast with Google TV support ethernet. I mean there's almost nothing worse than being right in the middle of an epic scene in your favorite movie only to have it buffer because of a poor connection.

One solution to bad wireless connectivity is to be sure you are using one of the best Wi-Fi routers the other is to go with the tried and true ethernet cable. However while the Chromecast with Google TV supports ethernet it doesn't have a port to plug a cable into. So to get your streaming device wired up you'll need to purchase an accessory. Not to worry Google has made an adapter specifically for the Chromecast with Google TV that is simple to use so you can get back to streaming in no time.

Google's adapter has the USB-C cable that goes to the Chromecast with Google TV attached with the ethernet port right on top of the wall plug for easy access. This adapter is rated for fast speeds of 10/100 Mbps so if your internet provider offers internet capable of 4K streaming you'll be able to plug into it directly. Just be sure that your TV is 4K ready as well.

Another option to get ethernet connectivity to your Chromecast with Google TV is to use a USB-C hub from a third-party that supports ethernet. Going this route can be beneficial if you are looking to expand the ports on your streaming device. Aside from only plugging in an ethernet cable you'll also be able to plug in things like a USB flash drive or an SD card with media on them to watch on your Chromecast with Google TV.

It's great to have options in how your dongle can get online. Regardless of whether you go wireless or plug in an ethernet cable you'll be able to watch all of your favorite content with ease through the Chromecast with Google TV.

On Monday the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued rules that will allow small drones to fly over people and at night in the United States and mandate remote identification technology for nearly all drones.

The rules eliminate requirements that drones known formally as unmanned aerial vehicles be connected to the internet to transmit location data but requires them to broadcast remote ID messages via radio frequency broadcast.

“This approach creates barriers to compliance and will have unintended negative privacy impacts for businesses and consumers” Wing said Thursday in a blog post adding “an observer tracking a drone can infer sensitive information about specific users including where they visit spend time and live and where customers receive packages from and when.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9yb2NrZXRzLXN0YXItamFtZXMtaGFyZGVuLW1pc3Nlcy0yMTQ1NDU3MjkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rockets star James Harden misses game vs. Kings with ankle sprain,"Houston Rockets star James Harden was a late scratch for Saturday’s game versus the Sacramento Kings due to a sprained right ankle.

Harden who is again leading the NBA in scoring tihs season with a 37.0 points per game averaged turned the ankle late in Thursday’s game versus Sacramento. “The Beard” did stay in to finish out the victory but he was clearly in some discomfort when it happened.

Prior to Saturday’s rematch with the Kings Harden took the unusual step (for him) of going out early on the Toyota Center court to warm up. Typically Harden is one of the last Houston players to go through his pregame shooting routine. It appears the change was done to test the ankle and apparently it didn’t respond as he and/or the team had hoped.

Rockets head coach Stephen Silas will update Harden’s status following the game. With Harden out Eric Gordon started at shooting guard alongside John Wall Danuel House Jr. PJ Tucker and Christian Wood.

At the same time the Boston-based hedge fund has also slashed its stake in drilling companies amid bleak future fundamentals.

While David Abrams' reputation remains intact the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 88 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

As Seth Klarman's protege continually re-evaluates investments based on the market conditions let’s start examining billionaire David Abrams' top 10 stock picks to see how he is seeking to outperform the markets.

10. Franklin Resources Inc. (NYSE:BEN)

The asset management holding company Franklin Resources Inc. (NYSE: BEN) is one of the long-running investments of billionaire David Abrams' 13F securities portfolio. Although the Boston-based hedge fund has reduced its position by 15% in the September quarter Franklin Resources is still the tenth largest stock holding of its portfolio.

Shares of Franklin Resources has been underperforming over the past five years amid sluggish financial numbers. Despite share price underperformance the company has extended its dividend growth strategy. It has raised its dividend every year since 1981.

9. AMERCO (NASDAQ: UHAL)

David Abrams has also been showing confidence in AMERCO (NASDAQ: UHAL) over the years. Abrams Capital Management has significantly raised its position in truck renting service several times since first initiating a position in 2016. It is the ninth-largest stock holding of Abrams hedge fund accounting for 6.35% of the overall portfolio.

Shares of AMERCO rallied sharply during the second half of 2020 after making a range-bound movement in the past four years. The latest share price gains are backed by robust year over year revenue growth of 14.8% in the latest quarter. Moreover AMERCO’s earnings per share came in at $13.58 in the September quarter up almost 90% from the year-ago period. Instead of investing all the profits back into the business the company returns cash to investors in the form of big special cash dividends.

8. Asbury Automotive Group Inc. (NYSE: ABG)

Automotive retailer Asbury Automotive Group Inc. (NYSE: ABG) is one of the favorite stocks of David Abrams’ hedge fund. The firm has been holding a stake in Asbury Automotive since 2017 and it currently accounts for 6.56% of the overall 13F portfolio. Boston based hedge fund is holding 2.1 million shares of Asbury Automotive valued at $206 million.

It appears that David Abrams has benefited from its Asbury position because shares of the Automotive retailer rallied 22% in the last twelve months extending the five years gains to 100%.

Other hedge funds are also showing interest in Asbury Automotive Group. It was in 24 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of June down slightly from an all-time high of 33.

Meanwhile Diamond Hill Capital is bearish about the future fundamentals of Asbury Automotive. Here is what Diamond Hill Capital stated about Asbury Automotive Group in an investors letter:

“Car dealer Asbury Automotive Group Inc. recently agreed to purchase a dealership in Dallas Texas to improve its poor new vehicle mix and geographic exposure; however the deal fell through because the business needs cash to survive the impact of the coronavirus. We believe the core Asbury business is weak (although well run) and that the slowdown in sales from the coronavirus will have a long-term impact on the business.”

7. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL)

Abrams Capital Management looks bullish over the largest advertising services platform Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL). The firm has been holding a position in Alphabet since 2018 and it currently represents the seventh-largest stock holding in its 13F portfolio.

Shares of Google rallied almost 29% in 2020 accelerating five years gains to 120%. Besides David Abrams the largest advertising platform is one of the favorite stock picks of other hedge funds. The Alphabet was in 150 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of September compared to the previous all-time high of 148.

Baron Opportunity Fund which returned 17.9% in Q3 2020 is among the bulls who expect Alphabet to outperform the broader market index in the quarter ahead. Here is what Baron Opportunity Fund stated in an investors letter:

“Considering solid Fund inflows we added to long-term holding Alphabet Inc. to maintain its weighting in the portfolio. Alphabet is the parent company of Google the world’s largest search and online advertising company. We increased our position in Alphabet this quarter as a protracted COVID-19-related recovery in travel and brand advertising presented an attractive buying opportunity. We are encouraged by improving trends in both search and YouTube driven by durable tailwinds to e-commerce and local advertising as well as the continued shift of video advertising dollars away from linear television as consumers increasingly cut the cable TV cord. We believe Google is becoming slightly more disciplined in capital allocation than it has been historically. Lastly Google Cloud which this quarter achieved a $12 billion revenue run rate under the leadership of Thomas Kurian is having increasing success competing with larger vendors due to its strengths in security open-source and data analytics.”

6. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE: TEVA)

The pharmaceutical company Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE: TEVA) is the fifth-largest stock holding of Abrams Capital accounting for 6.89% of the 13F portfolio. The firm first initiated a position in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries during the third quarter of 2017.

Shares of Teva Pharmaceutical underperformed over the past couple of years amid declining revenue and widening losses.

Hedge funds are showing low interest in Teva. It was in 33 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of the third quarter of 2020 down sharply from the all-time high of 81.

Miller Value Partners recently commented about the reasons behind Teva’s underperformance in an investor’s letter. Here is what Miller Value Partner said:

“Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) declined 26.9% during the quarter as the market continues to be concerned on opioid liabilities as well as price fixing lawsuits. The company report 2Q results with total revenue of $3.87B below consensus of $4.024B but reiterated 2020 company guidance of $16.6-17B (consensus of $17.041B). The company reported 2Q Adjusted EBITDA of $1.108B versus $1.099B expected and reiterated 2020 Adjusted EBITDA of $4.5-4.9B ($4.637B consensus) and adjusted EPS of $2.30-2.55 ($2.53 consensus) and Free Cash Flow of $1.8-2.2B. The company was hit after the US Department of Justice alleged in a lawsuit that TEVA provided illegal copays from 2006-2015 on a drug to treat MS. The allegation is $300mm of false claims which TEVA would be liable for 3x that in potential damages if they were to lose in court.”

Can you use ethernet with your Chromecast with Google TV?

While wireless internet is super convenient it isn't always the most stable and that may lead you to wonder does the Chromecast with Google TV support ethernet. I mean there's almost nothing worse than being right in the middle of an epic scene in your favorite movie only to have it buffer because of a poor connection.

One solution to bad wireless connectivity is to be sure you are using one of the best Wi-Fi routers the other is to go with the tried and true ethernet cable. However while the Chromecast with Google TV supports ethernet it doesn't have a port to plug a cable into. So to get your streaming device wired up you'll need to purchase an accessory. Not to worry Google has made an adapter specifically for the Chromecast with Google TV that is simple to use so you can get back to streaming in no time.

Google's adapter has the USB-C cable that goes to the Chromecast with Google TV attached with the ethernet port right on top of the wall plug for easy access. This adapter is rated for fast speeds of 10/100 Mbps so if your internet provider offers internet capable of 4K streaming you'll be able to plug into it directly. Just be sure that your TV is 4K ready as well.

Another option to get ethernet connectivity to your Chromecast with Google TV is to use a USB-C hub from a third-party that supports ethernet. Going this route can be beneficial if you are looking to expand the ports on your streaming device. Aside from only plugging in an ethernet cable you'll also be able to plug in things like a USB flash drive or an SD card with media on them to watch on your Chromecast with Google TV.

It's great to have options in how your dongle can get online. Regardless of whether you go wireless or plug in an ethernet cable you'll be able to watch all of your favorite content with ease through the Chromecast with Google TV.

On Monday the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued rules that will allow small drones to fly over people and at night in the United States and mandate remote identification technology for nearly all drones.

The rules eliminate requirements that drones known formally as unmanned aerial vehicles be connected to the internet to transmit location data but requires them to broadcast remote ID messages via radio frequency broadcast.

“This approach creates barriers to compliance and will have unintended negative privacy impacts for businesses and consumers” Wing said Thursday in a blog post adding “an observer tracking a drone can infer sensitive information about specific users including where they visit spend time and live and where customers receive packages from and when.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9yb2NrZXRzLXN0YXItamFtZXMtaGFyZGVuLW1pc3Nlcy0yMTQ1NDU3MjkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rockets star James Harden misses game vs. Kings with ankle sprain,"Houston Rockets star James Harden was a late scratch for Saturday’s game versus the Sacramento Kings due to a sprained right ankle.

Harden who is again leading the NBA in scoring tihs season with a 37.0 points per game averaged turned the ankle late in Thursday’s game versus Sacramento. “The Beard” did stay in to finish out the victory but he was clearly in some discomfort when it happened.

Prior to Saturday’s rematch with the Kings Harden took the unusual step (for him) of going out early on the Toyota Center court to warm up. Typically Harden is one of the last Houston players to go through his pregame shooting routine. It appears the change was done to test the ankle and apparently it didn’t respond as he and/or the team had hoped.

Rockets head coach Stephen Silas will update Harden’s status following the game. With Harden out Eric Gordon started at shooting guard alongside John Wall Danuel House Jr. PJ Tucker and Christian Wood.

Yet in 2021 more than two-thirds of its third-party sellers are men. The proportion of sellers who identify as women is now slightly higher than 2020’s 26% figure but still marks an interesting gap in gender representation on Amazon.

That got us thinking—what other variances exist between the genders with regard to selling on Amazon?

We surveyed thousands of Amazon sellers to identify those differences.

Here are a few key discoveries:

Men tend to sell on Amazon at a younger age than women

Women spend less time and money than men launching their Amazon businesses

Men are more likely to view their Amazon business as a hobby

Women follow Amazon’s rules and guidelines more closely

Women and men are optimistic about the future of selling on Amazon but more men than women would recommend selling to others

We also gained insights into the following:

How sellers invest time and money into their Amazon businesses

Their experience with Amazon and e-commerce

Their preferred selling methods and product categories

What they think of Amazon

Note: For a complete picture of the profile of an Amazon seller check out our report on Amazon seller demographics in 2021.

Only 32% of Amazon’s sellers are women

Despite the fact that selling on Amazon is open to anyone regardless of gender the seller community is primarily made up of men.

Nearly two-thirds of Amazon sellers (64%) identify as ‘Male’. On the other hand just over one third (32%) identify as ‘Female’ while 6% of sellers identify as ‘Other’.

Men start selling on Amazon younger

Though there are men and women of all ages currently selling on Amazon there are distinct differences in behaviors between these two genders across age groups.

Men tend to start their Amazon businesses at a younger age than women with 19% of men launching on Amazon between ages 18 and 35. On the other hand only 13% of women began selling in that age range

Men also have greater representation among sellers aged 35 to 54: this age group is 33% male and only 18% female

By their late 50s and 60s the number of women and men first starting out on Amazon evens out. 10% of women and 9% of men say they started selling on Amazon between the ages of 55 and 64

Women spend less time and money launching their Amazon businesses

From finding a product to launching their first active listing on Amazon women spend less time getting their Amazon businesses up and running than men do. They also spend less time maintaining their listings each week once they’re live and are more likely than men to work only on their Amazon businesses.

Time investments in Amazon and other employment

Women get their Amazon businesses up and running faster: within six weeks of launching 41% of women had listed their first product versus 33% of men

Women also turn a profit sooner: 26% became profitable after just 3 months versus 18% of men

60% of women were successful in their first product launch versus 52% of men

Women spend less time each week managing their Amazon businesses: 16% of women and 12% of men spend fewer than four hours per week while 22% of women and 25% of men spend over 30 hours a week

More men than women work full-time jobs outside of the home in addition to selling on Amazon (41% of men versus 27% of women)

A quarter of female Amazon sellers work exclusively on their Amazon businesses versus 22% of male sellers. Furthermore 27% of women surveyed say they’re self-employed outside of Amazon versus 22% of men

Financial investments

Women tend to spend less to start their Amazon businesses.

34% of women spent less than $1000 to get up and running on Amazon versus 25% of men

36% of men spent more than $5000 to launch their Amazon business versus 31% of women

Monthly and lifetime sales

Over a quarter of both men and women report average monthly sales of over $25000

However slightly more women than men report monthly sales below $1000 (29% of women versus 26% of men)

Curiously women are slightly stronger than men in terms of total lifetime sales. This could be explained by the fact that there are more women than men who have been selling on Amazon for over three years (56% of women versus 51% of men).

Profitability

Women report slightly higher profit margins than men: 35% of women achieve profit margins between 21-50% versus 30% of men

While there relatively few sellers with $1 million or more in lifetime profits more women achieve this (8% of female sellers) than men (5% of male sellers)

Men are more likely to view their Amazon business as a hobby

An Amazon business represents many sellers’ first foray into online entrepreneurship though women tend to take selling more seriously.

60% of men and 56% of women said selling on Amazon is their first experience as a web entrepreneur

8% of women consider selling on Amazon to be a hobby as opposed to 10% of men

Women are more likely than men to say they started selling on Amazon out of a desire to earn more income feel successful tackle a challenge and gain the flexibility to travel or work remotely

Men prefer selling private label products on Amazon

Selling private label items on Amazon requires a bigger investment up front particularly when compared to retail and online arbitrage.

For that reason and the fact that 23% of women reported started their Amazon businesses with less than $500 the following statistics are unsurprising:

75% of men and 56% of women sell private label products

Women use the online and retail arbitrage (OA and RA) business models more than men do: 46% of women versus 35% of men

Women follow Amazon’s rules and guidelines more than men

Though the Amazon marketplace is extremely competitive for sellers only 6% of women have engaged in sales-boosting strategies that violate Amazon’s Terms of Service otherwise known as black hat tactics. 12% of men on the other hand have used black hat tactics to get ahead.

Women and men sell in varying categories

Categories with significantly higher numbers of male sellers than female sellers include Electronics Automotive Parts and Tools & Home Improvement.

Here are the categories showing the highest differential between women and men:

Electronics: 17% of men and 10% of women sell in this category

Automotive Parts: 10% of men 6% of women

Grocery & Gourmet Food : 11% of men 20% of women

In 2017 Amazon bought the grocer for $13.7 billion.

After nearly four decades of being the big boss Mackey still CEO of Whole Foods said he is often asked what's it's like to now work for someone — namely Jeff Bezos. ""People had this wrong stereotype that the CEO is like a god or something"" Mackey told Freakonomics Radio host Stephen Dubner in a podcast released Nov. 4.

But that's not true according to Mackey.

""It hasn't been as big a switch as you'd think"" he said on Freakonomics Radio. To ask what it's like to finally have a boss is to ""completely misunderstands the way most corporations operate"" Mackey said.

""I mean I've always had a boss. I always reported to the board of directors at Whole Foods.""

In addition Mackey said he has tried to be a servant leader which means he has been ""serving the higher purpose of the company"" in addition to its stakeholders.

And logistically Mackey said Whole Foods has retained some amount of autonomy even after being acquired.

""Whole Foods has changed and evolved to be sure but in a respectful way. I always use this analogy when you get married do you change?"" Mackey said to Dubner. ""And the answer is 'Duh if you don't change you're going to get a divorce.' So Whole Foods is changing not because Amazon's cramming a bunch of things down our throat but because they do a lot of things that we want to take in.""

For instance Whole Foods didn't track its ""shrink"" — goods lost to a combination of spoilage shoplifting and employee theft — before the Amazon acquisition but does now Mackey says. Amazon also put into place things like Amazon lockers in stores and discounts for Prime members.

But according to Bloomberg two years after the acquisition the Whole Foods shopping experience remained mostly unchanged. ""[T]here have been few glimpses of new ideas that Amazon could bring to supermarket shopping""

For employees of Whole Foods however conditions have ""become noticeably worse"" since the Amazon acquisition as reported by the food industry website Eater and health insurance benefits for part-time employees were cut. A Whole Foods spokesperson told Eater of the benefits reduction that it affected only a small percentage of total workforce the move was made ""to better meet the needs of our business and create a more equitable and efficient scheduling mode"" and that those who were affected would receive ""resources to find alternative health care coverage options"" or can ""explore full-time health care-eligible positions.""

From the executive level however the transition was more copacetic Mackey says and that's partly because Whole Foods had previously acquired other companies.

""I understand well what you're looking for with the company that's coming in"" Mackey tells Dubner. ""And mostly you're looking for the acquired company to be excited to be part of the larger firm to start talking in the 'we' language instead of the 'us/them' language to figure out what the acquiring company wants and then try to make sure that you help give it to them.""

Construction on the $100 million to $120 million building the largest in the city and thought to be the biggest in North Dakota will continue throughout the winter. It's been a blessing for many construction workers especially during the tough pandemic year of 2020 according to Jason Ehlert president of the North Dakota Building Trades Unions.

He said as many as 300 union workers will be on site at peak times when steel and roof work begins joining those pouring concrete and doing electrical work. Off and on in recent months there have been 50 to 100 workers on site.

Ehlert said the main contractor Ryan Companies of Minneapolis has also hired many local workers and sub-contractors to help with the project on 110 acres of land north of Hector International Airport and east of Interstate 29.

He said crews are currently doing what the industry calls a ""tip up"" of the pre-cast concrete walls and that will be followed by steel and iron work. Once the roof is in place the concrete will be poured inside the building.

Concrete can be poured at almost any temperature now Ehlert said due to the advances in technology and the chemicals used. He said the ground is heated and then after the pouring it's covered until it cures.

Amazon is planning to enclose the building first he said and pour the interior concrete with the exterior work to be done starting in the spring.

Amazon doesn't verify any construction updates and won't in the future said public relations spokeswoman Samantha Fernandez.

That is in step with how the company didn't officially announce its project until Oct. 30 more than two months after work started on the site and permits and zoning were approved by the Fargo City Commission without the naming of the company involved. That simply led to speculation before the official announcement was made.

Fernandez added though that the company is ""very much looking forward to opening their first fulfillment center in North Dakota next year and creating 500 full-time jobs.""

Workers at the center will pack and ship large customer purchases such as sports equipment patio furniture fishing rods pet food kayaks bicycles and other household goods. The company said it delivers a wide variety of products including from more than 2000 small and medium-sized businesses and independent authors in North Dakota.

The company will start looking for workers in the spring or early summer said City Strategic Planner Jim Gilmour who worked with the company on the issues involved in starting the project. He said they obviously can't wait until the center opens to hire that many workers.

The city is calling the Amazon facility ""Project Force.""

The company said in an earlier statement that it will be offering an industry-leading minimum starting wage of $15 per hour with full-time employees receiving medical vision and dental insurance and a 401(k) with 50 percent company match starting on the first day of employment. The company also offers up to 20 weeks of maternal and parental paid leave and programs giving new parents flexibility in scheduling. They also offer a program that provides 95% of tuition for courses related to in-demand fields.

The two-story 40-foot-high building will be larger than Fargo's West Acres Regional Shopping Center which is about 900000 square feet and the Case IH manufacturing facility which is around 660000 square feet. A building permit indicates the Amazon facility will have 52 exits and 15 bathrooms.

A larger facility is planned for Sioux Falls although its facility isn't scheduled to open until 2022.

By John Goglia / Chicago Tribune

The ungrounding of Boeing’s 737 Max is undoubtedly a major milestone for an aircraft with a sordid history: responsible for two crashes that resulted in the deaths of 346 people which then exposed a deeply troubling relationship between the company and Federal Aviation Administration regulators who were supposed to oversee it.

While it appears that Boeing has met all the criteria laid out by the FAA and other authorities that participated in the review of the Max now getting people back on the airplane becomes the bigger problem.

The airlines will be implementing all sorts of measures to convince people that the airplane is safe to fly such as test flights with executives waiving change fees or even eliminating the Max branding. They have learned from the aftermath of other aviation disasters that aggressive communication that is open honest and discusses their problems and solutions goes a long way toward rebuilding confidence.

But the airlines cannot do this alone and they are not going to be successful if Boeing and FAA continue to resist providing more transparency on their decision-making which has been requested from groups ranging from pilots’ unions lawmakers and the family members of those who died in the two Max crashes.

In 1979 the FAA grounded the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 after a crash — largely caused by flawed maintenance procedures — led to the deaths of 271 people. Once the ban was lifted after 37 days the plane was quickly reembraced by carriers and passengers.

Boeing today faces a much steeper uphill climb. First the plane was grounded for 21 months and more time only breeds more concern about the safety and viability of the aircraft. But more importantly in 1979 the FAA had the full credibility with the U.S. traveling public and foreign regulatory authorities. Today its image is tarnished and it is no longer considered the gold standard. The House Transportation Committee delivered a blunt assessment: “Boeing failed in its design and development of the Max and the FAA failed in its oversight of Boeing and its certification of the aircraft.”

Ultimately the traveling public will not just willingly accept what the FAA says; one report from last year found that 40 percent of regular flyers would be unwilling to fly on the Max. This leaves it to Boeing to do what airlines have done for years after their accidents — work with key stakeholders such as outside experts and the families of victims — to show an extreme level of transparency about the changes it made to the Max and the supporting data behind them to regain travelers’ trust. This can be accomplished in several ways.

First Boeing should release data regarding the changes made to the airplane that support its safety. This does not mean releasing information such as software code or other proprietary information. What would be useful is simulator and flight test data to demonstrate how the “new” Max operates in certain scenarios and pilot reaction times during such situations. The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association recently submitted comments to the FAA calling the Max’s new emergency checklists “clunky at best” which does not inspire confidence in the safety of the redesigned plane.

Second the public needs an update on the still unfinished Ethiopian Airlines investigation which was the second Max crash in March 2019. Boeing and regulators have claimed they are unable to release certain documents until it is completed; however it raises the question as to why the plane should be ungrounded if an investigation is still pending. If there is no ongoing investigative activity which seems the case all documents relating to it should be released.

Third outside of technical data the FAA should disclose what assurances Boeing has provided concerning safety culture changes they both desperately need to ensure this situation never occurs again. It has been reported that Boeing engineers were fearful of speaking out on safety concerns while others inside the company were completely dismissive of the FAA (stating they were “like dogs watching TV”).

The FAA needs to reassert its authority in overseeing the industry and the industry is hopefully using this moment to be introspective about its own failings. Moreover the Government Accountability Office and the Department of Transportation’s inspector general need to ensure that the FAA fulfills its mission of overseeing the industry rather than being captured by it.

After two crashes the public is right to be skeptical of Boeing and the FAA. Under these unique circumstances more transparency and disclosure is necessary so technical experts engineers and safety advocates (as well as the public) can fully assess the fix and be confident it is safe for return to flight.

Only when this occurs will Boeing’s commercial customers embrace the Max and passengers not hesitate before boarding a plane that hopefully has better and safer days ahead.

During his almost half-century-long career he would design the legendary New York City subway map modernist furniture iconic kitchenware logos books and so much more. But despite these inherently creative projects Vignelli would never call himself an artist. He was famously quoted saying “Design is not art. Design is utilitarian art is not.”

This quote ultimately reveals Vignelli’s belief that all problems have a clear solution that could be found using logic. These problems—such as what logo best defines a company—were not artistic in nature. It required one to strip down complicated ideas into simpler concepts until the solution became clear.

After hearing such a strict description those unfamiliar with Vignelli’s work may imagine results that lack color or joy. But a logical design process does not mean a boring one. Vignelli simply believed that beautiful design meant understanding human nature and maximizing the efficiency of function in such a way that the work excited anyone who encountered it.

Vignelli founded Vignelli Designs with his wife Lella—another modernist designer who specialized in jewelry making. Under the firm’s name the couple designed iconography that is still familiar today including the identity of famous brands such as Bloomingdales and American Airlines. Vignelli completed all of this work under the belief that people deserved good design—and he was convinced that good design was pure with no meaningless decoration.

He believed that his life like the life of all designers was “a fight against the ugliness.” Read on to learn more about some of Vignelli's most famous projects and the legacy he leaves behind after his death in 2014.

Vignelli and American Airlines

Vignelli intensely disliked “marketing people.” He often complained that young businesspeople did not understand the beauty of crafting an identity and that they often added meaningless “vulgarity.” He thought that some business people did not give clients proper respect. They instead added decoration through an additive process—where meaningless pictures and colors were added with little critical thought. Instead Vignelli believed in a subtractive process. Remove lines until you have found the core elements or form of the concept—and hence the solution.

“You can reach timelessness if you look for the essence of things and not the appearance. The appearance is transitory—the appearance is fashion the appearance is trendiness—but the essence is timeless.”

When the Vignellis designed the American Airlines logo under the name Unimark International they simplified the design into its basic forms. They used a simple sans serif font and two basic colors. The American eagle was simplified to a based X-shape that divided the letters. To Vignelli this logo symbolized that American Airlines was an honest company no-frills and no-nonsense—just good service.

American Airlines would later rebrand after 45 years of using this logo. Vignelli responded with a break-down of the new design demonstrating its meaninglessness that came from ignoring important design rules. For example the new design included 11 stripes though the flag has 13. He reminded people that this was a constant problem that designers had to face—that folks were fickle and constantly rebranded for attention instead of using an honest design that did not add useless visual noise.

It is also important to note that the Vignelli American Airlines logo is so iconic because it utilized the font that the designer helped turn into the design staple that it is today: Helvetica.

Helvetica on the Rise Thanks to Vignelli

Among his many other claims to fame Vignelli is known as one of the people who popularized the font Helvetica. He used it in his designs extensively and towards the end of his career it was one of only four fonts that the firm Vignelli Associates ever used. The others were Garamond Bodoni and Century Expanded.

Vignelli explained the font’s flexibility by describing its ability to express love. “You can say ‘I love you’ in Helvetica. And you can say it with Helvetica Extra Light if you want to be really fancy. Or you can say it with the Extra Bold if it’s really intensive and passionate you know and it might work.”

One of the most obvious embodiments of Vignelli’s legacy can be found all over New York City in the signs and branding of the NYC Subway system—and all written in Helvetica.

Untangling the NYC Subway

Vignelli believed that the subway map was essentially two components— lines which symbolized the direction trains were going in and dots which symbolized the stops along those routes. He believed everything else was unnecessary visual complexity. Why did travelers need to see every single twist and turn that the train would take?

Vignelli’s map “untangled” the jumble of the NYC subway and has become the permanent branding of the system. The simple colored dots are deeply engrained in everyone who lives in and visits the city today. Unfortunately New York replaced the map but some of his logic still remains in the current version and the consolidated signage and dot system are still in use.

“Good design is a matter of discipline. It starts by looking at the problem and collecting all the available information about it. If you understand the problem you have the solution. It’s really more about logic than imagination” he says. The NYC Subway map is the perfect example of how Vignelli believed in logical solutions that pushed the boundary of simplicity.

Product Design by the Vignellis

Massimo and Lella worked together on many industrial and product design projects. One of their most famous works is the Heller Vignelli kitchenware set especially the famous mugs. These products adhered to traditional modernist ideals with a focus on simplicity and logic.

The mugs were designed so that the handle bent to create a place for your thumb. Though popular in Europe the cups ran into some cultural issues in the U.S. as consumers complained that they tended to spillover through the handle. Vignelli explained that Europeans filled their cup halfway which is how he intended for them to be used. Americans filled their cup closer to the top leading to a leaking problem when the mugs were moved too quickly. These were later capped to prevent issues.

Despite the initial controversy the Heller Vignelli dish sets are a highly sought-after example of modernist kitchenware.

Books on Design

Vignelli's best-known design logic for books was a highly developed grid. He was quoted saying “a grid is like underwear you wear it but it’s not to be exposed.” Every page that he designed started with this grid even if many of the guidelines were not used on every page.

Many great design rule books have been written both by and about Vignelli. These include: The Vignelli Canon Vignelli From A to Z and Design: Vignelli

The Work Is the Reward

Artists and designers are often living proof of the idea that if you do what you love you’ll never work a day. Massimo and Lella undeniably loved the design practice that they dedicated their lives to. In an interview following their recognition of the 1982 Medal from the AIGA—Professional Association for Design—the couple was asked what motivates them to continue the work. Massimo fittingly responded: “The reward? Why the reward is to do all this!”

But a new innovation provides a juxtaposition to the image and serves as to what the city aspires for.

This time last year American Electric Power approached the city's parks department for a new partnership. Hoping to provide an electric car charging station between Columbus and Portsmouth AEP offered to reimburse the city for the equipment in return for a spot downtown.

""We are proud to partner with the city to add in new technology to the historic downtown"" said John Rhoads customer account manager for AEP. ""This provided the first electric vehicle charging station [by AEP] for 90 miles on Route 23.""

It all began back in 2018 when AEP developed a grant program to incentivize the charging stations. Most of them were spoken for but because some failed to submit their applications a place opened for Chillicothe.

Rhoads then contacted Clint Boggs with the Chillicothe Parks Department at the end of last year to see if the city would be interested in acquiring a station. Rhoads felt downtown Chillicothe served as an excellent location for the technology because of its location between two cities where other charging stations were already installed.

But the thriving atmosphere of downtown was another contributing factor to the partnership.

With the installation of the electric vehicle charging stations on East Water Street in the municipal parking lot adjacent to Cristy's Pizza residents and visitors can now park and charge their cars while shopping and dining locally.

As Chillicothe was Ohio's first capital it only made sense for AEP to partner with the city to allow it to become one of the first southern cities in the state to receive the eco-friendly technology.

From the partnership Chillicothe purchased two charging stations for around $25000 — to be reimbursed by AEP — that allow four cars to replenish at a time. The devices are considered level two (out of three) fast chargers. Every 60 minutes cars can be charged to go 20 miles and it takes about eight hours to reach a full charge.

At this time there is no cost to use this new service as Chillicothe City Council must first pass legislation approving the rates. Boggs estimates the fee will be a minimal amount of around $1.50 an hour. He regularly monitors the technology and can see how often the stations are used a day or in a month.

""We saw a growing need for charging stations in Chillicothe and people have really taken advantage of this"" Boggs said. ""We need a spot for our residents and visitors who use electronic vehicles to do so safely.""

While there may only be a dozen or so people using the electric vehicle charging stations right now by 2025 Rhoads and other experts believe that electronic cars will make up about 10% of all vehicle sales.

Boggs said the technology aides in downtown Chillicothe's resurgence — encouraging residents and guests to shop local. It also puts the city ahead by providing some of the latest eco-friendly technology to the community.

""Electronic vehicles are here and the technology is only expanding"" Rhoads said. Boggs added ""It's been exciting to see the growing interest in these.""

We associate nuclear reactors more often with disaster than innovation but as the United States takes more coal and gas plants offline engineers are hoping fresh reactor concepts could redeem nuclear’s stature in American energy. Bigger is no longer better. The future experts say looks like “multispeed” nuclear energy—a combination of traditional large plants and smaller safer megawatt reactors.

“Until now customers only had one choice for nuclear and that was a gigawatt-sized power plant” says Rita Baranwal the assistant secretary for Nuclear Energy at the Department of Energy. “Now we’re talking about reactors at the megawatt scale that can flexibly meet a customer’s energy needs as demand grows.”

Baranwal says megawatt reactors (one megawatt powers about 650 homes) will be cheaper to build and operate and could be sited anywhere in the world. A more context-sensitive localized nuclear power industry—in which small towns remote facilities and big cities find nuclear solutions tailored to their needs—could replace a large swath of fossil fuel power stations filling in the inert resource-sucking downtimes left by renewables.

Courtesy USNC Each USNC reactor has a graphite core that houses the fuel.

The tenets of nuclear reactor design can be traced back to Enrico Fermi’s original 1942 reactor at the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago. Fermi and the other engineers at Argonne proposed and designed many kinds of reactors like commercial boiling-water reactors and experimental research reactors says Katy Huff nuclear engineer and researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s nuclear plasma and radiological engineering (NPRE) program. Argonne spearheaded a creative boom in nuclear energy. “All these different reactors were conceived at the same time” Huff says. “At the beginning we were trying all of them.”

Not every reactor survived. Just as HD DVDs fell to Blu-ray so did experiments like the sodium reactor at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory and the gas-cooled Peach Bottom plant in Pennsylvania fall to the more commonplace light-water reactor. Even nuclear-reactor designs owe some success to chance convenience and market whim.

The ideal reactor by today’s standards emphasizes safety cost-​effectiveness and adaptability. Ever since engineer Richard Eckert of the New Jersey Public Service Electric & Gas Co. conceived of a floating nuclear plant in 1969—one that could be built off-site towed to its final destination and operated over water—there’s been a vein of thinking in nuclear that says smaller reactors are a suitable form of power for the future. That’s where tiny nuclear hopes to prove itself a competitive alternative to the massive nuclear power plants we know.

Generally tiny reactors have a few advantages over power plants. First they are more space-​efficient. A 2019 small modular reactor design from Oregon startup NuScale is about 1 percent the size of a traditional power plant’s containment chamber though it delivers 10 percent of a plant’s power output. And while traditional nuclear plants need a 10-mile safety buffer in every direction in case of a meltdown tiny reactors can operate in close quarters with much less risk. That’s the second major edge: safety. Some small reactor designs incorporate fully passive safety and risk-management systems that rely on the steady immutable laws of physics—like gravity or buoyancy—to perform safety functions rather than the actions of people or mechanical equipment. Finally there’s scalability. Many small reactors are designed with replicability in mind. If a community factory or city needs an extra boost of nuclear power they can just order another reactor.

NuScale is the most conservative of the small-nuclear programs trying to reach the market. Their reactor design is a traditional light-water reactor (see previous spread) but smaller simpler and—according to NuScale—more scalable. The design eliminates coolant pumps external steam generator vessels and other equipment found in existing plants so NuScale claims it’s cheaper to manufacture lower-risk for operators and easier to maintain.

The light-water design gives NuScale an edge in power among its tiny-reactor peers. While other companies are seeking approval for reactors that produce just a few megawatts of energy NuScale’s design reaches 60 megawatts. For comparison the smallest nuclear plant in the U.S. produces 600 megawatts yet it's 100 times the size of NuScale's power module.

NuScale’s reactor will seek to complement not replace a grid already dependent on renewables. During the day it can operate at 20 percent energy production to let the renewables do the work before cranking up to 100 percent at night while the rest of the grid is on solar downtime.

Courtesy USNC USNC’s reactor produces 15MW of thermal power and 5MW of electric power.

Katy Huff and UIUC are seeking approval to build their own tiny reactor based on designs from the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC) a company taking a more extreme approach than NuScale in an effort to push the field toward new standards of safety and more possible use cases. USNC’s proposed design is rooted in low energy density and low decay heat generation after shutdown which means less risk of a meltdown. The energy startup is mindful that volatility has doomed other nuclear efforts in the past. “Normal reactors are in the 20 to 40 watts per cubic centimeter power density” USNC's Lorenzo Venneri says. “We’re in the 1 to 3 [watts] per cubic centimeter power density.”

“Fuel for nuclear reactors was developed for nuclear submarines where demands are entirely different from demands of a power plant” founder Francesco Venneri—this is partly a Venneri family operation—says. “A submarine is like a high-velocity sports car: It needs to go up and down in power very quickly. That’s exactly the opposite of what a nuclear power plant should be for producing power.”

USNC’s reactor concept uses Fully Ceramic Micro-Encapsulated fuel (FCM) in which a ceramic-carbon and silicon-carbide composite coats granules of uranium oxide. The ceramic protects the grains of fuel but still conducts heat. When this fuel is used in a low power-density environment it creates a reactor that according to Venneri can’t melt down. Inside the reactor a feedback mechanism stops the reaction when it exceeds operating temperature so nothing can become hot enough to melt. This contrasts an established pattern in nuclear plant design Venneri says to “push the envelope and then build another envelope around it.”

Engineers like Venneri calculate risk as the product of probabilities and consequences. “We found out that trying to lower the probabilities is a losing game” he explains. “We want to try to keep the probabilities of adverse events low but at the same time make sure the consequences are zero.”

The California-based startup Oklo is taking risk prevention even further to the point where they’re eschewing America’s legacy of water-cooled reactors. Their advanced fission micro​reactor can use sodium as a coolant (among other methods) so it doesn't require water. The 1.5-megawatt plant Oklo says functions much like a battery in producing electrical power. It's self-contained and it can self-sustain for 20 years without refueling.

“The industry typically takes this incremental approach to things” says Jacob DeWitte Oklo cofounder and CEO. “But in our mind we have to do things more transformatively frankly for the planet’s sake.”

The Oklo reactor uses high-assay low-enriched uranium fuel (HALEU) to achieve greater efficiency and power-per-volume given its size. HALEU is enriched to between 5 and 20 percent of the isotope U-235—the isotope that when split produces heat in a nuclear reaction—compared to the 3 percent low-enriched uranium in a typical power plant. This potential groundbreaker has more legwork ahead for approval than its water-cooled cousins but Oklo is banking on its undemanding spatial and financial design. Its demonstration site at the Idaho National Laboratory spans just a quarter-acre. “We’re still fission but other than that we use different fuel different cooling different technology” says Oklo cofounder and COO Caroline Cochran.

If the current nuclear energy infrastructure were a circulatory system only the major veins and arteries would be pumping—those are the giant power plants. But tiny reactors can be like capillaries extending power to the extremities (small towns remote industry encampments tiny islands and specific city blocks) of the nuclear-​power body.

“If you look at current big reactors and where they’re being installed they’re going into countries that have a need to decarbonize” Westinghouse Electric Company CTO Ken Canavan says. Countries like China and Poland are “replacing multiple medium or large coal plants with single nuclear” he says and these countries have contexts where large nuclear plants are appropriate. “If you look at other countries that have smaller grids they don’t have the capacity to put on a big nuclear plant.” That’s where reactors like the one at NuScale—just 65 feet tall and 9 feet in diameter—can be of service.

Canavan does hedge however to say traditional reactor concepts could make a comeback after tiny nuclear hits retail. He says tiny nuclear might disrupt nuclear energy beyond what we can project today and in a future where more things will need electrical power (not the least of which will be your car) than ever a “multispeed” or “multidimension” nuclear energy market is likely to emerge. Here anyone wishing to replace a remote diesel microgrid can find a solution in nuclear or a combination of nuclear and renewables.

For now Oklo USNC and NuScale focus on small markets as their entry point because in the United States large plants are either aging out or are too stigmatized to be replaced. Finding common but untapped use cases for tiny nuclear like rural towns will be key to reinvigorating interest in nuclear power technology and finding ways to integrate nuclear alongside or into renewable-focused grids will be important to acclimating the world to nuclear. A 2020 University of Sussex study found that the development of large nuclear plants stanched wide portions of global renewable-energy development between 1990 and 2014 but another 2020 report on the near future of energy showed four separate scenarios that demonstrated runaway growth in renewables alongside modest growth of nuclear energy. We see these things as competitors; they could coexist.

By 2040 if these small reactor projects are successful we could see a selection of plant sizes technologies and types of locations enter the American energy landscape. “If you look at the way everything is going it’s about personalization” Canavan says. “What’s that worth to us? The capacity [small reactors] offer and the capability they provide is just irreplaceable.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMDIvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvcnVzc2lhbi1oYWNraW5nLWdvdmVybm1lbnQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Understanding of Russian Hacking Grows So Does Alarm (Published 2021),"On Election Day General Paul M.

“We’ve broadened our operations and feel very good where we’re at right now” he told journalists.

Eight weeks later General Nakasone and other American officials responsible for cybersecurity are now consumed by what they missed for at least nine months: a hacking now believed to have affected upward of 250 federal agencies and businesses that Russia aimed not at the election system but at the rest of the United States government and many large American corporations.

Three weeks after the intrusion came to light American officials are still trying to understand whether what the Russians pulled off was simply an espionage operation inside the systems of the American bureaucracy or something more sinister inserting “backdoor” access into government agencies major corporations the electric grid and laboratories developing and transporting new generations of nuclear weapons.

However I would suggest that truly game-changing innovations are also found in the collection of technologies that although perhaps less glamorous are nevertheless poised to revolutionize what has long bedeviled military operations: logistics.

Legendary World War II general Omar Bradley famously quipped that “amateurs talk strategy. Professionals talk logistics.” Today’s military leaders are increasingly concerned about sustaining forces in remote areas where re-supply could be difficult and dangerous. The permissive supply routes that have largely existed in the 21st century cannot be assumed in confrontations with hostile peer competitors.

For example countering China militarily will likely require the ability to disperse forces from large—and vulnerable—military bases to “small geographically diverse operating locations” scattered in the vastness of the Pacific. Similarly Russian ambitions in the Arctic may require the U.S. military to significantly boost its ability to operate in harsh Arctic areas with limited infrastructure and few resources. In short America’s ability to conduct distributed operations in a contested environment presents many difficulties particularly with respect to logistics.

So what are the possibilities for technology to address these logistical challenges? Let’s unpack a few.

Food

Can technology help obviate the challenge of keeping the troops fed at far-flung outposts? Actually yes. A number of initiatives may help mitigate this difficult problem.

A new program suggests that nutrition supplies might become significantly lighter and smaller—developments that could ease the logistics complications. Military.com’s headline about these efforts says much: “The Military Is Developing a ‘Close Combat Assault Ration’ Up to 40% Lighter than an MRE.”

The article explains that “[s]cientists are prototyping a “close combat assault ration” containing an assortment of nutrient-dense energy bars that may augment the standard-issue meals ready to eat — MREs — or even replace them.” Besides being lighter they are “extremely compact” – both are features that could facilitate transport to remote locations.

Another initiative reported by Brian Albright could not only improve the food experience for individual troops but also lessen waste—which is another way of reducing the logistics burden. It comes from Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center and the idea is to use 3D “food printers” to “allow soldiers to generate rations on site.” The experts believe this “would be much less costly than packaging and shipping food and eliminate waste.” (Emphasis added.).

Waste would be minimized if not eliminated because the troops could print “on demand” the food they wanted in the amount they wanted. Needless to say logistics are clearly aided when resources can be so efficiently used.

The ability of 3D printers to transform a range of ingredients into a variety of foods presents another advantage.

Specifically food technologist Lauren Oleksyk said “as troops move forward..a compact printer…would allow soldiers to print food on demand using ingredients that are provided to them or even that they could forage for….” Foraging in the local area for ingredients that could be transformed into food nutritious and palatable to troops would be a significant benefit.

Water

To me one of the toughest problems to solve is that of getting water to troops in remote locations. As a general rule a soldier can survive without water for only about three days. As you might imagine water has been key in a number of military operations throughout history.

In the historic Battle of Hattin in 1187 thirst played a major role in the Crusaders’ defeat to Saladin. Historians also believe that his troops’ thirst helped to wreck Napoleon’s campaign in Egypt and Syria.

However technology may help with this problem as well. A July 2020 article in Interesting Engineering says that a joint team of researchers from the U.S. Army and the University of Rochester “has created a ‘super-wicking’ anti-gravity aluminum panel that uses solar power to purify water.”

Interesting Engineering says the “system can cut down on contaminants such as dye urine heavy metals detergents and glycerin to a level that’s safe for drinking.” Accordingly it “would mean safe drinking water for the Army as it moves around in parts of the world where water isn’t safe to drink.”

That same month Energy reported that [s]cientists in South Korea have developed a solar-powered membrane to turn seawater or waste water into drinking water using solar power.” The article further notes unsurprisingly that it “is also being suggested that solar technology could be used to provide sources of drinking water at military bases.”

A related development was reported in the past few days. Military.com describes a new “briefcase-sized device that medics can use to transform even ‘ditch water’ into intravenous fluid — a life-saving battlefield necessity for treating wounded soldiers.” The manufacturer says:

“Without question this small device will dramatically reduce the Army’s logistical footprint of having to ship and store lactated Ringer’s solution which is the fluid of choice for resuscitation if blood is not available on the battlefield.”

There may be an even more dramatic technological innovation in the future: drawing water from the air—to include desert air.

In January 2020 Nextgov reported that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) launched the Atmospheric Water Extraction project because as program manager Seth Cohen said “[t]he demand for drinking water is a constant across all [Defense Department] missions and the risk cost and complexity that go into meeting that demand can quickly become force limiting factors.”

Consequently DARPA has issued a “solicitation to develop cutting-edge devices that troops can use to capture potable water straight from the atmosphere.”

Fuel

Militaries use vast amounts of fuel. In fact the U.S. military is the “world’s single largest consumer of oil.” Getting fuel to isolated locations can be extremely challenging considering a single gallon of gas weighs over six pounds. A 2008 article in Forbes illustrates the problem:

“An armored division of the Army can use as much as 600000 gallons of fuel a day. A tank like the M1 Abrams gets about .6 mpg and a cargo vehicle like the M-1070 semi-trailer (designed to haul tanks) gets approximately 1.2 mpg.”

Can technology help? Maybe. This past summer the Army reported it developed “a new advanced scientific model that will allow vehicle maintenance specialists to turn to bio-derived fuels in austere locations.” The Army says:

“With this solution the Army can reduce logistics costs associated with transporting and storing military fuel for military operations overseas. Instead the Army can convert biomass like wood logs into usable fuel when and where it’s needed or use any locally available fuels that have different specifications from the jet fuels in the United States.”

Furthermore the military may be able to obviate the need for fossil fuels by using electricity. Troops already use electricity for battlefield communications and computing but we may see electric vehicles as well. Though the technology is not yet advanced enough to support very heavy vehicles like tanks the panoply of lighter vehicles could benefit.

Where to get electrical power? Solar power arrays Reuters says are already being used at forward bases in Afghanistan to “power batteries for communications GPS and night-vision goggles.” According to Reuters “the solar panels not only reduced the need for convoys they allowed marines to shut off generators hushing operations and making them harder for enemies to detect.”

An energy source with much greater potential might be found in micro nuclear reactors that are mobile. An advocate points out that “America’s military has operated mobile nuclear power plants for over 60 years — at sea.” If employed on land “new mobile nuclear power plants would allow the Army to deploy a protected lethal force deep into territory far beyond resupply bases and ports.”

Though the use of these plants are not without critics last March the Pentagon awarded contracts to three teams “to each begin design work on a mobile nuclear reactor prototype under a Strategic Capabilities Office initiative called Project Pele.” Still if such reactors can be operated safely and effectively in operational settings on land they present an enormous opportunity to diminish the logistical complications the supply of fossil fuels occasions.

Remotely-stationed military forces may also someday draw solar power directly from satellites. CleanTechnica reported last week that “plans are in the works to harvest solar power in space and beam it down to you wherever you are any time any place any weather.”

CleanTechnica pointed to Caltlech’s Space Solar Project which contends:

“Collecting solar power in space and transmitting the energy wirelessly to Earth through microwaves enables terrestrial power availability unaffected by weather or time of day. Solar power could be continuously available anywhere on earth. “

Caltech says their “concept is based on the modular assembly of ultralight foldable 2D integrated elements” and this enables “further reducing weight and complexity.” Consequently they say their “concept enables scalability and mitigates local element failure impact on other parts of the system.”

Given the obvious military utility of such a capability it isn’t surprising that CleanTechnica says that the Naval Research Laboratory has been working on aspects of this possibility since at least 2014. Additionally it says that “earlier this month the Air Force Research Laboratory announced that its ‘Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstrations and Research’a solar beaming project has just received the first key component for its Arachne spacecraft.”

Ammunition

Ammunition is an obvious necessity for soldiers everywhere and its weight has always been an issue. Not only does ammunition’s weight make it more difficult to get to remote areas but also for individual soldiers to carry enough ammo into combat.

However manufacturers are developing ways to lighten ammunition by getting rid of the heavy brass casings that have been standard for decades. Manufacturers insist that “their polymer-cased ammo designs offer about a 30 percent weight savings over brass ammunition but also bring increased performance.”

A technological development that would dramatically reduce the logistical demand that traditional munitions impose on military operations is laser weaponry. Just today an article in the National Interest explained the utility of these weapon:

Lasers are quiet meaning they can fire without a large acoustic signature which could give away an attack position should a large missile or cannon be fired. They can offer a kind of silent attack. They are also scalable meaning they can fire off to fully destroy and incinerate or merely stun or disable an enemy target depending upon the power setting of the weapon. Higher and higher power lasers are fast emerging to the point where should technology and form factor miniaturization mature at the current pace fighter jets tanks and other large-scale combat platforms will likely be armed with very high-power laser weapons.

Unsurprisingly a Popular Mechanics article says all the military services are “pushing hard” to get laser weapons into their systems. A key reason relates directly to logistics: “their ability to fire a high number of shots without stockpiling bullets missiles or shells.” Specifically:

[A]s long as there is electricity to power the weapon it can theoretically crank out an endless number of shots. “Ammunition” is basically the cost of generator fuel or about $10 per shot.

Thus solving the electricity challenge could also go a long way in addressing the ammunition issue.

Concluding thoughts

As you can see no single “disruptive” technology will alone revolutionize key aspects of the military logistics conundrum. Instead there are a collection of technologies that can synergistically transform logistics and in doing so enhance the ability of the military to conduct operations free from much of the legacy logistics structure that limited them.

Of course this brief article addresses only some of the technologies that could allow revamped logistics to become a “disruptive” influence in a positive way. Among other things enemy planners cannot necessarily count on being able to eviscerate U.S. military capability by disrupting supplies if American forces are markedly less dependent upon them.

For example on demand 3D printing of replacement parts decreases the need for supply dumps of a vast array of items sophisticated militaries require. Last April an article explained how the printers could reduce the logistics load:

By 3D printing metal parts remotely the CCDC [Combat Capabilities Development Command] aims to reduce the strain on the army logistics chain. Instead of requesting a replacement part from thousands of miles away troops could print it and recommission a vehicle much faster and at a fraction of the cost. Rather than carrying truckloads of spare parts including convoy loads all a unit would need is a 3D printer and raw materials.

Additionally “predictive maintenance” enabled by artificial intelligence can result in fewer systems needing repair and more efficiency in fixing those that do. As one source puts it for the military “the cost of unplanned downtime isn’t just money – it’s lives.” If the readiness of the assets at isolated locations can be improved the mission might be able to be accomplished with fewer of them—something that again would itself diminish and simplify the logistics involved.

The more logistics can be revolutionized the smaller the logistics footprint at forward locations. If fewer logistical troops were needed that itself would lighten the supply burden. Similarly reconfiguring combat formations – such as the Marines’ decision to eliminate tanks – can also ameliorate the logistical burden.

Even more radically emerging neuroscience developments and even human-machine interfacing carry the potential to so enhance the performance on individual soldiers that fewer of them would be required in a given circumstance—and that would lessen the logistics requirements.

Importantly many of these technologies have ready application in civilian settings. For example the ability to provide power in the aftermath of a natural disaster is an obvious benefit and one that if employed in an overseas disaster relief operation might garner goodwill for the U.S. This kind of “soft power” capability is often touted as being essential to an overall strategy for national security.

It is probably true that not all of the technologies outlined here will prove workable in a military setting. My bet however is that there will be more successes than failures particularly given the potential civilian applications of most of the benign ‘dual use’ technologies logistics involves. As I’ve said elsewhere the U.S. is a technological nation and we should not miss opportunities to use technology to enhance America’s security.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vc2NpdGVjaGRhaWx5LmNvbS9leHBlcnRzLWJlbGlldmUtdXMtZW1iYXNzaWVzLXdlcmUtaGl0LXdpdGgtaGlnaC1wb3dlci1taWNyb3dhdmVzLWhlcmVzLWhvdy10aGUtd2VhcG9ucy13b3JrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Experts Believe US Embassies Were Hit With High-Power Microwaves – Here's How the Weapons Work,"Some of the cases of the mystery ailment that has afflicted U.S. embassy staff and CIA officers off and on since 2016 in Cuba China Russia and other countries most likely were caused by pulsed electromagnetic energy according to a report by a panel of experts convened by national intelligence agencies.

The report’s findings are similar to those of another report released by the National Academies in 2020. In that report a committee of 19 experts in medicine and other fields concluded that directed pulsed radiofrequency energy is the “most plausible mechanism” to explain the illness dubbed “Havana syndrome.”

Neither report is definitive and their authors don’t address who targeted the embassies or why they were targeted. But the technology behind the suspected weapons is well understood and dates back to the Cold War arms race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. High-power microwave weapons are generally designed to disable electronic equipment. But as the Havana syndrome reports show these pulses of energy can harm people as well.

As an electrical and computer engineer who designs and builds sources of high-power microwaves I have spent decades studying the physics of these sources including work with the U.S. Department of Defense. Directed energy microwave weapons convert energy from a power source – a wall plug in a lab or the engine on a military vehicle – into radiated electromagnetic energy and focus it on a target. The directed high-power microwaves damage equipment particularly electronics without killing nearby people.

Two good examples are Boeing’s Counter-electronics High-powered Microwave Advanced Missile Project (CHAMP) which is a high-power microwave source mounted in a missile and Tactical High-power Operational Responder (THOR) which was recently developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory to knock out swarms of drones.



A news report about the U.S. Air Force’s high-power microwave anti-drone weapon THOR.

Cold War origins

These types of directed energy microwave devices came on the scene in the late 1960s in the U.S. and the Soviet Union. They were enabled by the development of pulsed power in the 1960s. Pulsed power generates short electrical pulses that have very high electrical power meaning both high voltage – up to a few megavolts – and large electrical currents – tens of kiloamps. That’s more voltage than the highest-voltage long-distance power transmission lines and about the amount of current in a lightning bolt.

Plasma physicists at the time realized that if you could generate for example a 1-megavolt electron beam with 10-kiloamp current the result would be a beam power of 10 billion watts or gigawatts. Converting 10% of that beam power into microwaves using standard microwave tube technology that dates back to the 1940s generates 1 gigawatt of microwaves. For comparison the output power of today’s typical microwave ovens is around a thousand watts – a million times smaller.

The development of this technology led to a subset of the U.S.-Soviet arms race – a microwave power derby. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 I and other American scientists gained access to Russian pulsed power accelerators like the SINUS-6 that is still working in my lab. I had a fruitful decade of collaboration with my Russian colleagues which swiftly ended following Vladimir Putin’s rise to power.

Today research in high-power microwaves continues in the U.S. and Russia but has exploded in China. I have visited labs in Russia since 1991 and labs in China since 2006 and the investment being made by China dwarfs activity in the U.S. and Russia. Dozens of countries now have active high-power microwave research programs.

Lots of power little heat

Although these high-power microwave sources generate very high power levels they tend to generate repeated short pulses. For example the SINUS-6 in my lab produces an output pulse on the order of 10 nanoseconds or billionths of a second. So even when generating 1 gigawatt of output power a 10-nanosecond pulse has an energy content of only 10 joules. To put this in perspective the average microwave oven in one second generates 1 kilojoule or thousand joules of energy. It typically takes about 4 minutes to boil a cup of water which corresponds to 240 kilojoules of energy.

This is why microwaves generated by these high-power microwave weapons don’t generate noticeable amounts of heat let alone cause people to explode like baked potatoes in microwave ovens.

High power is important in these weapons because generating very high instantaneous power yields very high instantaneous electric fields which scale as the square root of the power. It is these high electric fields that can disrupt electronics which is why the Department of Defense is interested in these devices.

How it affects people

The National Academies report links high-power microwaves to impacts on people through the Frey effect. The human head acts as a receiving antenna for microwaves in the low gigahertz frequency range. Pulses of microwaves in these frequencies can cause people to hear sounds which is one of the symptoms reported by the affected U.S. personnel. Other symptoms Havana syndrome sufferers have reported include headaches nausea hearing loss lightheadedness and cognitive issues.

The report notes that electronic devices were not disrupted during the attacks suggesting that the power levels needed for the Frey effect are lower than would be required for an attack on electronics. This would be consistent with a high-power microwave weapon located at some distance from the targets. Power decreases dramatically with distance through the inverse square law which means one of these devices could produce a power level at the target that would be too low to affect electronics but that could induce the Frey effect.

The Russians and the Chinese certainly possess the capabilities of fielding high-power microwave sources like the ones that appear to have been used in Cuba and China. The truth of what actually happened to U.S. personnel in Cuba and China – and why – might remain a mystery but the technology most likely involved comes from textbook physics and the military powers of the world continue to develop and deploy it

Travel perks still aren’t what they used to be and it’s going to be at least 3-6 more months before they are once again. For travel heavy premium credit cards that means it’s time to get creative. Once again American Express has. After offering $20 monthly credits last year for streaming or mobile devices Amex is offering a broader credit for 2021 with $30 in monthly PayPal credits for 6 months. Here’s everything you need to know.

Amex Platinum PayPal Credit For 2021

If you have the personal Amex Platinum Card in the USA congrats you just got $30 of your PayPal purchases covered each month for the first six months of the year. That’s $180 towards purchases you make with PayPal including shopping at most major retailers.

The only catch – person to person transactions don’t count. With the $30 credit the amount will automatically come off of any tallies you rack up over the month. So if you were to buy some Yeezy’s for $200 you’d receive a credit back of $30 making it $170.

Good to know: the credit resets monthly so if you don’t spend at least $30 in PayPal each month you won’t get the full $180 in perks over the six months. You’ll basically want to spend at least $30 each month via PayPal. If you don’t already it’s quite handy for shopping since it saves all your details and makes checkout both faster and more secure.

PayPal and Amex have a partnership explainer page which hammers out the rest of the details you might be curious about. For example – all transactions must be made in USD.

With an annual fee of $550 on the Platinum Card $180 back in the first six months plus all the 18+ other useful money saving benefits like $180 in Uber credits $100 Saks credit and a $200 airline fee credit plus Fine Hotels & Resorts offers still makes this a compelling card.

If you don’t already have the Amex Platinum Card Amex is currently offering a sign up bonus of 75000 Membership Rewards Points plus 10X points on the first 6 months of gas and groceries which can add up quickly.

PayPal has been a popular partner with credit cards in recent months as Capital One added its name to the list of rewards points currencies which you can redeem directly on PayPal to cover some or all of a purchase instead of paying cash.

Amex has long offered integrations with Amazon and PayPal to present ways to use points for daily online purchases directly but they typically don’t represent the best value. That honor still goes to travel and holding onto American Express Membership Rewards points for when travel recovers is most likely the way to go.

Here’s some inspiration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vYXVzdGlua2xlb24uY29tL3RhZy9jb250ZXh0b215L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better in context,"A good meme takes a snippet of something and makes it funnier or more interesting out-of-context.

Like television shows I prefer the trashy funny ones. What I can’t really stand are the memes that take themselves too seriously. Something “deep” like a moody black and white photo with a long quote laid over it. I often look up the original context for the quote and find the quote is either: a) fake b) wrongly attributed c) sliced up to make it more palatable. Worst of all the meme is very rarely as funny or interesting as the original context.

Take the Bob Dylan quote above. Here’s the original 1991 interview. Dylan was asked if he was more happier at 50 than 30:

“Oh man I’ve never even thought about that” Dylan said laughing. “Happiness is not on my list of priorities. I just deal with day-to-day things. If I’m happy I’m happy – and if I’m not I don’t know the difference.” He fell silent for a few moments and stared at his hands. “You know” he said “these are yuppie words happiness and unhappiness. It’s not happiness or unhappiness it’s either blessed or unblessed. As the Bible says ‘Blessed is the man who walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly.’ Now that must be a happy man. Knowing that you are the person you were put on this earth to be – that’s much more important than just being happy.

Emphasis mine. The meme maker in this case cut out the most interesting part of the quote the part with actual tooth (“yuppie words”!) that separates it from being a Hallmark sentiment.

This Patti Smith meme was of particular interest to me as I used the first part in the “Build a Good (Domain) Name” section of my book Show Your Work! The text is actually “correct” — Smith did say all those words — but the “life is like a roller coaster” cliché comes later in the speech.

What the meme doesn’t tell you is that Smith got the advice from William S. Burroughs — not the first name you think of associated with the word “clean”:

When I was in my early twenties I was lucky to have William Burroughs as a friend and mentor. Once I was with him and I asked him this question: “What should I aspire to?” and he thought and he said: “My dear a gold American Express would be good.” But after that he said very thoughtfully “Build your name.” And I said “William my name is Smith.” And he said “Well you’ll have to build a little harder.” But what William meant when he told me to build my name. Build a good name — because a name is not to get famous. He wasn’t talking about celebrity — he was talking about let your name radiate your self magnify who you are your good deeds your code of honor. Build your name and as you go through life your name will serve you.

At the risk of sounding like an old fart I encourage people — especially young people — to do “a 30-second fact check” on self-serious memes like this.

Without notice Virgin Atlantic moved to a distance-based award chart on Delta redemptions. Awards are still priced on a per-segment basis and in some cases 175% higher than before.

As a point of comparison prior to 2021 Virgin Atlantic charged the following for Delta premium cabin redemptions:

Let me give you an example. For over a year I have been eyeing a Los Angeles – Shanghai trip on Delta Air Lines to experience Delta One on the A350. The pandemic meant such travel was impossible in 2020 but I hoped to do it this year.

Two days ago the trip cost 60000 miles for a one-way business class ticket. Now the same flight costs 165000 miles one-way. That’s right folks a 175% increase in price without notice.

There really are no more sweet spots in premium cabins unless you are making a shorthaul redemption under 500 miles.

Was Delta Behind This Sudden Move?

Delta acquired a 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic in 2012. The two carriers are joint venture partners. Delta charged significantly more miles for its own flights than did Virgin Atlantic. Now the playing field has been leveled.

Do you really think Virgin Atlantic decided to make this change without pressure from Delta? Not when its business model (with partnerships including American Express Chase and Citi) relies upon incoming transfers and consumer redemptions.

I pressed Delta for details and received no response.

Virgin Atlantic’s statement is laughably misleading:

“We recognise how much our members value the extensive range of redemption partner options available through Flying Club including flights with our joint venture partner Delta Air Lines. The recent changes contribute to some considerable savings on reward seats meaning members can go further for fewer Virgin Points. Across all classes the redemption pricing remains competitive.”

Here’s what I think happened: Delta saw an uptick in partner bookings from Virgin Atlantic and decided that it was simply too much. In many cases Virgin Atlantic was charging less than half of what Delta charged for the same flight.

In that sense I suppose the change should not come as a surprise. What does come as a surprise however is that Virgin Atlantic gave us no notice. That is shameful and shows a total and complete lack of transparency and respect for Flying Club members.

CONCLUSION

I have miles in Virgin Atlantic and have no idea what I’ll use them for…certainly not on Delta any longer. It is a reminder that points are a depreciating asset and unpredictable in nature and value. As a consequence make an effort to collect points in flexible currencies like American Express Membership Rewards or Chase Ultimate Rewards and only transfer when you are ready to book.

I’m done transferring prospectively when a lucrative 40% transfer bonus appears. Because the price of my award went up 175%…

Oh and if you were planning on booking an ANA award with Virgin Atlantic I’d get on that. Today.

“Due to the recent threats issued by Iranian leaders against President Trump and other U.S. government officials I have ordered the USS Nimitz (CVN-68) to halt its routine redeployment” Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller said in the statement.

“USS Nimitz will now remain on station in the U.S. Central Command area of operations. No one should doubt the resolve of the United States of America.”

On the one-year anniversary of the killing of Soleimani the leader of Iran’s Quds Forces Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini and a senior military commander both vowed a retaliatory action against the U.S. reported Military.com.

The move from Miller is a reversal of a Thursday statement from the Pentagon in which the acting SECDEF ordered the carrier to end its deployment to U.S. Central Command and return home.

The carrier its embarked air wing and its escorts have been deployed since June but due to added precautions due to the COVID-19 pandemic the sailors and Marines assigned to the strike group have been isolated from their families since April.

Before the Thursday order Nimitz and the Makin Island Amphibious Ready Group had been operating off the coast of Somalia to support the repositioning of about 700 U.S. troops to other countries in East Africa. The ARG consists of USS Makin Island (LHD-8) and amphibious transport docks USS Somerset (LPD-25) and USS San Diego (LPD-22) and 2500 Marines from the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit are embarked aboard the three ships. Makin Island also has a squadron of Marine F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters aboard.

This will be the highest-profile single-sport event with this kind of host structure which presents potential political and logistical concerns. This article puts forth a case study for tournament organizers and highlights key components organizers should center on to maximize the local and international opportunities the world’s largest sporting event provides.

With more than half of the world population tuning in every four years the FIFA World Cup is the pinnacle of football passion. In January 2017 to make the event even more exciting and broaden the tournament’s appeal FIFA decided to expand the World Cup to 48 teams. Given the implications of this decision the expansion will take effect from the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

However there is another reason the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be unique. As announced on June 13 2018 FIFA Congress members voted in favor of the United Bid submitted by the football federations of Mexico U.S. and Canada—making 2026 the first FIFA World Cup to be co-hosted by three nations. Of the competition’s 80 football matches across 16 stadiums Mexico and Canada will host 10 matches each and the USA will host 60 matches.

Of the three host nations both Mexico (in 1970 and 1986) and the U.S. (in 1994) have previous World Cup hosting experience. Although Canada is yet to host the men’s event in 2015 Canada hosted the Women’s World Cup and has hosted multiple Olympic Games and most recently the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.

About the Bid Book

The Bid Book is generally considered to be a preface to the actual event planning. According to the Bid Book the 2026 FIFA World Cup will generate record revenues and opportunities to benefit not only the hosts but also the global football community

The North Americans pledged their tournament would generate an $11 billion profit for FIFA – greater than any previous World Cup finals… The “United Bid” projected that its tournament would generate more than $5 billion in short-term economic activity including the creation of 40000 jobs and more than $1 billion in incremental worker earnings. More than 5.8 million tickets are expected to be sold generating over $2 billion in ticketing revenue. Evans and Philips (Reuters)

FIFA rules require certain capacity standards to host matches:

The opening match and final match venues must hold 80000 spectators

Semi-final match venues must hold 60000 spectators

Group stage matches the round of 16 quarter-finals and the third-place match venues must hold 40000 spectators

In addition the hosts promise over 150 venue-specific training sites and practice facilities with modern training amenities. The bid also has sustainability promises all the stadiums will still be of use after the tournament.

Learning from the past

Hugely popular mega sporting events (MSEs) including the FIFA World Cup are associated with ever-increasing costs to meet competition standards with the estimated hosting costs for the next World Cup approaching $200 billion.

Therefore future organizers should review the experiences of the past MSE hosts for important lessons and opportunities. The strategies implemented outcomes achieved and challenges faced by the past hosts can help shape the strategic planning for future events.

Although Mexico U.S. and Canada have a wealth of experience expertise and capacity to host a successful tournament the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be among the first experiments of three co-hosting nations. Despite many benefits of co-hosting an MSE it comes with certain unique challenges with the most critical one being the need to align the capacities and logistics of host nations and managing the international and subnational interdependencies.

The three-host concept has been tried in other sports: in 2011 India Pakistan and Sri Lanka co-hosted the ICC Cricket World Cup; and in 2023 Japan Indonesia and the Philippines will co-host the FIBA Basketball World Cup. In regional FIFA football competitions multiple hosts are more frequent: in 2012 Equatorial Guinea and Gabon hosted the Africa Cup of Nations; in 2000 2008 and 2012 two countries co-hosted the Euro competitions; in 2019 the U.S. Mexico and Costa Rica co-hosted the Gold Cup; and in 2007 the Asian Cup had four host countries (Indonesia Malaysia Thailand and Vietnam).

But for the largest competition in the world only one contest has had multiple hosts: Japan and South Korea co-hosted the FIFA World Cup in 2002. Their experience could serve as a benchmark to evaluate unique challenges that might arise during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

During the 2002 FIFA World Cup co-hosts argued over a number of issues including the official name order ticket price policies and visa issuing as well as currency exchange and stadia construction which contributed to the complexity of co-hosting a mega event.

Similarly any political spat between the U.S. Mexico and Canada could cause border tensions restricting the free movement of spectators. Political conflicts could complicate visa approvals for international travelers across the three nations.

Travel logistics between host countries can be another challenge for spectators which was clearly evident during the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Although the 2026 FIFA World Cup would not require spectators to cross a sea traveling distant miles can be challenging. Travelers will also need to manage three different currencies. Given the proliferation of distributed ledger technology financial technology and banking innovation this could be an opportunity to promote a cashless FIFA World Cup.

At the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa ticket counters were placed in shopping malls and city centers to encourage local business opportunities and to make tickets accessible to people from diverse economic backgrounds. Similarly implementing ticket sales through online and offline channels may help ensure greater participation during the 2026 FIFA World Cup matches.

The United Bid Book refers to various entertainment programs and festivals to be conducted to engage fans during the event. Host nations should consider expanding these entertainment programs and festivals to take place before during and after the tournament as well as in non-host cities to ensure longer visitor stay even after the final match (as seen during the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia). Qatar the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup has similar plans to increase tourism and local business opportunities. A similar strategy if adopted during the 2026 FIFA World Cup would help increase the scope for local businesses in host and non-host cities.

Extending local business hours during event days would maximize economic activity – a serious challenge faced during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Since the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be co-hosted by three nations the Local Organizing Committee and tourism agencies should cooperate to offer three-nation packages for international travelers and maximize the impact of the tournament on the local tourism industry.

The FIFA World Cup provides a global platform that can enhance or rebrand a nation’s image as well as help spread awareness about a particular cause across the world. Past tournaments have been used as a platform to promote environmental causes. Restricting the use of non-recyclable materials enhancing waste management and recycling as well as the use of electric vehicles are good examples adopted during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil and the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia that helped reduce their carbon footprint. While adopting similar measures the 2026 FIFA World Cup organizers could go even further by innovating carbon-neutral transportation between the three nations.

With a variety of opportunities and challenges ahead the 2026 FIFA World Cup could serve as a major catalyst for innovation and business opportunities. However taking advantage of those opportunities will depend on the collaboration between the policymakers organizers and local businesses and determine the impact and legacy of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

After 10 executions in five months the Department of Justice was planning one last round of killings in the federal death chamber. The executions would bring Donald Trump’s tally to 13 more than any president since Franklin Roosevelt.

Never mind that the last two men slated to die Corey Johnson and Dustin Higgs had recently been diagnosed with Covid-19. Both had symptoms of the virus for days before they tested positive at the U.S. penitentiary in Terre Haute Indiana. Higgs has a long history of asthma heart problems and hypertension. Johnson has exhibited evidence of lung damage according to his attorneys. But this has not deterred the Justice Department from pushing forward. On December 27 federal prosecutors informed a U.S. district judge that although neither man had been retested and both still had symptoms they had been “medically cleared from isolation status.” In other words they had recovered for the purpose of execution.

Higgs and Johnson were not the only ones to get sick. The virus aggressively spread on federal death row after the back-to-back executions of Brandon Bernard and Alfred Bourgeois on December 10 and 11. At least 14 men had tested positive as of December 21 according to the New York Times though the figure has grown much higher. One source with close ties to death row told The Intercept last week that the real number is “at least 30” — 60 percent of the total condemned population in Terre Haute.

Read Our Complete Coverage The Coronavirus Crisis

There’s good reason to believe that Trump’s execution spree is responsible for the outbreak. Although cases were climbing at the penitentiary before the first killings in July many warned that the federal executions could become superspreader events. The local newspaper called for a delay in light of the pandemic. Victims’ families protested that traveling to Terre Haute could put them at risk. On the eve of the first execution news broke that a Bureau of Prisons staffer involved in preparations had tested positive. Nevertheless the killings moved forward.

As autumn brought a surge in Covid-19 cases across the country more people connected to the executions began to test positive. In November lawyers for Lisa Montgomery the only woman under a federal death sentence became sick after visiting their client at FMC Carswell a Texas medical facility for women in BOP custody. A few weeks later Yusuf Ahmed Nur the spiritual adviser to Orlando Hall the eighth man to be executed tested positive after accompanying him in the death chamber. Shortly afterward in response to a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union the Bureau of Prisons revealed that eight of approximately 40 members of the execution team had tested positive too. More recently the BOP admitted that it has failed to conduct contact tracing for fear of revealing the identities of those carrying out executions.

Although the return of federal executions after a 17-year hiatus refocused attention onto Terre Haute the Covid-19 outbreak there mirrors death rows all over the country. Cases were documented from Arizona to Tennessee to California where the virus proved especially deadly. As the year came to a close the number of known Covid-19 deaths on state death rows stood at 17 — equal to the total number of executions carried out all year in the United States. The most recent came on December 28 when Romell Broom who famously survived a botched execution attempt in 2009 died on Ohio’s death row at the age of 64; his name was placed on the corrections department’s “Covid probable list” meaning he likely died from coronavirus complications.

People on death row represent a small fraction of the Covid-19 crisis in the country’s prisons and jails; an estimated 275000 incarcerated people have contracted the virus in the United States and at least 1700 people have died in custody. Some experts and advocates argue that with capital punishment on the decline the real “death penalty” is the lethal medical neglect that comes with mass incarceration. Yet the impact of the virus also speaks volumes about a policy that by its own metrics has been a failure since the start of the so-called modern death penalty era.

Along with its arbitrariness racial bias and track record of condemning the innocent the American death penalty is increasingly defined not by executions but by the number of people who spend decades languishing in extreme isolation on death row only to die of disease or old age. Broom’s death in Ohio was preceded by that of 79-year-old James Frazier the oldest man on the state’s death row. In California which has carried out a total of 13 executions since the death penalty’s return in 1978 13 condemned people died of the virus in 2020. One man had been on death row since 1986.

If there is any silver lining to Trump’s execution spree it is that it has reinvigorated momentum against the death penalty. In December Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley who introduced legislation to end the federal death penalty last year sent a letter to President-elect Joe Biden asking him to act on his newfound opposition to capital punishment. “With a stroke of your pen you can stop all federal executions prohibit United States attorneys from seeking the death penalty dismantle death row at FCC Terre Haute and call for the resentencing of people who are currently sentenced to death” she wrote. “Each of these elements are critical to help prevent greater harm and further loss of life.”

Stunning Indifference

Preventing loss of life is supposed to be one of the reasons the death penalty still exists in the United States. Although evidence has historically shown that states with the death penalty on the books do not have lower murder rates than those in other jurisdictions supporters of capital punishment continue to insist that it is a deterrent. Yet Trump’s executions have exposed the fallacy of executions as a policy carried out in the interest of public safety. In the rest of the country where the pandemic largely stopped the death penalty in its tracks some prosecutors nevertheless ignored public health warnings pushing to move forward with executions and death penalty trials while fighting against exonerations of people on death row.

Trump’s executions have exposed the fallacy of executions as a policy carried out in the interest of public safety.

Scott Coffee a 24-year veteran of the Clark County public defender office in Las Vegas who is generally considered Nevada’s leading expert on the death penalty said that his county is down to just one functioning courtroom — out of more than two dozen in normal times — and that at present it can only handle short straightforward proceedings the polar opposite of a capital trial.

Capital cases are notoriously expensive and time-consuming. They require hours of research investigation and preparation by teams of lawyers and investigators; large pools of potential jurors; and expert witnesses who often have to travel from out of state — all things nearly impossible to accomplish amid a pandemic.

“The long and short is that these trials are being delayed for the foreseeable future” Coffee wrote in an email to The Intercept “irrespective” of prosecutors’ “desire to go forward.”

Nationally there were just 18 new death sentences handed down across the U.S. in 2020 (none of them in Nevada) down from a high of 315 imposed in 1996 according to the Death Penalty Information Center’s year-end report. And there were just 17 executions down from a peak of 98 in 1999; 10 of those executions have been carried out by the federal government. Three more were in Texas.

While support for the death penalty continues its steady decline Robert Dunham executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center said that the number of new death sentences in 2020 was artificially low because of the pandemic. “We were going to be near record lows in death sentences and in executions anyway because that’s just a continuation of the historical pattern” he said. “But the depth of the decline this year is unquestionably attributable to Covid.” As such he expects there will be some increase in new sentences in 2021 and particularly an uptick in executions as officials who faced court-imposed stays and generally sought fewer new dates will undoubtedly try to make up for lost time.

The year saw other milestones too those that have again highlighted the problems with capital punishment and those that point toward its demise.

In May Colorado became the 22nd state to abolish the death penalty clearing its three-man death row. Colorado’s experience offers a stark example of the policy’s arbitrary and racist nature: In a state as white as Colorado all three of the men on death row were Black and all three were prosecuted by the same district attorney’s office.

Still even as the pandemic worsened — and as abolition was all but inevitable — one Colorado prosecutor Adams County District Attorney Dave Young a vocal opponent of repeal pressed impossibly forward trying to quickly convene a death penalty trial against yet another young Black man. Hundreds of potential jurors were called to the courthouse even though there was no clear plan to keep them safe from the virus. It wasn’t until the end of March after Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed the abolition bill into law and then ordered a statewide lockdown that Young backed down and abandoned his efforts.

And despite the burdens the pandemic has posed across the system for lawyers and investigators there were six death row exonerations in 2020 bringing the total number up to 173. Notably Walter Ogrod who’d been sentenced to die in Pennsylvania in 1996 was finally exonerated after the Philadelphia district attorney’s office concluded that staggering levels of official misconduct had plagued his case ultimately condemning the wrong man for the murder of 4-year-old Barbara Jean Horn.

Although the district attorney’s office agreed before the pandemic took hold that Ogrod had been wrongly convicted Judge Shelley Robins New slow-walked the case  claiming she wouldn’t have time to consider whether Ogrod should be freed until after a vacation abroad in May — even as it became increasingly clear that the trip was not going to happen. In the interim Ogrod became gravely ill mostly likely with Covid-19; he developed a 106-degree fever and was in respiratory distress. Although a different judge had ordered Ogrod released to a hospital for treatment Pennsylvania’s corrections department balked and Ogrod was confined to his cell waiting for Robins New to hear the case which she finally did in June.

It was a dramatic hearing held via Zoom during which an assistant district attorney with the Philadelphia DA’s office delivered an emotional apology to Ogrod Horn’s mother and the residents of Philadelphia — a rare occurrence for any actor in the criminal legal system let alone a prosecutor. “The errors made in this case made the streets less safe and I fear that the true perpetrator … may have brought harm to others” she said. “That is the impact of … wrongful convictions on our community.”

“This is what happens when the powers that be care more about appearances than due process.”

Indeed the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed many of the ugly truths about the death penalty system that reformers and abolitionists have long recognized. Ogrod’s case is one example: A corrections department and judge demonstrating stunning indifference toward a man wrongfully condemned in a case where prosecutors and defense attorneys already agreed there had been a gross miscarriage of justice.

Nowhere was this kind of institutional callousness on greater display than in the Trump administration’s rush to execute federal prisoners even as the administration failed to control the pandemic. “I think the recent actions by the federal government of simply lining up as many people as possible for execution should frighten all of us” Coffee said. “This is what happens when the powers that be care more about appearances than due process and serves as a stark reminder of why we need to repeal Nevada’s death penalty. Like many other states we are but one leadership change away [from] committing the same atrocities.”

An Inflection Point

For those on federal death row who survive both the virus and Trump’s killing spree the future will largely depend on whether Biden lives up to his promises. Biden who was instrumental in expanding the federal death penalty — and who was the last Democratic presidential candidate to come out against capital punishment — has remained silent about the killings in Terre Haute. After the last round of execution dates was announced in November a spokesperson told the Associated Press simply that Biden “opposes the death penalty now and in the future.”

Even if Johnson and Higgs recover from Covid-19 in time for their executions their lawyers warn that any lasting lung damage from their illness has already compounded the risk of an excruciating death. Medical experts autopsies and witness accounts have long raised red flags about the government’s lethal injection protocol which shows evidence of causing flash pulmonary edema a harrowing sensation akin to waterboarding.

Those who are still sick on death row are also at higher risk for bad outcomes. “This is another case of everything that goes bad with the criminal legal system goes worse for the death penalty” said Dunham DPIC’s executive director. People on death row are “uniquely vulnerable in multiple ways” especially since they live in solitary confinement and under a high level of stress which makes them especially susceptible to illness. “There is no comparable stress to being on death row” Dunham said.

“These are people’s lives and we cannot trust the government to handle this policy responsibly.”

This has been especially true for the men in Terre Haute. In emails to The Intercept death row residents have described the horror of watching friends and neighbors taken to die coupled with a constant pervasive fear of new execution dates. One man described it as a combination of “life-draining sadness” and impending danger. “This place is really affecting me” he wrote in November. “When the guards do rounds their keys clang and that noise is all of a sudden jarring piercing my ears hurting my ear drums causing me major turbulence. And this never used to bother me.”

Dunham thinks 2020 may end up being an “inflection point” for the death penalty. “There are events that change the trajectory of debate on an issue. And there are points that death penalty opponents have been making for years — that this isn’t something you can trust with the government because there’s always going to be somebody who’s coming in who is completely unreasonable” he said. “This is not a toy. These are people’s lives and we cannot trust the government to handle this policy responsibly.”

Dunham is relatively optimistic that the failings of the system highlighted amid the pandemic may push additional states toward abolition. He thinks that it may be imminent in Wyoming which has been on the cusp of repealing its death penalty statute for the past few years. Marguerite Herman who is a member of the leadership team of the League of Women Voters of Cheyenne and among a diverse coalition of folks pushing for abolition in the state isn’t sure that 2021 will be the year; a number of moderate Republicans who were on board or nearly so were voted out of office in November making repeal less likely. Still she remains confident that it will happen — after all Wyoming’s death penalty isn’t exactly functional.

Four people have been sent to death row in Wyoming according to a dataset compiled by The Intercept of more than 7000 individuals sentenced to death in active death penalty states and the federal system since 1976. Of those four only one has been executed. The other three have had their sentences overturned. Two were resentenced to life with the possibility of parole. The fourth is awaiting resentencing. Meanwhile the policy has cost the state roughly $1 million per year.

As The Intercept’s dataset demonstrates Wyoming’s experience with capital punishment is on par with the nation as a whole. Just 20 percent of the more than 7000 people sentenced to die have been executed. A staggering 44 percent are no longer on death row for some other reason; the vast majority have had their sentences reduced and hundreds have been released from prison altogether. Black people account for 40 percent of those sentenced to die. At least 51 percent of the total are people of color.

Even as politicians acknowledge the death penalty’s obvious failures several seem content to put off abolition indefinitely. Pennsylvania has not used its death chamber since 1999; in 2015 Gov. Tom Wolf declared a moratorium on executions calling the death penalty “ineffective unjust and expensive.” Yet more than 150 people remain on death row in the state. In California where the execution chamber at San Quentin State Prison was dramatically dismantled almost two years ago more than 700 people remain in limbo. Like Biden Gov. Gavin Newsom could finish what he started and commute their sentences to life — a logical move for someone who has described the death penalty as “fundamentally immoral.” But such political courage is hard to come by.

As for Coffee he feels that abolition in Nevada is on the horizon. It’s become a regular topic of discussion at the state Capitol and he thinks the broader awakening around the failings of the criminal justice system combined with the fallout from the pandemic — the court disruptions the loss of life the economic destruction — may help more people realize what a fallible barbaric and ultimately failed policy the death penalty is.

“I am hopeful that the repeal efforts will succeed in this session. The move toward progressive criminal justice reforms has opened the eyes of many to the various problems inherent in the criminal justice system but I have to say I can’t think of an area where this is more obvious than in the death penalty” he wrote. “People are coming to realize that even if you believe in the death penalty there is no fair just and accurate way to determine who deserves it.

Taylor McWilliams’s property company Hondo which owns most of Brixton market claims the proposal will “deliver” 2000 jobs in the area and generate £2.8m every year for the local economy.

In the other corner is a group of residents whose fierce opposition has been joined by Historic England and the Victorian Society which this month wrote to the mayor of London Sadiq Khan saying the proposal no longer had merit in a post-Covid future where more people would be working from home.

McWilliams a member of the DJ collective Housekeeping first attracted local anger when Hondo served notice on a popular small shop Nour Cash & Carry.

But following a social media campaign called Save Nour – backed by celebrities including rock singer Skin from Skunk Anansie – the shop will stay albeit moved to a new site nearby.

Now McWilliams find himself facing further local censure after his plans for the tower were approved last month by Lambeth council despite almost 8000 people signing an online petition opposing it.

The Save Nour group wants the mayor to intervene a move backed by the Victorian Society.

“This area of Brixton has avoided the intensive development which has blighted many of London’s historic urban centres” said Olivia Stockdale conservation adviser for the society. “It therefore retains its character as a predominantly Victorian town centre.

“The plans to construct a building of 20 storeys next to this conservation area demonstrates a total failure to understand and respond to the context of the area.

“While buildings of this height may be appropriate elsewhere in London this is clearly not a location where this applies. The proposed development would overshadow the surrounding buildings including the historic Electric Avenue which when built in the 1880s was the first market street lit by electric lights.”

There were reports that the development had already been approved by the mayor. An email was circulated that appeared to confirm Khan had given the go-ahead. But this was later attributed to an administrative error.

In response to locals’ concerns Hondo told the Observer that it was setting up a community liaison group “to identify and map how the local community can engage with this project including engagement through the community space”. It claimed that the proposal had received support from more than 1000 residents predominantly from the local area and a large percentage of current Brixton market traders.

Joe O’Donnell Victorian Society director called on Khan to consider whether London needed more office space. “This is an opportunity to respond to what is wanted by the local community. If a huge office tower block was ever really needed or viable in Brixton it’s commercial future seems now seems doubtful as it is unclear whether London will ever return to previous levels of office demand in a post Covid-19 world of home working. We have sent our objection to the mayor to inform his decision.”

Hondo said there was a “serious need for office and commercial space especially in Brixton”.

The company said in a statement: “Commercial space is at a premium and Hondo feel we are best placed to address that. Despite employment rising at twice the rate as in Lambeth in Brixton vacancy rates are virtually at zero. Studies have been undertaken by Savills which reflect that the post-Covid situation for office space will look very similar to the pre-Covid situation.”

O’Donnell said that if the plan were to go ahead it would set a precedent opening up the area and potentially other sites across the capital for further high-rise developments.

“Many of the largely Victorian town centres of urban London are already blighted by massive development which has radically altered their character for example Lewisham or Stratford. This character is becoming increasingly rare and this is why we argue the conservation area be spared it.”

However Hondo stressed that the new development would do justice to the area.

“The Pope’s Road development will be a landmark building and the design is of the highest quality led by world leading designer Sir David Adjaye who has drawn inspiration from architecture in Brixton” the company said.

“Our proposal takes direct inspiration from the existing markets and aims to extend and implement this unique urban typology.

“A thorough research into the character and history of Brixton from both an architectural and a cultural point of view allowed us to propose a scheme which is at the same time innovative and contextual.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL2J1c2luZXNzL2NvbW1vZGl0aWVzL2p1bWlhLXNoYXJlLWRyb3AtcmVncmV0dGFibGUtbXRuLTE4NTc3NTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jumia share drop regrettable - MTN | Monitor,"MTN Group a major shareholder in Jumia Technologies AG has said the fall in the e-commerce group stock price is unfortunate.

Speaking to Bloomberg a US-based media agency the MTN Group chief executive officer Mr Rob Shuter said: “It is regrettable that the value has gone down so much.”

The decline in Jumia’s share price according to the African Report has accelerated since the e-commerce platform said in August that sales consultants in Nigeria had been involved in placing improper orders which were then cancelled.

Jumia has traded as high as $49.77 per share but the stock has fallen to about $11 compared with the IPO price of $14.50 which gives the company a market value of about $867m from $1.5b in 2016.

MTN’s interest in Jumia according to Bloomberg is now worth less than $100m.

The move comes at a time when MTN is behind schedule in its bid to generate about $1b in asset sales over the next three years.

The fall Bloomberg reported makes the e-commerce group less viable for MTN to sell a stake in the near term.

This follows a six-month lock in period where the telecom would not sell its shareholding in the e-commerce platform.

“The post IPO lock up period of Jumia in which we have an 18.9 per cent stake has expired and as at 29 October this stake is valued at approximately $94.3m” Mr Ralph Mupita the MTN Group chief financial officer said in a statement earlier.

Assets disposal

According to Mupita MTN has through its Asset Realisation Programme which was announced in March achieved $141m out of the $1b target.

However the telecom said it hopes to attain more money through disposal of its tower assets in Uganda and Ghana.

“We continue to make steady progress in this regard and following American Towers Corporation’s announcement of its acquisition of Eaton Towers we are in advanced discussions to dispose of our 49 per cent holdings in ATC Ghana and ATC Uganda which we value at between $471m and $539m respectively” he said.

The sale is expected to help MTN meet its target of generating a $1b in asset sales over three years.

A statement by ATC highlighting the definitive agreement to acquire Eaton Towers including the assumption of existing debt of approximately $1.85b said the company continues to expect the transaction to close by the end of 2019 subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

Acquisition of the stakes in each of the joint ventures with MTN in Ghana and Uganda ATC said are also subject to the closing of the Eaton Towers transaction.

MTN group performance

According to Mr Shuter: “Service revenue grew by 9.6 per cent while earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) marginally improving by 0.6 per cent to 35.1 per cent.



“We remain committed to driving access to Internet and financial services and in quarter three we added 4.7 million active data users and 2.2 million mobile money subscribers across the portfolio. Our Ayoba messaging platform is now available across five markets and is already recording 515000 active users per month” Mr Shuter revealed.

Various disposal efforts

Botswana’s Mascom for $300m has been scrapped and events at Jumia Technologies AG have made a sell less viable.

Further proceeds could be generated by the redemption of the Nigeria unit’s preference shares which MTN values at $315m according to Mr Mupita.

The MTN group is awaiting a ruling from the central bank of Nigeria on the matter.

A proposed sale of HIS Towers - which is separate to the $1b plan - may be revived as shareholders including MTN prepare for a fresh tilt at an IPO next year people familiar with the matter said this week.

MTN has been exploring asset sales while focusing on key markets such as Nigeria.

Mr Ssegawa believed Mr Magezi was successful because his electrical job enabled him to take care of his family and dependents then.

It is against this background coupled with his childhood escapades that he decided vocational school was the way to go.

“I loved repairing things. When our lights got a problem I would find a way of fixing the wires” Mr Ssegawa tells me.

He declined his father’s request to do carpentry because of his passion and instead pursued a diploma in electrical engineering after Senior Six.

Mr Ssegawa found a job as a supervisor in MM Construction Company in Masaka. Little did he know that this experience would give birth to Segken Services Limited. This enterprise majorly provides power line construction services supply and installation of generators as well as internal and external installation of solar power.

Starting business

There are several reasons to set up a business and more than 10 years ago Mr Ssegawa first toyed with the idea of opening his business in the early 2000s.

“Private companies were very few and I noticed there was a gap in the sector. People would apply for power privately and would spend months before the existing few companies could work on them” Mr Ssegawa says.

He then discussed the idea with his colleagues but was turned down because they were unwilling to invest. They thought it was very risky and resigning from their jobs was a no-no.

“I have to start even though I have no money” Mr Ssegawa thought after years in formal employment.

With Shs1m from his work’s savings he started out as a sole proprietor in 2004. Segken Services began with internal power installations for people’s houses in Masaka. Given his interaction with clients on ground a few small subcontracts from existing companies in the sector followed as he lacked capital to be a main contractor.

This came with its challenges unfortunately. Getting contracts was hard and when he did he was not paid at times. However gaining experience paying workers and minimising losses was all that mattered to Mr Ssegawa at the time. The returns on investment he says would matter later.

Growth

Eventually an opportunity showed up. Uganda Electricity Distribution Company Limited (UEDCL) started prequalifying service providers and this seemed like the perfect turning point. His first big job estimated at around Shs13m came along just after he had registered the business as a limited company but taught him business the hard way.

“I did not have experience. So I got it through another company. I did the implementation but when the company got paid the man disappeared leaving behind Shs7m yet with Shs13m my profit should have been Shs3m. I was getting things on credit so paying back was a problem” he says.

He then diverted funds from smaller contracts to pay off his debts. It was then that he decided to find contracts himself.

Starting out became difficult because clients were uncertain of his ability and he lacked reference to former contracts. Capital became another hurdle. He says “You get a job you are given a deadline but you do not have working capital the banks could not help because we did not have security.”

Temporary manual labourers became a key ingredient for the company’s growth because the company was uncertain of continuous jobs.

“I looked for qualified personnel in the power sector. We agreed that when I get a job you get a commission I did not have cash but needed their expertise and labour” he says.

When Uganda’s main electricity distribution company UMEME came on board it adopted UEDCL’s prequalified service providers a move that saw Segken build more clientele.

“With UEDCL we were small but they trusted us. Whenever we got a job we used professionalism. We used their materials efficiently and delivered projects on time” he says.

His breakthrough came when he won contracts from UEDCL and Airtel. He remembers working for three months nonstop with about 10 sites every month.

Nearly 11 years in the company has several clients such as Tramico SBI International Holdings Reynolds Construction Company Dott Services Limited and Roofings Limited. Communication companies such as Airtel and American Tower Company use Segken to extend electricity to their masts. In a good year Segken constructs power lines to 50 masts for a single client.

Giving advice that supports clients to manage costs has helped the company grow.

“When clients approach you most times they are green. What has kept us in the sector is advising clients on how to go about the power options. Someone may want to start a maize mill but want a big transformer. When you calculate their load they need a smaller one. Referrals work for us because of this” he says.

2015 was a bad year for business as contracts were few. Contracts showed up in 2016 but were followed by delayed payments.



Segken was able to sail through thanks to diversification of investments and savings made over the years. Mr Ssegawa also found money to pay off suppliers and for the loans dfcu restructured the loan payment to reduce pressure on the business.

Segken has invested in solar power because institutions are shifting priority there.

“You use the same personnel in both solar and power line installation there is less training so the cost is less. There is demand as municipalities are moving away from using electricity in street lighting because it is expensive” he explains.

Despite the challenges Mr Ssegawa knows the taste of success.

“We are in top 100 it is an achievement and we have graduated from small tax payers to medium tax payers.”

He says the company enjoys a turnover between Shs6b and Shs7b. It employs about 150 workers for a project and retains 15 permanent ones.

He has found a South Korean company with which he has signed a partnership to share technology within the power sector.

He expects to keep his business afloat through joint ventures and retaining the company’s big clients including UMEME UEDCL Airtel Dott Services Limited and American Tower Company among others.

He attributes his success to well-trained and committed workers. He admits it is difficult to avoid loans because he has to expand the business and banks such as dfcu are now willing to give him loans.

Mr Ssegawa says he operates in a growing sector but government has to help the industry.

He employs many people but fails to give them permanent contracts because of the uncertainty that surrounds contracts jobs. He advocates for implementation of local content because he believes Ugandans have capacity to do contracts handed over to foreign companies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL2J1c2luZXNzL3Byb3NwZXIvdGVsZWNvbS1tYXJrZXQtc2hhcmUtc2NhbGVzLXRpbHQtYXMtY29tcGV0aXRpb24tZ3Jvd3MtMTUxNDgwMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Telecom market share scales tilt as competition grows,"Intense competition in Uganda’s telecom sector is yet to change the market leadership position. But there are variations in the sector’s market share. MTN Uganda still takes pride of place as the strongest brand in Uganda’s telecom industry for more than a decade ever since it took over from Celtel (now Airtel) in the late 1990s going by subscriber numbers and market share.

However given the changing trend in the industry MTN Uganda a subsidiary of MTN South Africa has in the past three years shed a significant proportion of market share to rivals despite maintaining the top position since it is no longer possible for any player to lock in consumers.

Despite its subscriber base growing year-on-year to 7.6 million by the end of 2011 in a country with about 16.7 million mobile users MTN’s market share of the Ugandan telecom industry dropped to 47.5 per cent in 2011 from about 60 per cent five years ago.

This figure is however higher than the 43.6 per cent market share in 2009 and 47 per cent in 2010 according to data from Business Monitor International (BMI).

MTN Uganda corporate affairs manager Ms Justina Ntabgoba who said the telecom will maintain its leading position in the industry for the coming three and so years attributed its consolidation into the leadership position despite stiff completion to network quality and innovative products like mobile money services MTN Radio and data services among others.

Despite boasting of quality network a recent Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) Quality of Service survey report released early this year shows that none of the five major telecom players in the industry meets its quality of service benchmark rate for both blocked and dropped calls which are key measures for network quality. UCC’s maximum proportion of blocked or dropped calls is 2 per cent.

A blocked call refers to a call attempt which although is initiated within the coverage area was not established or is not successful due to network failure whereas dropped calls refer to calls that are terminated by the operator’s network after call establishment but prior to normal termination by the calling or called party.

The industry regulator however warned that telecoms with poor service quality will soon be subjected to 10 per cent of their gross income in penalty. The move seeks to streamline service delivery in the industry.

However an industry analyst who preferred anonymity because of his or her position within the industry predicts that there will be a shift in the telecom market leadership within the coming years.

“A while ago I predicted that competition would shift from voice to other services and I think we are beginning to see it. Most telecoms have now launched mobile money services as I predicted. Also because of increasing costs involved in managing networks telecoms are likely to come to a round table and agree to work together and share masts as a way of cutting costs and in the same breath I really predict that we are likely to see a change in market leadership” the source said.

The analyst however noted that changes in market leadership may not necessarily be based on the voice segment because going forward telecoms will not only be gauged based on voice but on a number of services including data mobile money services and content among others.

Airtel which registered the third highest number of dropped calls and which in the early 1990s controlled over 80 per cent of the local telecom market share saw its portion of the market dip from 20.2 per cent in 2009 to 17 per cent in 2010 according to BMI.

The telecom which currently boasts of a subscriber base of 4 million however saw its share of the market pickup slowly in 2011 to about 24 per cent. Asked about the proportion of the market that the company plans to occupy five years from now Airtel spokesperson Joseph Kanyamunyu said: “From the past one year we have seen favourable growth and we are optimistic that we will command over 40 per cent of the market share.”

But how prepared is Airtel to achieve this target? “Our customers will benefit from increased innovative mobile products and services and superior customer experience that will be over and above any player in the industry. Our customers have over the past few months seen and appreciated our past innovations because they are not only affordable but relevant to their business and lives at large” said Mr Kanyamunyu.

Warid Telecom’s market share on the other hand is also said to have dropped from 15.7 per cent in 2009 to 12.1 per cent in 2010. It however picked up in 2011 with available statistics citing a market share of about 15 per cent.

On the other hand Uganda Telecom Limited (UTL) one of the oldest players in the industry estimated its market share at about 10 per cent by July 2011 having dipped from 21.9 per cent in 2009 to 16.3 per cent in 2010 with a subscriber base of about 2 million.

UTL’s publicist Mr Emmy Olaki said the telecom was able to grow its subscriber numbers amid tough competition due to its recently implemented strategy of taking services closer to the public in the country side.

“UTL currently has foot soldiers that walk with products taking them nearer to the people to increase accessibility” he said. Orange Telecom the smallest of the five major players in the industry however gladly reaped 1.8 percentage points to hit 4 per cent share of the market in 2010 from 2.2 per cent in 2009.

Orange Uganda chief officer strategy Mr Edouard Blondeau attributed the gain in market share to innovation especially in the data segment convenience and quality services.

Its market share however did not change much last year despite the telecom’s subscriber base growing from 609000 in 2010 to 622000 according to HIS Global Insight that quoted the firm’s parent company France Telecom-Orange.

Competition intensifies

This slow but meaningful change in market share came amid an era of price wars that saw players cut call rates to Shs180 per minute from a market average of about Shs320 due to stiff competition.

The cut-throat competition meant that the slightest reluctance by a service provider could cost them dearly in terms of market share yet it takes hundreds of billions of shillings in marketing costs to get an increase of a mere 0.1 percentage point of the industry’s share.

In 2011 MTN was the biggest spender on marketing and publicity in the market spending Shs31.8 billion in 2011 according to Synovate Uganda explaining why the firm still controls the biggest share of the cake.

Ms Ntabgoba told Prosper that it is no surprise that MTN’s advertising spend is high as the firm averagely launches at least six new products or services annually requiring that it invests hugely in publicising them.

MTN is closely followed by Airtel with Shs23.7 billion having slashed its advertising budget from a high of Shs26.1 billion in 2010—the highest that year following its rebranding from Zain.

Orange spent Shs19 billion on advertising and publicity last year explaining the significant gain in market share. It was followed by Warid that spent Shs16.9 billion and UTL that emerged as the least spender due to problems that the telecom is facing.

As competition increases and subscriber expectations grow service providers – both veterans and new entrants – have got to seek new and better ways to differentiate themselves and minimise costs so as to concentrate on their core business to remain competitive and protect their piece of the industry cake.

This has forced telecoms to sell off towers to companies that have it as its core business making out-sourcing of networks and site-sharing an accepted norm.

Recently Warid sold off its 394 tower sites and other passive network infrastructure at an unknown price to Eaton Towers to cut operational costs and remain competitive while Orange relinquished 300 tower sites to the same company.

The two deals followed MTN’s deal last December which saw the telecom sell approximately 1000 tower sites for about $175 million to American Tower Corporation (ATC) a USA-based company in a joint venture with South Africa’s MTN Group.

Major challenges

Telecoms have been grappling with increasing operational costs arising from a spike in fuel prices depreciation of the shilling inflationary pressure and persistent power outages amid low call tariffs reducing their revenue margins substantially since the costs of running and maintaining a tower site are among the highest in providing telecom services."

Riverside Drive from Delta to Collins avenues is closed as crews work to repair the extensive roadway damage caused by the 60-inch water main break police said in a Facebook post Sunday afternoon.

As a result police are expecting an influx of large trucks on Columbia Parkway as well as significant back ups during rush hour traffic.

Previous reporting:

A 60-inch water main break on Riverside Drive in Cincinnati's East End affected water pressure in Downtown Cincinnati Saturday afternoon according to Greater Cincinnati Water Works executive director Cathy Bailey.

""There is a water main break that is impacting that area [Central Business District]"" Bailey wrote on Twitter. ""Crews have been dispatched and supervisors have and are arriving to assess and discuss options.""

Greater Cincinnati Water Works has issued a boil water advisory for 758-766 Steiner Street and 3406-3648 Hillside Avenue.

Police told The Enquirer that a red vehicle hit a fire hydrant at the 2400 block of Riverside Drive near St. Rose Church between 11 a.m. and noon which caused a major water main break and flooded the area. Four families were displaced due to the flooding.

One vehicle was trapped police said. There were no injuries.

Jason Fleming superintendent of water distribution told The Enquirer damage was done to the roadway parked cars and some utilities in the area. Workers are trying to remove the water to assess the damage to the pipe.

Water Service was not impacted according to Greater Cincinnati Water Works but some areas ""may have temporarily experienced lower water pressure than normal.""

Jane Crabb 61 of East End said Saturday’s water main break flooded the entire first floor living area of her two-story painted brick home on Riverside Drive.

“It’s ruined” she said. “One minute it was dry the next minute it was flooded.”

Crabb said her granddaughter and a babysitter were in the house when the flood started but that no one was hurt.

Her cat Boots is missing but Crabb is hopeful her pet escaped the flood.

Crabb was still in a state of shock and said at the moment she feels “lost.”

Greater Cincinnati American Red Cross Greater Cincinnati Water Works crews a building inspector police and fire have responded to begin clean-up. Officials said they are assessing necessary repairs and establishing traffic detours in the area.

Roads are closed in the immediate area around Lumber and Bayou streets until further notice officials said. Fleming says he expects the road to be closed for at least a week.

We’ll then look at some of the challenges introduced by having more than one core on a chip and how modern multicore-aware debuggers can help to make these complex tasks more manageable.

Systems Performance

There are many ways to increase the performance of an embedded computing system ranging from clever compiler algorithms to efficient hardware solutions. Compiler optimizations are important to get the most efficient instruction scheduling from high-level language code that is easy to read and understand. In addition to this systems can take advantage of parallelism available in the project to process more than one thing at a time. And of course scaling the clock frequency can be an effective way to get more performance from your computing system.

Unfortunately the days when clock speeds could be assumed to increase geometrically have passed. And code optimization can only get you so much improvement particularly now after many generations of compiler technology development. This leaves us to look to parallelism as the best opportunity to continue scaling our system performance as time goes on.

Parallelism

Digging a well is a task that is hard to parallelize. Others can help shoveling the dirt away but the actual digging in the hole is typically a one-person job. As a result adding more people in the hole will not get the job done any faster. In fact the others may just get in the way and slow down the process. Some tasks are not suitable for parallelization.

Other tasks are easily parallelized. Digging a ditch is a task suitable for parallelization. Many people can work beside each other.

This picture shows a form of parallelism called MIMD Multiple Instruction Multiple Data. Each digger is a separate unit and can do different tasks. In this case you can imagine that four diggers may get the job done in about 1/4th the time of a single digger.

With SIMD Single Instruction Multiple Data a single digger might use a shovel like this one.

The SIMD unit can only do one type of computation at a time but it can perform it on several pieces of data in parallel. These types of instructions are common in vector processing units in many processors. This is useful if your data is very regular and you need to do the same operations over and over on a large data set such as in image processing. However for more general computing tasks this model lacks flexibility and will not yield performance gains.

This leads us to the choice to put multiple full CPU subsystems on a single chip creating multicore processors. Multiple cores on one chip can scale performance. Each core is a full CPU and can work independently or in concert with other cores.

Different Types of Multicore Processing

There are different combinations of types of cores you might have on a processor chip as well as how the work is distributed among them.

Homogeneous multicore processors have two or more copies of the same processor core. Each core runs autonomously and may communicate and synchronize with other cores through a number of mechanisms like shared memory or mailbox systems. Each processor has its own registers and function units and may have its own local memory or cache. However what makes this homogeneous is the fact that all of the cores we are looking at are of the same type.

Another type of multiple core chip is referred to as heterogeneous multicore with two or more different kinds of CPU cores. Here the cores may have very different characteristics which make them well suited for different parts of the system processing needs. One example might be a Bluetooth communications chip where one core is dedicated to managing the Bluetooth protocol stack while the other core might manage external communications applications processing the human interface etc. This kind of multiple core chip can be used for applications that need both real time dedicated performance on one core and system management capabilities on the other.

Now we’ll look at how the cores are used. Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) happens when you have more than one core and the cores run the same project code base. Different cores may be running different parts of the code at the same time but the code is built as a single project and is dispatched to the separate cores by some controlling program like a real-time operating system (RTOS). By necessity the cores working this way must be of the same type since they all use the same project code compiled for one type of processor.

Asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) happens when you have more than one core or processor and each processor is running its own project application. The separate cores may synchronize or communicate from time to time but they each have their own code base which they execute. Since they are each running their own project these cores can be of different types or heterogeneous cores. However this is not a requirement. If two or more of the same type of cores run different project code they are homogeneous cores running AMP.

Notice that for SMP operation you must have multiple homogeneous cores since they all run code from the same single project code base. However if you have multiple projects with different code bases for the different cores to run these can be different cores such as in a heterogeneous system. However if the cores are the same that works as well.

Reasons for Using Multicore

Over the last several years Moore’s law coined in the mid 1960’s finally seems to be running out of steam or at least slowing down. Processor clock rates no longer double every 2-3 years and in fact the highest speed CPUs have hit a ceiling in the low single digit GHz range for many years now.

One way to continue pushing the performance envelope is to have more CPU cores working together if you can use them efficiently.

While speeds have plateaued transistor size has continued to shrink. Although slower than in the past the small transistors enable the packing of more logic on a single chip. As a result using these transistors to put several CPU cores on a single chip can take advantage of much faster and wider bus interconnects between the several CPU and memory subsystems.

Heterogeneous asymmetric multiprocessing is very useful where an application has two or more workloads that have very different characteristics and requirements. One might be real-time and interrupt-latency dependent while the other might be more dependent on throughput than response time. This model works very well: For example a device might dedicate one core to manage a communications protocol stack like Bluetooth or Zigbee while another core acts as an application processor running human interactions and overall system management operations. The communications processor being isolated can provide excellent real-time response needed by the protocol stack. In addition the communication software can be certified to a standard making the entire product easy to certify by keeping functional modifications separate from this part of the system.

Challenges Using Multicore

What kinds of challenges are introduced when you put more than one CPU core on a chip? Well let’s dig into it.

A monolithic application or software may not be able use the available computing resources efficiently. You need to organize the application into parallel tasks which can run at the same time to use resources of more than one core. This might require an unfamiliar way for software engineers to think of embedded design. Migrating existing single-loop code might not be very easy. Too few threads or even too many threads can become performance barriers.

Applications that share data structures or I/O devices among multiple threads or processes could have serial bottlenecks. In order to maintain data integrity access to these shared resources might have to be serialized by using locking techniques for example read lock read-write lock write lock spinlock mutex and so on. Inefficiently designed locks could create bottlenecks due to high lock contentions between multiple threads or processes trying to acquire the lock to use a shared resource. This could potentially degrade the performance of the application or software. The performance of an application could even degrade as the number of cores or processors increase if some cores are stalling others waiting on common locks causing two cores to perform worse than one.

An unevenly distributed workload can be inefficient in utilizing computing resources. You might have to break large tasks into smaller ones that can be run in parallel. You might have to change serial algorithms into parallel ones for improving performance and scalability. However if some tasks run very quickly and others take a significant amount of time the quick tasks may spend a significant amount of time waiting for the long tasks to complete. This results in valuable compute resources idling and poor performance scaling.

An RTOS will likely help you but might not solve everything. In an SMP system this is virtually a must to schedule tasks over a number of similar cores. The work to be done can be divided by data or by function. If you divide things up by data chunks each thread might do all of the steps in a pipeline of processing. Alternatively you might have one thread do one step in the function while another does the next step etc. The advantages of one technique over the other will depend on the characteristics of the work to be done.

Debugging in Multicore Environments

The first thing that is useful when debugging a multicore system is visibility of all cores. Ideally we should be able to start and stop cores simultaneously or individually— that is single step one core while others are running or stopped. Multicore breakpoints can be very useful to control the operation of one core predicated on the state of another.

Multicore trace can be very difficult to implement. Managing the high bandwidth of trace information from several cores as well as dealing with potentially different types of trace data from different kinds of cores is a real challenge.

Here is an example of a processor with both heterogeneous and homogeneous multicore implementations. There are two homogeneous core groups one based on a dual Arm Cortex-A57 and the other on a quad Cortex-A53. These groups are homogeneous within themselves but heterogeneous among the two groups.

The CoreSight debug architecture provides protocols and mechanisms for communicating with the debug resources on all of the cores and it falls to the debugger to manage all of this information and parse messages from different cores. The cross trigger interfaces and matrix (CTI CTM) allows simultaneous halting of both cores triggering of trace and more. The trace infrastructure includes the serial (SWD) and parallel (TPIU) trace ports used for smoothing the trace flow and the trace funnels which combine the trace from each source into a single flow. Compared to the dual-core part the diagram shown represents a much more complex chip to control.

The C-SPY Debugger in IAR Embedded Workbench provides support for both symmetrical and asymmetrical multicore debugging. This is enabled through the debugger options on the multicore tab. To enable symmetric multicore debug all that is required is that the number of cores be entered to let the debugger know how many different processors to communicate with. Other IDEs might have similar options available.

On the right (above) you can see a view in the debugger where a 4-core Cortex-A9 SMP cluster has its cores’ status displayed with core number 2 stopped while the other three cores are executing.

An asymmetric multicore system might use a heterogeneous multicore part like the ST STM32H745/755 which has one Cortex-M7 core and a separate Cortex- M4. In this case when the debugger runs it uses two instances of the IDE (Master and Node). One for each core since the two cores are running different project code.

In each instance of the IDE there is status information about the core being controlled as well as the other core controlled in the other window. There are options that can be selected to control the behavior of the debugger so that starting and stopping the cores together or separately is under the control of the developer.

This full control is possible thanks to the cross trigger interfaces (CTI) and cross trigger matrix (CTM) together form the Arm embedded cross trigger feature. There are three CTI components one at system level one dedicated to the Cortex-M7 and one dedicated to the Cortex-M4. The three CTIs are connected to each other via the CTM as illustrated in figure below. The system-level and the Cortex- M4 CTIs are accessible to the debugger via the system access port and associated APB-D. The Cortex-M7 CTI is physically integrated in the Cortex-M7 core and is accessible via the Cortex-M7 access port.

The CTIs allow events from various sources to trigger debug and trace activity. For example a breakpoint reached in one of the processor cores can stop the other processor or a transition detected on an external trigger input could be set to start code trace.

In this example with a heterogeneous multicore processor which has a Cortex-M7 core and a Cortex-M4 core on a single chip two separate programs are used: one to run on the Cortex-M4 and the other running on the Cortex-M7. Each project uses FreeRTOS to manage the software running on the processors. The two cores communicate through a shared memory interface. However the applications both use the FreeRTOS message passing mechanisms to communicate with the other processor and hide the complexity of the underlying mechanisms. So from one CPU’s perspective it is just sending or receiving messages with another task. It is transparent that the other task happens to be running on another CPU core.

The image below is the Workspace explorer widow in the IDE. The overview of two projects is displayed here so you can see the contents of both the Cortex-M7 and Cortex-M4 projects.

By selecting one of the other tabs at the bottom of the window you can switch focus to either the M4 project or the M7 project.

The Cortex-M7 project has a task which sends messages to tasks running on the Cortex-M4. The Cortex-M4 has two instances of a receive task running. The Cortex-M7 has a “check” task which runs periodically to see if things are still running correctly.

Finally the debugger loads both projects. This means that an additional instance of Embedded Workbench for the second debugger is started.

To set up the debugger for asymmetric multiprocessing support we need to designate one project as the “Master” and the other as the “Node” project. In fact the selection is arbitrary and only determines which project has the capability to launch the other on startup.

The “Node” project has no special settings and is unaware that it is running as a “Node” to another project.

In this way when the “Master” project has its debugger started it automatically launches another instance of the IDE to accommodate a second debugger session in which the second project will run.

Summary

Multicore enables performance gains when Moore’s law runs out. However multicore presents debugging challenges and requires specific development approaches so the application can take maximum advantage of the multicore architecture.

Once the debug setup is configured multicore debugging has never been easier. If you have used tools for debugging mono-cores before you will recognize everything included in this and you will probably never understand other people talking about how difficult multicore debugging is for them.

Modern hardware and software tools will help you overcome multicore debugging challenges.

Berkowitz's mugshots / Picture Credit: A& on YouTube

Who is David Berkowitz?

David Berkowitz in an American serial-killer born in Brooklyn in 1953.

He murder six people between 1976 and 1977.

Berkowitz’s crimes led to one of the biggest New York City (NYC) manhunts in the city’s history and caused a mass panic within the area as many citizens feared for their lives.

The oddest part about this case is no doubt the reasoning Berkowitz gave for killing – he claimed he was being ordered to murder by a demon-possessed dog…

Later on in the investigation into his crimes Berkowitz became known as ‘Son of Sam’. This is because Berkowitz stated (after his arrest) that his neighbour Sam Carr was commanding him to kill and communicating these orders through his demon-possessed Labrador Harvey.

Early life and military service

Berkowitz was adopted by a Jewish-American couple Nathan and Pearl Berkowitz when he was just days old.

Berkowitz was very close with his mother and when she passed away when he was a teenager he found it very difficult to deal with.

At 18 years old Berkowitz enlisted in the U.S Army and served in South Korea – he turned out to be quite the skilled marksman.

He finished his military service in 1974 and returned to NYC where he obtained a job with the U.S Postal Service as a letter sorter.

Berkowitz found an apartment in Yokers. However neighbours and co-workers would say that he was a loner and kept himself to himself – hardly surprising since we are talking about a serial killer.

The ‘Son of Sam’ appears

Berkowitz’s rampage began in 1976 when he attacked two teenage girls Jody Valenti and Donna Lauria in the Bronx. He shot at the girls who were sat in Valenti’s parked car – killing Lauria and injuring Valenti.

Not long after his first kill Berkowitz was at it again.

He shot a couple again in a parked car resulting in massive injury to the man’s skull.

Berkowitz also shot at another pair of teenage girls this time while they were on their way home. One girl was unfortunately left paraplegic.

Police had yet to connect these shootings together not realising that they were related.

Another attack occurred in 1977 in which Christine Freund and her fiancé were shot at – Christine was shot in the head twice evidently this proved fatal.

Berkowitz left a clue for the Police seemingly unbeknown to him; he used the same .44 caliber gun in all the shootings. At this time police now seemed to be connecting all the murders and were now facing the idea that they were tackling a serial killer.

Berkowitz struck again when he murdered another young woman this time on her way home from class.

A month or so later Berkowitz attacked another couple Valentina Suriani and her partner Alexander Esau while in their car.

This murder was different however as Berkowitz left a note addressed to NYPD captain Joseph Borrelli – calling himself the Son of Sam for the first time.

He left many letters at the scenes of his murders which led to widespread media coverage. This then instigated a panic among NYC citizens as everyone lived in fear of being Berkowitz’s next victim.

Berkowitz’s last hit occurred in July of 1977 when he shot Stacy Moscowitz and Bobby Violante. Moskowitz was killed and Violante was blinded in one eye and lost most of his vision in the other due to his injuries.

The arrest of Berkowitz

Thankfully during Berkowitz’s last hit there was a witness who saw something pertinent to the investigation.

Berkowitz seemingly unbothered by his arrest / Picture Credit: Real Crime on YouTube

The witness saw a man fleeing from the scene in a car a car with a parking ticket on it. Only a handful of tickets were handed out that day – one of them belonging to Berkowitz.

On the 10th August 1977 Berkowitz was arrested. According to The New York Times Berkowitz said “Well you’ve got me” while being taken into custody.

Sentencing and demon-dog claim

After many psychological evaluations due to his outlandish claim regarding a demon dog telling him to murder Berkowitz was declared ‘competent’ to stand trial.

The year following his arrest in 1978 Berkowitz pled guilty to all six killings and around 1500 fires he had set in and around NYC.

He received 25-years-to-life for each murder.

Berkowitz’s trial got a bit heated as he attempted to jump out of the window of the seventh-floor courtroom after hearing the judge’s ruling.

Since his arrest Berkowitz has retracted his story about a possessed dog telling him to kill as per the order of his neighbour Sam Carr. Berkowitz claimed that this was “all a hoax a silly hoax” in a letter to his psychiatrist Doctor David Abrahamsen.

Harvey the 'demon-dog' / Picture Credit: Real Crime on YouTube

Berkowitz also made declarations that he had been part of a cult that aided him in carrying out the murders and fellow members John and Michael Carr (Sam Carr’s sons) abetted him in this.

During his time in prison Berkowitz has been offered large amounts of money to share his story. Since then however nearly every state (including NYC) passed a law (sometimes known as ‘Son of Sam’ laws) that prevent convicted criminals from profiting financially from books films or other enterprises relating to their crimes.

Berkowitz himself has since turned Christian and prefers to be called Son of Hope rather than Son of Sam as seen in his book Son of Hope: The Prison Journals of David Berkowitz (2006).

This is even featured on a website run by his supporters.

In both the book and on the website Berkowitz provides an apology to the victims and their families. In prison he continues to write journal essays on faith and repentance…

Berkowitz is currently still serving his sentences at the Shawangunk Correctional Facility in Wallkill NY.

Apple will allow Amphetamine an app that keeps Mac computers awake to remain on its App Store after a dispute with its developer over whether it promoted drug use.

On a call on Saturday between William Gustafson the developer and Apple a company representative said the six-year-old app could remain.

""On that call an Apple representative stated that Apple now recognizes that the word 'amphetamine' and the pill icon are being used 'metaphorically' and in a 'medical sense'"" wrote Gustafson on Github.

They cost nearly 200 times more than the pricy new Apple AirPods Max.

Those who had a tough time justifying the Apple AirPods Max’s $550 price tag should stop reading now because this bedazzled aftermarket treatment of the silicon valley giant’s first over-ear headphones steps into six-figure territory.

Luxury gadget company Caviar has plated the outer earcups and other metal fixtures in pure 18-karat gold then wrapped the overhead headband in “rare black crocodile leather.”

Apparently this design is worth nearly 200 times more than the base AirPods Max because the this one-of-one “Golden Black” edition is listed for $108000. “If you appreciate sophisticated design laconicism and innovation this model was created for you” the listing reads.



We assume that Caviar’s custom work doesn’t interfere with core functionality from the removable magnetic ear cushions two-button and Siri-activated controls Apple HomePod hardware or balanced sound tuning but that’s necessarily not a given.

Today the tiny transistors in your smartwatch are capable of more advanced computing than scientists of the 1930s could’ve ever dreamed. Now computational science is on the verge of another revolution: quantum computers.

Quantum computers have long been the holy grail of computer science — these machines in theory would be capable of outperforming any classical computer. While we won’t be popping down to the local Best Buy to purchase our own quantum computers anytime soon advances in this technology are becoming more realistic everyday. Companies like Google and IBM are muscling for quantum supremacy and startups in Silicon Valley are already pumping out quantum algorithms by the thousands.

Science of Quantum Computing

At the center of quantum computing is strange and counterintuitive quantum physics itself which was discovered in the 1930s.

Classical physics the kind that describes how apples fall from trees relies on exact measurable qualities to make calculations. For example the height of an apple tree branch and the weight of the apple. But quantum physics refuses to provide these kinds of qualities. Instead quantum physical properties are measured by probabilities and measurements of uncertainty. Usually this would be a pain. But when it comes to eking out more computing power it can actually come in handy.

Traditional computing measures information in bits that can either represent 0 or 1 and can be combined to create every display and click of your computer. But quantum computing even these binary bits of information aren’t so certain. A quantum bit known as a qubit can represent 0 1 or a state that exists between both. This is known in physics as a superposition.

Taking advantage of this quantum quirk a computation or software execution that would’ve taken several strings of binary bits can now be done using a single qubit. String multiple qubits together and the computational possibilities start to skyrocket.

Why It Matters

Once out of its awkward adolescence these machines will be particularly good at computations like factoring searching and modeling and be able to do so at speeds far faster than any classical computer.

These features won’t necessarily be used to speed up your Google search but they will help scientists make breakthroughs in fields like chemistry and pharmacology. Using quantum-speed chemical modeling it may be possible to develop vaccine candidates in a number of days instead of years.

Quantum information processing will also change how our world is run. Experts believe that quantum computers will be able to easily crack open existing cryptography systems exposing some of the world’s most sensitive encrypted information. To future proof these systems scientists are already looking to develop quantum encryption that will take advantage of quantum characteristics to be impenetrable. Just as a spy might pop a cyanide pill rather than tell you government secrets information encrypted by qubits will disappear as soon as someone attempts to tamper with it.

The Efforts

When it comes to actually designing a quantum computer increasing your number of qubits is the name of the game. In recent years IBM and Google have risen to the top of the pack with their supercooled superconducting qubits. These qubits experience no electrical resistance (which is a property of superconducting materials) and because they’re manufactured instead of naturally collected (such is the case for trapped ion qubits) they can be more easily controlled.

The secret weapons behind quantum computing are notoriously unstable.

IBM’s computer is currently capable of operating 65 qubits and Google’s of operating at 53 which makes them capable of solving thorny calculations in a matter of minutes that would take a classical computer 10000 years. This milestone which Google’s Sycamore computer reached in 2019 is called “quantum supremacy.”

Both companies have already announced plans to build 1000 qubit computers in the coming decades which could bring these already fast minutes-long calculations down to only fractions of a second. But even then you’re more likely to find these computers crunching large data at a server farm than juggling your internet tabs.

The Challenges

But part of what makes actually building a quantum computer like this difficult is that qubits the secret weapon behind these calculations are notoriously unstable. To make calculations researchers have to hold these qubits very precariously in certain energy states but vibration from highways or even ambient room temperature can be enough disturbance to send these qubits into a tizzy. Scientists call this “decoherence.”

One way to control for these disturbances is to keep these computers very close to absolute zero (-450 degrees Fahrenheit) in giant freezers. But this is incredibly costly. Developing so-called “warm” quantum computing — computers that could run at room temperature — could drastically save on costs and space for future computers.

Additionally quantum computers right now have to dedicate a handful of their limited qubits to keeping track of accumulating errors due to those disturbances. Developing more efficient ways to track or circumvent these errors can help return these side-lined qubits to the main game and in turn increasing computing power.

The goal posts may seem far away now but researchers are confident that this quantum computing will one day have a huge impact on our lives.

According to the developer Apple had threatened to remove the app over its name saying that it violated guideline 1.4.3 related to “consumption of tobacco and vape products illegal drugs or excessive amounts of alcohol.”

For those unfamiliar Amphetamine is a free application on the Mac App Store designed to prevent your Mac from going to sleep. It was released in 2014 and has been on the Mac App Store since then but only this week did Apple contact Amphetamine creator William Gustafson with the accusation that the app violated the App Store guidelines.

The guideline in full reads:

Apps that encourage consumption of tobacco and vape products illegal drugs or excessive amounts of alcohol are not permitted on the App Store. Apps that encourage minors to consume any of these substances will be rejected. Facilitating the sale of marijuana tobacco or controlled substances (except for licensed pharmacies) isn’t allowed.

Apple also added specific details:

“Your app appears to promote inappropriate use of controlled substances. Specifically your app name and icon include references to controlled substances pills.”

Apple said that if Gustafson did not change Amphetamine’s name and branding the app would be removed from the Mac App Store on January 12. Gustafson quickly filed an appeal and was contacted by Apple to discuss the situation:

On January 2nd 2021 I received a call from Apple to discuss the results of my appeal. On that call an Apple representative stated that Apple now recognizes that the word “amphetamine” and the pill icon are being used “metaphorically” and in a “medical sense.”

Ultimately Apple backtracked on its stance and Amphetamine will be allowed to remain on the Mac App Store. Nonetheless this is yet another instance of Apple’s inconsistent approach to applying its App Store guidelines. There are numerous other applications on the Mac App Store with references to both legal and illegal drugs in many instances far more blatant than Amphetamine.

Beyoncé just shared never-before-seen footage of her family on Instagram.

Beyoncé's New Year's Day video includes her twins Rumi and Sir.

The New Year is already off to a great start thanks to Beyoncé. Queen Bey released a surprise drop on Jan 1. And no it wasn't music. She shared never-before-seen footage of her kids including twins Rumi and Sir. There may or may not be footage of Rumi singing ""Savage Remix"" and it may or may not have made my day life.

""Cheers to a New Year Beyhive!! 🎆🎊 2020 divided us and united us. Most could not see loved ones and we felt too many losses but we were united by our humanity"" she captioned the video. ""This year for me has been about celebrating joy chasing happiness and living in love.""

She continued ""As we all look forward and pray for new beginnings my wish for you is that you honor yourself and those you love. Celebrate that you are an important individual who contributes to our beautiful collective. Here’s to a better and brighter 2021! Love B.""

The video is exactly four minutes long because of course it is. Beyoncé and Jay-Z have a huge thing for the number four. See Jay's 4:44 album Blue's name (four letters) and Bey and Jay's birthdays on Sept. 4 and Dec. 4 respectively. Her fans have flocked to the video's Instagram comments to express their gratitude. One user wrote ""Thank you so soo much for what you've done this year to uplift our spirit during these horrible moments in human history. I'm very proud of you!! Wishing you a prosperous life and a wonderful new year honey B!! 💓💓💓🐝🐝."" Another added ""SAVAGE REMIX PERFORMANCE IS COMING.""

OK now that really would be the best way to start 2021!

What Happened: Nio officially launched on Sunday a pre-owned service called Nio Certified for buyers of used Nio cars. The company plans an investment of 3 billion yuan ($459.21 million) into this service over five years.

""The launch of NIO Certified marked the closure of the service loop throughout the life cycle of NIO cars"" the company said in a statement.

The implementation comes after six months of trial operation it added.

Nio noted that as of Dec. 31 2020 it had delivered a cumulative 75641 vehicles through the trial program with the total mileage exceeding 1.4 billion kilometers.

How The Used Car Service Works: Nio said it has established a nationwide used car business network providing a full-range of services including vehicle inspection evaluation acquisition and sales.

The company said it offers competitive rates and fast transactions. All pre-owned cars from NIO Certified have passed 286 tests designed for new energy vehicles and come with traceable vehicle information the company said.

NIO Certified allows buyers to return their cars or ask for replacement within seven days after purchase. The cars bought through the service come with other freebies such as an extended warranty from the manufacturer for one year or 30000 kilometers from the date of purchase a free 7 kW Power Home lifetime free roadside rescue lifetime free car connectivity and the same battery-as-a-service program that comes with a new car.

Nio also provides authentic part replacements in used cars and updates their software and hardware before delivery. Battery swaps ensure the health of batteries available in the service network the company said.

NIO Certified also offers benefits for repurchase including NIO value point rewards battery upgrades at a 40% discount and discounts for Nio Pilot and autonomous driving packages.

Why It's Important: NIO Certified is seen as a move to accelerate the company's sales momentum especially at a time when bigger rival Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) has begun to sell its China-made Model Y at a discounted price relative to imported models.

Nio reported for December 121% year-over-year increase in deliveries topping off a year that saw the company rebounding strongly from a COVID-19-induced downturn in the first two months of the year.

Marshawn Lynch

One of the most accomplished running backs in modern history Seahawks great Marshawn Lynch went public this month with news that he’s considering coming out of retirement for the third time—but only if it’s to play for a Super Bowl contender. He certainly doesn’t need to do it for the money.

According to Business Insider which reported on a radio interview involving the NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport Lynch got in the habit of tucking away every dollar of his on-field salary starting when he was drafted in 2007. He lived off the millions he made from several lucrative endorsement deals and his Beast Mode clothing line and saved the rest.

“Marshawn Lynch has a lot of money” Rapoport said. “He hasn’t spent a dime of his actual playing money… ever.”

That was a few years back but if Lynch stuck to his plan he has nearly $56.77 million in career earnings in the bank today.

Kirk Cousins

Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins has some good advice for his colleagues in the NFL. “You don’t know how long you’re going to play” Cousins said in a 2016 interview with the Wall Street Journal. “You’ve got to save every dollar even though you are making a good salary.”

At the time of the interview Cousins drove a 16-year-old GMC Savana van that used to belong to his grandparents.

“It’s better to buy appreciating assets than depreciating” he told the Wall Street Journal. “No yachts no sports cars.”

Not only did he opt against a typical NFL supercar but he also steered clear of the classic celebrity mansion choosing to live in an apartment with a roommate who happened to be an NFL lineman.

The duo apparently furnished the place with hand-me-down furniture and miscellaneous repurposed items they were given by teammates including a bunch of fake trees.

Rob Gronkowski

When Rob Gronkowski retired in 2019 he walked away from his long and illustrious career with every penny of the $54 million he earned since being drafted in 2010. The famed Patriots tight end of course came out of retirement to follow his partner in Super Bowl rings Tom Brady to the Tampa Bay Bucs—but his frugal financial strategy never changed uniforms.

Aside from being an explosive sure-handed touchdown machine Gronk was famous for living off of his endorsement money and not touching a dollar of his outsized salary.

“I’d just say keep it simple” Gronkowski told Business Insider in 2018. “Keep it easy and I’d say keep it simple. Get what you need to be comfortable save the extra.”

Glover Quin

Former Detroit Lions safety Glover Quin retired in 2019 but his notoriously cheap habits are a legend for the ages.

According to ESPN however “cheap” is a synonym for “smart” in Quin’s eyes.

For years Quin still drove the same Yukon Denali he owned when he was drafted in 2009. It’s all part of his 30/70 plan. In his playing years Quin and his family lived off just 30 percent of his salary. For his first three years in the league that was $6000 a month. The rest he invested in stable publicly-traded blue-chip stocks.

The trick is discipline and refusal to deviate.

“I like to call it tunnel vision” Quin told ESPN. “It’s not good to have tunnel vision on the field because you need to know what’s going on around you but when you’re in life especially in this field you need to have tunnel vision because you see so many guys around you buying cars buying jewelry doing this spending money talking about the money that they spend.”

Jordy Nelson

Like Glover Quin former Green Bay Packers wide receiver Jordy Nelson left the game in 2019. Also like Quin Nelson’s legendary thriftiness still lives on.

While calling into the Dan Le Batard radio show Nelson recounted his childhood growing up on a farm in Kansas. Raised to perform difficult and tedious agricultural labor for his family Nelson credited his upbringing for his NFL work ethic. He also admitted to a history of frugality.

“I am extremely cheap” he told the hosts when they asked about his reputation as a penny pincher.

Nelson told the hosts about a habit he had of staying in his hotel room and eating NFL-provided snacks so he could keep the per diem money he and his teammates receive to dine on the road.

The flabbergasted host said “Wait a minute Nelson you’ve got a $39 million contract that came with like a $12 million bonus. You’re hoarding the per diem so that you can just have the team snack?”

“Yeah” the famously frugal celebrity responded.

Gallagher & Co (AJG): A Strategic SWOT Insight,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co's robust brokerage segment continues to drive revenue growth.

Strategic acquisitions bolster the company's service offerings and geographic reach.

Global economic volatility and competitive pressures present ongoing challenges.

Technological advancements and ESG initiatives offer pathways for future growth.

Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (NYSE:AJG) a leading global insurance brokerage and consulting firm filed its 10-Q on May 1 2024 revealing key financial and operational data. The company's primary revenue streams stem from its brokerage segment with significant contributions from its corporate segment including clean energy investment and other investment income. The United States remains AJG's largest market complemented by substantial operations in Australia Bermuda Canada the Caribbean New Zealand and the United Kingdom. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats as presented in the recent SEC filings providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of AJG's market position and potential investment value.

Decoding Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (AJG): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Robust Brokerage Segment: AJG's brokerage segment is a cornerstone of its financial stability consistently generating the majority of the company's revenue. This strength is underpinned by a diverse client base ranging from middle-market entities to individuals and a wide array of insurance products. The segment's success is driven by AJG's ability to negotiate favorable terms with insurance companies reflecting its strong market position and negotiation leverage.

Strategic Acquisitions: AJG has a proven track record of successful acquisitions such as Willis Re Buck and Cadence Insurance which have expanded its service offerings and geographic footprint. These strategic moves not only enhance AJG's revenue streams but also provide cross-selling opportunities and access to new markets contributing to the company's growth and competitive advantage.

Financial Performance: The company's financial health is solid with the latest 10-Q filing indicating a healthy balance sheet. AJG's revenue and net income figures underscore its financial resilience and operational efficiency which are critical in maintaining investor confidence and supporting strategic initiatives.

Weaknesses

Integration Risks: While AJG's acquisition strategy is a strength it also poses integration risks. The assimilation of large acquisitions requires significant resources and management attention and there is always the potential for unforeseen liabilities such as cybersecurity issues or compliance violations. These risks could lead to financial strain and distract from core business operations.

Story continues

Dependence on Economic Conditions: AJG's performance is closely tied to global economic conditions. Factors such as high inflation increased interest rates and geopolitical instability can impact the insurance industry's risk-taking capacity and client demand for AJG's services. Economic downturns could lead to reduced revenues and pressure on profit margins.

Competition and Market Pressures: The insurance brokerage industry is highly competitive with constant pressure from both established players and new entrants. AJG must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its market share which requires ongoing investment in technology and talent retention.

Opportunities

Technological Advancements: AJG has the opportunity to leverage technology data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance client services and internal efficiencies. By investing in technology-based solutions AJG can differentiate itself from competitors and offer value-added services to its clients.

ESG Initiatives: There is a growing emphasis on environmental social and governance (ESG) factors in the corporate world. AJG can capitalize on this trend by integrating ESG considerations into its service offerings and operations potentially attracting clients who prioritize sustainability and responsible business practices.

Emerging Markets: AJG can expand its presence in emerging markets where insurance penetration is typically lower and growth prospects are higher. By establishing a foothold in these regions AJG can diversify its revenue base and tap into new client segments.

Threats

Global Economic Volatility: AJG operates in a global environment that is subject to economic and geopolitical volatility. Events such as recessions political unrest or trade wars can disrupt markets and negatively impact AJG's operations and financial performance.

Regulatory Changes: The insurance industry is heavily regulated and changes in laws or enforcement policies can have significant implications for AJG's business model. Compliance with new regulations can be costly and time-consuming potentially affecting profitability.

Cybersecurity Risks: As a company that relies on data and technology AJG is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. A significant data breach or cyber-attack could damage the company's reputation result in financial losses and lead to legal and regulatory consequences.

In conclusion Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (NYSE:AJG) exhibits a strong market position with a robust brokerage segment and a strategic approach to acquisitions. However the company must navigate integration risks economic dependencies and competitive pressures. Opportunities in technology ESG initiatives and emerging markets present avenues for growth while global economic volatility regulatory changes and cybersecurity risks pose significant threats. AJG's forward-looking strategies including leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses will be crucial in maintaining its competitive edge and ensuring long-term success.

""La situation sanitaire va rester difficile dans les prochaines semaines et va nous conduire à prolonger (...) la prime de 4.000 euros (par an) pour l'embauche en CDD de plus de trois mois ou en CDI d'un jeune de moins de 26 ans et les 5.000 ou 8.000 euros d'aides pour un contrat d'apprentissage ou de professionnalisation"" assure la ministre.

""Les chiffres montrent que notre plan porte ses fruits"" estime-t-elle à propos d'une batterie de mesures lancée en juillet alors que la crise sanitaire liée à l'épidémie de Covid-19 a très durement touché l'emploi des jeunes. Elle cite 1.052 million de jeunes ""recrutés en CDD d'au moins trois mois ou en CDI"" entre août et fin novembre soit ""presqu'autant qu'en 2019"". ""Plus de 220.000 primes ont déjà été distribuées"" ajoute Mme Borne rappelant le succès inédit de l'apprentissage avec 440. 000 contrats signés en 2020 contre 353.000 en 2019.

Vers un assouplissement du télétravail

Interrogée par ailleurs sur l'assoupissement du télétravail qu'elle avait déjà évoqué la ministre a confirmé qu'elle souhaitait revenir à une règle d'""au moins une journée par semaine"" de présence dans l'entreprise. ""Nos études montrent que plus de six salariés sur dix en télétravail à 100% depuis novembre souhaitent revenir dans l'entreprise au moins une journée par semaine"" explique Élisabeth Borne assurant que ""plus de la moitié disent souffrir d'isolement"".

Elle promet d'évoquer cette question lundi lors d'une rencontre avec les partenaires sociaux pour adapter à nouveau ""le protocole sanitaire à partir du 7 janvier"". ""Il s'agira de continuer à recourir fortement au télétravail pour lutter contre l'épidémie tout en permettant à ceux qui en expriment le besoin de revenir une journée par semaine en entreprise"" conclut-elle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0ZXVyYXV0b21vYmlsZS5iZS9hY3R1LWF1dG8vbm91dmVhdXgtbW9kZWxlcy9rb2VuaWdzZWdnLWplc2tvLWFic29sdXQtcHJpbWUtdml0ZXNzZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nouveau modèle / Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut prime à la vitesse,"C’est le constructeur qui l’affirme la Jesko Absolut sera sa création la plus rapide en vitesse de pointe de manière définitive. Elle a été conçue spécialement dans ce but et se différencie de la Jesko « normale » par une recherche de finesse aérodynamique extrême tout en assurant la stabilité nécessaire.

""La Jesko Absolut avec son coefficient de traînée étonnamment bas de 0278 Cd combiné à ses caractéristiques aérodynamiques optimisées pour la stabilité à haute vitesse ses caractéristiques de conduite quotidienne et son espace pour les bagages font de la Jesko Absolut un vaisseau-fusée terrestre déterminé à atteindre une vitesse inouïe en battant des records"" (Christian von Koenigsegg)

Traînée mini vitesse maxi

On l’aura compris la Jesko Absolut bénéficie d’un traitement aérodynamique destiné à optimiser au maximum sa vitesse de pointe en assurant cependant la stabilité de la voiture en toutes circonstances. Les différences avec la Jesko « normale » se situent donc principalement au niveau de la carrosserie puisque la puissance reste à 1600 ch fournis par le V8 biturbo (alimenté en E85) et est transmise aux roues arrières via une boîte robotisée à 9 rapports du système Light Speed Transmission (LST) développé et produit par Koenigsegg qui permet de changer de vitesse en un temps pratiquement nul de n'importe quelle vitesse à n'importe quelle autre quel que soit le nombre de rapports sautés. Toutefois derrière ce joli discours aucune donnée concrète n’est annoncée quant à la vitesse maxi ou les capacités d’accélération.

Comme à son habitude le patron de la marque préfère se fendre de déclarations imagées qui suffisent à faire vibrer les fans de ses créations. Pour détailler les deux dérives « en aileron de requin » qui ornent le capot il évoque les empennages d’un chasseur F-15 tout en précisant qu’ils permettent de nettoyer le flux d’air vers la poupe allongée pour stabiliser la voiture. Toujours dans cette volonté d’optimiser la vitesse maxi les roues arrières voient leurs jantes carénées tandis que la suspension avant est plus compacte et le capot modifié pour favorisé l’écoulement de l’air. Du coup il est possible de ranger le toit targa sous le capot avant.

Générant moins d’appui et nantie d’une suspension assouplie l’Absolut se veut plus confortable et utilisable au quotidien. Ce qui ne l’empêche pas de se montrer la digne héritière de la One : 1 en affichant un rapport poids-puissance de 1kg/ch même avec les pleins deux passagers et leurs bagages. Ce qui reste un exploit unique à ce jour pour un véhicule homologué pour un usage sur la voie publique !",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhZGVwZWNoZS5mci8yMDIxLzAxLzAzL2Fwb2xvZ2llLWR1LXRlcnJvcmlzbWUtZXQtY29saXMtc3VzcGVjdC11bi10cmFpbi1hcnJldGUtZXQtZXZhY3VlLWVuLWdhcmUtZGFnZW4tOTI5MDE2Mi5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apologie du terrorisme et colis suspect : un train arrêté et évacué en gare d'Agen,"l'essentiel Le train assurant la liaison Toulouse - Paris a été arrêté en urgence en gare d'Agen et évacué de l'ensemble de ses passagers. Un colis suspect y avait été repéré et des propos faisant l'apologie du terrorisme auraient été tenus. Un important dispositif de police a été mobilisé.

Ce samedi 2 janvier peu après 20h30 l'hôtel de police de Paris reçoit une alerte de Paris des services compétents. Un colis suspect a été repéré dans un train parti de Toulouse et qui assure la liaison jusqu’à la capitale. De plus des propos sur l'apologie du terrorisme auraient été tenus dans un des wagons de ce train circulant en soirée.

Immédiatement un important dispositif est mobilisé en gare d'Agen où plusieurs fonctionnaires de police interviennent dès le train s'arrête sur les quais. La gare de la ville préfecture est bien entendu évacuée en urgence. Les passagers du train sont invités à quitter le plus rapidement les rames.

Une trousse de...maquillage

Une patrouille intervient pour repérer le colis suspect. Rapidement ce risque est écarté. Le colis suspect est en fait qu'une trousse contenant uniquement du maquillage.

Concernant les actes d'apologie du terrorisme là encore il n'en serait rien. Les propos lâchés dans le wagon - une fois traduits - signifieraient ""je te jure c'est la vérité"". Une prononciation qui aurait prêté à confusion selon les premiers éléments.

En tout cas l'histoire a été prise très au sérieux à Agen. Cependant les deux contrôleurs sont restés à quai et ont été entendus sur ce qui s'était passé dans ce train entre Toulouse et Paris.

Quatre personnes interpellées

De plus quatre personnes ont été interpellées par les forces de l'ordre. Deux ont pu être interrogées par les enquêteurs et ont été relâchées dans la soirée. Deux autres ont été placées en cellule de dégrisement en attendant que leur état permette de les entendre.

An Israeli official also confirmed the negotiations had stalled and described them as being in “crisis.”

For months the negotiations aimed at achieving a cease-fire and a release of hostages have made little progress but signs the two sides were coming closer to an agreement appeared over the last week. Israel backed off some of its long-held demands and a top Hamas official said the group was studying the latest Israeli offer with a “positive spirit.”

But the setback over the weekend meant Palestinians living in miserable conditions in Gaza would not experience an imminent reprieve and the families of hostages held by militants would have to wait longer for the freedom of their loved ones.

Warren Buffett spoke candidly to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders Saturday about a future when he's no longer there to lead the sprawling conglomerate he built appearing solemn at times as he pondered his advanced age and reflected on his late friend and business partner Charlie Munger. The death of Munger last year brought the question of succession to the forefront of many investors' minds at this year's shareholders meeting. At times Buffett who's about to turn 94 in August seemed to mull over his own mortality even as he said he was feeling fine to continue running the business. He spoke from the dais at Omaha's CHI Health Center where the meeting was held with his lieutenants Greg Abel Berkshire Hathaway Energy chairman and Buffett's heir apparent as well as Ajit Jain vice chairman of insurance operations. ""We'll see how the next management plays the game out at Berkshire [but] fortunately you don't have too long to wait on that"" Buffett said. ""I feel fine but I know a little about actuarial tables.""

""I shouldn't be taking on any four-year employment contracts like several people are doing in this world at an age when you can't be quite that sure where you're going to be in four years"" he added. Berkshire's future The Oracle of Omaha provided more clarity than he'd had in the past on the leadership structure at Berkshire going forward disclosing for example that Abel will have final say when it comes to the conglomerate's investing decisions. ""I would leave the capital allocation to Greg and he understands businesses extremely well"" Buffett said Saturday. ""If you understand businesses you'll understand common stocks.""

Abel in turn reassured investors that the culture at Berkshire will remain the same as well as attract new people going forward. ""I think we have a very special company at Berkshire"" he said adding ""that's not going to change."" Berkshire's architect Munger's absence was felt deeply by many investors at this year's shareholder meeting. The business titan was known for his sharp wit and wisdom and over the decades had drawn uproarious laughter from the crowd with his many humorous asides. Some of those zingers and insights were highlighted in a video tribute at the start of this year's meeting. At the 2015 meeting for example he observed ""Warren if people weren't so often wrong we wouldn't be so rich."" As the lights of the arena came on at the conclusion of the short movie some tens of thousands of investors got to their feet for a standing ovation.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: New data released today shows that California continues to have the largest market share of tourism in the nation with travel spending in the state reaching an all-time record high of $150.4 billion last year.

SAN FRANCISCO – Governor Gavin Newsom and Visit California CEO Caroline Beteta today announced that travel spending in the state reached an all-time high of $150.4 billion last year surpassing the record $144.9 billion spent in 2019. This comes after the state retained its title as the world’s 5th largest economy and had a population increase both of which are directly tied to California’s nation-leading tourism and entertainment industries.

WHAT GOVERNOR NEWSOM SAID: “From our world-renowned coastline to the world’s tallest trees to our iconic cities and theme parks California is the nation’s coming attraction. Visitors from all over the world are coming here to experience the wonder of the Golden State boosting our economy and creating good-paying jobs for years to come.”

BY THE NUMBERS: The Economic Impact of Travel in California prepared by Dean Runyan Associates and released by Visit California detailed spending that is 3.8% higher than 2019 and 5.6% higher than 2022. Spending exceeded 2019 levels in a majority of counties.

WHAT VISIT CALIFORNIA CEO BETETA SAID: “California tourism is back where it belongs – setting records and providing for the workers business owners and all Californians who depend on the travel industry as a cornerstone of our state’s economy. The industry has once again proved its ability to recover from any challenge whether it be economic or environmental. California continues to be the largest most diverse and most resilient tourism economy in the United States.”

WHAT THIS MEANS: California has the largest market share of tourism in the nation. The new travel-spending record generated $12.7 billion in state and local tax revenue by visitors in 2023 marking a 3% increase over 2019. Tourism created 64900 new jobs in 2023 bringing total industry employment to 1155000.

California remains the 5th largest economy in the world for the seventh consecutive year with a nominal GDP of nearly $3.9 trillion in 2023 and a growth rate of 6.1% since the year prior according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. California’s per capita GDP is the second largest among large economies.

In addition to visiting the state more people are moving to California. Earlier this week Governor Newsom announced the state’s population is increasing for the first time since the pandemic.

The Golden State which has the most equitable tax system in the entire country is #1 in the nation for new business starts #1 for access to venture capital funding and the #1 state for tourism spending manufacturing high-tech and agriculture.

All the fake-woke corporations and companies are launching their campaigns to uplift Black people one month out of the year. At The Frontline we center Black leadership and voices all year long; we don’t need Black History Month to do that. That being said we’ll never turn down an opportunity to celebrate everything Black.

Welcome to The Frontline where we’re kicking off Black History Month with some facts. I’m Yessenia Funes climate editor of Atmos. Let’s start off this month by laying out what’s what. The reality is that Black people in the U.S. and around the world care tremendously about our ecological crises despite white environmentalist stereotypes.

In the U.S. Black people have been at the forefront of environmental advocacy. Their work around civil rights and pollution wasn’t always viewed as environmental stewardship but it was.

These days we have Black voters in Georgia to thank for a Democratic-controlled Senate that finally offers the U.S. a fighting chance at passing comprehensive climate legislation. If we step out for a bird’s eye view Black people’s diets and energy habits on average contribute less greenhouse gases and air pollution than white people in the U.S. Meanwhile they’re disproportionately at risk from both of these dangers.

Ain’t that some shit?

A poll released in March 2020 by the Environmental Defense Fund found that a majority of Black Americans are already feeling the impacts of climate change. I’m talking about severe heat and extreme weather. And 57 percent believe the situation is worsening. On the bright side 77 percent of the Black people surveyed support a clean energy transition. This is a contingent of people who don’t have the luxury to deny climate science. They see the realities in person.

We’re finally witnessing a union between racial justice and traditional environmental groups—and an understanding that there’s some serious value in learning from Black communities. Yes they are on course to face some of the gravest harms from climate change. (Remember Hurricane Katrina?) Beyond that expected devastation however is essential knowledge and an awareness of what Black communities will need to weather the next storm. There are countless leaders who are paving the way for Black leadership in the climate space and creating space for even more leaders to come up.

I’m thinking of Mustafa Santiago Ali. Or Tamara Toles O’Laughlin. How about the Green New Deal champion Rhiana Gunn-Wright? And newly elected Rep. Cori Bush. There are more: Sean Watkins a climate solutions storyteller; climate writer Mary Annaïse Heglar; Brentin Mock whose writing inspired me to jump on this beat; or Grist’s Andrew Simon whose mentorship helped make my career possible.

So many Black creatives writers scientists thought leaders and advocates are making a carbon-free future possible through their everyday work.

Since the field’s official 1958 emergence engineers have helped humans travel — commercially militarily and exploratively. Aerospace industry advancements have improved how quickly safely and efficiently this has been made possible. They have also paved the way for numerous endeavors not previously imaginable.

Only three years would elapse before we turned our attention to the stars. Accordingly manned spaceflight kicked off in 1961 with Yuri Gagarin’s interstellar ascent. Space was the final frontier — a medium through which countries could display their technical prowess — and global powers poured billions into the space race. That reinvigorated space exploration has taken a different form today.

Looking at Modern Aerospace Pursuits

The world’s current concept of space travel wouldn’t exist without advancements in aerospace engineering. Spaceflights while largely safe are still relatively risky for a variety of reasons. Crew members rely on radiation shielding heat shielding continuous oxygen flow and other exterior-interior structural elements. There are human lives aboard — as with any aerial flight — meaning shuttle designs must be robust. These developments require a few things:

Ample amounts of strong expensive materials

Multiple prototypes and viability tests

An immense amount of intellectual and financial resources

Space missions have extended beyond simple proofs of concept. Oftentimes it is expected that astronauts remain in orbit longer making their duties even more complex. Aerospace engineers have shifted their gaze increasingly inward towards the cabin. Crew members now require more livable spaces with noise isolation comfort lighting and mental health coming to the forefront. These needs are compounded as crews push deeper into the galactic unknown.

In the early days of space travel governments were expected to provide these essentials. Private companies are leading today’s rejuvenated efforts. SpaceX and its engineering team have redefined traditional spaceflight from accessibility to execution.

The Rise of SpaceX

United States-based company SpaceX was founded by Elon Musk in 2002 as a privately-funded venture with the goal to further commercialize space flight. A central goal in that mission is making spaceflight more affordable something which has never been done before.

The engineering team at SpaceX has since implemented cost-saving measures to make this possible. Its Merlin engine was cheaper to design and assemble than those of competitors. Furthermore reusability became a central tenet of SpaceX’s strategy. This eliminated the need to construct expensive new launch vehicles. SpaceX became the first private company to achieve spaceflight in 2008. It also launched a nine-engine craft (Falcon 9) into orbit in 2010 after earning over $1 billion in the NASA funding and federal contracts.

SpaceX’s Dragon space capsule blasted into orbit before making its terrestrial return. Dragon became the first commercial craft to dock with the International Space Station (ISS) just two years later. Naturally this meant that Dragon was built stoutly enough to handle the physical rigors of repeated space travel without disintegrating. Recent Dragon missions and those involving other rockets have completed successfully proving that modern aerospace engineering has reached a new pinnacle.

SpaceX is now focusing efforts on commercial space travel with a plan to make rapid travel between Earth and settlements on Mars possible by the mid-2020s. Engineers must devise a new class of crafts capable of transporting humans skyward time after time. Note that these vessels will be subject to similar stressors upon launch and reentry. Teams will once again innovate in the areas of strength efficiency and speed to realize these goals.

Novel Approaches to CAD CAE and CAM

The need for creative thinking in the aerospace field is of utmost importance. However no job is done without the proper tools — tools that make sound design possible while respecting the variables unique to spaceflight. With programs such as Autodesk’s Integrated CAD CAM and CAE software Fusion 360 engineers now have the ability to create dynamic projects on a single platform and streamline their development process making projects — like the ones being done at SpaceX — possible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vcGFyYW1ldHJpYy1hcmNoaXRlY3R1cmUuY29tL2FndWFob2phLXByb2dyYW1tYWJsZS1iaW9jb21wb3NpdGVzLWRpZ2l0YWxseS1mYWJyaWNhdGVkLWJ5LW5lcmktb3htYW4tYW5kLW1pdC1tZWRpYS1sYWIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aguahoja: Biocomposites Digitally Fabricated by Neri Oxman and MIT,"A secondary skin developed and programmed by Neri Oxman and MIT using water-based biocomposites for digital design and fabrication. The Aguahoja project has exhibited a pavilion and a series of artefacts erected from molecular components found in tree branches insect exoskeletons and our own bones. They use natural ecosystems inspired for a material production process that produces no waste.

The Design Approach

The design approach facilitates close integration between material creation and robotic fabrication. The project consents creation of objects across varying scales. Besides it examines the importance of water in Nature’s systems the birth cycle adaptation and decay. This allows the re-use of materials in the whole composition. Incorporating inspiration of growth forests and coral reefs waste virtuals non-exists The design team compared to the waste production rates of current building industries where objects expire and materials extracted from the earth. Indeed their creation can faster be replenished.

Aguahoja uses biocomposites composed of the widely used materials on our planet: cellulose chitosan pectin and many more. They digitally fabricate particularly to weave materials with specific properties adapting in response to heat and humidity. In death the materials dissociate in water thus eliminating production waste and fuelling life.

The Aguahoja Pavilion

The Aguahoja Pavilion continues its research on the application of environment-responsive biocomposites leading to the first architectural-scale iteration. Vertically upright in five meters the structure’s skin indeed composes flexible biocomposite with functionally graded mechanical chemical and optical properties. Cellulose and chitosan allow for creating a generative surface pattern to additionally alter panels’ stiffness and colour by robotic deposition. Moreover when exposed to rain the skin degrades programmatically. This restores its constituent building blocks to their natural ecosystem. This cycle continues naturally in synthesis.

Minute alterations to the molecular composition of biocomposites induce dramatic impact on their appearance and behaviour. The Aguahoja Artifacts subsequently represent years of exploration into parameterizing material chemistry. Especially developing a library of functional biocomposites. The pieces in the collection appear diverse in presence yet all compose the same components; chitosan cellulose pectin and water.

The Aguahoja Artifacts

The Aguahoja Artifacts forms an array and behaviours exhibited by these pieces. They reflect their manner of expression in Nature. Furthermore a material such as chitin can compose both the exoskeletons of crustaceans and fungi’ cell walls. In contrast to steel and concrete the composites indulge in constant dialogue with their environment. Some artefacts exude dramatic changes conforming in response to humidity and heat. Others darken or lighten as the season’s transform. Some seem brittle and transparent with glassy texture while others remain flexible and tough like leather. Despite the emergent diversity these artefacts share a standard quality mediated by humidity. As in death they dissociate in water and return to the ecosystem.

“Derived from organic matter printed by a robot and shaped by water this work points toward a future where the grown and the made unite.”

It can be tough to narrow down which one works best for you — especially since they all offer different features.

Gmail has been the go-to for many thanks to an easy-to-navigate interface and simple chat feature. But while Gmail may be one of the top email choices Google is notorious for collecting tons of user data. This massive tech company tracks almost everything users do search for or use.

The automatic data gathering that occurs in Gmail is going to change shortly though. Google is rolling out new smart features that will change the way you look at this email service. If you’re concerned about the data collection that comes with using Gmail you’re going to want to know about these changes.

Smart features coming to Gmail

Google announced on its blog recently some new changes to Gmail. These changes will give Gmail users more control over the data gathering done by apps like Gmail Chat and Meet.

Gmail users will be able to opt out of having their data used by the smart features in Gmail and Gmail-associated apps. This includes automatic email filtering and categorization Smart Compose summary cards and automatic calendar entries.

These smart features which can give you directions in Google Maps to your restaurant reservations or summaries of your emails are admittedly handy for users. Who doesn’t want to get automatic directions to where you’re having lunch with a colleague?

But while these features are useful they also gather a ton of data and hand it over to Google which is less than ideal. There have been concerns for years about the volume of data Google is gathering on users and most people want to limit that whenever possible.

Gmail users have always had the option to toggle these features on or off but the new update will also disable the background data processing that makes them possible. This gives Gmail users the option to fully and completely opt out of smart feature data processing while using Gmail and Gmail-associated apps.

There’s a downside though. While this will stop your data from being used by Google users who opt out of the data processing for smart features won’t be able to use any of the smart features offered in Gmail or the other apps.

You will have the option to limit data gathering by Gmail Chat and Meet that powers other Google products too. This includes data that powers the Assistant which displays bill due date reminders and other important information along with Google Maps and GPay’s loyalty cards and tickets.

According to Google the settings changes were “designed to reduce the work of understanding and managing that process in view of what we’ve learned from user experience research and regulators’ emphasis on comprehensible actionable user choices over data.” In other words they’re meant to give you more control over whether your data is gathered and used by Google.

When will these new changes roll out?

According to Google these changes aren’t active for all Gmail users just yet but will be in the “coming weeks.”

If you opt out of any of these features you can always enable them again in Gmail’s settings. However you won’t be able to enable or disable any of the features individually.

You won’t be able to toggle it on for Smart Compose but turn off the data processing for summary cards or calendar entries for example. It’s all or nothing because these features are all powered by the same data.

With the backdrop of a fast-changing regulatory landscape evolving technology and volatile operating conditions the CFO should expand this role to encompass helping the whole organisation to make better use of data to inform strategic and operational decision-making.

The CFO is one of the natural leaders for a big data strategy given that the financial leader will typically already have put analytics tools in place to gain visibility into financial metrics. The finance function also has good line of sight of key performance indicators across sales the supply chain procurement and so forth.

The challenge increasingly is not about accessing data that reflects the organisation’s key operational and financial metrics but finding ways to surface the data that will be most useful in driving business performance. By tapping into the right data CFOs can help their organisations to rapidly respond to changing market conditions identify new trends and drive growth in revenues and profits.

To chart a path for profitable growth finance departments must thus become masters of processing and extracting actionable insights from large amounts of data. They need to look beyond historical financial data towards working with the CIO and business to put in place platforms that generate insights in real-time and offer predictive intelligence.

To step into this big data future however CFOs should first ensure that they have automated statutory reporting and generating financial statements so that they can focus on finding new ways to add value to the business.

An important foundation for this capability is a modern integrated business solution that provides people in the business with fast and easy access to financial information.

Inflexible legacy infrastructures should be replaced by scalable technology that can provide a holistic view of processes and data right across the business and its supply chain while giving easier access to information to the people and systems that need it. Cloud-based platforms can speed up and reduce the risks of modernising the IT infrastructure.

Those CFOs that leverage data effectively and embrace change at speed will be well positioned to help guide their organisations through times of change and turbulence. But their role goes beyond using the data themselves towards becoming champions of a data-driven enterprise where access to insights is democratised.

Automatic for the people

CFOs and their organisations should invest in ensuring that real-time data and real-time analytics are available at the points where operational decisions are made. This may involve enabling machine learning and AI-powered systems and devices to make decisions in real-time speeding up processes and lowering costs through automation.

It can facilitate faster response to emerging business needs as well as monitoring advanced metrics for constant optimisation of costs and business performance.

Self-service business intelligence tools that allow people to interrogate data using familiar interfaces such as Excel or to look at visual representations of business trends in graphs and tables can be used to help those at the coalface make faster and better operational decisions.

In future AI and natural language interfaces (speech recognition or chatbots for example) could even be used to help people at all levels of the organisation to make sense of data.

Finance has always been a reporting function but senior finance executives understand that today it needs to be a data-driven insights centre driving business initiative and strategy. With an increase in the volume of data this requires new focus and capabilities. This investment is one that will pay off in the longer term.",,,

As the iconic company turns 100 what lies ahead?,"The iconic Pep Boys chain founded in Philadelphia will turn 100 next year. Its latest owner billionaire corporate raider owner Carl Icahn is facing turbulent financial times. Read more

The New Year marks 100 years since a group of World War I veterans opened the first Pep Boys at 63rd and Market Streets where Philadelphia’s suburbs began.

Its stores and garages festooned with statues and cartoons of founders Manny Moe and Jack sell car parts mount tires and change oil for an auto-dependent nation. Its block-long headquarters and warehouse at 3111 W. Allegheny Ave. is a city landmark.

But where is it bound?

Corporate raider Carl Icahn who has owned Pep Boys since 2016 turns 85 in February. He has been selling off businesses including Federal-Mogul the big car-parts maker Icahn once said fit so well with his part stores and repair shops.

Last month S&P cut its credit rating of his holding company Icahn Enterprises to BB (a “speculative” or junk rating) requiring higher interest payments to support Icahn-style borrowing. The rating firm’s analysts noted that too many of Icahn’s businesses including Icahn Automotive which combines Pep Boys and smaller auto chains were losing money.

Well before the S&P downgrade Icahn folded Pep Boys and three other companies (including Horsham-based Aamco Total Auto Care the transmissions chain) into Icahn Automotive Group — before cutting that into two new companies separating the stores from the garages.

Sales for the 2000-store Icahn auto group including Pep Boys’ 1000 stores fell to $660 million last quarter from $744 million a year earlier. Most of the drop was due to store closings group chief financial officer Sung Cho told investors in an October conference call.

And Icahn recently sold Pep Boys’ Allegheny Avenue headquarters though for now it is leasing back some of it. Spokeswoman Arianna Sherlock would not say how much space it has leased or say for how long. Nor would she say how many of the 500 jobs at the headquarters when Icahn bought Pep Boys were still based there.

Sherlock said the billionaire Icahn was still putting money into Pep Boys investing in technology to permit customers to order parts online or to book car repairs that way. too.

“We remain committed to the Philadelphia area” which still “has one of the densest Pep Boys store-footprints in the country” she said.

“We look forward to the company celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2021 as a Philadelphia-based business” said Kevin Lessard spokesman for the city Commerce Department with a hopeful tone. He acknowledged that city officials haven’t met with Pep Boys executives since 2018.

When Icahn paid just more than $1 billion for Pep Boys to outbid tire giant Bridgestone-Firestone four years ago city leaders were upbeat. They hoped they could not just hold on to the company’s main office but also even gain jobs.

They saw Icahn’s purchase as a step to reverse the exodus that has turned Philadelphia once a center of American manufacturing finance and energy companies into just another branch town with less than its share of corporate headquarters and the jobs taxes and charity they provide.

Japanese-owned Bridgestone-Firestone was expected to run Pep Boys out of its U.S. headquarters in Tennessee. When Icahn won out Mayor Jim Kenney dispatched his Commerce Department to urge Icahn to enhance the Allegheny Avenue headquarters — and even move some of his own investment activities here from high-cost Manhattan.

“The city did reach out and we really appreciate it” Pep Boys general counsel Brian Zuckerman said at the time shortly before he and other Philadelphia-based Pep Boys executives went off the payroll. Some were replaced by executives with Icahn’s smaller AutoPlus chain in Georgia.

Icahn also sent his longtime lawyer Daniel A. Ninivaggi to run Icahn Automotive. Though based in New York Ninivaggi pledged to “spend a lot of time in Philly” to keep the Pep Boys “core team” here and even to increase local staff. He also added parts from Icahn’s Federal-Mogul manufacturing group to Pep Boys shelves.

And then in 2018 Icahn Enterprises sold Federal-Mogul to Tenneco Corp. for $2.5 billion (plus debt) while plowing cash into the oil business which Icahn expected would gain value during the pro-petroleum Trump administration. Ninivaggi departed Icahn Automotive and Pep Boys.

Brian Kaner chief executive for the auto-service wing has an office in Philadelphia but lists his home on social media as Indianapolis. Christopher Cox his opposite number at the parts division works out of Georgia.

The top tech officer serving both companies remains primarily based in Philadelphia. But the chief financial legal workforce and marketing officers work in places ranging from New York to Detroit.

As for Icahn himself he left New York City for Florida in 2019 citing high taxes as a reason.

Icahn has continued restructuring its auto businesses Icahn Enterprises chief executive Keith Cozza told investors in the October conference call. Cozza is now working closely with Icahn’s son Brett who returned to the company this fall and is now his father’s official successor.

Last month after cutting Icahn Enterprises’ credit rating S&P analysts noted the company’s debt had doubled over the last year even after Icahn pumped in an additional $750 million in cash. This partly offset falling oil prices on its oil-refining investments.

In addition S&P noting the enterprise’s ongoing losses and shrinkage through asset sales deemed that it no longer had a “satisfactory” risk profile only a “fair” one. The asset shedding included Icahn’s sale this year of most of his stake in casino giant Caesar’s Entertainment

Pep Boys has plans for celebrating its 100th year said spokeswoman Sherlock. The company she said has put out a new “commemorative calendar that takes a trip through the decades using the vehicles and milestones of the times.”

And she said it will continue to back community activities in the city where it was founded.",,,,,,,,,

City Council OK’d the $93926 purchase of two 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles at its last meeting in December.

“The Mach-E is an all-electric small crossover vehicle that is new on the market” Matt Kulhanek the city’s fleet manager told council in a memo noting the city is purchasing all-wheel-drive models for winter weather conditions.

The vehicles which are expected to arrive later in 2021 could go about 210 miles per charge Kulhanek said.

“As a fully electric vehicle this purchase is consistent with many of the city’s established sustainability efforts including the Green Fleets Policy and the A2Zero Plan” Kulhanek wrote.

The city has been gradually shifting toward all-electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles as part of its goal of achieving communitywide carbon-neutrality by 2030.

The city’s sustainability office is putting $30549 toward the initial EV purchases though the police department will be responsible for the increased fleet replacement costs each year Kulhanek said noting fuel savings will offset some of the expense.

“These vehicles will also require Level 2 chargers at an estimated cost of $5000” he told council adding that would be funded separately.

The city’s sustainability office has a goal of adding 100 new EV chargers throughout the community in 2021 including four rapid-chargers planned outside city hall and the police station on Ann Street.

Ann Arbor gets $170K from state DTE to install rapid EV chargers downtown

The new electric Mustangs are replacing two police vehicles reaching their contractual limit Kulhanek said.

The city’s labor contracts with the Ann Arbor Police Officers Association and the Ann Arbor Police Supervisors require the city to replace vehicles used by the police union members every six years or 80000 miles whichever comes first.

In addition to the new electric Mustangs which are coming from Gorno Ford in Woodhaven council OK’d a six-year $348308 contract for new dashboard cameras in AAPD vehicles.

The agreement with Axon Enterprise Inc. includes the cost of new cameras and Wi-Fi offload server hardware in patrol vehicles and cloud data storage via Evidence.com.

Ann Arbor resident Adam Oxner addressed council urging city leaders to make sure the city’s police oversight commission has a say on future technology purchases to avoid using facial recognition technology.

AAPD does not use or possess facial recognition technology including the Axon dash cameras and body cameras Police Chief Michael Cox said.

“Facial recognition technology has been proven over and over again to be biased and used mostly to surveil lower-income communities and communities of color” Oxner said calling it a powerful technology that in the wrong hands can harm the less privileged.

While the contract does not grant Axon the right to analyze the city’s data in ways that identify anyone’s personally identifiable information it does upload all recordings to Axon’s servers and that’s a citizen privacy concern Oxner said.

“It is exactly this type of technology used by police that we need strong citizen oversight of” he said.

It’s good to know current AAPD practice is on the proper side of policing on the issue of facial recognition technology said Ali Ramlawi a City Council liaison to the police oversight commission.

Protectionism refers to government actions and policies that restrict or restrain international trade often with the intent of protecting local businesses and jobs from foreign competition. In ordinary terms a tariff is a tax imposed on imported goods and services.

Trade tension started this year when the United States of America President Donald Trump on July 6 imposed tariffs on 818 goods worth of $34 billion (Shs128 trillion) of imports from China. This move substantially escalated the US-China trade tension (trade war).

In retaliation to US’ move China announced a 25 per cent charges on $16 billion (Shs60.2 trillion) worth of US goods the move which is shaking the global trade arena because of its possible effect in global economy.

The US has already imposed $50 billion in tariff on Chinese imports including $16 billion and threatened to follow up with levies on further $200 billion of products.

Any impact on Uganda?

As a result the trade tension between the world’s largest economy and the second largest world economy has caused a slowdown in global trade.

To find out the current trade tension between US and China could affect Uganda Prosper magazine spoke to experts who gave their insights on the current situation.

Much as the impact of the ongoing US-China trade tension is not yet in full scale there are risks associated as ‘potential vulnerabilities’.

The executive director of research Bank of Uganda Dr Adam Mugume said trade tensions between the USA and China may not have direct impact on Uganda.

“However indirect effects are substantial. Global growth could slow down dramatically as a result of trade tensions and this could hamper Uganda’s economic growth” he said.

Dr Mugume explained that China’s growth has been a major driver of global growth and should it slowdown as a result of trade war with US this will slow down infrastructure finance and Foreign Direct Investments.

“… Uganda’s infrastructure expenditure is linked to financing from China and also FDI from China has been a major contributor to Uganda’s gross capital formation. This points to challenges Uganda could face if China was to be affected significantly by the trade tensions” he said.

Statistics from China show that the trade volume with Uganda has reached $811 million while FDIs from China to Uganda reached $400 million.

China in Uganda

China’s financing in Uganda is also growing rapidly targeting energy and transport sectors. The major projects signed with China Exim Bank in Uganda include: $1.4 billion and $483 million for Karuma and Isimba hydropower dams respectively. This is in addition to the $350 million for the construction of the Kampala- Entebbe express highway.

The trade war which could affect China comes in before the China-Africa Summit in following the last one it had in Johannesburg (South Africa) Summit of Forum of China Africa Cooperation during which Chines president announced 10 major plans to boost cooperation between China and Africa.

During the South African Summit decided to provide $60 billion of funding package which covers the areas of industrialisation agricultural modernisation infrastructure financial services people to people exchanges among others.

China Africa summit

The 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China –Africa cooperation (FOCAC) which started yesterday and ends today will discuss new developments in the Africa-China cooperation as well as the way forward over the trade spat between China and US.

Development economist and Makerere University lecturer at the School of Economics and Management Mr Fred Muhumuza explained to Prosper magazine that the USA and China trade row would impact on Uganda indirectly as China will be looking for new markets.

In doing so it will lower its tariffs for goods it is exporting to countries where there are low or no tariffs something which will result into China dumping its products here.

“It will be dumping its products very cheaply into the Ugandan market to try and consolidate what it has lost in USA market. China is going to be looking for markets outside the United States more aggressively than ever. This will have negative impact on our local products and manufacturing sector since we may not have the capacity for trade protectionism here as the USA” he said.

Trade protectionism

But why doesn’t Uganda have the capacity for trade protectionism?

Uganda is mainly a net importer so it cannot begin introducing high tariffs (protectionism) because that will make its limited exports attract high tariffs elsewhere.

Not only has the US announced tariffs on Chinese goods but in other countries’ goods as well. The US president announced on August 10 the doubling of tariffs on Turkey aluminum which will attract 20 per cent and 50 per cent on steel a development which saw the Turkish currency Lira depreciate against the US dollar by 20 per cent. Uganda trades with Turkey on bilateral basis.

Opportunities

Mr Onen said the tension between US and China presents both challenges and opportunities.

A look at threats and opportunities for Uganda from the United States of America and China trade spat.

“The trade tension presents opportunities for us and we can design a strategy to attract Chinese investors to Uganda and begin making textiles here for export. We can export these textiles to US under the AGOA arrangement because it will be treated by the US as Ugandan products” he said.

Ambassador Onen said for Ugandan products to qualify under AGOA they must have 35 per cent of value addition which is possible and it can reach 50 per cent if cotton was to be added.

The World Trade Organisation (WTO) said in January this year that in 2017 it witnessed strongest growth in world trade since 2011.

The WTO said global trade recorded its highest growth rate in six years in 2017 both in volume and value terms. Merchandise trade volume as measured by the average of exports and imports grew by 4.7 per cent marking the first annual increase in excess of 3.0 per cent since 2011.

“The dollar value of merchandise exports rose by 11 per cent to $17.73 trillion while commercial services exports increased by 7 per cent to $5.25 trillion. Merchandise trade growth in 2017 was up sharply from 2016 when trade volume grew by just 1.8 per cent the smallest increase since the financial crisis of 2008” WTO said.

The WTO added: “Growth in trade volume was strong in 2017 despite trade tensions. In the first half of 2018 these tensions translated into a number of trade-restrictive measures being imposed covering a wide range of goods and major economies. How these measures will affect trade in 2018 remains to be seen but they risk triggering a cycle of retaliation that could be disruptive for global trade and growth.”

The director general of WTO Mr Roberto Azevêdo said in April in Geneva 2018 during a news conference: “The rising trade tensions we have seen in recent months could put the recovery in global trade at risk with inevitable consequences for the wider economy which could reach far beyond those countries that are directly involved.”

In August Mr Azevedo said trade expansion will likely slow further in the third quarter of 2018 according to the WTO’s latest World Trade Outlook Indicator (WTOI) released on August 9.

“The most recent WTOI reading of 100.3 is below the previous value of 101.8 and just above the baseline value of 100 for the index signalling an easing of trade growth in the coming months in line with medium-term trends. This loss of momentum reflects weakness in component indices including export orders and automobile production and sales which may be responding to the ratcheting up of trade tensions” he said.

The IMF said the possibility for more buoyant growth than forecast has faded somewhat in light of the weak outturns in the first quarter in several large economies the moderation in high-frequency economic indicators and tighter financial conditions in some vulnerable economies.

“Downside risks on the other hand have become more salient most notably the possibilities of escalating and sustained trade actions and of tighter global financial conditions” said the IMF.

Impact of Brexit

Searching for new markets. Mr Muhumuza said it only does the US-China trade war posing a threat to global trade but also the Brexit from the European Union because the UK will be looking for markets elsewhere outside EU.

As per the ongoing negotiations in Brussel with the European Union and the UK government on Brexit the UK is supposed to leave the European Union in March next year.

Before that happens UK is stepping up its trade relationship with some African countries.

Last week British Prime Minister Theresa May concluded her three-day visit in Africa in Kenya on Thursday to strengthen trade ties with African countries on bilateral basis to show its open business after Brexit.

“All those developments are going to change the global economy and global trade. Dumping is going to be an issue as well as increased protectionism and bilateral trade arrangements” Dr Muhumuza said.

International trade between different countries is an important factor in raising living standards providing employment and enabling consumers to enjoy a greater variety of goods.

In a telephone interview the Permanente Secretary in the Ministry of Trade Julius Onen said the current trade war between US and China will not impact Uganda directly because Uganda’s trade with China is very small. He revealed that China mainly imports goods from Uganda for domestic consumption such as coffee and simsim among others.

“However for countries exporting raw materials to China which China processes for export to other countries will scale down their exports because China’s market in US will become small” Mr Onen said.

Boosting China-Africa ties

Uganda is among the 20 countries on the African continent where China has massively invested.

It is no wonder that China is hosting more than 1000 African representatives from over 600 enterprises business groups and research institutions at a conference of Chinese and African entrepreneurs in Beijing."

If your mother enjoys the outdoors and appreciates the delicate beauty of birds what better gift is there than a bird bath? More specifically a solar-powered bird bath fountain. It only needs a little bit of sun exposure before it begins blasting water into the air giving all of your flying friends a chance to wash off that sky dust.

(For even more ideas check out our roundups of the best Mother's Day gifts for every budget and the best last-minute Mother's Day gifts to shop now.)

Why is this a good deal? 💰

At over 30% off this matches the best price we've seen this year. It's also one of the most affordable options on all of Amazon with most other fountains starting at $17 and going up from there.

Why do I need this? 🤔

Running water makes for an attractive feature in any space and this fountain pump will spray water high into the air using nothing but solar power. You don't need to plug it in anywhere; just place it in the bird bath and after about three seconds it will begin spraying water. It doesn't store energy so it may be somewhat less effective on cloudy days.

There are also six different nozzles that you can swap out for different water patterns so you can mix things up from time to time. If you keep it in the middle of a properly-sized bird bath you won't lose a lot of water over the sides. It will minimize the amount of refilling you have to do. That said you should clean it every so often to prevent the pump lines from clogging — the company suggests doing so at least once a week.

Splish splash they were takin' a bath! Mom will enjoy the feathered fun this bird bath will bring to her garden. (Amazon)

What reviewers say 💬

With over 7900 five-star reviews a lot of fans have added this touch of whimsy to their birdbath.

Pros 👍

Despite concerns over sun exposure fans say this fountain works well even with indirect light. ""I have a bird bath with a shallow basin and only 1/2 day of direct sunlight. My concern was that I did not want to have stagnant water that could attract mosquitoes. This solar fountain pump works great. It even works at lower capacity using only reflected light when the bird bath is in a shadowy part of the day.""

Another bird-watcher said ""This little thing is beautiful. It aerates the water and the birds love it.""

It isn't limited just to bird baths either. ""I bought it for my neighbor's koi pond but he put it in his pool. It sprays water about 3 feet in the air. He loves it.""

Cons 👎

One fan said it can be a little noisy. ""I love them! I have one in my front and back garden. Only downside is they make a sputtering noise when they’re not in full sun.""

Another shopper warned that it might actually be too powerful. ""I found that they have too much power for my small birdbath. I put a half-inch square of electrical tape over one of the solar collectors and wait and watch. If the spray is too strong I put another piece on. it usually takes three pieces.""

Two of the murderer’s 16-year-old friends who were also carrying zombie knives were detained for nine years and nine years and six months after being found guilty of the manslaughter of Mikey Roynon 16.

During his sentencing remarks Mr Justice Saini said the killing was an example of the “plague of knife crime” that was blighting Bristol and surrounding areas. He said: “The lives of young boys who carry knives continue to be taken at the hands of other boys who carry knives.”

He said Mikey from Kingswood South Gloucestershire was still a child but had a “bright musical career ahead of him”.

Mikey’s mother Hayley Ryall said: “Every morning I wake up and it hurts as much as the last morning. I keep having awful dreams that Mikey is lost and I’m looking for him but even the awful dreams are better than waking up to reality. At least in my dreams he is somewhere whereas in reality he is gone.”

She described how difficult she found what would have been Mikey’s 17th birthday in November without him and spoke of her sadness that she would never be called “mum” again. She said: “I feel like I’m living in a film or a nightmare and soon I’ll wake up and I’ll be able to hug and kiss him and Mikey will say ‘It’s OK Mum.’”

The judge lifted an order banning identification of the killers. The boy convicted of murdering Mikey is Shane Cunningham who will serve 16 years before being considered for parole. The two boys convicted of manslaughter are Cartel Bushnell and Leo Knight.

A jury at Bristol crown court rejected the claims of the boys who are from the Wiltshire market town of Devizes that they were acting in self-defence.

They travelled to Bath by bus in June last year for an open-invitation birthday party. They were each armed with zombie knives hidden beneath their clothes. One other member of the party took a knife. The judge said: “You took a total of four big knives to what was supposed to be a fun occasion. How you each got hold of these horrendous and unlawful weapons and why you took them to the party will never be known.”

The three did not know Mikey. He arrived at the party with friends from Bristol. He had a reputation as a rapper and his appearance at the party went down well and some of his songs were played.

There were about 70 young people at the party. The judge said he was sure Mikey also had a knife. The judge said: “Something happened in the garden which led to the violence. A number of the Bristol boys began drawing knives.”

Cartel and Leo took their knives out ready to fight. The judge said: “Mikey drew a knife and struck towards Cartel. Shane stabbed Mikey in the neck. The knife passed through his neck and severed a major artery.”

DI Mark Newbury the senior investigating officer said: “Knife crime is a disease which leaves a horrifying and long-lasting mark on everyone it affects. It’s a national problem which isn’t limited to specific towns or cities and we must come together as a society to tackle it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLnVzbmV3cy5jb20vd2VsbG5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvZG8taWNlLWJhdGhzLXdvcmstZm9yLXJlY292ZXJ50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Do Ice Baths Work for Recovery? | U.S.,"Getty Images

You’ve probably seen athletes or other fitness trendsetters on social media taking an ice bath or tried one yourself to reap the benefits of the potential health benefits including faster recovery increased metabolism and reduced stress.

“People want to try (an ice bath) usually for three reasons: the physical benefits the mental benefits or because it’s trendy and they want to know what the hype is about” says Alex Corbett a physical therapist with BreakThrough Physical Therapy with locations throughout North Carolina.

But is that bone-chilling dip worth the purported benefits?



Key Takeaways:

Ice baths also called cold water immersion involve plunging part or most of your body into cold icy water.

Studies have shown that ice baths have the potential to increase fat loss reduce inflammation improve mood and speed recovery.

Cold water immersion isn’t for everybody and it is possible to experience frostbite or hypothermia if your water is too cold or you stay in for too long.

What Is an Ice Bath?

An ice bath is a planned exposure to cold water. It can be water made cold by ice or it can be water in lakes or oceans that’s seasonally cold. In the latter example it may be called a cold plunge. Some people even partake in charity cold plunges or ring in the new year with an icy cold shock.

An ice bath temperature is typically below 60 degrees Fahrenheit and often ranges from 50 to 59 degrees. Sometimes people may want their ice bath temperature to be even lower.

Ice baths are different from cryotherapy which involve exposure to very cold air (typically -220 to -240 degrees). However cryotherapy doesn't involve any submersion in water.



Ice Bath Benefits

Fans of ice baths claim that they have several potential benefits including:



Quicker recovery after intense exercise and reduced muscle soreness.

Fat burning by stimulating the body’s production of brown fat

Improved circulation

Improved mood focus and stress relief

Reduced inflammation and pain

A 2023 analysis of 20 studies published in Frontiers of Physiology concluded that cold water immersion performed immediately after exercise could help lower muscle soreness and speed up fatigue recovery. However despite their initial benefits for muscle recovery some research has found that ice baths can actually reduce muscle strength and growth over time Corbett says.

While an ice bath can increase your metabolism and help with fat burning you’re not likely to see overnight benefits with just one ice bath session. Studies have noted that while researchers have seen decreases in body fat in people who take cold plunges much more research is needed to recommend ice baths for weight loss.

Beyond physical health benefits ice baths can also give your mental wellness a boost.

“Ice baths make people feel refreshed and invigorated leading to a sense of overall well-being” says Dr. Yoshua Quinones a board-certified internist with the Medical Offices of Manhattan in New York and a contributor to the website Lab Finder.



Dangers of Ice Baths

Before you take the plunge it's important to first consider some of the potential dangers of ice baths.

These include:



Frostbite. This is more of a risk if you stay in an ice bath for too long.

This is more of a risk if you stay in an ice bath for too long. Hypothermia. This occurs when the body loses heat faster than it can create heat and can cause confusion shivering and – in severe cases – organ failure.

This occurs when the body loses heat faster than it can create heat and can cause confusion shivering and – in severe cases – organ failure. Cold shock. Sudden immersion in cold water can cause increased blood pressure heart rate and breathing which increases the risk of drowning. This is due to blood vessels contracting when your body is exposed to cold. People who have cardiovascular issues are at higher risk for experiencing this type of response to cold.

Because of the potential dangers of hypothermia or cold shock make sure there's someone else keeping an eye on you while you plunge into the cold no matter how experienced you are with cold temperatures.



Who Shouldn’t Take an Ice Bath

For most healthy people it’s OK to try an ice bath. However you’ll want to avoid an ice bath or check first with a health care provider if you have:



An open wound or infection. An ice bath could slow healing.

An ice bath could slow healing. Cardiovascular disease . Immersing yourself in cold water will likely raise your blood pressure and heart rate.

Immersing yourself in cold water will likely raise your blood pressure and heart rate. Peripheral neuropathy. A type of nerve damage that may cause tingling and numbness this condition is often associated with diabetes.

An ice bath could make your condition worse. Respiratory issues. Cold water immersion may cause breathing problems.

Cold water immersion may cause breathing problems. Uncontrolled high blood pressure. Increased blood pressure can occur during an ice bath.

You should also check with a healthcare provider or avoid ice baths if you are pregnant or hypersensitive to cold.

Ice Bath Tips

If you’re ready to take the plunge with an ice bath keep these tips in mind:



Plan to have someone with you or someone nearby who can help in case you need help during the ice bath.

Start gradually as you would with an exercise routine. Don’t go too cold or for too long during your first time.

Aim for water that’s uncomfortably cold but still feels safe.

Less is more. A few minutes is good but more than 30 minutes is too long.

Listen to your body. Exit if you feel dizzy or uncomfortable.

Plan to warm yourself up gradually after exiting an ice bath.

Don’t take any medication that might impair you before an ice bath.

Stay hydrated after an ice bath.

Additionally consider when is the best time to do an ice bath and how often you'll incorporate it into your routine.

“If you’re using it for muscle soreness then doing an ice bath after exercise is the optimal timing. Ten minutes post-exercise may help with delayed onset muscle soreness” says Dr. Justin Mullner a primary care sports medicine physician for adults and children with Orlando Health Jewett Orthopedic Institute in Orlando Florida.

For general mental health benefits like mood and focus you can do an ice bath three to four minutes at a time a couple of times a week for its benefits he adds.

Ice Bath Alternatives

If you want the benefits of an ice bath but can’t fathom immersing yourself in that frigid water you still may be able to obtain some of the same benefits in other ways:

""What the games have shown us is most games are close affairs. All games in their way are difficult. I think it's a mistake if we think suddenly we are gonna blossom into a wonderful team because we are not playing against one of the so-called top teams"" said Baxter in an official release.

Speaking about the break that Odisha FC players got after the previous game against NorthEast United FC the head coach said ""We needed a little bit of time together on the field and I think this has been useful. It was a comparatively long break and it's been good.""

Goalkeeper Arshdeep Singh has been one of the fine performers for the team so far in the competition. Highlighting the custodian's performance in the seventh season he explained ""He (Arshdeep) has done very well. The main thing is that he has shown consistency. For a goalkeeper you want that consistency. Every game is a new game a new challenge. We give him as much information about the opponents as we can. On the day he's got to do the ABCs correctly make sure that he gives that level of consistency and I think he has done that very well.""

When asked about the mindset of the team after the first few games in the season the former South Africa manager mentioned ""We have got new foreigners who are settling into Indian football and we have got young players who are helping the younger players. Even our more experienced younger players are still really settling into it. They have got a different message coming from the coach. I have been very pleased with the fact that they approach every game with the belief of getting the result. I think if we can continue to do that then we can expect a better result in the future.""

Pretty much like the Kalinga Warriors SC East Bengal is also winless so far in the tournament. Explaining further about his take on the Red and Gold Brigade the experienced coach said ""I see a lot of similarities in ourselves. We have a very young team who need time on the field and they have a very new team who need time on the field. So in a way maybe we and they have suffered from the limitations of the bio-bubble quarantining etc the most. Their games have been close games they have played well in periods of games same as we have. They will be looking for that consistency the same as we are.""

""I don't know Robbie (Fowler) that well as a coach. I obviously know him as a player. The job that he is doing under the shorter constraints is the same as ours. Even he is seen working very very hard and you see improvements there. We both would like to see those improvements going a little bit quicker"" he added.

Odisha FC is currently at the 11th spot in the ISL points table and the side will take on East Bengal on Sunday.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Lending credence to the “digital gold” narrative bitcoin hit a high of 15.62 ounces in the early morning surpassing its peak at the top of the 2017 bull run according to MarketWatch data. Its price in fiat terms was $19300 at the time of publication.

Bitcoin priced in gold bullion via MarketWatch

Many analysts are bullish on both gold the spot price of which rose 25% in the past year and bitcoin which jumped 300% in 2020. Citibank’s analysts believe bitcoin’s price could hit $318000 by the end of 2021 and similarly optimistic projections have become widespread. Even JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon once a vociferous critic of bitcoin has jumped on the bandwagon.

Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal sold his considerable gold position to go all in on bitcoin and Ethereum. While he remains bullish on gold he shares Wall Street legend Paul Tudor Jones’ belief that bitcoin is “the fastest horse in the race” and thinks it will reach a gobsmacking $1 million in five years.

Proponents of the digital gold narrative include Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone and Michael Saylor CEO of MicroStrategy an American business intelligence firm that has shifted its treasury into bitcoin a highly lucrative move that has caused its share price to soar.

Saylor believes bitcoin is “1000X better than gold” because of its greater divisibility; ease of storage transport and verification; and perhaps most importantly its genuine scarcity.

‘Rat poison squared…’

Meanwhile bitcoin has roared past American tycoon Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway. At $545 billion at the time of publication the largest crypto has passed the the finance giant’s market cap. Bitcoiners rejoiced in the slap in the face to the legendary investor who once dismissed the crypto as “rat poison squared.”

Bitcoin bull Vijay Boyapati tweeted victoriously “#Bitcoin just surpassed Berkshire Hathaway in market capitalization. How do you like the rat poison now @WarrenBuffett?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy94cGVuZy1yZXBvcnRzLTExMi1yaXNlLTIwMjAtMDMwNDM1NDY1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xpeng Reports 112% Rise In 2020 Deliveries: What Investors Need To Know,"In this article:

Xpeng Inc (NYSE: XPEV) electric vehicle deliveries rose 112% on a year-over-year basis in 2020 the company said Sunday.

What Happened: The Guangzhou China-based EV firm said total deliveries for the year ended Dec 31 2020 reached 27041 units.

The automaker’s mid-sized P7 sedan reached cumulative deliveries of 15062 units after mass deliveries commenced in June. The company delivered 11979 of its compact electric G3 sports utility vehicles.

For the fourth quarter Xpeng recorded 12964 EV deliveries which is a 303% increase year-over-year and a 51% increase compared to the previous quarter.

Monthly deliveries stood at 5700 units which is a 326% increase on a year-over-year basis and a 35% increase over November.

Why It Matters: Xpeng is attributing increased deliveries to “increasing brand awareness expanded sales marketing and supercharging service initiatives across China.”

Xpeng said last week that it had partnered with Shenzhen-based Livox to deploy the latter’s lidar technology in the automaker's new 2021 production model.

Meanwhile rival Chinese EV firm Nio Inc (NASDAQ: NIO) said over the weekend it delivered 43728 vehicles in 2020 representing a 112.6% increase on a year-over-year basis.

Segment leader Tesla inc’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) 2020 deliveries fell just shy of the 500000 mark beating the Wall Street estimates of 481261 vehicles.

Price Action: Xpeng shares closed nearly 1.3% higher at $42.83 on Thursday and gained almost 1% in the after-hours session.

In 2020 a wave of interest from mainstream investors and institutions helped push the price of the virtual currency from $7200 in January to above $29000 on December 31 (and then on past $32700 by early January 2021). But the innovative digital asset maintained by a decentralized swarm of so-called miners has a long history of volatility. Most observers expect some retrenchment of that rally sooner or later.

For insight into why (or maybe when) a slump is likely it’s worth looking back at Bitcoin’s many “bubble” periods: stretches when the price increased dramatically in a short amount of time then fell in most cases even more sharply. “Bubble” of course has negative connotations implying popular delusions and the madness of crowds. But there’s a growing understanding that financial bubbles can also be generated by temporary overoptimism about real innovation that can still pay off in the long run. Examples of this include the British Railway Mania of the 1840s and the 1999 Dot-com bubble.

Supporters see Bitcoin’s history of volatility as just a matter of watching the world catch up in fits and starts with an inevitable future. Ten years of steady growth seems to have vindicated that view—at least for now. But the growing pains can be truly savage.

Below a trip down Bitcoin’s memory lane.

Caveat: Many of the Bitcoin marketplaces (such as Mt.Gox) that established the historical prices cited in the following text no longer exist. Even at the time it would have been hard to identify a single price in the very small relatively illiquid market. For simplicity and consistency this article primarily relies on 99bitcoins.com for prices from 2009 to 2012 and CoinGecko for prices from 2013 to the present.

Feb. 2011: The Great Slashdotting/Dollar Parity Day

The Peak: $1.06 (Feb. 14 2011)

The Bottom: $0.67 (April 5 2011)

The Bitcoin bull run that peaked in February 2011 was arguably the cryptocurrency’s first bubble and tremendously significant for its evolution. It began as early as July 2010 when Bitcoin—then worth just pennies per coin—was first mentioned on Slashdot a news aggregator popular with die-hard techies. That post first brought important developers including Jeff Garzik and Jed McCaleb to the project. Heightened interest then drove the price of a Bitcoin to one dollar on Feb. 10 2011. That day became known as Dollar Parity Day and triggered a second Slashdot post that brought further attention.

That basic cycle is still a major dynamic of the Bitcoin market: real technology or infrastructure advances drive the price higher then the price itself generates further less sustainable price growth.

Story continues

June 2011: The Bump on Silk Road

The Peak: $29.58 (June 9 2011)

The Bottom: $2.14 (Nov. 18 2011)

The first truly wild Bitcoin bubble began with a June 1 2011 article about the darkweb market Silk Road on now-defunct news site Gawker. The article described how illegal drugs could be purchased on a hidden website using Bitcoin. (Beliefs at the time that Bitcoin is untraceable turned out to be wildly incorrect.) Just as important the article followed on the heels of several early Bitcoin exchanges opening which made the token easier to buy. The combination of attention and access sent Bitcoin from $10 to nearly $30 in just a week. Then setting a pattern it slumped for months.

November 2013: A Thousandaire

The Peak: $1127.45 (Nov. 29 2013)

The Bottom: $172.15 (Jan. 13 2015)

Just short of three years after breaking the barrier to dollar parity Bitcoin zoomed on to another crucial threshold cracking $1000 in late November 2013. It didn’t last and the price cratered nearly 50% by mid December. This bull run is notable for its relative stickiness: The Bitcoin price declined relatively gently over a little more than a year to a new bottom then rode along that bottom for another year. Prices didn’t break $1000 again for more than three years after the first time.

December 2017: The Widowmaker

The Peak: $19665 (Dec. 15 2017)

The Bottom: $3164 (Dec. 15 2018)

The most brutal and crazy of all Bitcoin bubbles so far except it wasn’t really a Bitcoin bubble. Instead 2017’s bull run was largely fueled by a wave of newly-minted “alternative” cryptocurrencies that made big promises.

More importantly a novel process known as an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) allowed founders to sell their new offerings directly to the public. That created not just one speculative mania but literally thousands that fed off of each other: One ICO’s purely speculative run-up would create FOMO—that is fear of missing out—for the next. Bitcoin benefited from the frenzy but its “dominance” or share of the overall crypto market fell off a cliff as interest in “altcoins” surged.

It all ended in tears of course. A mere week after peaking Bitcoin dropped more than 25%. Other cryptocurrencies plummeted even further. Longer term many of the projects rolling out ICOs turned out to be brazen frauds and ICOs have since been broadly and aggressively pursued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as illegal securities offerings.

To cite one example of how bloody things got Japanese tech mogul Masayoshi Son of SoftBank fame is reported to have lost $130 million in the 2017 crypto bubble—and that was allegedly his personal money not SoftBank’s.

This time it’s…different?

Veterans of Bitcoin’s wild roller-coaster ride have argued that the current white-knuckle run-up is in crucial ways different. (Of course we’ve heard this before.) They argue that the absence of ICOs has forestalled the worst excesses of scammers and their greedy marks the U.S. COVID stimulus can be read as validation of the inflation-hedge thesis that is crucial to Bitcoin’s appeal as an investment and the presence of regulated institutions and publicly-traded corporations throughout the crypto market has created an entirely new sense of normality.

But Bitcoin it can’t be repeated enough is still a speculative and risky asset. If history is any teacher (and it often is) there will be more than a few more steps backwards on Bitcoin’s journey to the moon.

“In the middle of this pandemic and as the market continues to evolve it has been the product that really started to show us a new phase of Rolls-Royce focusing onto the post-opulence era” Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Americas CEO Martin Fritsches tells Yahoo Finance. “And obviously we've been able to embed all of the technology features but in a more subtle and let's say ‘less opulent’ way.”

For Rolls a delay in production for the new Ghost ‘entry-level’ Rolls-Royce wasn’t an option. After a stellar 2019 the momentum had to be maintained and the high-end luxury market wasn’t going to wait. Car sales even at the top end have been steadily climbing higher amid sharp economic contraction and soaring unemployment rates.

“Our customer base not only is changing it's becoming more and more young” Fritsches says. “They are absolutely very demanding.”

He says the new Ghost is a direct response to Rolls-Royce’s evolving high-end customer. These younger clients are increasingly going the bespoke route with customized requests “dramatically” increasing he explained.

With the Ghost being Rolls’ most popular product its success is paramount for the English automaker’s North American aspirations.

“With our current product lineup and further encouraging the customization and the ... personalized approach our trend is to continue expanding our business here particularly in the U.S. but also markets like Canada” Fritsches says.

It was no secret that the outgoing Ghost was long in the tooth (last updated in 2014) and needed to get back on par with the latest and greatest in terms of tech comfort and aesthetics.

But I think it was a great year for Chromebooks. We saw more high-end options from companies not named Google for example. We saw mid-range choices come in a lower prices even before sales. And we saw a tablet computer show the form-factor’s potential that didn’t have a horrific launch like the Pixel Slate did. So it’s tough to pick my personal Chromebook of the year.

And there were plenty of contenders. My own choices ranged from the $279 Lenovo Duet Chromebook to the $629 Acer Chromebook Spin 713 with the $409 Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook slotting in between the two from a pricing perspective.

You all had thoughts as well. When I asked what you would recommend for 2020 Chromebook of the year I received a number of comments.

Here are a few with others happy using older devices agreeing with one of my top three contenders and even my pick from 2019 the Pixelbook Go (although it doesn’t qualify for this year’s pick):

If you want premium I really like the Asus Chromebook Flip 436FA. The i3 feels every bit as fast as the i5 Acer Chromebook Spin 13 and it’s display somehow feels slightly larger. The 128GB PCIe SSD may help give it that extra bit of performance. The fingerprint sensor back-lit keys large glass touchpad and USI stylus are all really nice to use everyday. The separation of the quad speakers sounds great. I often work an eight-hour day with it running only on battery. It’s also very pleasing to the eyes with the lid open or closed. Cajun Moses

Asus Chromebook Flip C436

My new Acer Chromebook 715 with its full size keyboard including a number pad and touch screen is my ideal computer. Those familiar with Chromebook already know the amazing capability compared with Windows 10 computers. During Black Friday sales I was able to buy for less than $300 including shipping and 7% sales tax. Phil

Acer Chromebook 715

Obviously a case can be made by anyone that the Chromebook they chose is the best. And it likely is… for them. So as I said last year with my 2019 pick this isn’t about the “best” Chromebook of 2020. We all have different budgets use-cases preferences and requirements so there is no “best” Chromebook for everyone.

Having said that my pick for 2020 Chromebook of the year is the Lenovo Duet Chromebook.

Now this isn’t a device that I use often. I reviewed it coming away mostly positive about it and I take it out every now and again. Because of what I do on a Chromebook it really doesn’t meet my daily needs.

Yes I can and have used it for general purpose browsing email streaming video consumption and writing blog posts. But I also write code on a daily basis so I need something with more horsepower and a larger display or at least better large display support. I also need strong Linux performance for some of my coding projects.

Still when I look at what Lenovo has delivered at a price of either $279 or $299 depending on the configuration I have to admit it is an incredible value. You’re getting a high resolution touchscreen tablet with included keyboard and stand. Frankly the Lenovo Duet Chromebook is a little workhorse for under $300. And you can often find it on sale. As of today Best Buy has the 128 GB configuration for $249 a savings of $50.

Lenovo and MediaTek (who made the processor) should be commended for offering so much value for such a low price.

Here’s how I see it: There are still hundreds of millions of daily computer users that haven’t yet taken a chance on Chrome OS. In many cases folks may have a specific need that a Chromebook can’t meet. I get that. For many others in this group though they just haven’t tried Chrome OS.

For a low cost-of-entry this audience can take the chance of Chrome OS on a Lenovo Chromebook Duet. And they don’t have to worry about spending $400 $800 or even more to take that chance. Simply put I think the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great bridge between alternative computing choices and Chrome OS. Not to mention many current Chromebook users picked one up for a secondary device.

No the Lenovo Chromebook Duet isn’t the fastest option out there but it’s speedy enough for typical web and Android app usage. And it supports external monitors for use on a desk or in the office. Plus you can use it with a stylus for digital ink.

That’s enough to move folks outside the Chromebook camp to the “hey this isn’t bad” crowd. And once they’re there they can explore other options that might be faster offer larger displays or provide some other features and functions that they didn’t know Chromebooks and Chrome OS even had. I’m thinking fingerprint sensors multiple virtual desktops and solid Linux performance.

I really expected the Pixel Slate to do this back in 2018 but it wasn’t meant to be. That device had a much higher price point for starters although for good reason: The internal hardware is much more capable and the display is both larger and has a higher resolution than the Lenovo Duet Chromebook.

Design choices such as the floppy-on-the-lap keyboard add-on and base model with a poorly performing Intel Celeron chip didn’t help. Nor did the weight or the state of Chrome OS at the time which wasn’t up to par with the actual hardware. That was eventually fixed but the damage had been done. So the Pixel Slate simply had no chance to appeal to new Chromebook owners on a widespread basis at launch.

In comparison the Lenovo Duet has had great software support from day one includes useful accessories for a full computing package at home or on the go and can easily be taken anywhere. It’s a fantastic little device for an outstanding price and showed that even a low-cost Chromebook can keep many people productive and happy using Chrome OS. It’s not a “perfect” Chromebook; that unicorn doesn’t exist. But for the price you’re getting a ton of bang for buck.

Obviously my opinion is simply that: my opinion. If you had to pick 2020’s Chromebook of the year which might not be the Chromebook you might yourself use what would it be and why?

Here's the best stuff to buy starting at $25,"Gift cards are fantastic since they're basically free money to spend at a particular store -- and you have to spend them right? It's not like you can do the responsible thing and put them in the bank. The question is what to buy? Assuming you're not already ticking off your own wish list we have some suggestions.

Starting with this: If the gift card isn't for the store you want or you'd rather just have cash head to Raise and list it for sale. If someone buys it you'll get a bit less than face value minus Raise's cut -- but it's still money in your pocket instead of a gift card you'd rather not use.

Ready to shop? Here are some of the best ways you can put a gift card to use.

Rick Broida/CNET Wyze Band Smart fitness tracker for a song The Wyze Band ($30 at Amazon shipping included) is by no means a perfect activity tracker but it does a lot especially considering its super-bargain price tag. It has a color AMOLED screen a full-time heart-rate monitor support for Alexa voice commands and a battery good for up to 14 days. It's also a watch of course and it can sling notifications from your phone. Read our Wyze Band first take to learn more. $30 at Amazon

Chris Monroe/CNET Echo Dot (current generation) Smarter than the average orb With better sound quality than its predecessor and a fancy new orb design the fourth-gen Echo Dot is great for the first-time smart-speaker owner or anyone looking to upgrade an older Dot. Just try to avoid paying the full list price ($50) because Dots go on sale all the time. Indeed at this writing you can get it for as little as $30. Read our Echo Dot 2020 review.

Scott Stein/CNET Oculus Quest 2 Leave this troubling world behind Can't get your hands on the latest PlayStation or Xbox? Consider this ""console"" instead. The Oculus Quest 2 lets you step inside games instead of just playing them on a screen. The experience is breathtaking and the VR headset itself is more affordable than most consoles. (The games are cheaper too.) Even if your gift card doesn't cover the entire cost it's worth making up the difference. Read our Oculus Quest 2 review.

Audiophile speaker brands like Bowers & Wilkins and Focal now have a big presence in the headphone space and can be found on display in everyday places like Best Buy and Apple’s retail stores. Heck you can buy Bowers & Wilkins headphones in some airports these days. Fifteen years ago the idea of buying a B&W product in an airport would have seemed ludicrous. That just goes to show how important the headphone business has become to the audio industry as a whole. While most loudspeaker manufacturers that now offer headphones — including B&W Focal KEF and PSB — got into the personal audio business after the advent of Beats by Dre Klipsch was ahead of the curve when it launched its first in-ear monitor in 2007 a year before the first Beats headphone was introduced. In the intervening years Klipsch has maintained its position as an important player in the headphone business particularly with the company’s in-ear monitors. (My friend Bill who is a Grammy-winning mixing/mastering engineer used a pair of Klipsch in-ear monitors as his daily drivers for several years before eventually upgrading to some very expensive custom IEMs from JH Audio.) Now in 2020 Klipsch is poised to get ahead of the curve once again via a recently-announced collaboration with the DSP wizards at Dirac. Together the two companies aim to “pioneer the next generation of headphone audio performance” according to a press release from Dirac. The first product to be born of this partnership is expected to debut shortly after the holidays. Though details are scarce at this time it will probably be a true wireless earbud or in-ear monitor (like Apple’s AirPods) and will reportedly leverage Dirac’s sound optimization algorithms to “boost every detail of the music and unleash the full potential of the earphones.”

Klipsch is the preferred choice of audiophiles and aficionados around the world thanks in large part to our unwavering commitment to engineering excellence and innovation. By working with Dirac we combine our decades of headphone expertise with their digital audio expertise to introduce to our customers a new level of listening experience. Dirac shares our commitment to excellence and innovation and we look forward to continued collaboration.

— Vlad Grodzinskiy Sr. Product Manager at Klipsch

I’m personally hoping to see an updated version of the Klipsch Heritage HP-3 over-ear headphones ($1200) at some point down the road. The companies have said that “the integration of Dirac’s software with Klipsch’s premium speaker hardware will establish new performance standards across Klipsch earphones demonstrating the ability to level-up any listening experience through the use of pioneering digital audio solutions.” So it’s reasonable to expect more than one Dirac-enhanced Klipsch headphone product coming down the pipeline. The engineering teams at the two companies have worked closely to customize Dirac’s technology so that it delivers “peak performance and (the) maximum degree of audio upgrade” when combined with Klipsch earphone hardware.

Dirac has long been a pioneer in the home theater automotive and mobile market working with the industries’ most well-respected brands. Collaboration with Klipsch – a legendary acoustics pioneer – further establishes our position as an innovator in the headphone market and reasserts our commitment to working closely with premium brands to leverage the latest in digital audio to elevate hardware performance to new levels.

Klipsch / Dirac Future Product Collaborations in the Making?

Dirac’s sound optimization solution provides impulse response and frequency response correction resulting in improved clarity sound-staging voice intelligibility and bass fidelity according to Dirac. The Swedish digital audio experts have also developed a technology called Dirac 3D Audio which they describe as “audiophile-quality 3D audio DSP tailored to your headphones.” Dirac 3D Audio is ideal for gaming and for immersive surround-sound effects but can be applied to all kinds of headphones. The tech promises a more convincing outside-of-your-head sound presentation with a realistic sense of space and accurate spatial positioning of different audio objects.

Although this is the first time that Klipsch has teamed up with Dirac the iconic brand has been a part of some interesting partnerships in the past. Back in 2008 Klipsch collaborated with Best Buy to develop the five-model Icon V Series of loudspeakers which was designed to deliver superior sound from slim attractive and lifestyle-friendly cabinets all for a low price. More recently Klipsch became the official headphone and portable audio partner of the McLaren Formula 1 racing team and earlier this year the two brands announced several new headphone products featuring McLaren’s signature Papaya Orange color and suitably high-tech styling. The range-topping Klipsch x McLaren T10 True Wireless in-ears will set you back a cool $1000. For the T10 Klipsch partnered with a technology group called Ear Micro to develop the internal electronics which are claimed to be the smallest in the world (about 50% smaller than those inside Apple’s AirPods Pro) yet with much more powerful processing capabilities than any competing solution. It seems likely that Ear Micro’s small yet powerful “ear computers” will again be put to use in the next generation of Klipsch earphones as it takes quite a bit of computing horsepower for Dirac’s DSP-based sound solution to work its magic. We’ll be sure to keep you updated as soon as more information becomes available about the fruits of the Klipsch/Dirac collaboration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xMC1iZXN0LWF1dG8tcGFydC1zdG9ja3MtMTY0NzMyODQwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Best Auto-Part Stocks To Buy For 2021,"In this article we will talk about the 10 best auto-parts stocks to buy for 2021. The automotive aftermarket industry is going through interesting times. People are fixing up their old cars to avoid public transport amid the coronavirus crisis resulting in an increased demand for car parts. Even though the car parts industry wasn't safe from uncertainty and losses in 2020 the new year could bring in huge opportunities for long-term investors. Click to skip ahead our discussion and see the 5 best auto-parts stocks to buy for 2021.

Like every industry the automotive aftermarket sector has experienced a bumpy ride in 2020 amid the coronavirus crisis. In the beginning the industry got hammered after vehicle miles traveled (VMT) dropped across the country resulting in a steep decline in auto parts demand. Restricted movement in all states also resulted in less usage of personal vehicles fewer collisions and limited customer spending on new auto parts. Vehicle sales in the U.S. which were already crashing worsened after the COVID-19 outbreak as consumers started to limit their spending. In November new car sales posted a 15% decline. All of this painted a bleak picture for the auto-parts industry.

An Antifragile Industry

But the auto-parts industry is known for its anti-fragility. In the period between 2007 to 2009 when the U.S. economy was in recession and auto sales for new cars plunged 42% the aftermarket experienced just a 1% decline. Analysts now believe that the auto-parts industry is set for a strong rebound and growth in 2021 on the back of several factors.

Firstly a decline in new car sales will buoy demand for auto parts as people drive their old cars and trade used cars. Secondly people are starting to shun public transport and prefer using personal cars to avoid contracting the coronavirus. Stephan Wöllenstein chief executive of Volkswagen Group China said earlier this year that the company is seeing a rise in sales mostly from young buyers who accounted for about 60% of the company’s sales in March. In a survey conducted by the Institute for Transport Research in June and July 50% of respondents said they are using public transport less often or much less often because of health risks. This trend will help the auto-parts industry grow in 2021 and beyond.

McKinsey & Company forecasts that the auto-parts industry will grow at a rate of 3% per annum through 2030. However the industry is expected to go through several key changes in consumer behavior including a shift to e-commerce direct distributions and partnerships. The aftermarket industry growth will touch new highs in Asia according to the report. McKinsey expects automotive aftermarket revenues of approximately €337 billion in North America and approximately €295 billion in Europe in 2030.

Times are changing rapidly. The hedge fund industry’s reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 88 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16.

Growth Catalysts for Car Parts Stocks in 2021

Several growth catalysts are on the horizon for the auto parts industry. One of them is emerging technologies and the upcoming demand for new injection systems and turbochargers. The rise of hybrid diesel and electric vehicles in the U.S. Europe China and Asia will push auto parts companies to invest in innovation for growth in 2021 and beyond. The auto-parts industry is also transitioning rapidly to ecommerce. According to an estimate ecommerce sales accounted for $16 billion of the total U.S. automotive aftermarket revenue crushing analysts’ forecasts.

Data shows that personal consumption of auto parts reached an all-time high of $50.509 billion in June 2020. With the availability of coronavirus vaccines and traffic coming back to pre-COVID levels globally auto-parts stocks are poised to grow in 2021. The Dow Jones U.S. Auto Parts Index is up over 16% in 2020.

That was the case during pre-orders; that was the case at launch; and I anticipate it’s going to be the case well into the new year. While stocks could stabilize as early as late January there’s a good chance that we’ll have to wait a few more months before you can waltz into any electronics store and pick up Sony’s newest console.

The good news is that you don’t really need a PS5 right now  at least if you have a PS4 or a comparable gaming system. However while I don’t recommend dropping everything for a PS5 just yet the fact is that the PS4 is on the way out and console gamers will have to update sooner or later. If now isn’t the right time to buy a PS5 when will it be?

While everyone’s individual case will vary somewhat we can try to pinpoint the “best” time to buy a PS5 based on three major factors: game selection hardware and price. And naturally if you really really want a PS5 then the best time to buy one is “ as soon as you can find a restock .”

PS5 game selection: What’s coming when

Everyone has a different threshold when it comes to “how many games make a system worthwhile?” For some people one system-seller is enough (that system-seller is Demon’s Souls incidentally); for others a dozen exclusive titles may be the threshold because why upgrade otherwise?

I don’t think there’s a right or wrong approach here but I will say that my own rule of thumb is “three games that I can’t get on any other system.” Right now the PS5 doesn’t meet that criterion. It has only two true exclusive titles — Astro’s Playroom and Demon’s Souls — and one of them technically came out on the PS3 more than a decade ago.

My own rule of thumb for buying a new console is that it needs “three games that I can’t get on any other system.” Right now the PS5 doesn’t meet that criterion.

Looking out across the next few months we’re scheduled to get Returnal Deathloop and Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart in the first half of 2021. We have more nebulous release dates for other exclusives like God of War Ragnarok Ghostwire: Tokyo and Final Fantasy XVI but it’s at least possible that they could come out in 2021.

Then there’s also the issue of cross-gen games like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and Yakuza: Like a Dragon. While these games play just fine on the PS4 there’s a good chance that cross-gen games will start favoring the next-gen consoles sooner rather than later. We’ve already started to see this disparity with titles like Cyberpunk 2077 and the performance differences are likely to get even more noticeable as time goes on.

Based on the PS5 exclusives we have right now as well as those we’re slated to get in the next few months it seems like March 2021 would be the time to start seriously considering a purchase; by June there should be no real reason to hold off.

PS5 bugs and issues

One reason why I advise against buying consoles at launch is because of hardware issues. They’re not always present but when they are they’re often extremely hard to get fixed. Think back to the Xbox 360’s Red Ring of Death — or even more recently to the spate of PS5s with unfixable rest mode issues .

Even if an issue doesn’t break your system early console versions are often not optimized. Consider the Nintendo Switch’s meager battery life at launch or the PS5’s considerable variance in fans and consequently fan noise.

These issues get ironed out over time although it’s difficult to say exactly how long this could take — particularly since new hardware issues might crop up as the months advance. Remember: the Red Ring of Death issue didn’t get bad until almost two years after its initial release.

So should you wait two full years before buying a PS5 — by which time there very well might be a smaller and/or cheaper redesign? Well maybe — I’m no great fan of the PS5’s current appearance. But it’s also worth remembering that the Red Ring was an anomaly among game consoles and these systems are usually pretty solid.

My recommendation would be to give it six months to see if any additional issues crop up and see how Sony addresses those issues. While there’s nothing inherently instructive about this time frame it’s at least long enough to gauge the system’s real-world performance and see if anything crops up. That would put the “ideal” time to buy a PS5 at May 2021 — right when its game library will be getting more robust.

PS5 price: Will it come down?

If you’re delaying a PS5 purchase because you’re waiting for a price break I have bad news: Consoles very rarely decrease in price during their first year on the market. Maybe if you hold out until next Christmas you can get some kind of discounted bundle but this would probably be a pack-in game or an extra controller — not a make-or-break price difference.

As such the standard PS5 is very likely to stay at $500 in 2021 and the PS5 Digital Edition is likely to stay at $400. (It’s possible of course that the Digital Edition will prove to be much less popular than its disc-enabled counterpart in which case Sony could discount the smaller device further. But at least for the moment it’s impossible to keep either model in stock.)

While it’s a bit of a cop-out answer it’s also true: The PS5’s price is unlikely to change in 2021 so it shouldn’t really factor into your decision one way or the other. If you want a more substantial price break you’ll have to wait until 2022 or later.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

When to buy PS5: Outlook

Since price isn’t an issue and game selection is largely down to personal taste I would say that the earliest time to buy a PS5 is March 2021 — and you can wait until May or June if you really want to hit the ground running. Of course you can try to find one sooner but you may just drive yourself up a wall dealing with inconsistent restocks and greedy scalpers.

Alternatively you can wait another year and see if the price drops. If 2022 rolls around and you still can’t find a PS5 something will have gone horribly wrong."

Heaney,"Heaney Timothy M. age 74 of Falcon Heights died peacefully on December 31 after a long battle with Parkinson's disease. Tim was born in Anoka Minnesota on June 25 1946. He spent his childhood near Washington D.C. He graduated cum laude from St. John's University in 1968 and cum laude from the University of Minnesota School of Law in 1972 where he served as an editor of the Minnesota Law Review. Tim was a partner and chair of the securities department at Fredrikson & Byron where he practiced law for 27 years. During the final years of his professional career he served as vice-president and general counsel at Bio-Techne Corp. a global biotechnology company. Tim was a lifelong learner and student of history politics philosophy and the world. His unending curiosity and love of travel took him around the globe including Iran India China Chile Russia and parts of Africa. His 1990 trip to the jungles of New Guinea visiting indigenous tribes was a feature story in the Star Tribune and LA Times which earned him the nickname ""Jungle Tim."" Tim's greatest joy was spending time with his grandchildren. ""Papa"" as he was known to his grandchildren enjoyed reading stories baking and supervising trips to the zoo State Fair and the Children's Theatre. Tim was well known for his sweet-tooth managing to enjoy all the treats pies and cookies that so many friends brought to him throughout his final years and days. He is survived by his wife Roberta Hunt; sons Mark (Amy) and Andrew (Ashley); stepdaughters Jackie (David) Smith and Megan (Ward) Davis; grandchildren Phina Gus Levi Mack Ashton Brooksley Nolan Wyatt and Wren; and his siblings Paul (Dianne) Larry (Terry) Bill (Ruth) MaryBeth (Tom) Kulikosky and many nieces and nephews. Tim was preceded in death by his mother Mary Ann father Richard and sister Maureen. Out of deep concern for the health and safety of Tim's many friends and family members a memorial service will be postponed until a later date when we can safely gather to remember and celebrate Tim's life. Details will be shared. Memorials preferred to Second Harvest Heartland ( 2harvest.org ) to help end hunger.

The S&P 500 ended a highly volatile year at an all time high and overall was up 16.3%. Meanwhile several stocks in the healthcare sector fetched attractive returns for investors. However that list did not include Gilead Sciences and Biogen.

Does Wall Street expect these stocks to recover this year? We used TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool to find out whether analysts see upside potential in Gilead and Biogen and pick the stock offering a better investment opportunity.

Gilead Sciences (GILD)

Gilead Sciences grabbed headlines last year when its antiviral drug remdesivir (sold under the brand name Veklury) was granted emergency use authorization in May by the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for the treatment of COVID-19. In October 2020 remdesivir became the first FDA-approved treatment in the US for COVID-19 patients.

The company generated better-than-anticipated results in 3Q mainly due to remdesivir which generated $873 million in sales and drove a more than 17% rise in overall 3Q revenue to $6.6 billion. Gilead’s 3Q adjusted EPS increased 29% year-over-year to $2.11. (See GILD stock analysis on TipRanks)

However the company trimmed its 2020 revenue forecast to the range of $23 billion-$23.5 billion from the previous outlook of $23 billion-$25 billion and cautioned that remdesivir revenue is subject to significant volatility and uncertainty. Also its hepatitis C virus (HCV) business continues to be under pressure amid the pandemic.

Gilead has a strong HIV portfolio including its lead drug Biktarvy. Sales from HIV products grew 8% to $4.5 billion in 3Q and accounted for 70% of the company’s overall product sales. That said there are concerns about sales of HIV drug Truvada due to loss of exclusivity.

Meanwhile the company is strengthening its business through strategic acquisitions in key growth areas like oncology. Last year Gilead acquired Immunomedics for $21 billion. This acquisition added Trodelvy an FDA-approved metastatic triple-negative breast cancer treatment to Gilead’s portfolio. The company also acquired clinical-stage immuno-oncology company Forty Seven for $4.9 billion in 2020.

Most recently Gilead announced an agreement to acquire German biotech MYR GmbH which is focused on developing therapeutics for the treatment of chronic hepatitis delta virus.

Investors were disappointed when Gilead announced in December that it will not pursue the FDA’s approval for filgotinib as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the US following a meeting with the regulator. The company entered into a new agreement with partner Galapagos under which the latter will assume sole responsibility in Europe for filgotinib where 200 mg and 100 mg doses are approved for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis and in all future indications.

In reaction to this development Oppenheimer analyst Hartaj Singh lowered his price target to $100 from $105. However the analyst reiterated a Buy rating on Gilead as he continues to believe in his thesis of “(1) a dependable remdesivir/other medicines business against SARS-CoV flares (2) a base business (HIV/oncology/HCV) growing low-single digits over the next couple of years (3) operating leverage providing greater earnings growth and (4) a 3-4% dividend yield.”

Currently the rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic with a Moderate Buy analyst consensus based on 10 Buys 12 Holds and 1 Sell. The average price target of $74 suggests an upside potential of 27% from current levels. Shares declined 10.4% in 2020.

Biogen (BIIB)

2020 was a tough year for Biogen which specializes in treatments for neurological disorders. The company faced a setback in November when the FDA’s Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee voted against the effectiveness of aducanumab an investigational antibody for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.

The news led to a major sell-off in Biogen shares as investors saw aducanumab as a potential blockbuster drug for the company. The Advisory Committee’s recommendations are non-binding for consideration by the FDA and the company disclosed that the FDA will continue the review process with a decision on aducanumab’s approval to be made by March 7 2021. (See BIIB stock analysis on TipRanks)

To add to investors’ worries Biogen lost a patent dispute with Mylan in June 2020 for its top-selling multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera which exposes it to competition from Mylan’s generic version. Tecfidera’s revenue fell 15% in 3Q to $953 million reflecting the impact of multiple generic entrants in the US.

Moreover Biogen’s spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza is feeling the impact from Roche’s Evrysdi with sales of the drug declining 10% to $495 million in 3Q. Overall the company’s 3Q revenue fell 6.2% to $3.4 billion and adjusted EPS declined 3.6% to $8.84. Biogen lowered its full-year revenue outlook to $13.2 billion-$13.4 billion from $13.8 billion-$14.2 billion assuming “significant erosion of TECFIDERA” in 4Q.

Biogen has been entering into strategic collaborations to gain access to drugs with promising potential. Recently it announced a $1.5 billion (plus potential milestone payments) deal with Sage Therapeutics to co-develop and sell zuranolone (SAGE-217) for major depressive disorder (MDD) postpartum depression (PPD) and other psychiatric disorders and SAGE-324 for essential tremor and other neurological disorders.

Following the SAGE deal Oppenheimer analyst Jay Olson reiterated a Buy rating on Biogen with a $300 price target. Olson explained “Zuranolone is a potential first-in-class oral therapy for the treatment of MDD and PPD currently in multiple Ph3 studies. Given our view that zuranolone is an active drug and the considerable market opportunity in MDD/PPD we believe the deal provides BIIB some much-needed revenue growth in the mid-term and better positions BIIB regardless of the aducanumab outcome.”

Meanwhile the Street is sidelined on Biogen with a Hold analyst consensus based on 11 Buys 13 Holds and 5 Sells. The average price target stands at $293.74 implying a possible upside of 20% in the months ahead. Biogen shares fell 17.5% last year.

Conclusion

After a rocky 2020 the Street’s sentiment looks better for Gilead than Biogen backed by factors like the company’s HIV portfolio and prospects in oncology. Also unlike Biogen Gilead pays dividends and has a dividend yield of 4.67%.

Now the asset-management giant is setting its sights lower.

BlackRock’s staffers conceded the target was unrealistic after struggling to meet fundraising goals. The firm’s staffers hope to grow the fund to between $4 billion and $6 billion in assets over time people familiar with the matter said.

Best known for funds that track broad markets and trade on exchanges BlackRock launched fundraising for a strategy in 2018 to make direct long-term investments in private companies. The fund was an aggressive gambit to take on private equity’s big league deal makers.

Private markets are one of the few corners of finance untouched by fee pressures that have pulled the cost of investing closer to zero. But it is hard to build a presence from scratch. Many asset managers face challenges replicating their reach over stock-and-bond markets in the complex labor-intensive business of investing in privately held companies.

So far BlackRock has raised less than one-third of its original goal—$3.4 billion as of the end of 2020 according to people familiar with the matter. BlackRock which had an initial year-and-a-half window to raise money for the fund missed internal fundraising deadlines and asked investors for a few more months to seek money according to some of the people familiar with the matter. Now BlackRock can’t raise further money until 80% of that money is invested fund documents dictate.

Firm executives have told investors BlackRock is committed to the fund.

“As one of the largest first-time private equity funds ever we look forward to investing in and working with more companies seeking a long-term strategic partner to help them grow their business"" said André Bourbonnais who heads the strategy known as Long Term Private Capital.

In 2019 the fund bought a stake in Authentic Brands Group which owns brands including Sports Illustrated and Nine West. It invested in a luxury perfume maker in 2020.

BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink has pushed the firm with $7.8 trillion in assets to grow its illiquid alternatives business. BlackRock’s illiquid alternatives franchise has roughly $80 billion invested across infrastructure credit and other strategies in hard-to-trade wagers. This business punched above its weight delivering 4% of the firm’s fee revenues in the third quarter even while accounting for 1% of assets. The business has grown as pensions and endowments hunt for returns in a low-interest era.

However BlackRock’s experiment in private equity has been a tough sell.

The fund was structured differently from traditional private-equity funds that exit bets and give investors their money back within a set period of time. Some institutions balked at tying up money in BlackRock’s fund with no deadlines for returning investor money or a proven track record. Some investors asked BlackRock to settle for more modest fundraising goals.

The fund’s architect Mark Wiseman hoped that a selling point of the fund was that fees would fall as it got bigger. BlackRock found it harder to attract new investors after Mr. Wiseman was pushed out of the firm in late 2019 for failing to disclose a relationship with a subordinate. Investors questioned if the team would stay together.

Mr. Bourbonnais the executive leading the fund was a top candidate in 2020 for the top job at Canadian pension fund giant Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec said people familiar with the matter. He remained at BlackRock.

When the pandemic struck it was tough getting pensions excited about untested strategies.

Despite missing the $12 billion fund target BlackRock was still successful in raising over $22 billion for illiquid alternative projects in the year ended September 2020 a person familiar with the matter said.

A group led by former Goldman Sachs investors is on track to raise in excess of its $1.5 billion target by early 2021 to buy secondhand fund stakes. BlackRock sealed $5.1 billion in 2020 for a fund to invest in power plants and energy infrastructure.

“As clients are increasing their exposure to private markets we have raised record amounts for our illiquid strategies over the last year across private credit real assets and private equity"" said Edwin Conway the head of BlackRock’s alternatives business.

To knit staffers more closely to the success of the alternatives business BlackRock is in early discussions over new ways for professionals to share in profits typically reserved for select executives investment staff and firm shareholders for future funds people familiar with the matter said.

Dave Gadhia has a message for anyone who questions the value of good governance: It can be worth $9-billion.

Mr. Gadhia is deputy chair of Flutter Entertainment PLC one of the world’s largest gambling companies. He took a long strange trip to help build what’s now a $40-billion business It was a journey filled with boardroom intrigue including showdowns with a former chief executive officer regulators and major shareholders Blackstone Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc.

The four-year odyssey turned the Vancouver-based executive into an outspoken advocate for strong boards of directors a role he’s taking on at a time when investors are increasingly focused on understanding the hard-to-measure environment social and governance components of a company.

“The lesson from my experience is compelling value can be created by a board that takes its responsibilities seriously and is willing to engage with shareholders” Mr. Gadhia said in an interview.

Mr. Gadhia 57 never intended to have a second career as a board member. He ran then sold Burnaby B.C.-based Gateway Casinos & Entertainment Ltd. one of Canada largest gambling companies. In 2010 he agreed to what he expected would be a six-month stint as a director at what was then called Amaya Inc. He did it as a favour to the co-founder David Baazov.

What followed was a governance baptism by fire. Pointe-Claire Que.-based Amaya acquired a number of online gambling businesses including PokerStars the dominant player in the sector. Then the company almost collapsed in 2016 when Mr. Baazov faced insider trading charges from Quebec’s securities regulator an investigation that played out as he tried and failed to take Amaya private.

In the spring of 2016 the Amaya board named Mr. Gadhia as chair. Mr. Baazov departed in August. The stock price slumped and although the company was the leading online poker platform with a $3-billion market capitalization institutional shareholders pushed for its sale. Looking back Mr. Gadhia said: “David was a great deal maker but a poor operator.”

To fix Amaya Mr. Gadhia and the board called a halt to acquisitions. The chair renewed the board by recruiting proven directors then hired executives with experience in the gambling sector. Amaya set a new course diversifying away from a poker business that accounted for 70 per cent of revenue.

Then Mr. Gadhia hit the road for what he recalls as “intimidating” meetings with disgruntled shareholders including Blackstone and BlackRock two of the world’s largest fund managers.

“We had to look shareholders in the eye explain we went wrong and explain exactly what we were going to do to fix it” he said.

Blackstone BlackRock and a number of other institutions agreed to back the turnaround. A Canadian company that had nearly failed leaving shareholders with nothing found international suitors. Rather than being sold Amaya returned to the acquisition trail snapping up British-based Stars Group for $5-billion in 2014. The combined companies were taken over by Dublin-based Flutter in May for $9-billion one of the largest successful deals in pandemic-plagued 2020.

“In my experience boards should look at engaging with their stakeholders as an opportunity not a threat especially when you’re in crisis” said Mr. Gadhia. “At a minimum you’ll learn something. Beyond that you might just find the allies you need to succeed.”

Flutter’s stock price is up 60 per cent since Mr. Gadhia joined its board in May continuing a two-year rally in the company’s shares that reflects a more liberal approach to sports betting in the lucrative U.S. market. Flutter is already a major player in British sports wagering and the company partnered with Fox Corp. as part of a push into the United States. Recent filings show BlackRock owns a 5-per-cent stake in Flutter worth more than $2-billion.

As a board member Mr. Gadhia said he cannot comment in detail on Flutter’s performance and strategy but said the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the shift to sports betting through mobile devices such as cellphones.

Special to the Farmville Herald

Qualifying older adults in the area have a resource in an agency on aging whose mission is to provide supportive services and advocacy for persons 60 years of age and older.

Email newsletter signup

Piedmont Senior Resources Inc. (PSR) headquartered in Farmville serves seniors in Prince Edward Buckingham Cumberland Charlotte Lunenburg Amelia and Nottoway counties.

PSR provides numerous services most income based to hundreds of clients throughout southside Virginia. Those services include home delivered meals care packages non-emergency medical transportation to doctor appointments care coordinators for clients who have difficulties with self-care and a homemaker program that provides meal preparation and basic companionship.

Before COVID changed social activities many PSR seniors would participate in weekly county-based Friendship Cafes. When the virus shut down the cafes PSR created a volunteer phone-based wellness check system that has proven to be successful in making connections with seniors who otherwise would be shut-in and socially isolated.

Over the past six months PSR volunteers have made more than 2700 phone calls to seniors for monthly check-ins to see how they are doing. They also inquire about what needs they may have and sometimes simply chat and socialize.

One situation demonstrates the importance of PSR in the lives of seniors.

“PSR has a very skilled team of individuals who often intervene and advocate in situations on behalf of seniors” Nutrition and Transportation Director Thomas Jordan Miles III said. “One of these people is Nikki Dean our nutrition program coordinator who was instrumental in helping the client in this story.”

The calls are fairly simple to make. The volunteers identify themselves and ask how the senior is doing. The volunteer in this case was Buckingham resident Margaret “Maggie” Snoddy. The PSR senior was Donald Ostrander. The results of that simple call were life changing.

It turns out that when Snoddy called 83-year-old Ostrander (who had just signed up as a PSR client) for the first time he was in Hampton where he’d gone to get medical treatment at a VA hospital. Along with prostate cancer Ostrander was struggling with pain from a hernia. While getting treatment he was placed in a Hampton shelter.

Ostrander now sees Snoddy as a gift from an angel.

“I told her I was in Hampton and could not receive PSR meals at that time” Ostrander said.

Snoddy noted his situation and said she or another volunteer would call back the next month.

“I told myself she ain’t going to call me back. What am I going to do?” Ostander said. “The situation in the shelter was not good. I couldn’t take it anymore. I didn’t know where I was going but I knew I had to leave.”

Ostrander managed to get a ride back to Farmville ending up in a motel in Blackstone basically homeless.

With cancer a painful hernia and now homeless Ostrander was at a very low place.

“I went to a church in Blackstone and spoke to God. I asked him to cure me. That was on a Sunday” he said. “The hospital was supposed to operate that following Wednesday. The doctor tested me first and the cancer was gone.”

Meanwhile continuing to stay in the Blackstone Motel was not financially possible for Ostrander.

“I got on my knees by my bed and asked God ‘what am I going to do?’ I didn’t have any money and I need a place to stay by the first of the month” he said.

That is when the next month’s wellness check-in call came from Snoddy and PSR went into action. After Snoddy learned that Ostrander had returned to the area she alerted PSR about his situation. Along with finding him an affordable place to stay PSR helped set up rides to doctor appointments made sure he had nutritous meals as well as helping with other essential needs.

“When Maggie called and informed me of Mr. Ostrander’s situation I immediately contacted Mr. Ostrander to see what PSR could do to help” Dean said. “His story brought tears to my eyes and I immediately got to work on finding him a place to stay. Once he was settled we made sure he had the necessary food clothes and other bedding items so he was comfortable. Then I got to work on his medical issues. Thankfully we were able to contact the VA on his behalf straighten up his medical issues and get him the transportation he needed to make those much-needed doctors’ appointments. Mr. Ostrander is a sweet man and has been 100% appreciative for everything given to help him throughout this process. This is why I do what I do and why I love what I do.”

Ostrander looks at PSR and Snoddy as his lifesavers. He also acknowledges God’s power.

“Look at what he did” he said. “I can’t turn God away. There’s only one God. You’re going to need him one day. I was all alone and no family.”

Ostrander gives much credit to Snoddy for being his guardian angel.

“Thank you all for what you’re doing” he said to Snoddy when she recently visited him in Blackstone. “I wouldn’t know what to do or where to go. You came to my rescue.”

Ostrander is now settled in his new home. His medical issues are being addressed and PSR continues to provide vital services to him so he can continue to live independently. Each month he still gets his monthly wellness call from Snoddy who has also worked with PSR to identify a volunteer in Amelia County who delivers groceries to him.

Snoddy as well as the other PSR volunteers know they are making a difference.

That 16 percent surge among Gotham fat cats since mid-March included big gains for former Mayor Mike Bloomberg the city’s richest person whose financial data and media empire shot up by $6.8 billion to some $55 billion a 14 percent spike says Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies which crunched the Forbes data.

President Trump also did quite well as his net worth grew by $420 million jumping from $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion a 20 percent increase the data shows.

New Mets owner and hedge fund titan Steve Cohen is also among the metro-area billionaires — a class of 141 — who had a great 2020 adding $700 million to his pile which now totals $14.6 billion a 5 percent uptick.

Buoyed by trillions in federal COVID-relief largesse Wall Street powerbrokers notched some of the largest gains.

Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone Group fattened his wallet by some $5 billion to about $21 billion a 34 percent gain. JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon’s holdings went from $1.2 billion million to $1.5 billion about a 29 percent increase.

Even so those gains were not as rosy as the national average. America’s 651 billionaires collectively padded their pockets by a cool $1 trillion going from $2.95 trillion to $4 trillion a 36 percent bump.

And some New Yorkers lost money.

Gristedes supermarket owner John Catsimatidis who also has oil and real estate holdings saw his portfolio go down by $453 million to $2.8 billion a 13 percent decline.

Hedge fund icon Ray Dalio author of the 2017 philosophical bestseller “Principles” shed more than $1 billion to drop to about $17 billion a 6 percent decline.

Analysts blame the downturn on Dalio’s $148 billion Bridgewater Associates which got hammered for the second straight year on bad bets. Tragically Dalio’s 42-year-old son Devon died last month in a fiery car wreck in Greenwich Conn.

Leveraged buyout king and Revlon tycoon Ron Perelman also took a financial hit. His balance sheet lost some $450 million to about $6 billion or a nearly 7 percent plunge. Perelman’s wealth built on credit and high stakes deals has been hurt by losses from his troubled New York-based cosmetics company.

But most New York titans are celebrating.

Investor Carl Icahn’s nest egg grew by more than half a billion to roughly $14 billion a 3.8 percent jump. Money man George Soros’ stack added $300 million to go to nearly $9 billion a gain of 3.6 percent gain.

Cablevision and Madison Square Garden baron Charles Dolan also saw about a half a billion benefit going from $4.6 billion to more than $5 billion a 10.5 percent spike. Media tycoon Barry Diller’s fortunes soared by $1.65 billion to $4.65 billion a 55 percent surge.

The meteoric windfalls came largely because of the trillions of dollars in federal pandemic grants which shored up the economy when offices and businesses closed plants shuttered and millions of workers lost their jobs.

“In many cases the actions taken by Congress and the Federal Reserve have directly subsidized the biggest businesses and underwritten a huge boom on Wall Street and in the value of privately-held corporations — while providing only modest short-term aid to regular people and small businesses” Michael Kink a Wall Street critic and anti-poverty activist told The Post.

Frank Clemente executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness said “Never before has America seen such an accumulation of wealth in so few hands. As tens of millions of Americans suffer from the health and economic ravages of this pandemic a few hundred billionaires add to their massive fortunes.”

The billionaire gains have prompted elected leaders in New York and Washington to call for tax increases on the wealthy to plug steep budget shortfalls.

To fix Amaya Mr. Gadhia and the board called a halt to acquisitions. The chair renewed the board by recruiting proven directors then hired executives with experience in the gambling sector. Amaya set a new course diversifying away from a poker business that accounted for 70 per cent of revenue.

Then Mr. Gadhia hit the road for what he recalls as “intimidating” meetings with disgruntled shareholders including Blackstone and BlackRock two of the world’s largest fund managers.

“We had to look shareholders in the eye explain we went wrong and explain exactly what we were going to do to fix it” he said.

Blackstone BlackRock and a number of other institutions agreed to back the turnaround. A Canadian company that had nearly failed leaving shareholders with nothing found international suitors. Rather than being sold Amaya returned to the acquisition trail snapping up British-based Stars Group for $5-billion in 2014. The combined companies were taken over by Dublin-based Flutter in May for $9-billion one of the largest successful deals in pandemic-plagued 2020.

“In my experience boards should look at engaging with their stakeholders as an opportunity not a threat especially when you’re in crisis” said Mr. Gadhia. “At a minimum you’ll learn something. Beyond that you might just find the allies you need to succeed.”

Flutter’s stock price is up 60 per cent since Mr. Gadhia joined its board in May continuing a two-year rally in the company’s shares that reflects a more liberal approach to sports betting in the lucrative U.S. market. Flutter is already a major player in British sports wagering and the company partnered with Fox Corp. as part of a push into the United States. Recent filings show BlackRock owns a 5-per-cent stake in Flutter worth more than $2-billion.

As a board member Mr. Gadhia said he cannot comment in detail on Flutter’s performance and strategy but said the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the shift to sports betting through mobile devices such as cellphones.

By John Goglia / Chicago Tribune

The ungrounding of Boeing’s 737 Max is undoubtedly a major milestone for an aircraft with a sordid history: responsible for two crashes that resulted in the deaths of 346 people which then exposed a deeply troubling relationship between the company and Federal Aviation Administration regulators who were supposed to oversee it.

While it appears that Boeing has met all the criteria laid out by the FAA and other authorities that participated in the review of the Max now getting people back on the airplane becomes the bigger problem.

The airlines will be implementing all sorts of measures to convince people that the airplane is safe to fly such as test flights with executives waiving change fees or even eliminating the Max branding. They have learned from the aftermath of other aviation disasters that aggressive communication that is open honest and discusses their problems and solutions goes a long way toward rebuilding confidence.

But the airlines cannot do this alone and they are not going to be successful if Boeing and FAA continue to resist providing more transparency on their decision-making which has been requested from groups ranging from pilots’ unions lawmakers and the family members of those who died in the two Max crashes.

In 1979 the FAA grounded the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 after a crash — largely caused by flawed maintenance procedures — led to the deaths of 271 people. Once the ban was lifted after 37 days the plane was quickly reembraced by carriers and passengers.

Boeing today faces a much steeper uphill climb. First the plane was grounded for 21 months and more time only breeds more concern about the safety and viability of the aircraft. But more importantly in 1979 the FAA had the full credibility with the U.S. traveling public and foreign regulatory authorities. Today its image is tarnished and it is no longer considered the gold standard. The House Transportation Committee delivered a blunt assessment: “Boeing failed in its design and development of the Max and the FAA failed in its oversight of Boeing and its certification of the aircraft.”

Ultimately the traveling public will not just willingly accept what the FAA says; one report from last year found that 40 percent of regular flyers would be unwilling to fly on the Max. This leaves it to Boeing to do what airlines have done for years after their accidents — work with key stakeholders such as outside experts and the families of victims — to show an extreme level of transparency about the changes it made to the Max and the supporting data behind them to regain travelers’ trust. This can be accomplished in several ways.

First Boeing should release data regarding the changes made to the airplane that support its safety. This does not mean releasing information such as software code or other proprietary information. What would be useful is simulator and flight test data to demonstrate how the “new” Max operates in certain scenarios and pilot reaction times during such situations. The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association recently submitted comments to the FAA calling the Max’s new emergency checklists “clunky at best” which does not inspire confidence in the safety of the redesigned plane.

Second the public needs an update on the still unfinished Ethiopian Airlines investigation which was the second Max crash in March 2019. Boeing and regulators have claimed they are unable to release certain documents until it is completed; however it raises the question as to why the plane should be ungrounded if an investigation is still pending. If there is no ongoing investigative activity which seems the case all documents relating to it should be released.

Third outside of technical data the FAA should disclose what assurances Boeing has provided concerning safety culture changes they both desperately need to ensure this situation never occurs again. It has been reported that Boeing engineers were fearful of speaking out on safety concerns while others inside the company were completely dismissive of the FAA (stating they were “like dogs watching TV”).

The FAA needs to reassert its authority in overseeing the industry and the industry is hopefully using this moment to be introspective about its own failings. Moreover the Government Accountability Office and the Department of Transportation’s inspector general need to ensure that the FAA fulfills its mission of overseeing the industry rather than being captured by it.

After two crashes the public is right to be skeptical of Boeing and the FAA. Under these unique circumstances more transparency and disclosure is necessary so technical experts engineers and safety advocates (as well as the public) can fully assess the fix and be confident it is safe for return to flight.

Only when this occurs will Boeing’s commercial customers embrace the Max and passengers not hesitate before boarding a plane that hopefully has better and safer days ahead.

Norsk Titanium delivered new Boeing 787 Dreamliner components to Leonardo’s Grottaglie Plant based in South Italy and part of Leonardo’s Aerostructures Division. Norsk is a Norwegian-American firm providing additive manufacturing of aerospace-grade titanium components (using proprietary RPD technology).

This delivery adds a third production customer to Norsk’s growing commercial aerostructures customer base and represents Norsk’s first recurring production order from a European Union based Aerospace company.

“We are pleased to be Leonardo’s supplier” said Karl Fossum director of customer programs for Norsk. “This delivery marks a significant increase in the number of additively manufactured parts previously manufactured from titanium plate. It also is an important step towards our mission to provide an alternative to titanium forgings in aerospace applications.”

Using Norsk’s Rapid Plasma Deposition (RPD) process Norsk engineers designed Ti-6Al-4V preforms that reduced raw material needs by over 40 percent. Leveraging the RPD industrial process enabled Norsk to create a near-net-shape design while maintaining the stringent process control and material properties needed for structural applications in Boeing aircraft.

In 2018 Norsk Titanium has initiated qualification for additively manufactured titanium structural components for the Boeing 787 aircraft through an ongoing partnership with Spirit AeroSystems. The qualification process validated Norsk Titanium’s production and industrialization processes while integrating Spirit’s workscope of machining additively manufactured near-net shape components. The qualification sought to verify the aircraft parts’ material properties and overall conformity to requirements.

Leonardo does not share many details of its AM operations with the public however 3dpbm is aware of the company’s intensive testing on the industrialization of metal 3D printed parts within its helicopter production lines. At the Grottaglie site Leonardo’s Aerostructures Division has also been testing filament extrusion additive technology in the production process for composite aerospace materials.

In this case polymer 3D printing technology was implemented internally to replace traditional metallic molds with polymer-based elements (nylon carbon fiber and PEEK carbon fiber reinforced composites) reducing the cost and time factors involved in the test process and offering an increase in design flexibility. Leonardo was able to remove any porosity and surface wrinkles typically associated with items printed using fused filament fabrication technology – an essential factor also for maintaining a vacuum during the ‘curing’ stage of the process."

“I’d have gone even quicker to be honest but the wind caused a bit of a wobble so I eased off.”

Read in isolation that is the basis of nearly every motorsport story. ‘I’d have done even better if only for the never-ending battle against nature and conditions.’ ‘I’d have gone quicker faster or more if only…’ But with a bit of context that particular opening statement is truly mind-bending and it’s about time you learned about Ted Brady the man behind one of the craziest records ever set.





Anyone who’s ever laid their hands upon a motorcycle’s handles will know the urge to twist the throttle. Go faster go further go up on the back wheel. Ted was the exact same.

“I was 18 when I first got a bike and it was a case of just going out and messing. We’d race each other but then I learned to wheelie and that was it. I was on the back wheel everywhere; any chance at all really.”

So far so very normal – a young fella popping wheelies what’s new? But for Ted it was just the beginning of an obsession that’s led him to world records and invites to some of motorsport’s biggest events.





Ted takes up the backstory: “As I was getting older I started to get a buzz for competition. I entered a few local drag races but by the end I’d get bored and end up doing the course on the back wheel. I toyed with the idea of going road racing and tried out a few short course hill climbs but it wasn’t for me. The risk was too big and I doubt my mother would have ever let me do it.”

With racing pushed to one side an outlet was still needed. There was a will to go fast and a constant urge to do wheelies so in 1996 Ted headed across the Irish Sea for his very first competition. It was the start of a frenzied drive to become the fastest.

“The first time I went over I just had my normal road bike in the back of the van. I knew no-one and landed on the Isle of Man not knowing what to expect. It was just a huge runway a load of great people and some of the quickest motorbikes I’d ever seen. Everyone was so welcoming and I was like a kid with all the freedom to go as fast as I could.”





Over the next few years the bug bit. Wheelie competitions are a simple business: a 1km stretch of tarmac and the aim to go as quick as possible with the front wheel raised. I’ll leave Ted describe what its like from his perspective…

“It’s just a rush. The marshal gets the message to go and you get a tap on the shoulder. It’s head down short shift right up to sixth gear. We get about one kilometre to get up to speed with the throttle pinned but in sixth I have to be right at a sweet spot. Then properly moving at about 180mph [290km/h] the front comes up and it’s all guns blazing then. The wind is pushing your body in all manner of directions but I still have the throttle wide open. The cushion taped onto the seat doesn’t look great but that was key – it kept me in the seat at full speed.”

Just picture that for a moment. Flat out down a runway and deciding to pop a wheelie while shifting into sixth gear…





“Cross the line it’s a case of get speed off as quickly as possible without locking up. The front wheel shoots a cloud of smoke when it hits the ground and binds up for a second or two but then I ease down the gears but there ain’t much room to spare.”



Remember that sentence at the start? The ‘I’d have gone quicker’ one? Well in 2017 during a Straighliners competition at the ex-RAF Elvington airfield in Yorkshire England Ted went faster than anyone ever before.

“I set the record at 217.85mph [350.59km/h] that day but the wind was really starting to pick up and it got a bit squirrelly towards the end in fairness so I had to back off a bit.”

No that is not a typo. The man before me who is such an absolute gent has just very calmly described touching over two hundred and seventeen miles per hour on the back wheel. For perspective all those clips you see of the Isle of Man TT or the North West 200 the top speeds are in the 196 to 198mph [315 to 318km/h] territory but this unsung hero from the south of Ireland is eclipsing that down a UK runway.

“I was delighted when I got the record especially now its in the Guinness Book of Records but I keep thinking that I’d love to get back over and try to go even quicker. It’s always the drive to go quicker you know. When I was on a 1000cc the plan was to be the quickest and when this machine came up I knew it was my chance to go for the real speeds.”

The machine part of this record is almost as impressive as the feat achieved. Born from a road-going bike purchased by a friend from new Ted’s Suzuki GSX 1300R Hayabusa is a long way from how it left the Toyokawa Plant in Japan in early 2004.





“It was a bike that I’d seen on the road and really liked and I knew in my hands it could be developed into what it is today. When the chance came to buy it I just knew it was the one to set the record. It’s not the most polished up or showy thing but it does exactly what it needs to do.”

At it’s core this is a turbocharged ‘Busa pushed to the limit. The ‘Stage 3′ build features a BorgWarner EFR 7163 turbo allowing for 540bhp to be sent directly to the rear wheel. The overall weight of 240kg (529lb) is heavy in the bike world but the power-to-weight ratio is on a scale I’ve never seen before.





“The engine was built by Holeshot Racing in the UK. They pretty much changed everything necessary to handle the boost levels but the engine is so strong from the factory that it can take a lot of abuse. Holeshot changed the pistons con-rods the cams and then bolted on the turbo.”

The work of Holeshot continued through to the electronics. “They got everything running through a Syvecs standalone ECU mounted under the seat and that feeds everything onto the AiM digital dash.”





“It’s actually fine riding at speed. It’s a bit heavy and the boost can come on strong but I do like to test it every once in a while keep it all working well and make sure there are no surprises for when I get back to Elvington for another go.”

That’s the overarching desire that shines through that this isn’t finished yet. The record may be in the bag but that just means a target on the back. There’ll always be someone looking to knock you off the perch so why not raise the bar.





As we finished up the shoot I still struggled to make sense of the whole thing. Here before me are two very different items. To my left decked out in leathers and telling stories of rubbing shoulders with the greats of the motorsport world at Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2019 is one of the nicest and most humble men I’ve ever met and to my right idles the single scariest motorbike I have ever seen up close.

Ted Brady is a record setter a thrill seeker and has an unending passion for hunting speed. Not many have heard of the quiet man from Co. Cork but what he does is downright spectacular.

The property is on the westbound side of Route 9 after Price Chopper and South Street. It primarily consists of woods.

“We’re looking forward to working with the new owner and to understanding what they will put on the property” Shrewsbury Assistant Town Manager Kristen Las said. Prior to the purchase Las said the pieces of land had been on the market for a while and she said she was looking forward to welcoming Boch to Shrewsbury

Boch Shrewsbury — Worcester is managed by Ernest A. Boch Jr. and Robert C. Weiss of 111 Morse St. Norwood according to the Massachusetts secretary of state's office. The Morse Street address is the location of Subaru of New England.

The entity runs multiple car dealerships around New England including Toyota Honda Hyundai Chevrolet and Nissan.

Beth Casavant chairman of the Shrewsbury Board of Selectmen said the town welcomes the opportunity to see its economic base develop.

“We’re always looking to increase our economic development base” Casavant said “We have a small area of land available for economic development so every parcel of land is extremely important for developing our community.”

Since the purchase was a private deal between Boch and the property owners Casavant said that the town was not aware of the deal before it was made. Any development plans for a potential dealership would need to go to the town for evaluation before Boch could build one on the property.

Casavant said that she expects Boch to be a good neighbor in the town. Route 9 is a key commercial area for the town and one where the town is hoping to attract new business Casavant said.

Karen J. Chapman president & CEO of Corridor Nine Area Chamber of Commerce said news of continued development in her region is welcome after a particularly difficult year for businesses. New development brings along hopes of businesses coming to the region and creating jobs Chapman said.

""Continued development is really helping in a tough year"" she said ""The light at the end of 2020 is seeing these new developments.""

Chapman pointed to plans to develop the former Edgemere Drive-In on Route 20 in Shrewsbury into supermarket and apartment properties and the Boch purchase as examples of promising development in her region.

News of the purchase was also welcomed by Timothy Murray president and CEO of the Worcester Regional Chamber of Commerce. He said the good economic news for Shrewsbury will also be felt in Worcester.

“Anytime there’s new investment in the region that’s a positive” Murray said “This acquisition underscores continued interest in Central Mass.”

Lilly Attell Realty Trust sold the 25.3 acres at 701 Boston Turnpike. The property includes a 1600-square-foot single-family home. The latest town records assessed the property at $710700.

Tim and Eileen Samara sold a half-acre adjoining site at 713 Boston Turnpike. The property includes a 1100-square-foot single family home and it was assessed at $280600 according to town records.

The origins of the site home to the new headquarters of electric vehicle-maker Fisker Inc. stretch back more than 50 years.



In 1969 entrepreneur and general contractor Charles Lundquist launched Continental Development Corp. The basis of his new company was 20 acres of land in the South Bay that he had acquired for UNIMERC an investment group Lundquist had formed 14 years earlier.



He merged UNIMERC into Continental Development Corp. and started building out the plot of land that would become Continental Park.



Over the next five decades Continental Development would steadily grow its presence in L.A. The company now holds roughly 4 million square feet of commercial and office space in California and its expansion continues today under the leadership of the founder’s son Richard Lundquist who came aboard in 1972.



“Growing up I always knew I wanted to be involved in real estate development” he said.



But Lundquist’s first big role was not in his father’s company. Instead he and a friend started a home building business creating spec homes.



His dad then asked him to join Continental but Lundquist continued building homes on the side. By 1988 he was working on Continental’s commercial properties full time.



Lundquist became president of Continental after holding other roles at the company including construction project manager and working with the property management department. After his dad retired in the mid-1990s he acquired the company.



Lundquist said he “enjoyed the relationships with our (commercial real estate) tenants. Tenants are a little different than residents and I really loved the aspects of that type of development that we do. The office the medical office retail restaurants and we’ve done a movie theater complex and fitness facilities. I enjoyed the variety and the aspect of holding onto the assets instead of just selling a home to a buyer.”



Continental also has several projects in the construction or planning phases.



Most recently the company developed an office campus called Del Rey in partnership with Mar Ventures Inc. It’s also working on the Nash Street Exchange a 7.3-acre site near the El Segundo Boulevard Green Line station that will have 75000 square feet of retail dining and medical office space.



And in July Boston Properties Inc. acquired a 50% interest in Continental Development’s planned Beach Cities Media Campus a 6.4-acre site on the western border of Continental Park.



El Segundo and beyond

Continental Development has long been interested in El Segundo.



“That’s where my father’s manufacturing business was that he would end up with the land. The buildings were in Manhattan Beach on Rosecrans … and they had acquired approximately 20 acres for expansion in El Segundo” Lundquist said.



At the time the market had higher vacancy rates. That plus its proximity to the airports and ocean and the fact that the city is very business-friendly made it a desirable area to develop Lundquist said.



“It seemed like an excellent place to continue our development activity” he said.

El Segundo known as an aerospace hub and for its Chevron refinery has been attracting a greater variety of tenants lately.



During the third quarter of 2020 the asking rate for Class A space in the area was $4.44 a square foot up 5 cents in a year according to data from Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. That number might seem high but it’s still a discount compared to parts of the Westside like Santa Monica where the average asking rent was $6.64 a square foot during the third quarter.



Continental has also worked on projects in other L.A. County cities and it has substantial holdings in Torrance in the medical office field.



Lundquist said Del Rey the company’s most recently completed project was “a very nice development that is suited for the post-Covid world.”



Del Rey is comprised of three two-story buildings on roughly 5.7 acres.



In November Electronic Arts Inc. announced it had signed a 10-year lease for a new studio headquarters at the campus. The video game company is leaving its longtime offices in Playa Vista for Del Rey which features lots of outdoor areas and balconies.

“The fact that it was a campus with individual buildings was of interest to (EA) so they could have their own building” Lundquist said.



Some experts say that during and after the Covid pandemic many tenants are likely to seek out their own buildings rather than shared properties.



Lundquist said the company is also incorporating features such as touchless doors and entrances as well as stairways in buildings that allow tenants to avoid elevators.

“We do everything we can to make the buildings work under this new world we are living in” he said.



Adding hotels and more

Continental Park started as an industrial park. Over the years it has added a variety of other uses including a large movie theater complex a fitness facility restaurants and creative office buildings.



Beyond traditional office and retail the company also has substantial medical holdings.



Its Skypark medical office complex in Torrance spans 13 buildings and more than 500000 square feet. It is served by two hospitals.



“Our medical offices are in Torrance and we acquired that property because it was a good value-add opportunity that was presented to us” Lundquist said.



Initially he planned on the project being traditional office space but quickly changed gears.



“After a few months we didn’t have any new tenants signed up after building out a few of these spec suites but we’re receiving a tremendous number of calls for medical space and being in close proximity to Torrance Memorial Hospital decided to concentrate on medical there” Lundquist said.



When Continental acquired the property it was 15-20% medical office space. It is now 80-85% medical office space.



The company has also ventured into hospitality. In 2008 it opened the 32-story InterContinental San Francisco. According to Continental it was the largest new hotel development in the city in more than 20 years.



Lundquist said the company owned the land and the Moscone Center — the city’s biggest convention center — was expanding “all the way up to (our) doorstep.”



“We decided it made the most sense to develop a hotel” Lundquist said. “It’s our first hotel and it could quite possibly be our only hotel.”



Still he said the company could be interested in a high-end boutique hotel being added to the Continental Park area.

In March 2020 the agency had postponed routine site surveillance inspections resuming them four months later for “mission-critical inspections” (e.g. those required to approve potential COVID-19 therapies or vaccines critical drugs that are in short supply and novel drugs developed for serious conditions on fast-track approval) and issued guidance (1) on the subject.

Between March and October 2020 the agency conducted more than 200 such inspections Judith A. McMeekin associate commissioner for regulatory affairs with FDA’s Office of Regulatory Affairs told attendees at the Food and Drug Law Institute’s (FDLI’s) annual conference on October 6 2020 (2).

However based on FDA 483 inspection data for the fiscal year between Oct. 1 2019 and Sept. 30 2020 FDA conducted only 28 biologics plant inspections in 2020 compared with 116 the year before and 349 drug facility inspections vs. 779 in 2019 (34). The lower inspection numbers in 2020 also reflect five months before COVID-19 travel restrictions prevented the agency from conducting inspections.

In lieu of onsite inspections FDA is taking a number of different approaches including document review (permitted under section 704(a)(4) of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act) before or in place of onsite inspections McMeekin said. The agency is also leveraging inspection reports from other global regulatory authorities under the Pharmaceutical Annex to the US/EU Mutual Recognition Agreement.

Data dump vs. communication

Well before the pandemic—in fact for decades now—FDA has emphasized the importance of drug developers communicating with reviewers and inspectors at the agency. “Clearly if one is a sponsor in need of a pre-approval or pre-license inspection being in regular contact with the people at FDA who will be making decisions on your application is key and should extend all the way up the chain of command if necessary” says Mark I. Schwartz director at the Washington D.C.-based law firm Hyman Phelps & McNamara P.C. Schwartz spent 13 years at FDA and left five years ago as deputy director of the agency’s Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality.

FDA’s new remote document review process has underscored the need for sponsor outreach and communication with the agency. Recent examples have shown what can happen when FDA reviews documents remotely without sufficient context. “The biggest mistake a company can make is throwing things over the wall to FDA. It’s up to the owners of the documentation to put it into context for the regulators requesting a meeting to discuss issues with them” says Peter Miller President/CEO of Dynamic Compliance Solutions (DCS) which offers a platform designed to help pharma companies handle remote audits.

In October for example Alkermes received a complete response letter (CRL) from FDA due to tablet coating issues with its new schizophrenia treatment ALKS 3831. Only after the company received the CRL did it discover that FDA was concerned about the tablet coating process that had been used to make development batches. The firm had reportedly resolved these issues for manufacturing-scale batches (5).

“In instances where FDA requests documents it is very important to suggest a call with FDA prior to sending the documents to at least give an overview of any nuances within the documents that exist” says Schwartz. Recalling working on the “other side” on inspections while at FDA he says “One is constantly seeking input from subject matter experts at the facility regarding arcane issues in the company’s records. That connection is completely lacking if the firm just dumps the documents on FDA and it can lead to misunderstandings with tragic consequences for the firm” he says.

So far FDA has been reluctant to approve use of technologies such as 360-degree video (6) to perform remote site tours and inspections. However regulators—including the European Medicines Agency (EMA) the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Health Canada the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia Japan’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency and the Russian Ministry of Health—are all using some forms of remote technology for remote inspections (7).

FDA piloting use of video

McMeekin reported in October 2020 (2) that the agency had begun to pilot the use of new technologies such as live or recorded video in food-related investigations. “As we learn more from the pilot and decide how and when we might use these and other technologies we commit to having transparent dialogues with regulated industry as to how this may affect our procedures in the future” she said (2). However FDA remains cautious about their use in pharmaceutical inspections. “The agency is exploring all options for evaluating facilities when a physical inspection is not feasible [and] is assessing the potential use of other tools to serve as supplements to FDA inspections including remotely evaluating pharmaceutical manufacturing operations using remote live-streamed video and other remote and live interactions with facility operators and records” Charles Kohler press officer with FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) stated in a written response to Pharmaceutical Technology in December 2020.

Some question whether the agency is moving quickly enough to approve the use of supplemental technology for drug and biologics inspections. In the title of an op-ed that was published in December 2020 (8) Schwartz accused FDA of ‘fiddling while pharma burns.’ “It’s difficult to understand the agency’s position but it’s certainly not helpful” he says. Schwartz argues that FDA’s stance against using new technologies for remote inspections has left patients without access to potentially life-saving therapies in 2020. As an example he cites the agency’s failure to approve Bristol Myers Squibb’s (BMS) lymphoma treatment the chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy liso-cel. This approval delay the second so far for the drug happened in November 2020 when a local flare-up of COVID-19 in Texas prevented FDA investigators from traveling safely to BMS’s contract manufacturing partner’s (Lonza’s) facility for an on-site inspection. The postponement occurred even though liso-cel met FDA’s criteria of a ‘mission critical’ inspection in that the therapy had been granted breakthrough therapy and regenerative medicine advanced therapy designations he says.

Schwartz also notes that there is a “real need” for timely pre-approval and pre-license inspections (PAIs and PLIs). “Companies’ livelihoods—and in some cases their very survival—depend on it” he says. It’s also crucial that FDA find a solution for non-mission-critical inspections he says since only a tiny fraction of the inspections that need to be performed have been deemed mission critical by FDA. “While the agency has been performing some record reviews FDA is unwilling to overturn a facility’s Official Action Indicated (OAI) status based on a record review so even if a firm’s records demonstrate full CGMP [current good manufacturing practice] compliance it won’t overturn a previous problematic finding. FDA has also been ambiguous as to whether foreign regulatory reports can overturn a previous problematic FDA finding” he says leaving pharmaceutical firms with few good options.",,,

Brown is among a small number of universities that have agreed to discuss their investments in companies that do business in Israel in order to persuade student protesters to dismantle encampments. Mr. Sternlicht in a scathing email to The New York Times which he copied to Brown’s president Christina H. Paxson said the arrangement amounted to sympathy for Hamas which attacked Israel in October and described students protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza as “ignorant.”

“There should never be a vote when people do not have the facts” he wrote. “It’s not education it’s propaganda.”

Mr. Sternlicht 63 said no deal with protesters could be fruitful because the two sides did not agree on “facts and moral clarity” as well as the scale of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in which about 1200 were killed and another 250 were taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent intense bombardment of the tightly packed area has left more than 34000 dead and drawn international condemnation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYXNoLm5ldC9mMS9uZXdzLzEwNDc5ODcvMS96YWstYnJvd24tb3Blbi1nZXR0aW5nLXNlY29uZC10YXR0b28tY2VsZWJyYXRlLWxhbmRvLW5vcnJpcy1tYWlkZW4tZjEtd2lu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zak Brown open to getting second tattoo to celebrate Lando Norris' maiden F1 win,"McLaren CEO Zak Brown says he would be open to getting another tattoo to commemorate Lando Norris’ maiden F1 victory.

Norris claimed his first career F1 victory winning the Miami Grand Prix ahead of Max Verstappen.

The McLaren driver inherited the lead through the Safety Car caused by Logan Sargeant.

However Norris' win was no fluke as he gapped Verstappen by over seven seconds.

It ends a run of near misses for Norris most notably back at the 2021 Russian Grand Prix.

It’s now McLaren’s second victory under Brown’s leadership with the first at Monza in 2021 with Daniel Ricciardo.

To celebrate Ricciardo’s win Brown was forced by the Aussie to get a tattoo ultimately getting the Monza circuit inked to his arm.

Brown could be set for another trip to the tattoo parlour following Norris’ win in Miami.

Speaking after the race Brown said: ""[My nerves were] not so good they’re still not good.

""But what a drive. The car was great. I’ve got to thank everyone back at McLaren and here. All the hard work is paying off.

On getting a tattoo he added: “Yeah I don’t mind Miami. It’s kind of my home country so why not?”

Norris had to wait a long time for his first win taking the chequered flag on his 110th start.

Brown felt it was “long overdue” while paying tribute to Gil de Ferran and Mansour Ojjeh.

“This is long overdue” he added. “I think this is a very popular win amongst the fans and the drivers.

“The drivers went up to him and congratulated him. He drove perfectly. The car was really fast. I think Gil de Ferran and Mansour had something to do with today.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZm9yd2FyZC5jb20vbmV3cy82MDk1MjYvYnJvd24tdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1hbnRpc2VtaXRpc20tcHJvdGVzdHMtZW5jYW1wbWVudC_SAVhodHRwczovL2ZvcndhcmQuY29tL25ld3MvNjA5NTI2L2Jyb3duLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktYW50aXNlbWl0aXNtLXByb3Rlc3RzLWVuY2FtcG1lbnQvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Everyone gets to be uncomfortable’: How Jewish students at Brown kept antisemitism at bay,"By Mira Fox May 3 2024

At universities and colleges across the country police are sweeping through encampments supporting Gaza trying to clear protesters from the grounds. But at Brown University’s encampment on the campus’s main green in the middle of Providence Rhode Island the biggest drama last Shabbat was that the candles would not stay lit.

This was more or less the calm atmosphere of Brown’s encampment for the six days it stood; it was not plagued by the antisemitism violence or arrests that have dominated headlines about schools including Columbia and the University of California Los Angeles. There were no clashes with counterprotesters and no police presence. The encampment’s daily schedule included tai chi and a talent show alongside teach-ins and rallies. People tossed frisbees next to the tents.

On Tuesday the protesting students at Brown reached an agreement with the university’s administration and voluntarily dismantled their encampment.

Life on the Ivy League campus wasn’t always so calm. In the wake of Oct. 7 61 students were arrested at various sit-ins. Some student groups celebrated Hamas’ massacre. People took pictures of Israeli students on campus and posted on anonymous social media with captions disparaging them as Zionists.

Fractures deepened after a Palestinian Brown undergraduate Hisham Awartani was shot in Burlington Vermont along with two other Palestinian friends; they were all wearing kaffiyehs. Brown-RISD Hillel put out a statement mourning the shooting but also castigating “a torrent of antisemitic hatred” online saying that Hillel’s “support for Israel and Zionist students is unassailable.”

Some Jewish and Israeli students who had previously been involved with Hillel broke ties calling the email “tone-deaf” and “a disgusting response to a hate crime.” At a vigil for Awartani a speaker said his blood was on the hands of Zionist students.

But around May’s encampment that vitriol seemed to have dissipated. Chants were focused on the activists’ demands — divestment not from Israel as a whole but from companies involved in the oppression of Palestinians — and not on broader statements about Zionism or Israel’s existence. Some of Brown’s most vocal Zionist students members of opposing campus group Brown Students for Israel said that they felt safe.

Students told me that the encampment chose not to chant “from the river to the sea” — common at most protests — because one student who was part of the tent group said it made them feel uncomfortable. (The chant did occur once on the encampment’s final day.)

What enabled this shift? And who planted the seeds for compromise on Brown’s central lawn?

I asked this question of many at Brown students faculty and rabbis and their answers all pointed to a willingness to cross ideological divides. Where protesters at other campuses adopted “do not engage” policies at Brown they kept talking.

“On the periphery of the encampment there were a number of students in conversation with one another some of which I think people might have imagined were unlikely pairs to be having conversations across political differences” said Jason Klein the rabbi for Jewish life in the chaplain’s office. “That’s something I think that Brown students can often do well.”

This isn’t of course to say that everyone approved of the encampment or agreed with its demands. Some students and staff at the Brown-RISD Hillel harshly criticize the campus environment. And many activists call for more extreme measures and more rigid stances — most students I spoke with mentioned more radical factions on campus that don’t fret over upsetting their peers.

But they no longer dominate at Brown.

The encampment maintained a middle ground of sorts in part due to a monthslong committed dialogue organized and run by students to talk through the toughest issues and feelings and try to understand each other.

And many students said that the relative calm and success of the protest was thanks in large part to the deep engagement of Jewish students in the campus’s activist movements.

Jews at the center

The first sit-in for divestment at Brown in November last year was composed entirely of Jewish students. In their first statement in the student newspaper The Brown Daily Herald the group mourned the murders on Oct. 7 and affirmed its “connection to the amorphous spiritual entity” of Israel but declared itself anti-Zionist.

Soon after they named themselves BrownU Jews for Ceasefire Now; many of its members were part of Brown’s encampment. JFCN as most on campus call it has organized protests or actions but also created an independent study course for those grappling with Judaism Jewish identity and Israel; organized dinners for Jews who clash over Israel; and invited other students to come and ask questions of its members promising to cast no judgment. It has also hosted weekly Shabbat services — including the one at the encampment — as well as holiday celebrations.

Maddie a senior with JFCN who spoke on condition that only her first name be used so as not to compromise her employment prospects in the Jewish professional world said the group hosts large Shabbat dinners and has created an “alternative ritual space” for Jews “who don’t want to feel like they’re praying to a flag.”

About 24% of Brown’s student body is Jewish and most of them according to Rabbi Joshua Bolton the head of the Brown-RISD Hillel “exist in a broad center and in fact they don’t necessarily feel represented by activists on either side of this issue.”

Nevertheless Jewish students comprise a significant portion — it’s not clear exactly how large — of pro-Palestinian activists on campus. Their deep engagement and leadership seems to have helped insulate the movement from becoming as divisive as on other campuses.

When an outside group from Providence came to the encampment and handed out flyers urging a global intifada over the weekend students pushed back saying that was not part of their messaging. They kept their chants focused on divestment and criticism of Brown’s leadership.

“The heavy Jewish presence in these pro-Palestine circles ensures that there will never be the extreme blatant antisemitism” said Ma’ayan Stutman-Shaw a first-year student who is not involved with the protests. “And it’s Jews who are really engaged with the Jewish community not Jews who picked up Judaism on Oct. 10 because they wanted to fight for Palestine — Jews who have been thinking about this constantly they are the ones who are leading this movement on campus.”

Of course much of the pro-Palestinian organizing has been led by non-Jewish students as well.

But much of the pushback to pro-Palestinian protests — concerns about antisemitism and what they see as calls to dismantle Israel — have come from Jewish students who are concerned about antisemitism or who have ties to Israel. And that’s where the leadership of Jewish student activists has come in.

“Jewish students are going to have a better understanding of what will trigger other Jewish students” said Asher Radziner a senior who has been leading conversations on campus.

A safety blanket

Many Jewish students I spoke to said the university encouraged conversations among students over Israel and the war but never convened any that students found inviting.

“It hasn’t really provided those spaces” said Eiden Spilker a senior involved with JFCN. “There just haven’t been contexts to engage in good faith.”

So instead students built their own.

Outside the encampment while it stood JFCN students — none of whom were camping on the green — had set up a dialogue space: a blanket and a painted canvas that said “Questions? Comments? Concerns? Come talk.”

Every day that the encampment stood at least two students sat there waiting for people to approach them. The group also facilitated conversations during a student hunger strike in February when 17 students fasted for eight days to protest the refusal of the Corporation of Brown University which governs the investment of Brown’s endowment to hear a proposal for divestment.

JFCN members said they are looking especially to engage with Jewish and Zionist students. Spilker whose father is a rabbi and whose mother is a cantor said JFCN understands where they’re coming from.

“We’ve been there and we’re in a position where we can empathize with that” he said. “It’s less about trying to convince people and more about hearing them and having dialogue and creating a space that ideally Hillel would’ve created but because of their ideology and current leadership have not been able to make.”

(“We are a home for every Jewish student” said Bolton the director of the campus Hillel when told of the criticism from some Jewish students. “That doesn’t mean that we’re a home for every type of program.”)

On blanket duty one recent morning Spilker greeted a student who introduced himself as Kareem not giving his last name and had questions. He asked about the use of the term genocide and the impact of divestment. Spilker thought before he spoke and then drew on theories he learned in classes he’d taken.

“I think it is a question of at which stage do you call it a genocide — is it just at the final stage of mass extermination?” he said.

“That’s a good point” Kareem responded. “I hadn’t heard that before that it’s a process.”

Spilker said he’s had all kinds of people come up to him at the blanket: students from the campus pro-Israel group students from settlements in the West Bank alumni faculty a local imam worried parents of prospective students who had just taken the campus tours that walked by the encampment multiple times a day.

“That was the main goal in setting this up. Like: We’re here to talk to you we’re not a threat to you” he said. “There are people who understand what we’re doing here or may not fully agree but appreciate what’s happening and appreciate that we’re opening up this space.”

Caught in the middle

One of those appreciative students is Stutman-Shaw. She doesn’t feel comfortable being part of the group but said she still agrees with much of what JFCN is doing on campus particularly its work to keep students talking to one another. Those efforts have “made me really proud to go to this school” she said.

At the same time the Jewish involvement in the protest movement has put Stutman-Shaw into a difficult position. JFCN hosts a Shabbat service each week with two options for prayer: a Reform service and a traditional-egalitarian one that uses traditional liturgy but doesn’t divide servicegoers by gender. It’s so popular that it can make it hard for Hillel to field a minyan for its own version of that service several students told me.

But JFCN’s homemade siddur doesn’t sit right with Stutman-Shaw. It has a disclaimer explaining that the word “Yisrael” in prayers doesn’t refer to the country of Israel but to the Jewish people and to the biblical parable in which Jacob wrestles with God. For Stutman-Shaw that’s not how she views her spirituality; when she prays to Yisrael she said she does think of the country and the time she’s spent there.

That means she often finds herself without her preferred mode of prayer; instead she usually attends the Orthodox minyan at Hillel.

“JFCN right now is the best egalitarian service that you can find on campus” she said citing the passion of the students involved. “Part of me feels really happy for that and part of me like that really breaks my heart because I feel like I can’t really be there fully in who I am.”

Stutman-Shaw is attempting to resuscitate the Brown chapter of J Street U which describes itself as “the political home for pro-Israel pro-peace pro-democracy Americans.” The chapter dissolved in the wake of Oct. 7 because the national organization had failed to call for a ceasefire. She hopes it will be a place where student can both condemn Israel’s actions in Gaza and support the existence of the state.

Still while she endeavors to build her own Jewish space on campus Stutman-Shaw said JFCN has been integral to the success of Brown’s pro-Palestinian movement.

“A lot of Israeli students were leading the protests a lot of Jewish students with connection to Israel” she said. “So they were really trying to emphasize the importance of diverse ideological dialogue.”

Dinners across disagreement

Stutman-Shaw has been attending an event called Dinners in Progress created by two other students who hold differing views on the conflict in the Middle East that seeks to bring groups of the not-likeminded students together to talk about Israel Gaza and the atmosphere on campus.

“For the first time since Oct. 7 I see the SJP president who happens to be Jewish and someone who is from the Gush talking about Israel” Stutman-Shaw said referring to the school’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine and a group of settlements in the West Bank. “And that’s so exciting.”

Radziner who is one of the co-founders said the dinners arose from the idea that “it would be great to have a dialogue space that wasn’t controlled by the university that wasn’t run by faculty or adults but run by students for students — not run by an organization like Hillel or even JFCN.”

The office of student life at Brown put him in touch with another student Zoey Fisher and gave them funding to buy dinner which is always a draw for college students.

In the three dinners so far a cohort of 14 Jewish students discussed their personal connections to Israel were able to express frustration with each other and dug deeply into their disagreements.

“It’s very easy for people who feel very strongly about something and want to act on it to get together and take action” Radziner said. “But often that comes at the expense of continued dialogue with people who disagree with you.”

The dinners he said “keep it going.”

‘I’ve had too many bad experiences’

Not everyone feels that the conversation has been quite so welcoming. Rabbi Joshua Bolton the director of the Brown-RISD Hillel critiqued what he saw as students holing up in “ideological fortresses.”

“Wisdom is revealed in places where we know very little where there’s vulnerability” Bolton said. “And so it would strike me that the opportunity before students at Brown is not to build an encampment that keeps everyone of a differing opinion out but really embrace the idea of let us go camping together in the wilderness.”

He blames the Brown faculty in part for building ideological fortresses and setting a bad example for students.

In many ways Hillel has been the target of the worst of the ire from protests. Bolton and the assistant director of the Hillel Molly Goldmeier received death threats several months ago.

“It’s just very hard for me to imagine what I’ve endured” he said “and there not being a major campus revolt on account of it.” he said. The campus he posits would be outraged had the head of the Brown Center for Students of Color received such threats.

“I think that kind of reflects where students are at right now” he added.

Teddy Horowitz a senior said he too feels unwelcome on campus because of his Zionism; he said he’d lost numerous friendships because of his love for Israel and his membership in the campus pro-Israel group Brown Students for Israel.

Horowitz largely agrees with the activists’ demands for a ceasefire and an end to Israel’s occupation but is deeply concerned about antisemitism within the movement. He said the Brown SJP chapter had expressed admiration for Hamas and that he’s seen antisemitism rise on campus social media. He also saw no place to mourn Israelis murdered in the Oct. 7 attack because of the dominance of pro-Palestinian activism on campus.

Many of his activist classmates fall into two groups he said. “There are the Jews and students who think Oct. 7 was a victory and there’s the activists who are willing to put up with that” he said. “And I don’t want to deal with either group anymore; I’ve had too many bad experiences.”

Horowitz turned to the campus Hillel and Chabad where he found community with like-minded friends. But he remains discouraged by what he sees as echo chambers on campus.

To combat this he founded a new publication the Brown Jewish Journal. “When the Jewish Journal started one of the editors was an anti-Zionist and I was really suspicious of him at first” Horowitz recounted. But as they began to read and edit each other’s work that changed. “Now I really look forward to talking about Israel-Palestine with him” he said.

Horowitz who spoke to me in the days before protesters and the university struck an agreement to dismantle the encampment said the climate on campus had improved since the weeks after Oct. 7.

“I’m really pleasantly surprised with how well this protest is going” he said of the encampment. “Recently I’ve come to the conclusion that these people might be pretty chill.”

But he still feels “betrayed” by the campus community. “I love the outpouring of empathy for Palestinians — they need it!” he said. “I just wish some of the empathy was directed our way as well.”

A campus less divided than it looks

Every student I spoke to said they think even the groups at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum on Israel actually well mostly agree.

“You’ll find a lot more in common with BSI members and JFCN members than either of them would ever admit” said Stutman-Shaw.

But they did admit it. When I spoke with them both BSI and JFCN members made the same point — that most of them agree on a lot of points including criticism of the Israeli government horror at the deaths of civilians in Gaza and a desire for a ceasefire.

Talking with students from across the campus’s Jewish community the divides largely came down to details — students who want a ceasefire but are uncomfortable with using terms such as “genocide” or “anti-Zionist.” Or students who are reluctant to try to find common ground or engage with students who reacted to Oct. 7 in a way that upset them.

But many of them on all sides are trying to push through their discomfort to understand each other even when it’s difficult.

“Movements are imperfect” Radziner said. “Once you understand that you’re all working towards the same goal with different ways of getting there it lets you start to not overlook but push through the parts that you disagree with or find challenging.”

That’s what Klein the rabbi in the chaplain’s office hopes will define Brown’s protest movement.

“I was really proud that these students were still really in it and trying to make it imperfect for everyone” he said. “Everyone gets to be uncomfortable everyone gets to learn.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA1L3Nwb3J0cy9qYXlsZW4tYnJvd24tZnJlZS10aHJvd3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2024 NBA playoffs: Jaylen Brown's free throw shooting could be an issue for Celtics,"In the first round against the Heat he struggled mightily at the line going just 9 for 20 (45 percent). The Celtics seem aware of the potential pothole. After Saturday’s practice the team pumped in artificial sounds of booing fans while Brown attempted free throws raising the volume just before his release. While Brown stood at the line an assistant coach stood under the basket waving large foam pads. We’ll see if the extra work makes a difference.

▪ Aside from center Kristaps Porzingis’s calf injury that will likely sideline him against Cleveland the Celtics do not have many concerns during these playoffs. But Jaylen Brown’s free throw shooting probably deserves to be on the list. The forward made 70.3 percent of his attempts during the regular season his lowest mark since 2018-19. He connected on 65 percent of his fourth-quarter tries overall and 63.9 percent on the road.

▪ There was a narrative that it would be good for the Celtics if the Cavaliers/Magic first-round series extended to seven games because it would give Porzingis more time to recover. But this result made no difference. Game 3 of the semifinals was going to be played Saturday regardless and Porzingis will not be back by then. Perhaps the extra two days of rest will be more helpful for someone like 37-year-old forward Al Horford however.

▪ Last month we published a story about how the Celtics identified and pursued Sam Hauser as an undrafted free agent target in 2021. That process was important but Boston’s executives stressed that Hauser’s development has been more important than their discovery.

They said his stint with the team’s G League affiliate in Maine as a rookie was particularly essential. Coaches there helped Hauser become more comfortable keeping the ball above his shoulders before firing away quickly a style perfected by Warriors star Klay Thompson. Hauser also became more adept at shooting on the move and after peeling off screens.

“He’d shown us enough over the first half of his G League season that we weren’t sitting there going ‘Oh if we throw him in we hope we does OK’ ” Celtics assistant general manager Dave Lewin said. “We knew he was a player. Anyone who watched the G League closely knew Sam could contribute.”

Hauser made 197 3-pointers for the Celtics this season.

▪ Boston’s semifinal matchup against the Cavaliers is not all that spicy but it should be more competitive than their first-round win over the extremely undermanned Heat. Porzingis’s injury levels the playing field a bit but Cleveland center Jarrett Allen has missed the last three games because of a rib injury and his status for Game 1 on Tuesday is unclear.

Allen averaged 16.5 points and 10.5 rebounds per game this season and is an excellent rim protector. With the absence of Porzingis a long-range threat Allen would be able to patrol the paint more freely.

The Celtics went 2-1 against Cleveland during the regular season with the home team winning all three games and each decided by single digits. Also the Cavaliers had a similar core last season when they went 3-1 against Boston. This will be the first playoff matchup between these teams since the 2018 conference finals when Jayson Tatum was a rookie and LeBron James still played for Cleveland.

▪ Potentially awkward timing: Tom Brady’s Patriots Hall of Fame induction ceremony will be held on June 12 from 7-9:30 p.m. That is the same night as Game 3 of the NBA Finals.

▪ Tales from South Beach: It was a beautiful morning in Miami before Game 4 of the Celtics’ first-round series against the Heat last Monday so I took a walk on a paved path near the waterfront. I reached the end and made a right turn toward Biscayne Bay when I noticed some people pointing their cellphone cameras up at a leafy tree.

There dancing from branch to branch and munching on something the tree had grown was a small monkey. I’ve been to Miami countless times thanks to the Celtics’ tendency to face the Heat in the playoffs so often and I had never seen a monkey in a tree there. I felt somewhat uneducated about the area’s wildlife and I wondered if children nearby were getting a bit too close to this seemingly wild animal.

Then I looked over and saw a man on a bike directly beneath the tree holding food in the air. He seemed surprisingly comfortable. Then I noticed the monkey was wearing a diaper. Yes it was the man’s pet. He had taken his monkey out for a walk and a tree climb. None of this is legal in Massachusetts but in Florida all it takes is a permit.

Here’s how some schools avoided that,"New York CNN —

After several days of protests pro-Palestinian encampments on the campuses of Ivy League schools Columbia and Brown came down last week.

But while the apparent end of Columbia’s pro-Palestinian encampments was marred by a takeover of a building a mass arrest and a widespread condemnation of the heavy police presence encampments came down voluntarily at Brown and other institutions like Northwestern University.

And other public universities like Rutgers University and the University of Minnesota also peacefully reached agreements with protesters.

Notably none of the schools agreed to fully divest from companies doing business in Israel a demand student protesters have commonly rallied for across the country. While there were people on both sides who criticized the agreements at Brown and Northwestern the deals nevertheless diffused a tense standoff that has boiled over at other colleges and universities across the country.

A delicate balance

College officials face a delicate balance between encouraging dialogue and allowing free expression while keeping their campus safe and running free speech experts told CNN. Some schools achieved it at least temporarily and prevented a situation in which a police presence to break up encampments led to violence and fear.

The schools where an administration “was willing to lay a little lower and treat the speech going on in their public spaces as not a catastrophe but something that might be dealt with through dialogue have done better” said Sophia Rosenfeld a professor of history who teaches a class on free speech at the University of Pennsylvania.

Rosenfeld said Brown provided a conversation — not a concession — and that was enough to dissipate the encampments.

Lena Shapiro director of the First Amendment clinic at the University of Illinois College of Law said when it comes to demonstrations colleges must take preventive measures to make sure everyone has a space to demonstrate.

“First and foremost the safety of all students is paramount” she said. Shapiro added schools can place reasonable restrictions on the time place and manner of the protests to keep order but at the same time should keep open channels of communication with protesters to try to find common ground.

Some school leaders set the tone early on. For example Northwestern President Michael Schill put out a statement expressing his horror at the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7. In the same letter Schill who is Jewish made sure to distinguish between himself and his public role as a president. He also reaffirmed his commitment to the Chicago Principles which are a set of commitments to free speech many colleges have adopted.

“Just to be clear as individuals in a democracy we do not give up our rights to have and express our personal political and social viewpoints. We just need to make clear we are speaking for ourselves” Schill wrote.

What the schools agreed to do

On Monday Northwestern announced an agreement with protesters to end the encampment. The school agreed to more transparency over specific investment holdings and fully funding the cost of attendance for five Palestinian students.

Northwestern also allowed protesters on Deering Meadow a stretch of lawn on campus through the end of the quarter if there was only one tent.

Rutgers agreed to meet with student protesters to discuss divestment and to support scholarships for at least 10 displaced Gazan students. Rutgers along with Northwestern agreed to expand spaces for Arab and Muslim students on campus. Rutgers also said it would “revisit and follow up” its existing relationship with Birzeit University in the West Bank and consider a student exchange or study abroad program.

The University of Minnesota said it would allow protesters to present a case for divestment to its board. It also said it would “explore” an affiliation with a Palestinian university and it would make a “good faith effort” to disclose as much information about its holdings as possible as well as not pursue disciplinary action against protesters affiliated with the school.

Brown’s board agreed to hold a vote on divestment in the fall. Brown also said no student or faculty member involved in the protests would face retaliation though they emphasized they would investigate reports of bias harassment or discrimination. Rutgers made a similar commitment.

Inside Brown University

Brown which is located in Providence Rhode Island has not had a police-free campus in six months. Twenty students were arrested in November and 41 in December for trespassing during sit-ins at University Hall that demanded divestment from companies doing business with Israel according to the university’s student newspaper.

Calls for divestment have been ongoing for at least the past decade said Owen Dahlkamp an editor at the Brown Daily Herald.

Dahlkamp said students were uncomfortable with the police presence on campus and many were outraged at the arrests. Student activists are still advocating for charges to be dropped against those arrested in December. Brown dropped the charges against the 20 arrested in November.

But Brown took a different approach as encampments began popping up around the country. On the main lawn which serves as more of a public space than the inside of a hall the university reiterated that though the camps weren’t a legal violation they could violate student conduct policy.

“Brown has always prided itself on resolving differences through dialog debate and listening to each other. I cannot condone the encampment which was in violation of University policies” Brown President Christina Paxson said Tuesday in a statement announcing an agreement for five students to meet with five members of the Corporation of Brown University in May to present their divestment arguments.

Though some on social media argued Brown agreed to simply push off a divestment decision Dahlkamp said students he spoke to are satisfied with the agreement.

“It feels like a compromise but not a compromise which they feel negatively about” Dahlkamp said. “There are some students who in passing say they believe Brown was able to diffuse the situation but didn’t have to cede much. It will be interesting to see if (divestment) will pass.”

Dahlkamp called CNN from the main lawn where the encampment once stood. He described students lounging around studying and reading as the academic year ends.

Watching the images come out of Columbia as well as the University of California Los Angeles and the University of Texas at Austin Dahlkamp said the resolution is an important step.

“This is not the ultimate victory but still a victory” he said.

A road map for the future

The agreements are not a guarantee for a smooth road ahead. For example the Midwestern branch of the Anti-Defamation League called for Northwestern President Michael Schill to resign writing he “capitulated to hatred and bigotry.” Rep. Elise Stefanik a Republican from New York who has spearheaded congressional hearings on antisemitism called Northwestern students who demonstrated “self proclaimed terrorists” in a posting on X formerly known as Twitter.

Those critical of Northwestern on social media said the students who made the agreement did not advocate for strong enough commitments for divestment from the school.

But with rapidly moving events it can be difficult for schools to keep up said Lena Shapiro of the University of Illinois College of Law.

For example President Michael S. Roth at Wesleyan University said Tuesday the encampments could continue as long as the protest remained nonviolent and didn’t disrupt campus operations.

“There will be many on campus who cheer on the protesters and many who are offended or even frightened by their rallies and messages. But as long as we all reject violence we have opportunities to listen and to learn from one another” Roth said Tuesday in a statement.

But in a letter on Thursday he said the university would not tolerate the acts of vandalism that had taken place and would hold those responsible for the damage accountable. He reiterated the protesters are “bringing attention to the killing of innocent people.”

“We do not want to move in this direction unless necessary and much prefer to talk with protesters about things we can do as an institution to address the war in Gaza. Recent agreements at Brown University and Northwestern University might show the way” Roth wrote."

Chinese chip designer Espressif has developed a dual core XTensa wireless system on chip for AI in the Internet of Things (AIoT).

The ESP32-S3 uses two 240MHz extended XTensa LX7 cores from Cadence Design Systems with 2.4GHz WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0 connectivity. It has 44 programmable GPIOs and supports larger high-speed octal SPI flash than the previous ESP32 devices and PSRAM with configurable data and instruction cache .

The ESP32-S3 AIO chip supports a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n) with 40 MHz of bandwidth support while the BLE subsystem supports long range through Coded PHY and advertisement extension. It also supports higher transmission speed and data throughput with a 2Mbit/s PHY.

The XTensa LX7 cores have been extended with vector instructions for acceleration for neural network computing and signal processing workloads. Espressif is currently working on the software libraries for AI functions as part of the updated ESP-WHO and ESP-Skainet development tools.

ESP32-S3 has 44 programmable GPIOs ten more than the ESP32 and supports all the commonly-used peripherals such as SPI I2S I2C PWM RMT ADC DAC and UART SD/MMC host and Espressif’s Two-Wire Automotive Interface (TWAI). In total 14 GPIOs can be configured as capacitive touch input for HMI applications. Apart from all these peripherals however ESP32-S3 is also equipped with an ultra-low-power (ULP) core that supports multiple low-power modes in a variety of such use-cases.

The AIoT chip supports AES-XTS-based flash encryption and RSA-based secure boot with a digital signature peripheral and an HMAC module which provide functionality that is similar to the hardware secure element protecting the private or symmetric key from software attacks and identity theft. ESP32-S3 also has a “World Controller” peripheral that provides two fully-isolated execution environments which enable the implementation of a trusted-execution environment or a privilege-separation scheme.

With processor cores with vector extensions the development environment is key and Espressif’s ESP-IDF platform that already powers millions of devices on the market. This allows developers to easily build new applications or migrate their own applications to the ESP32-S3 AIoT platform and continue working with the ESP-IDF tools and APIs.

By Tanishaa Nadkar

(Reuters) - Ladbrokes owner Entain said on Monday an $11 billion takeover approach from U.S. casino operator MGM Resorts significantly undervalued its business as companies move to capitalise on an expected boom in U.S. sports betting.

The United States is widely viewed as the next big growth market following a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that lifted a ban on sports betting. U.S. companies have sought partnerships to tap European expertise including Caesars Entertainment's 2.9 billion pound deal for Britain's William Hill in September.

Online betting has also enjoyed a further boost as COVID-19 restrictions encouraged locked-down customers to play more from home when casinos and betting shops were off limits.

A deal would make a global gaming company with presence in both online and retail channels and end-to-end technology stack MGM said adding it aimed to engage with Entain.

MGM and Britain's Entain formerly known as GVC have had a joint venture since 2018 when they set up an online betting platform in the United States.

MGM's proposed offer of 1383 pence per Entain share implies a deal value of 8.09 billion pounds ($11.08 billion) according to Reuters calculations representing a 22% premium to Entain's last close.

Entain shares jumped as much as 28% to an all-time high of 1455 pence leading gainers on the UK blue-chip index.

A deal would raise questions over the future of Entain's UK high street betting shops after Caesars said it could sell off William Hill's non-U.S. operations.

However an Entain spokesman told Reuters there was no detail on that yet.

""Entain is a far more global and more integrated operation – operating online gaming sites around the world as well as a high street estate. That makes folding the non-US operations into MGM or spinning them off separately a far greater challenge"" Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett said.

U.S. PROSPECTS

DraftKings whose backers include basketball great Michael Jordan and Flutter Entertainment's FanDuel are among the other businesses fighting for supremacy in the growing U.S. gambling market.

Entain said it received multiple proposals from MGM with the latest one being MGM's offer of 0.6 of its shares for each Entain share. Under the proposal Entain shareholders will own about 41.5% of the enlarged MGM.

MGM's proposal is backed by billionaire mogul Barry Diller's IAC group according to the Wall Street Journal which first reported the proposal on Sunday. It follows an earlier all-cash proposal worth about $10 billion that was also rejected it said.

Davy Research analysts also said the proposal undervalued Entain's operations including its prospects in the United States adding that MGM's flexibility and ability to improve its offer will be key.

Entain has itself expanded rapidly through a series of acquisitions and owns the bwin Coral and Eurobet brands. It has asked MGM for more information on the strategic rationale for a combination.

""It would be no surprise if the predator were to put a bigger wad down on the table"" AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.

Las Vegas-based MGM has indicated that a limited partial cash alternative would also be made available to Entain shareholders Entain said.

Posted on: January 3 2021 04:06h.

Last updated on: January 3 2021 05:12h.

MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) is reportedly looking to acquire Entain Plc (OTC:GMHY) the UK-based company formerly known as GVC Holdings that’s the casino operator’s partner in the BetMGM online gaming and sports wagering business.

The Wall Street Journal reported the rumor earlier today citing unidentified sources and claiming the Bellagio operator recently made a $10 billion offer for the UK-based company that was rejected. It’s not immediately clear what MGM’s new offer for the prospective target is but it is believed the proposal comes with financial support from Barry Diller’s IAC/InterActiveCorp (NASDAQ:IAC).

In August IAC revealed a $1 billion stake in the Las Vegas-based company equivalent to 12 percent of shares outstanding. Entain has a market capitalization of $9 billion. It’s believed MGM’s latest offer is a mixture of cash and equity and above the $17.56 a share that was pitched last year. Entain’s US-listed shares closed at $15.70 last Friday.

Following the recent sale of $700 million worth of units in gaming real estate investment trust (REIT) MGM Growth Properties (NYSE:MGP) the second such move made by MGM last year the Mandalay Bay operator has $5.9 billion in liquidity.

Precedent Set

Under the current terms of the BetMGM arrangement the casino operator and Entain split the economics. But with the US iGaming and sports wagering industries taking off brick-and-mortar gaming companies are looking for higher margin less cost-intensive businesses and can potentially find willing sellers among partners.

That door was opened in a big way last year when Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) said it’s acquiring its online casinos/sports betting partner William Hill (OTC:WIMHY) for $3.69 billion in cash in a transaction that’s expected to close in the first quarter.

MGM may have taken a cue from that deal because Wall Street is voicing preference for companies that have full control of their internet gaming and sports wagering operations over those that are constructed as partnerships as is the case with BetMGM.

Ladbrokes owner GVC and the casino company formed BetMGM in 2018 allocating $200 million to get the business going. The partners boosted that total to $450 million last July.

Good Time for a Deal

Entain shares jumped 25 percent last year and if that rally continues MGM or any other prospective buyer would be forced to pay up for the British company.

For now it’s not immediately clear if Entain will accept any takeover proposal or what MGM’s plans would be for the seller’s European retail business assuming an offer is accepted. Caesars will almost certainly shed William Hill’s international operations when that transaction is completed.

For MGM it makes sense to acquire Entain because in the BetMGM agreement the latter provides technology services. But the unit derives benefit from the gaming company’s well-known brand and land-based operations in select states positioning it capture iGaming licenses in those locations.

BetMGM is the fifth-largest online sports betting provider in the US and is operational in 10 states a figure that’s forecast to double over the course of 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbGFzdmVnYXNzdW4uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9qYW4vMDMveC1idXJsZXNxdWUtZmVtYWxlLXJldnVlcy1yZW9wZW5pbmctbGFzLXZlZ2FzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Relaunch of 'X Burlesque' demonstrates the durability of Vegas female revues,"Relaunch of ‘X Burlesque’ demonstrates the durability of Vegas female revues

Edison Graff

Sexy showgirls topless revues and tantalizing burlesque-style shows have always been a prominent part of the Las Vegas entertainment landscape and certainly an even bigger piece of the city’s iconography and “Sin City” reputation. And during the COVID era when Vegas shows have struggled to survive and faced greater challenges than ever before this genre has proven to be among the most enduring and resilient.

“I guess the bottom line is sexy revues and showgirls are a staple in Las Vegas. They have been since the 1950s and when people come to Las Vegas that’s one experience they usually want to have” says Angela Stabile. “That’s one of the things you need to do here that you can’t do anywhere else.”

Stabile performed as a dancer and showgirl in “Lido de Paris” “Crazy Girls” and other shows before becoming the producer of some of the most popular revues on the Strip. Stabile Productions reopened “X Country” at Harrah’s Las Vegas on October 22 — the first Strip casino production show to return after the March shutdown — and it has continued performances despite tighter restrictions installed in November limiting audiences to just 50 people.

This week Stabile Productions has found a way to bring back its original revue “X Burlesque” which has performed more than 9000 shows since opening at the Aladdin in 2002.

The “private edition” of “X Burlesque” opens Thursday with performances planned for 7 and 10 p.m. Thursday Friday and Saturday nights at the Flamingo. Two tickets are priced at $199 including taxes and fees and guests will also receive a bottle of Champagne and a signed poster and the renovated show will include a first-ever question-and-answer session with the cast. Guests must be 21 years or older and ticket info can be found at caesars.com.

The show returns to the same venue the X Burlesque Theatre at Bugsy’s Cabaret at the Flamingo despite the normally 160-seat theater’s intimate space. The room is only about 35 feet deep and the audience will be capped at 30 people.

“Because of the 25-foot distance rule (between the stage and the audience) we’re putting the seating along the back rim of the room and adding another couple of tables to get it up to 30” says Matt Stabile Angela’s husband and producing partner. “That’s why we’re also making the show more of a private experience.

“We’ve sold tickets in the past called the pink circle a higher-priced ticket maybe 20 a night and the seats are very close to the pole in the middle and the dancers would walk by and sometimes touch them. We’ve always sold those well so we decided to go with that formula a higher price with a bottle of Champagne and then we’re doing something unique with the Q&A.”

Longtime “X Burlesque” comedian Nancy Ryan will be guiding the Q&A session at the end of the show. The Stabiles continue to discuss opportunities to bring back the other “X” show “X Rocks” at Bally’s with their partners at Caesars Entertainment but right now the focus is on continued 50-ticket sellouts for “X Country” and relaunching the special version of “X Burlesque.”

Another staple Strip revue “Fantasy” returned to Luxor on November 6 in a different theater but MGM Resorts re-shuttered most of its live entertainment around Thanksgiving when the 50-person rule fell into place.

One of that show’s swing performers singer Anne Martinez says the adjustment from its Atrium Showroom to the much larger theater on the Luxor casino floor provided some interesting obstacles but the “Fantasy” team had cleared them and was enjoying success.

“That stage is deep and wide just a really big stage and the show is very intelligently choreographed and we had to readjust all of that” she says. “But [dance captain] Yesi [Burgess] and [associate producer] Mariah [Rivera] were fabulous. It was wild but really fun and once we got onstage everyone worked together so well.

“As a performer your number one job is to tell a story. When you’re performing in a more intimate space you dial it in a little bit” Martinez continues. “But when the space is a little bigger you have to be bigger so they can see us and hear us and the performance really sticks with you. And everyone was up for that challenge. If you believe in yourself and what you’re doing the audience will come with you. They just can’t resist it.”

The intimacy of this style of show is obviously one of its biggest draws and performers have been able to create that feeling in a different way despite singing and dancing while wearing masks and being unable to come in close contact with their audience members.

Martinez also has been performing in a renovated version of the Westgate’s resident revue “Sexxy” which has been presenting a different style of show at Larry Flynt’s Hustler Club just south of the Strip. Producer choreographer and star Jennifer Romas — who also engineered a drive-in version of the show during the summer months of 2020 — launched the “Sexxy After Dark” shows at the gentlemen’s club in early December and continued the limited engagement through New Year’s Eve weekend.

“I didn’t really know what to expect because I don’t know that world at all but I’ve been so impressed with how nice everyone is at the club” Martinez says. “We didn’t have a lot of time to get it together and the stage is very [different]. It was a little like playing pinball at first getting around it. But that’s the genius of Jen. She just went in and never complained and said ‘This is what we’ll do’ and that’s why it looks good and it works.”

With the 50-person rule solidly in place until mid-January and no sign of loosening restrictions there are no plans to reinstate “Sexxy” at the Westgate soon which could lead to more shows at the club.

At least one brand-new burlesque show has popped up during the pandemic. “BurlesQ” made its debut on December 18 in the Athena Showroom at the Alexis Park Resort just off the Strip a Roaring ’20s-themed variety show hosted by former “Fantasy” comedian Sean E. Cooper and featuring six showgirls and guest ventriloquist April Brucker.

“While a sexy show [“BurlesQ”] isn’t topless and isn’t all girls dancing around for 70 minutes. It’s a true variety show” says Pete Housley executive producer and CEO of Admit VIP Entertainment which manages a variety of shows at Alexis Park and other resorts. “The issue that most shows face is dealing with the enormity of the 25-foot socially distanced moat between guests and the performance area and it’s one of the reasons we built ‘BurlesQ’ to use the classic showgirl costumes that were a staple of Las Vegas for decades because the costumes themselves are larger than life.”

Both “BurlesQ” and Admit VIP’s “Motown Extreme” shows are sold out through Saturday’s performances Housley says noting that the “BurlesQ” artists have focused on maintaining high levels of energy onstage in order to make guests feel comfortable and enjoy the experience despite limitations and restrictions.

“We are very humbled that we’re allowed to operate at this time at all” he says. “We do not take that or the health and safety of our guests cast and crew for granted and we sincerely appreciate all of the difficult decisions being made every day by health and government officials.”

Vegas showbiz folks have proven their resiliency time and time again before and during the pandemic but there’s something about these sexier offerings that continues to resonate with visitors and audiences in a special way.

“It’s because it’s exclusive. You can’t see a topless show with that caliber of talent anywhere but Vegas” says Martinez who has performed in many different styles of shows in Las Vegas throughout her career. “These women are legit showgirls they’re extremely talented and there are not only incredible dancers they’re also aerialists and acrobats and more. It’s an experience. People come to Vegas because they want to see something naughty and sassy they can’t see at home and that’s why these shows do so well.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhc2luby5vcmcvbmV3cy9zaGVsZG9uLWFkZWxzb24tYW5kLWphbWVzLXBhY2tlci1zcGVuZC1uZXcteWVhcnMtdG9nZXRoZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sheldon Adelson and James Packer Spend New Year's Together,"Sheldon Adelson James Packer Huddle For New Year’s – Sands/Crown Deal Forthcoming?

Posted on: January 2 2021 10:46h.

Billionaire casino tycoons Sheldon Adelson and James Packer were spotted together during a New Year’s Eve bash in the French Caribbean. And that’s prompted speculation that Packer could be in discussions to sell his more than 36 percent stake in Crown Resorts to the Las Vegas Sands founder and CEO.

The UK’s Daily Telegraph broke the news that Adelson 87 and Packer 53 were celebrating the end of the most difficult year for their gaming businesses. The media outlet says Packer’s $200 million superyacht was docked next to Adelson’s $70 million Queen Miri. Tender boats were seen going back and forth from the yachts.

According to Forbes Adelson and Packer are respectively worth $36.3 billion and $3.4 billion. Adelson’s Sands owns casinos in Las Vegas Singapore and Macau. Packer’s Crown operates in his native Australia as well as Crown London Aspinalls.

Adelson Acquisition?

Packer’s Crown Resorts is amid an investigation in Sydney officials in New South Wales determining if the casino group is suitable to hold a gaming license in the Australian state. Crown Sydney a AUD$2.4 billion (USD$1.8 billion) integrated resort opened last week but with its casino on hold.

The New South Wales Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) is set to issue its verdict on Crown’s suitability sometime this month. Lawyers assisting in the ILGA Inquiry suggested that Packer isn’t suitable to be a close associate of Crown Resorts.

Though Packer no longer sits on the Crown board nor has any executive role he maintains a 36.8 percent stake in the company. During his ILGA testimony Packer conceded that he would sell his position in the casino group if that would allow Crown Sydney to maintain its gaming license.

Adelson is bullish on casinos located outside the United States. Sands sold the company’s only US casino not in Las Vegas — Sands Bethlehem in Pennsylvania – in 2018 for $1.3 billion. It’s also been reported that Sands is looking to sell its Las Vegas Strip properties — The Venetian and Palazzo.

Adelson has at least for the moment called off his company’s interest in investing in Japan. Gaming analysts believe the casino tycoon prefers acquisitions more than new construction. A Crown purchase would fall in line with that thinking and give Adelson two casinos in Australia — Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth — and possibly a third with Crown Sydney.

Crown Affair

As it awaits the NSW Inquiry verdict Crown Resorts is doing all it can to help prop up its public image. The company which has been accused of failing to prevent its casinos from being used to launder money recently changed its deposit rules for gamblers.

Crown also announced in November that it would only work with VIP junket groups that are fully licensed in the jurisdiction where its casinos are located. Crown appointed its first financial crimes officer too.

Critics say Crown’s efforts come too late.

“Crown has acted with impunity and arrogance for years” opined Tim Costello a reverend and CEO of World Vision Australia a nonprofit that advocates for the poor. “Now they are desperate to prove that they are a fit and proper organization.”",,,

Luckily Fisher didn’t have to run in the Orange Bowl.

Devon Achane did more than enough of that for the Aggies.

Achane had two touchdowns in the final 3:44 including a 76-yarder that put Texas A&M ahead to stay and the fifth-ranked Aggies beat No. 14 North Carolina 41-27 on Saturday night — capping a winless bowl season for the Atlantic Coast Conference.

“North Carolina had one heck of a team man” Fisher said. “That was one of the great Orange Bowls. ... But I also say there’s a heck of a football team standing in front of me.”

Kellen Mond passed for 232 yards and ran for a score for the Aggies (9-1) who were in the Orange Bowl for the first time since 1944 and were one spot away from making the College Football Playoff field. Fisher improved to 3-0 in Orange Bowls winning two previous ones at Florida State.

Achane’s go-ahead score came on a play where he nearly tripped over one of his own blockers broke a tackle and then got loose down the left sideline.

“Ain't nobody catching me"" Achane said.

The Aggies got a fourth-down stop on the ensuing possession and Achane — the game's MVP after a 140-yard effort taking over for Isaiah Spiller after he got “a little banged-up"" Fisher said — sealed the win on a 1-yard run with 1:34 left.

Fitting in a season when young players scored the overwhelming majority of Texas A&M's touchdowns a freshman had the final two scores.

“I just can’t wait for next season” Achane said.

Sam Howell passed for 234 yards and three touchdowns two of them to Josh Downs for the Tar Heels (8-4). North Carolina was without leading rushers Javonte Williams and Michael Carter leading receiver Dyami Brown and top tackler Chazz Surratt — all of whom opted out of the bowl game.

“We were so close"" Howell said. “We played a heck of a game out there tonight and just came up short. We were right there.""

The ACC sent two teams to the playoff but went 0-6 in bowls four of those losses by two touchdowns or more.

Howell — a likely Heisman Trophy candidate in 2021 — did his best to change that stat. He tied the Tar Heels' career TD passing record of 68 with his three scoring throws all of which gave North Carolina leads.

“We lost 4000 yards coming into the game and still had a chance against the No. 5 team to win” UNC coach Mack Brown said.

The first go-ahead throw from Howell saw Dazz Newsome make a diving 28-yard grab with 4:56 left in the half to put the Tar Heels ahead 13-10. The next was a 10-yarder to Downs with 8:01 left in the third for a 20-17 lead a drive extended when Texas A&M had an interception in the end zone waved off by penalty. And the third was a 75-yarder to Downs early in the fourth when Howell saw him break free pointed to him and let the ball fly.

“We're able to compete with anybody"" Tar Heels linebacker Tomon Fox said.

But every time UNC went up Texas A&M answered.

A 3-yard run by Spiller late in the half put the Aggies up 17-13 a chip-shot field goal by Seth Small tied the game at 20 with 14:02 remaining and Mond had a 4-yard TD run with 10:11 left to tie the game at 27.

The rest was up to Achane and Fisher is already thinking about history repeating itself in 2021. It'll be his fourth season at Texas A&M; he won an Orange Bowl in his third season at Florida State and a national title in his fourth.

“I’m gonna tell you this: We ain’t done yet"" Fisher said.

THE TAKEAWAY

Texas A&M: Mond’s rushing score was the 93rd touchdown he was responsible for at Texas A&M tying Johnny Manziel’s school record.

North Carolina: The Tar Heels gave up 24 points in the fourth quarter after allowing just 17 points in the first 45 minutes. It was a difficult end for a defense that forced five three-and-outs.

POLL IMPLICATIONS

At worst Texas A&M should remain No. 5 and match its best AP poll finish since finishing No. 1 in 1939 (joining No. 5 rankings to end the 1956 and 2012 seasons). North Carolina still could finish ranked for only the fourth time in the last 27 seasons.

BOWL WOES

Of the 25 bowl games played so far the ACC and Conference USA have had the losing team in 48% of them. Like the ACC C-USA also went 0-6 this bowl season.

UP NEXT

Texas A&M: Scheduled to open 2021 against Kent State on Sept. 4.

North Carolina: An ACC opponent likely awaits in Week 1 next season. The Tar Heels’ first non-ACC game is currently set for Sept. 11 against Georgia State.

A broad ban on single-use containers forks straws and other ubiquitous items takes effect in Mexico's capital one of the world's largest cities after more than a year of preparation.

On Friday Mexico City's environmental secretary said via Twitter that ""from today on Mexico City without single-use plastics."" The message urged people to think of always carrying reusable containers like never leaving home without their cell phones.

Mexico City lawmakers passed the ban on plastic bags utensils and other disposable plastic items in 2019. The city of 9 million people has spent the past year adjusting or in some cases ignoring the impending law change. The ban on plastic bags took effect last year.

Light allegedly biodegradable bags have become more common at the city's street food stalls. Plastic straws are offered less often. Fresh tortillas are handed over wrapped in paper or cloths that buyers bring with them.

But without the imposition of fines the change will likely be slow in coming.

On Friday morning a woman selling tamales under a large umbrella at the corner of a busy Mexico City avenue slid two into a plastic bag and offered two small colorful plastic spoons from a cup filled with them. Asked if she was aware of the ban taking effect she said she was ""but with the coronavirus they (authorities) forgot about it.""

Mexico City is currently under red alert as its hospitals' COVID-19 beds hover near capacity.

The woman who declined to give her name because she didn't want to be singled out for enforcement said it wasn't just her. She said vendors and market stalls were still using plastic all over the city.

She asked how she was supposed to give customers steaming hot tamales without a plastic bag.

The ban also covers disposable plastic cups plastic stirrers single-use coffee capsules and balloons among other items.

In 2019 Mexico City produced about 13000 tons of garbage per day according to the capital's environmental agency.

Now it's being scrapped.,"Another icon of the early days of cruising has been sent to the scrappers.

Ocean Dream which originally sailed as Carnival Cruise Line's Tropicale arrived at the scrapyards of Alang India on Friday after being idle for nearly a year due to the coronavirus crisis.

Unveiled in 1982 the 1422-passenger ship was the first cruise vessel purpose-built for Carnival and it played a significant role in the line's early growth.

Ordered just eight years after Carnival's founding in 1972 the 10-deck-high ship was larger than the line's three existing vessels at the time -- Mardi Gras Carnivale and Festivale. It also was the first true cruise ship at the line.

Carnival had bought its first three vessels on the second-hand market and all were traditional ocean liners that the line had converted for use as cruise ships.

The addition of a purpose-built cruise ship to the Carnival fleet was thus a major milestone in the line's development. In part due to the success of the ship and three more bigger vessels based on the same design that came later Carnival grew rapidly and soon was able to begin buying up its rivals to become the world's biggest cruise company.

Now known as Carnival Corp. the company today operates nearly 90 cruise ships under not just the Carnival brand but eight other cruise brands including Princess Cruises Holland America Seabourn and Costa Cruises.

Built by Danish shipbuilder Aalborg Verft Tropicale initially sailed from Miami to the Caribbean. But the vessel would go on to play an important role in launching Carnival cruises to other destinations such as Alaska and Mexico. Tropicale was the first Carnival ship to be based in San Juan Puerto Rico New Orleans and Tampa.

Tropicale was notably also the very first Carnival ship to boast one of the line's signature ""whale tail"" winged funnels -- a now-iconic design flourish dreamed up by the noted ship designer Joe Farcus. All Carnival ships since Tropicale have had one.

Tropicale left the Carnival fleet in 2000 transferring to sister line Costa Cruises. It sailed for Costa through 2005 as the Costa Tropicale before being transferred to another sister line P&O Cruises Australia to sail under the name Pacific Star. In 2008 the ship was transferred yet again to Spanish line Pullmantur. It was there that it took on the name Ocean Dream.

A few years after that the ship was sold to Peace Boat a Japan-based non-governmental organization that runs educational voyages as part of its mission of working toward peace human rights environmental protection and sustainable development.

Peace Boat has purchased a former Princess Cruises ship to take Ocean Dream's place.

Tropicale is the oldest former Carnival ship still in existence. Once it is scrapped the oldest former Carnival ship to still be in existence will be the 1987-built Celebration which now sails for Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line as the Grand Celebration.

The scrapping of Tropicale comes just just six months after one of the most iconic ships from the early Royal Caribbean fleet Sovereign of the Seas was sent to the scrappers.

The ships are among a growing list of cruise vessels that have been sent to the scrappers in the past 10 months as the cruise industry experiences an unprecedented shutdown.

What happened

Shares of Carnival (CCL -0.14%) (CUK 0.30%) fell 57% last year according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence as the coronavirus took a heavy toll on the cruise industry.

So what

After a series of COVID-19 outbreaks occurred on multiple cruise ships the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued no-sail orders that forced Carnival and other cruise operators to cancel their U.S. voyages. With their ships stuck at port and little revenue coming in the major cruise lines quickly began bleeding cash.

By the second half of 2020 Carnival's cash burn rate had reached approximately $650 million per month. To stay afloat Carnival was forced to raise billions in cash via stock sales and high-interest-rate debt diluting shareholders and increasing its interest costs in the process.

Now what

With health officials in the U.S. and international markets beginning to rescind their no-sail orders Carnival is slowly resuming operations. Promising vaccines developed by the likes of Moderna and Pfizer could accelerate this process if they can help to reduce COVID-19 infection rates and bring about the end of the pandemic. Carnival's stock price in turn could rebound in 2021.

Still risks remain. Higher interest expenses and safety-related costs will make it more difficult for Carnival to achieve its pre-pandemic profit margins. And with more shares outstanding after its stock offerings investors may find is per-share profits less attractive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL29uZS1tb3JlLWZvcm1lci1jYXJuaXZhbC1jcnVpc2Utc2hpcC1pcy1iZWFjaGVkLzQ1MjA10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,One More Former Carnival Cruise Ship is Beached,"The new year did not start well for former Carnival cruise line ship Ocean Dream formerly known as Tropicale. After a long life sailing the world’s oceans for multiple cruise lines since 1982 she was beached at the shipbreakers in Alang India on January 1 2021.

The Ocean Dream is the latest in an ever-increasing list of ships that have been beached in India and Turkey over the last year. Companies are hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and are forced to eliminate costly and financially ineffective vessels.

In the last 12 months Carnival Cruise Line has scrapped Carnival Imagination Carnival Inspiration and Carnival Fantasy sold Carnival Fascination while another former Carnival Cruise ship is also heading for the shipbreakers in India Grand Celebration.

You can watch the cruise ship beached in Alang India below:

Carnival’s first new-build ship

At the time she was built Tropicale was a first in many different ways. While Carnival was sailing with Mardi Gras Carnivale and TSS Festivale the line needed to increase its presence. Building a new ship was the only option to remain competitive with the stiff competition in the Caribean; Tropicale was ordered and delivered in 1982.

Built at the Aalborg Værft Denmark in 1981 Carnival Tropicale could hold 1022 passengers. As-built she weighed in at 36674 gross tons and measured 204.76 metres from bow to stern.

She was the first vessel to feature the iconic winged funnel designed by Joe Farcus who would significantly influence how cruise ships would be designed and built in the future. Due to the success of Tropicale Carnival cruise line ordered Carnival Holiday in 1985 Carnival Jubilee in 1986 and Carnival Celebration in 1987.

Tropicale for Carnival Cruise Line

Carnival Tropicale sailed for Carnival cruise line from 1982 until the year 2000. As Carnival cruise line grew in size and took on larger vessels the line used Tropicale mainly for test voyages in places like Alaska New Orleans Tampa and Puerto Rico. She became a front runner in what would ultimately become incredibly popular cruise destinations.

A Lifetime Roaming The High Seas

Tropicale was transferred to sail for Costa Cruises in the year 2000 and was renamed Costa Tropicale. During her 40-year career as a cruise ship she was a testament to the build quality of the time. Tropicale sailed for five different operators and was renamed several times as well.

After sailing with Costa Cruises until the year 2005 she was transferred to P&O Cruises Australia under the name Pacific Star where she sailed until the year 2008. In 2008 she left Carnival Corporation and sailed for Pullmantur and renamed yet again to Ocean Dream.

The vessel’s last assignment was for the Peace Boat organization. Peace Boat is a Japanese NGO that raises awareness internationally for human rights sustainability environmental protection and other global causes. Peace Boat had operated Tropicale or how it was now named Ocean Dream since 2008.

In 2020 the organization purchased the former Princess cruise line ship Sun Princess marking the end of the line for Tropicale. The end of the line sadly ended on a beach in India amongst other iconic vessels made obsolete by the pandemic.

How the Ship Changed Carnival Forever

If the name doesn’t sound familiar it’s probably because the ship hasn’t been a part of the Carnival fleet since 2000. After its time with Carnival Cruise Line it was transferred to Costa Cruises (a division of Carnival Corporation) and then eventually sold by the company. That said Tropicale holds a very special place in both Carnival’s history and the hearts of many cruisers.

During the early days of Carnival the ships making up its fleet were ones that had been purchased from other lines as opposed to new builds. But all that changed when the company decided to go all-in on the then-still-fledgling cruise industry by having a ship custom made.

That instantly recognizable whale-tail funnel that makes it easy to spot a Fun Ship? Tropicale was the ship that introduced the now-iconic shape which was the idea of legendary Carnival designer Joe Farcus.

Describing that first funnel in his book Design on the High Seas Farcus said “It was beautiful. It was distinctive. It was functional. And it was Carnival Cruise Lines.”

This first new build for Carnival was one of which Farcus was uniquely proud. “She was bigger and clearly better” than the fleet’s earlier ships had been he wrote. “The ship as a destination in itself had gone to the next level.” This would also be the last Carnival ship to feature windowless dining rooms.

A Fond Farewell

The ship wound up being transferred to Costa Cruises in 2001 where she sailed as the Costa Tropicale. Like many of the older ships in the fleet this one never sailed as the Carnival Tropicale because it would not be until several years after the transfer that the company began adding “Carnival” to the official name of their vessels.

Over the following years Tropicale would eventually become the Ocean Dream sailing humanitarian missions for the Peace Boat organization.

Now however 38 years after the Tropicale first began reinventing the cruise industry the ship has arrived on the shores of India where it will become the latest in a far-too-long line of vessels to be scrapped.

Yet memories of the ship will live on especially for the thousands of passengers who had the pleasure of sailing upon her.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWNyaXRpYy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvcGhvdG9zLW9mLWNhcm5pdmFsLW1hcmRpLWdyYXMtY3J1aXNlLXNoaXAtYmVmb3JlLWl0cy0yMDIxLWRlYnV00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos of Carnival Mardi Gras Cruise Ship Before Its 2021 Debut,"As we enter 2021 excitement and anticipation is building for Carnival Cruise Line's newest vessel Mardi Gras slated to debut in the U.S. this year.

Carnival took delivery of the 180000-ton ship named after Carnival's Mardi Gras of 1972 in December 2020 in a virtual ceremony held at the Meyer Turku Shipyard in Turku Finland. The ship will be the first vessel in the Carnival fleet to be powered by liquefied natural gas or LNG technology.

Mardi Gras has now begun its journey towards North America for the first time. In December it sailed for Rotterdam where it bunkered with LNG for the transatlantic crossing before proceeding to Barcelona Spain. It is expected to make its Atlantic crossing sometime in January 2021.

For Carnival cruisers the 5200-passenger Mardi Gras represents an exciting new chapter. Mardi Gras is an entirely new class of ship unlike any other Fun Ship afloat and introduces a new livery of blue white and red along with a flourished name represented in a similar font to that of the Mardi Gras of 1972; a vessel that formerly sailed as Canadian Pacific's Empress of Canada.

Here are some of the other new features along with photos:

First Roller Coaster at Sea

Chief among the new features aboard Mardi Gras is BOLT the world's first-ever roller coaster at sea.

BOLT will race along an 800-foot airborne track situated 187 feet above sea level with the roller coaster's electric motorcycle-inspired cars travelling at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour. Each car can seat two people and passengers will have control over their own speed as they dip drop and turn along the track which includes a hairpin turn around the ship's iconic funnel.

Cameras placed along the track will also capture riders' journeys and commemorative photos can be purchased in true amusement-park fashion as a memento of the experience.

Grand Central Atrium

Mardi Gras will also debut a brand-new atrium concept for Carnival. Spanning three decks in height the Grand Central Atrium will be flanked by walls of glass windows and will be situated along the starboard side of the vessel.

Designed to be a café bar and gathering spot by day the Grand Central Atrium turns into a show lounge at night offering immersive performances each evening.

Grand Central will also offer the Grand View Bar; the Center Stage Bar; the JavaBlue Coffee Bar; and Carnival's Cherry on Top candy shop.

Bars will offer custom cocktails that are inspired by and change with the entertainment on offer each evening while light bites will be offered for the first time at JavaBlue.

""It's entirely a departure from anything that we've ever done"" Carnival director of newbuild product development Glenn Aprile told Cruise Critic in an interview. ""As far as I know I think this is the first atrium that's been placed on the side of a cruise ship. Most typically Atriums run down the center of the ship.""

New Cabins and Suites

Passengers will be accommodated in 2600 cabins and 180 suites that span 11 different categories of accommodation. These include standard inside outside and balcony staterooms all done in a refreshing new style of décor for the line that focuses on light blues and other sea colours instead of the heavy browns and reds that graced past staterooms.

Mardi Gras however also kicks things up a notch when it comes to suite selection. Long a weak-point on Carnival ships Mardi Gras boasts more suites than other Fun Ships to-date including the Excel Presidential Suite that offers separate living and sleeping areas a dining area and a hot tub mounted on the included wraparound balcony.

The line's popular ""Havana Cabana"" Cuban-themed suite return aboard Mardi Gras as well as part of the Havana collection of cabins suites and public areas that include exclusive access to the Havana Bar & Pool.

New Restaurants From Celebrity Chefs

Carnival's Mardi Gras will also usher in a whole host of new dining concepts onboard with restaurants designed by noted chef Emeril Lagasse Shaquille O'Neal and Holland America Line's master chef Rudi Sodamin.

Emeril's Bistro 1396 will be the first seagoing restaurant headed up by Emeril Lagasse. The 66-seat Creole-themed dining venue will offer all-day dining with specialities including grits muffuletta sandwiches roasted duck gumbos jambalayas and Emeril's signature barbecue shrimp. A raw bar will also serve up Louisiana crawfish oysters and more.

Carnival's Chief Fun Officer and NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal will debut his own Big Chicken Restaurant aboard Mardi Gras. The complimentary venue which serves up breakfast lunch and dinner items culled from O'Neal's family recipes was scheduled to debut aboard Carnival Radiance. With that ship's conversion from Carnival Victory delayed into Fall 2021 Mardi Gras will likely be the first vessel to offer this casual eatery.

Rudi's Seagrill meanwhile brings Holland America chef Rudi Sodamin's trademark culinary whimsy to Carnival's Fun Ships for the first time. According to Carnival in addition to an extensive menu of seafood entrees and sides dishes Rudi's Seagrill will offer several unique dishes presented as playful ""food faces"" that double as Instagram-worthy pieces of art.

Another new venue Street Eats rolls out casual street fare like empanadas while the RedFrog Tiki Bar makes its debut aboard Mardi Gras.

Also returning are Guy Fieri's onboard burger joint and smokehouse which have been established in recent years as two of Carnival's most successful specialty venues.

The Next Fun Ship Evolution Coming Soon

When cruising resumes Mardi Gras will operate weeklong Caribbean itineraries from Port Canaveral FL. Carnival notes it has worked closely with authorities at Port Canaveral to design and build a new cruise terminal capable of accommodating the size and LNG-fueling process required by Mardi Gras and other Excel-class ships.

""We have been working tirelessly this year to get to this exciting day to take delivery of this beautiful ship and the team at Meyer Turku has been an outstanding partner throughout this process"" said Christine Duffy president of Carnival Cruise Line. ""I cannot wait for our guests and crew to see and experience Mardi Gras. Notwithstanding the delays related to the pandemic there is tremendous enthusiasm and pent-up demand for this ship.""

Mardi Gras will also have a sister ship joining the fleet in 2022 complete with another ""throwback"" name: Carnival Celebration.

""Next we will work on the development of her sister ship Carnival Celebration which arrives in 2022 and has sold very well since inventory opened in October"" said Duffy.

Mardi Gras is currently scheduled to embark on its maiden revenue voyage on April 24 2021."

Now there could be a new more direct way for traders and investors to bet on this ultra-hot market. Israeli liner operator ZIM has just filed for an initial public offering (IPO) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing.

This marks the fourth attempt to bring ZIM public since the Ofer family took the carrier private in 2004. As with the rest of the container industry ZIM has traveled a rocky road over the past decade. It was forced into two major restructurings of its debt and ship leases one during the financial crisis and one in 2015.

But the fourth time could finally be the charm for the IPO. As reported by American Shipper several days before the ZIM filing there has not been a successful shipping IPO in the U.S market since 2015 yet ZIM appears the most likely to break the losing streak. Given today’s unprecedented rate froth the trans-Pacific container trade the timing couldn’t be better.

Almost all U.S.-listed container stocks are companies that lease ships or boxes to liners. When liners prosper via high freight rates leasing company stocks rise (due to lower counterparty risk and higher charter renewal rates). Nonetheless lessors are one step removed from the freight market.

In contrast liner companies are directly exposed to ocean freight rates. But there is only one liner in the U.S. stock market: Matson (NYSE: MATX).

Matson has significant exposure to Asia-U.S. rates. However it is primarily a Jones Act operator with higher exposure to domestic markets including tourism-reliant Hawaii.

(Chart: ZIM prospectus; data from Alphaliner; TEUs = 20-foot-equivalent units)

Meanwhile Maersk the world’s largest liner operator does have U.S.-traded American depositary receipts (OTC: AMKBY) but its common shares trade in Denmark.

A NYSE listing by ZIM would offer U.S. stock investors the most direct exposure possible to the Asia-U.S. freight market. According to Alphaliner ZIM is the world’s tenth largest liner but it is the most exposed to the trans-Pacific. It had 52% of capacity deployed in this trade versus the industry average of just 19% as of October.





Exposure to downside import risk

This also means that ZIM is more exposed to a collapse in U.S. containerized imports than any other liner company. On a positive note there is no evidence this will happen anytime soon.

As of Saturday there were 34 container ships waiting at anchorage off Los Angeles/Long Beach; congestion is more extreme than ever. As of Friday Asia-West Coast rates (SONAR: FBXD.CNAW) were at an all-time high of $4200 per day according to the Freightos Baltic Daily Index.

The seeming contradiction — a U.S. import boom amid a pandemic with outsized infections in the U.S. — is explained by data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Despite surging unemployment and poverty overall U.S. personal income has increased due to stimulus. Spending on services has plummeted leading to a surge in savings as well as much higher spending on goods (i.e. imports).

With more stimulus coming in 2021 and vaccines likely to give consumers more confidence to draw down savings inflated in 2020 imports — and thus ocean freight rates — appear likely to continue their bull run into at least the second quarter.

ZIM filed its publicly accessible IPO registration on Dec. 30 (its first confidential filing was Sept. 30; see full Dec. 30 filing here). Citigroup Goldman Sachs and Barclays are serving as global coordinators with Jefferies and Clarksons Platou Securities as joint bookrunners.

Although price targets and IPO timing have yet to be set ZIM seems likely to strike while the iron is hot. American Shipper has been told that talks with prospective investors are beginning this week. Thus it seems all but certain that ZIM’s Wall Street move will happen during a period of extremely elevated trans-Pacific rates.

ZIM is different than other liners

Most ocean carriers are either regionally focused or are global providing ships on all major lanes. ZIM is in between. ZIM said it is “uniquely positioned as a global carrier but one that focuses on select trades where it believes it can establish a competitive advantage.”

Most carriers own about half their fleet. Here again ZIM is different. It owns only one of its 70 vessels or 2% of its fleet.





(Chart: ZIM prospectus; data from Alphaliner; arranged in order of total deployed capacity)

ZIM also differs from other carriers in that it leases 89% of its containers and owns a mere 11%. Most carriers own closer to half their containers with Maersk recently affirming that it will move to own even more.

ZIM maintains that its leasing strategy allows it to maintain a sizable presence while limiting capital costs and maintaining flexibility.

On one hand this is a plus. While more leased assets are listed in the asset column of the balance sheet under new accounting rules ZIM can still claim to be “asset-light” — a category today’s investors heavily favor over asset-intensive businesses like traditional shipowners (one reason why there have been no shipping IPOs in New York since 2015).

On the other hand the reason most liners own half their fleets and half their boxes is that if you own assets for their full lifetime it’s cheaper to own than lease. Plus leasing all your ships and boxes exposes you to surging charter rates — exactly what is occurring today.

As of Sept. 30 78% of ZIM’s leases had less than one year in duration. As previously reported by American Shipper ship leasing rates are going “through the roof.” Thus the high upside exposure to surging trans-Pacific revenues could be counterbalanced by higher near-term charter costs.

Big debt load

Another area of potential concern for IPO investors: ZIM’s debt.

As of Sept. 30 total outstanding debt was $1.7 billion up from $1.6 billion as of Dec. 31 2019 and $1.46 billion as of Dec. 31 2018. The increase in the first nine months of 2020 was primarily due to a $101.4 million increase in lease liabilities. Current trends in charter markets imply that these liabilities could escalate.

ZIM’s current assets were $823.4 million and current liabilities were $975.9 million equating to a working capital deficit of $152.5 million. Total equity was negative $95 million.

In December indentures on ZIM’s Series 1 and 2 were amended to allow the company to pay up to 50% of annual net income in dividends. This revision followed $47 million in ZIM repurchases of Series 1 and 2 notes over recent months.

Yet operational restrictions remain. In general ZIM’s restructuring-induced debt constraints raise the question: To what extent does ZIM lease virtually all of its assets as a strategic decision and to what extent does it do so because it has to?

ZIM acknowledged “The terms of our Series 1 and 2 notes currently limit our ability to buy or charter large vessels for long periods of time.”

The carrier is seeking ways around this limitation. It currently operates a fleet of ships of up to 12000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in size. It stated in its prospectus that it “is exploring long-term lease arrangements” for 15000-TEU ships to be deployed in the trans-Pacific. These would replace short-term charters “which would increase our ability to service such routes.”

Insider sales

There are other red flags in the prospectus as well beyond debt issues and exposure to spiking charter rates. One is insider equity sales. As a result of its restructurings prior holders of ZIM lease obligations and debt now own a material percentage of the company.

According to the prospectus the largest shareholder is Kenon Holdings controlled by Idan Ofer with 32% of pre-IPO shares. The second largest shareholder is Deutsche Bank with 16.7%. The third largest holder is Danaos (NYSE: DAC) with 10.2%.

Companies like Danaos and Deutsche Bank could theoretically exit positions once ZIM is freely trading on NYSE and lockups expire.

ZIM conceded “The perception in the public market that our shareholders might sell our ordinary shares could depress the market price for our ordinary shares and could impair our future ability to obtain capital especially through an offering of equity securities.”

Related-party deals and ‘Israel factor’

ZIM also features another commonplace red flag among shipping companies: related-party transactions.

The company paid $22.4 million in full-year 2019 for charters of Ofer-controlled ships and $19.4 million in the first nine months of 2020. During these periods it paid $41.4 million and $22.5 million respectively for charters to shareholder Danaos.

The company also has risks related to being Israeli. The state of Israel holds a special or “golden” share in the company which imposes various restrictions. Provisions of Israeli law impede a potential sale of the company. Israel has the right to requisition ZIM’s vessels. ZIM’s employees could be required to perform military services impairing operations.

ZIM conceded that its status as an Israeli company “may limit our ability to call on certain ports and therefore could limit our ability to enter into alliances or operational partnerships with certain shipping companies which has historically adversely affected our operations and our ability to compete effectively within certain trades.” It confirmed that “certain carriers … are not willing to cooperate with Israeli companies.” Click for more FreightWaves/American Shipper articles by Greg Miller

Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said:

“We spoke about the challenges including in the South China Sea and we had a long discussion about the Pacific and the opportunities for deeper British engagement in our part of the world.”

Johnson (now Prime Minister) said at the time in response to concerns raised regarding freedom of navigation in the South China Sea:

“One of the first things we will do with the two new colossal aircraft carriers that we have just built is send them on a freedom of navigation operation to this area to vindicate our belief in the rules-based international system and in the freedom of navigation through those waterways which are absolutely vital for world trade.”

We reported recently that it had emerged that the UK plans to sail HMS Queen Elizabeth to the Pacific in 2021.

Commodore Michael Utley Commander United Kingdom Carrier Strike Group is reported by Save The Royal Navy here as saying that HMS Queen Elizabeth will be escorted by two Type 45 destroyers two Type 23 frigates a nuclear submarine a Tide-class tanker and RFA Fort Victoria. The ship will also carry 24 F-35B jets including US Marine Corps aircraft in addition to a number of helicopters.

Baroness Goldie Lord in Waiting Minister of State for the Ministry of Defence said in November this year:

“The deployment of HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH will demonstrate the UK’s commitment to upholding a rules-based international system and showcase our world-leading carrier capability. The UK has enduring interests in the region and is committed to maintaining regional security including asserting its rights to freedom of navigation and overflight as laid out in UNCLOS. Wherever the Royal Navy operate they do so in full compliance with international laws and norms and exercise their rights to freedom of navigation and overflight provided for by UNCLOS.”

What are freedom of navigation operations?

‘Freedom of navigation operations’ are designed to reinforce internationally-recognised rights and freedoms by challenging excessive maritime claims. The particulars of each operation are determined by the excessive maritime claim that is being protested.

What was China’s response?

Chinese defence spokesman Tan Kefei was quoted in the South China Morning Posas saying:

“The Chinese side believes that the South China Sea should not become a sea of great power rivalry dominated by weapons and warships. The real source of militarisation in the South China Sea comes from countries outside this region sending their warships thousands of kilometres from home to flex muscles. The Chinese military will take necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty security and development interest as well as peace and stability in the South China Sea.”

What happened last time?

In 2018 assault ship HMS Albion was challenged by a Chinese frigate and two helicopters during freedom of navigation exercise in the South China Sea.

However its wings were clipped after Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had the airlines’ International Operator Licence withdrawn last year.

The saga which lasted almost a month capped the eventual exit of the carrier by the end of August 2014.

A letter written on June 17 2014 by CAA indicated the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) had found the carriers’ certification process irregular in an industry that was low on surveillance and less compliant to international requirements.

Thus Air Uganda just like other local airlines according to CAA had failed the audit and could not continue to operate requiring the affected airline to consider going through a new recertification process.

Audit faults CAA

Results of the ICAO audit only became available to the public in December 2014; four months after Air Uganda had folded.

Although the audit makes no mention of any particular airline it made several recommendations among them dealing with inconsistences in CAA’s regulatory oversight.

“CAA should strengthen the internal audit and quality assurance section with the necessary techniques and technical skills to enable it effectively perform its function including audit of the directorate of safety security and economic regulation” the audit reads in part.

The audit also found CAA’s aviation certification and regulation below the global requirement of 66.45 per cent considering that Uganda was rated at 45.45 per cent.

Compared to regional authorities including Kenya and Rwanda which are rated at 77.27 per cent and 68.28 per cent respectively in terms of effective regulation airlines certified by CAA had been considered risky for travellers and industry trends.

CAA is also below the global average in terms of effective licensing operations and air navigation services.

The Authority however did score above the global average in airworthiness organisation and aerodromes.

The half-truths

In a communication to MPs regarding the suspension of Air Uganda the then Works minister Abraham Byandala insisted the carrier was towing a dangerous line including incidents of near misses and crash landing.

Additionally Mr Byandala said the airline had been warned to adhere to safety procedures among which was failure to provide fleet maintenance documentation.

“The above irregularities presented a significant gap in safety assurance process within Air Uganda” Mr Byandala said then.

Byandala’s argument continues to be shared by CAA with the Authority maintaining it had no option but to suspend Air Uganda operations.

“With incidents recorded on a regular basis and manuals and procedures irregularly altered CAA had no choice but to withdraw the airlines Air Operator Certificate. The deficiencies were compounded by the results of an inspection of the Airline’s Maintenance Organisation (AMO) that was also found wanting” Rama Makuza the CAA managing director told this reporter.

Subsequently Air Uganda ceased operations laying-off more than 200 staff in its commercial and handling business.

Cornwell Muleya the then chief executive officer rubbished CAA’s claims maintaining the responsibility to file maintenance and incident reports was not Air Uganda’s business since they were using leased aircrafts.

He further said as Air Uganda they could not risk their reputation in a highly regulated airline industry insisting CAA was to blame for failing to properly file industry audits as well as conducting its oversight roles as recommended by ICAO.

All locally licenced airlines were suspended meaning they did not meet international standards.

Before quitting Mr Muleya saw through the sale of Air Uganda assets debts including shareholders equity and informing shareholders of the decision to fold the Uganda venture.

Wolfgang Thome a contributor with the travel news site - r-turbo vocally criticised CAA’s decision to suspend Air Uganda and other airlines faulting the authority for the woes afflicting Uganda’s aviation sector.

For instance he said Air Uganda could not afford the luxury of spending a day grounded since operating the airline business includes huge overheads.

A day without operation for an airline can result into huge losses considering many contracts are pegged on the company’s daily operations.

The situation could not be helped given that Air Uganda was yet to turn into a profitable venture in its seven years of operation.

Negotiations between Uganda Civil Aviation Authority and the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development the majority shareholders in Air Uganda which had been initiated in September 2014 to discuss the revival of Air Uganda collapsed with the airline saying it would be hard to effectively operate considering the huge loses incurred and the massive reputation damage.

Experts estimate the airline to have posted more than $500m in losses before fully closing down in August 2014.

Talk of reviving a national airline

The exit of Air Uganda opened talk of reviving Uganda Airlines a government-owned airline which was liquidated in 2001.

In several Cabinet meetings last year this newspaper understands the Ministry of Works and Transport vouched for the revival of the national carrier with a view of buying shares in Air Uganda.

However a paper which was presented on the matter then was sent back for reviewing especially in the area of cost implication but many of the suggestions have been over taken by events among them the closure of Air Uganda.

Other options including finding joint venture partners or a go-it-alone option (100 per cent funding) had been discussed however no conclusion has been discussed yet.

Reviving the national airline is also being supported by tourism sector with players such as Uganda Tourism Board National Planning Authority and traders saying it will help to market the country.

The bigger question

Up to now many have been and continue to ask why Air Uganda never sought legal redress but the answer is grounded in the fact that the airline would be required to go through the recertification process and then proceed to court.

Another argument was that if Air Uganda or any other airline had any dispute it would be resolved through a tribunal which CAA has never set up.

The CAA Act provides that all disputes in the airline sector shall be settled in a tribunal set up by the Authority.

After Air Uganda had exited Uganda its routes were temporarily granted to Ethiopian Airlines and Rwandair.

The exit also had a knock-on effect on ticket fares with Kenya Airways almost tripling its return ticket from Entebbe to Nairobi Kenya.

A return ticket to the Entebbe-Nairobi route on Kenya Airways which had spiked to almost $800 (Shs2.4m) after the closure of Air Uganda has since dropped to $300 (Shs930000).

Cautious on revivals of Uganda airlines

Mr Francis Kamulegeya the managing partner at PriceWaterhouseCoopers Uganda is cautious of the move to revive Uganda Airlines saying it might not be a major priority for government currently.

“The debate is still out there. We have to first ask why Uganda Airlines collapsed? Since we are expanding the airport do we attract more international airlines or do we start our own and fly to those various destinations?” he says. The cost implication if the revival was to be taken up would be high considering that government has just secured a $350m loan from China’s Exim Bank for the expansion and rehabilitation of Entebbe International Airport."

She told the children they were going to do something new.

As the children sat and watched in confusion they had no idea Masse was doing this to introduce new toys — toys that were nontraditional and based in nature — as a way to introduce a new learning method at the day care the Curiosity Approach.

The Curiosity Approach implements a “calm cozy approach” according to Masse and uses natural play that resembles a child’s natural environment.

“It has made a huge difference” she said. “The teachers have said that the students are less chaotic they have calm bodies and they gravitate toward the natural learning environments — they don’t ask for the old toys.”

The success of their Waterville day care facility The Hungry Caterpillars Learning Center has prompted Masse and her husband Josh to open The Curious Caterpillars Learning Center in Augusta also focused on alternative learning methods. The Augusta facility is scheduled to open Monday.

Masse said her passion for education began about six years ago with her wanting to be a teacher so she could be home for her young children.

Through the stints she had working in education she saw methods she wanted to improve. She also wanted to teach in ways that went beyond the “traditional” public school test-based structured learning model.

As she worked toward her doctorate in education from Capella University an online school headquartered in Minneapolis she was encouraged by her husband to start her own day care. It lead to the start of The Hungry Caterpillars Learning Center in Waterville about three years ago and this week the Augusta location will hold its grand opening implementing a learning method about which Masse is passionate.

“There are a lot of children out there that deserve to be in a good (learning) environment” Masse said. “There is research out there that a lot of facilities help families that don’t have a lot of other options but not for families that fall in between or don’t make the cut because they are not income eligible.”

WHAT IS ALTERNATIVE LEARNING?

Julie DellaMattera an associate professor of early childhood development and education at the University of Maine said she could not think of reasons children should not participate in alternative learning environments.

Using an example of a toy car she explained how such teaching can work: If given a toy car a child can move it or even smash it around because he or she is aware of what happens on the street. A child will rarely turn a toy car into a telephone doll hat or bed. It will always be a car to him or her. But if children are given a rock or sticks it encourages them to use their imagination and pretend.

Masse has incorporated nature-based play into her child care centers which DellaMattera said can sometimes be misinterpreted among adults.

“People think that nature-based means being outside but nature-based means using natural materials” DellaMattera said. “We found that when you give kids Legos or play kitchen sets it’s not that they stop using their imagination. It’s that it’s boxed in.

“If I use kitchen sets I’m supposed to do kitchen-type things and they know that you cook and food goes in the fridge. It limits how they play in the space. They don’t take a kitchen set and pretend it’s a car.”

Related Bill to expand access to child care unveiled in Waterville

Some families may not have Legos or playdough to replicate play at home she said. By using natural materials students are encouraged to learn and play no matter the environment. DellaMattera said this encourages natural creativity and it is easier for parents to teach children when they are at home.

“For kids they’re trying to figure out the world at their age and their place in it” DellaMattera said. “The world is full of nature stuff and they can see what happens to a leaf over time or bark or think ‘Can I crush a rock?’ It’s science-based and all of those things are what we want a scientist to be skeptical about.”

Masse said including nature-based materials in play has encouraged students to use their imagination and thinking skills. It has also caused the children to be able to sit for 45 minutes at a time focused on trying to explore the items with which they are playing.

One of the children’s favorite play methods is a suitcase that has been turned into a treasure box. Every time the box comes down there are new objects for the children to explore — usually items they do not see often such as seashells or silk clothes.

“When they see it come down every time it opens there is something new in there” Masse said. “It’s magical curiosity and they know there is a new treasure in there that they can see and paw through.”

TRANSITIONING TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS

Heather Duquette said from the start she has felt her 2 1/2-year-old daughter Avery has been ahead of the game.

The prekindergartens Masse runs offer evaluations on when children reach certain milestones which can be shown to pediatricians. Duquette said Avery is always ahead of where she normally would be and already knows her numbers and alphabet.

“We didn’t foresee any of the things that (Masse) was going to come up with” Duquette said. “But as we have progressed I have seen the benefits. Even before looking at schools and day cares I was skeptical about sending her somewhere that she doesn’t get direct instruction. But now I have seen it through and seen the growth and I think it’s amazing.”

As a French teacher at Waterville Senior High School Duquette was used to the structure of a public school and enrolled Avery at the Waterville Hungry Caterpillar location before the alternative method was introduced.

With her background in public education Duquette said she was not worried about her daughter’s ability to transition into public schools.

“Even with the nature-based approach they are integrating all of the curriculum students would have to learn about” Duquette said. “They’ll bring things in about plants and animals and then they start integrating science and counting. Everything is brought together in a whole as opposed to separating each topic.”

Duquette said she has adopted some of Masse’s learning styles for her French classes such as making the classroom a cozy environment that enhances learning.

GRAND OPENING IN AUGUSTA

Masse said people have traveled good distances to attend her two learning centers. People find out about them mostly by word of mouth she said.

She realizes nontraditional learning styles may not be suited to every child or adult.

“They have to be the type of person that wants this type of education and it’s OK if they are not” Masse said. “It’s OK if you just want your child to go to child care. Not everyone has the desire to go to a more specific style and I’m OK with that. I think that it’s wrong to think that anyone is above and beyond other types of learning.”

Masse said she chose the Augusta location to give parents more options especially since people in the Waterville area were traveling to attend the center.

Infants to children ready for kindergarten are accepted into the center and rates are structured in part around the area. However at the Waterville center infants were $250 a week and pre kindergartners and toddlers $210 a week.

Masse said she and her husband are looking to enroll 50 children. Each teacher at the center has a degree or is working toward a degree in child development.

DellaMattera advised parents looking for child care options to recognize how their children learn and to incorporate that into the search.

“You want a place that matches your beliefs and what your children want” she said. “Some kids are happy to sit and color and other kids need to run around. None are wrong. They just need someone to honor that.”

Nashville TN - News outlets across the country took a break from discussing President Trump on Wednesday to cover a completely unrelated caterpillar.





One evening news anchor said ""Tonight we have decided to take a break from Donald Trump coverage to bring you this funny-looking yet extremely dangerous orange caterpillar.""





The insect in question is the flannel moth caterpillar (Megalopyge Opercularis) also called the woolly slug or puss moth. It is best know for its fluffy orange tufts of hair in its larva form.





Liberal news outlets described the caterpillar as a pest and warned Americans to stay away.

""Sure it may look funny but this thing is venomous. Underneath all that orange mess you'll find lethal pointed fleshy appendages. This thing will cause agonizing pain to anyone who comes into contact with it so avoid it at all costs.""





Conservative media outlets did not mention the dangers of the caterpillar but all the great things the caterpillar has done for the environment and laws of nature.





All news channels are expected to return to Trump coverage on Thursday.

But could some species – including the common and familiar great tit – vanish from Britain’s gardens by the end of the century?

Researchers from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology working with the University of Oxford have modelled how great tits are reacting to the climate crisis. Specifically are the birds able to respond to the earlier emergence of the caterpillars on which they feed their chicks?

Birds such as great tits have evolved to time their breeding cycle so it coincides with the peak of moth caterpillars that feed on oak leaves which traditionally happens in late May and June. But as temperatures rise so oaks are coming into leaf earlier and the caterpillars have responded by hatching out earlier too.

This means that when the great tit chicks are ready to be fed the peak of caterpillars is already coming to an end. Because the parent birds need to find 1000 caterpillars every day for their hungry offspring any mismatch is likely to dramatically reduce breeding success.

The researchers found that although the birds can respond to climatic shifts they are not doing so quickly enough. Lead author Emily Simmonds estimates that the tipping point comes when oak leaves and their associated caterpillars appear 24 days earlier than usual.

The discovery that birds can and do respond to climate change by breeding earlier than normal was first made in the 1990s by Dr Humphrey Crick a scientist working at the British Trust for Ornithology. He was analysing thousands of cards from the BTO’s long-running Nest Record Scheme which had been filled in by amateur birdwatchers over the previous half-century detailing the dates when eggs are laid and chicks hatch.

Crick noticed a surprising trend: for many species the date on which they laid their eggs had moved forward by an average of nine days. The resulting landmark paper “UK birds are laying eggs earlier” published in the journal Nature in 1997 provided some of the earliest empirical evidence that wild creatures were already responding to a warming climate.

A decade later in 2006 I remember Bill Oddie introducingd Springwatch with the astonishing news that every blue tit nest they were monitoring had already fledged young – several weeks earlier than usual. Because blue tits only have one brood they must respond very rapidly to changes such as earlier springs. If they fail to do so quickly enough their numbers will plummet.

At the end of his 1997 paper Humphrey Crick made this prophetic comment: “For birds earlier nesting could be beneficial if juvenile survival is enhanced by a prolonged period before winter. Conversely birds may be adversely affected if they become unsynchronised with the phenology of their food supplies.”

View image in fullscreen A longer breeding season benefits birds such as the robin which produce two or more broods. Photograph: incamerastock/Alamy

Less than a quarter of a century later both parts of that prediction appear to be coming true. In the short term a longer breeding season has benefits especially fr birds such as the robin blackbird and song thrush which produce two or more broods of young. Starting to nest earlier in the year might allow them to squeeze in an extra brood and so produce more offspring in total.

Professor James Pearce-Higgins the BTO’s director of science points out that our smallest birds such as goldcrests wrens and long-tailed tits are benefiting from another aspect of climate change: the much milder winters of recent years.

He also points to the positive impact of our habit of feeding garden birds which helps species such as blue tits great tits and goldfinches. At present he suggests that the advantages of higher winter survival rates outweigh the failure to synchronise with the spring food supply though that may not always be so.

Another climate-driven success is the way many species are now expanding northwards. The latest European Breeding Bird Atlas reveals that on average the ranges of Europe’s breeding birds have shifted north by 28km (17.5 miles) since the original survey was done in the late 1980s – almost 1km every year.

This may not sound like much but over time it will allow species once confined to continental Europe to cross the Channel and colonise the UK. Indeed given that some species respond much faster than others several (including cattle egrets and great white egrets) have already done so.

But as our climate becomes less predictable with more extreme weather events such as storms droughts and floods what scientists have called the “honeymoon period” will come to an abrupt end.

As Professor Pearce-Higgins notes ground-feeding birds may not be able to cope with prolonged summer droughts which make it harder for them to find food: “One potential exception to this positive picture of warmer temperatures is thrushes and blackbirds which rely on soil invertebrates. We know from a study we have run recently asking schoolchildren to count earthworms in school playing fields that the availability of worms – a major food source for many species – declines significantly in summer particularly when it is dry.”

So as we stand on the precipice of a runaway warming world the future for many of our best-known and best-loved birds remains in the balance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzc2VtYmx5bWFnLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy85NjA2OC1leC1lbXBsb3llZS1kcml2ZXMtbGFyZ2UtbG9hZGVyLW9udG8tbWVyY2VkZXMtYmVuei1wbGFudC1wcm9wZXJ0edIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ex-Employee Drives Large Loader Onto Mercedes-Benz Plant Property,"VITORIA Spain—A disgruntled former employee of a Mercedes-Benz plant here reportedly stole a Caterpillar front-end loader from a construction site on New Year's Eve drove it to the plant and rammed through the property gate before destroying nearly 70 vehicles. Police claim the 38-year-old man was trying to get inside the assembly line area where he could have caused far more damage.

Luckily the only employees at the plant were part of the maintenance and security teams and production wasn't underway. Had he broken into the plant itself he could have damaged just-assembled Mercedes-Benz V-Class vans.

The man briefly worked for the plant several years ago and apparently he didn't end his tenure on good terms. Initial damage estimates are at $6 million.

According to one police report: ""During the journey between the two sites he caused other damage” apparently in part to other Mercedes products. “Police arrived at the scene of the damage to find the man at the wheel of the [Caterpillar] smashing into the parked vehicles. He was held on suspicion of causing criminal damage.""

rick@greenepublishing.com

Teaching has always been a challenging profession even in the best of times. It takes a special gift to be able to effectively transfer knowledge from one person to another younger person. In recent months those challenges have become even greater. With many teachers having to alter some of their methods to a combination of in-person and virtual teaching greater creativity has become more of a necessity. Often that greater creativity comes with a price tag. With increasingly tight school budgets teachers frequently need help. That is where the national program ""DonorsChoose"" steps in to help.

It all began with a history teacher from Bronx N.Y. named Charles Best who wanted his students to read the classic ""Little House on the Prairie."" As he was making copies of one book he was able to procure he began to think to himself just how often teachers use money out of their own pockets for classroom materials. He began to wonder to himself how many people would be willing to donate if they could see the projects and just where the money was going. He sketched out a website and shared the information with his colleagues. Right off the bat 11 projects were funded and the program took off from there. Now DonorsChoose is available nationwide to every school. Today 85 percent of public schools in America have posted a project on the DonorsChoose website. In total nearly two million projects have been supported by 4682430 supporters. Both those numbers continue to grow. DonorsChoose has received the highest ratings from Charity Watch Charity Navigator and Guidestar. Some of their corporate sponsors include: Chevron the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation the Dicks Sporting Goods Foundation Verizon Volkswagen General Motors the Charles Schwab Foundation 3M Kleenex Sonic and many others. Many of these corporate sponsors will match donations on certain projects making each donation have an even greater impact.

Locally approximately 24 projects have been funded through DonorsChoose. Some of these projects have included televisions in the Madison County High School weight room health and safety products such as face shields and hand sanitizers lap desks classroom supplies books and much more. Local teacher Leslie McLeod had one of her virtual learning projects featured on WCTV television. ""It's great I love it"" said McLeod of DonorsChoose. Madison County Central School (MCCS) teacher Jamie Andrews has been designated a DonorsChoose Ambassador meaning she assists teachers in developing their projects helps in finding potential funding sources etc.

Currently there are nine Madison County projects online. These include projects for MCCS Pinetta Elementary School Lee Elementary School and James Madison Preparatory High School. To find current local projects for Madison County schools visit the DonorsChoose website at https://www.donorschoose.org/donors/search.html and type Madison County in the search window. All donations are tax deductible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2Vlay5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvOTU3NDc4L3NhYmJhdGljYWxzLWFyZS1uZXctY29ycG9yYXRlLXBlcmvSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sabbaticals are a new corporate perk,"Here are three recent top pieces of financial insight gathered from around the web:

Sabbaticals are a new corporate perk

Citigroup is the latest big company to recognize that workers need an improvement in work-life balance said Elisa Martinuzzi at Bloomberg. The Wall Street bank announced last week it will begin offering three-month sabbaticals (at 25 percent pay) to staff with at least five years of service. Citigroup also promises ""a month of fully paid leave to anyone who wants to work pro bono for a charity."" So far sabbaticals are still not common. Many companies have feared that allowing workers extended time off would leave them with one foot out the door. But ""high performers are a flight risk with or without a sabbatical"" and their loyalty could ""strengthen after a company-endorsed three-month trek around the world.""

Illegal overdraft fees at Chase

Regulators have let banks get away with illegal overdraft fees with little publicity or penalty said Patrick Rucker at ProPublica​. Since 2017 the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has ""found at least six banks wrongly charged overdrafts and related fees"" but in each case the agency ""issued a quiet reprimand"" rather than penalization. The latest example was JPMorgan Chase which charged overdraft fees to roughly 170000 customers last year due to a software glitch. The customers had chosen to opt in to ""overdraft protection"" that promised ""they would get an alert before their accounts went negative."" But a ""coding hiccup"" meant those alerts didn't happen leaving customers in the dark. ""Chase charges $34 for an overdraft and allows three such charges a day on an account with insufficient funds."" Chase promised to repay its customers and the OCC's supervisory letter stayed largely out of public view.

Buying fractional shares in ETFs

More investors are buying fractional shares as a way to diversify risk said Julia Carpenter at The Wall Street Journal. Brokerages like Robinhood Charles Schwab and Fidelity advertised the option to purchase fractions of a stock ""as an easy way for small investors to buy a piece of Tesla or Apple."" But a growing number of investors are using the feature to ""slowly accumulate exchange-traded funds that give them a small piece of the broader market."" Online investment platform SoFi estimates ""about one-quarter of its clients' fractional buys are ETFs"" such as the Invesco QQQ Trust a fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100 index and costs about $300 per share.

No suit for the development manager of EFG/Saber Heritage SC of Armonk just work boots jeans open-collar shirt and a very warm jacket.

Berger took time out from his busy schedule to afford the Business Journal a personal tour of the massive $300 million-plus development that Saber Real Estate North LLC and EnviroFinance Group LLC are in the midst of creating on the grounds of the former Hudson River State Hospital in the town of Poughkeepsie.

Berger and company are turning the neglected 156-acre property ”“ long a scavenger”™s delight and a veritable eyesore visible for miles ”“ into an intergenerational live-work-play community called Hudson Heritage that will eventually include:

750 residential units;

350000 square feet of commercial and retail space;

assisted living housing;

a 150-room hotel and conference center;

40000 square feet of urgent and primary care medical facility/office space; ”¢ a 24700-square-foot education/performing arts center;

walking trails; and

more than 60 acres of open parkland and access to a planned 2.7-mile rail trail for walking and biking.

Berger said what initially drew him to the site was demographics ”“ the growth of adjacent Marist College the Culinary Institute of America and Nuvance Health which includes Vassar Brothers Medical Center just to the south.

“So you have 40000 high paying quality prevailing wage union wage jobs within a mile and a half. And you have such a need for multifamily housing hotel retail restaurants and a supermarket” he said.

THE LURE

“So what attracted us was first and foremost the demand generators in the immediate corridor combined with the lack of services. We love to do these live-work-play centers. We”™ve found if you can offer somebody the opportunity to live work and play on one site you get higher rents higher values. You create synergies so there”™s a purpose. We”™re seeing multifamily (developers) want to be here because we have the amenities the retail space hotel.”

Saber has been involved in a number of developments in the New York region including The Duet a luxury rental complex under construction at Hale and Maple Avenues in White Plains; Rivertowns Square an open-air village with dining and shopping in Dobbs Ferry; and The River Club luxury apartments and retail in Bogota New Jersey.

A similar but smaller live-work-play campus 60-acre Eastdale Village on Route 44 in the town of Poughkeepsie recently began its next construction phase for four retail tenants. Eastdale Village which is planned to have 400 residential units is being built by Kirchhoff Cos.

Berger said Marist College gets about 68000 visitors a year with 24000 inquiring as to where they can stay nearby. So a hotel was a natural for the property he said and it could be branded by Marist with its Red Fox logo. In addition they wanted a “Main Street retail” component.

So in the overall plans Berger said there will be 350000 square feet of commercial including a nearly finished 65000-square-foot ShopRite that intends to open early next year with plans to hire 200 workers.

Several other businesses signing leases are:

Chipotle Mexican Grill  2300 square feet. The chain has roots in the Hudson Valley as founder Steve Ellis is an alumnus of the Culinary Institute of America.

 2300 square feet. The chain has roots in the Hudson Valley as founder Steve Ellis is an alumnus of the Culinary Institute of America. CVS Pharmacy  14866 square feet.

 14866 square feet. Starbucks 2100 square feet.

2100 square feet. Burger King  2570 square feet.

 2570 square feet. Smoothie King 1345 square feet.

Several other tenants have also signed letters of intent to open at Hudson Heritage. Charter Realty & Development of Westport Connecticut is handling commercial leasing.

FROM OLD THE NEW

Berger proudly spoke of the project as he drove through the property from Route 9 to the back by the east gate where on the other side sits Our Lady of the Rosary Chapel which was once part of the psychiatric center until St. Peter”™s Church bought it in 1999 and restored it.

Restoration and adaptive reuse were also on the mind of Berger as he stopped next to the “Kirkbride” administrative building which commands a majestic view of the Great Lawn ”“ designed by the renowned Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux ”“ and the Hudson Valley beyond.

The High Victorian Gothic building was designed by Vaux Withers & Co. when the psychiatric center opened in 1871. Workers were placing new trusses on the roof of the “Kirkbride” which had 360 of its windows replaced.

The Kirkbride and five other buildings ”“ including the 7500-square-foot director”™s house ”“ will be preserved which Berger suggested could be used by a law firm or doctors.

Berger said he found inspiration in the old buildings and the ones that had to be torn down. So much so that “We”™ve taken brick from the demolished buildings and reusing them in the pylons and monuments throughout the site. We”™ve taken windows out of the old buildings and stained glass and using them in some of the retail buildings. Some of the grates and gates and ornamental metal etc.”

Berger said “We”™re going to reuse and rebuild the old greenhouses. It will be an amenity for residents who want to plant vegetables and so forth.”

Saying “it”™s a shame some of these buildings are coming down” and that already the crews have “taken down about half million square feet of buildings” Berger is quick to point out that all but the steel ands tons of asbestos and lead that was shipped offsite has been reutilized.

“Everything else gets processed. So all the material that we”™ve used ”“ rather than bring in 5000 6000 7000 truckloads of material ”“ we”™ve used everything on site.”

In what will be the parking lot for the ShopRite one worker operating a front loader outfitted with a giant magnet on it removed bits of metal from the broken brick and concrete. Another front loader pushed the material onto a conveyor belt that sent it through two crushers. The end material becomes clean fill or stone for road beds with the crushed brick used for liner for laying underground pipes.

LOOK AHEAD

Berger characterized Hudson Heritage as his hardest project.

“We”™re the master developer. We”™re doing all the infrastructure and we”™re building the shopping center (for) $80 million” he said.

“This is really eight or nine or ten projects at once. You have to think about it typically one company does the commercial and then another company will undertake restoration and then another company (will) build a hotel another multifamily.”

Construction is expected to take three to six years. Once finished Hudson Heritage will create 750 permanent jobs and generate $8 million in annual property taxes including $2 million to the town.

“So we”™re fairly far along. About 65 to 70 percent pre-leased. ”¦Out of the 750 residential about 600 plus under letter of intent or contract. We”™re up in the air on the hotel and we”™re up in the air on the administration building” he said.

“I can”™t tell you who but we”™re going to contract with a developer who is going to build 360 units they plan to restore and reuse the church chapel library and one other building.”

The tour ends with a smile.

“When we”™re all done it”™ll be spectacular.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Following up our “Top 5 Youth Helmets” Let’s look at our top 5 varsity/adult football helmets on the market!

Before we get into the list there are a few important points. For starters no helmet can or will ever be 100% concussion-proof; when you walk on the football field there is always a risk involved. Next there are a number of factors to consider: weight fit comfort and to many aesthetics.

5. Schutt Vengeance Z10 LTD | $499 SchuttSports.com

Schutt has worked to cut weight as much as possible while still being as protective as possible. In recent years they’ve introduced the Helmet Stabilization System (HSS) lighter models and they continue to use their TPU design. Alvin Kamara wears a Schutt Vengeance Z10 LTD

Pros – The Z10 is light with a large variety of facemask options alongside Schutt’s HSS and their TPU padding technology. It also received 5-Stars in the Virginia Tech helmet study.

Cons – The Z10 LTD is used in relatively small numbers at the NFL level; mostly on defensive backs. It also has received conflicting test results; an impressive 5-Stars from Virginia Tech but a lower rating with the NFL’s helmet study.

Final Thoughts– The Vengeance Z10 LTD is a very impressive comfortable lightweight helmet that I would look into using if you’re at a skills position or favor a lighter piece of equipment.

Get the Schutt Vengeance Z10 LTD for $499 SchuttSports.com.

4. Xenith Shadow XR | $549 Xenith.com

From the very beginning of its existence Xenith has been making some of the more unique and scientifically driven helmets on the market. Their newest helmet the Shadow XR continues that trend. Nick Chubb wears a Xenith Shadow XR

Pros – Xenith’s bonnet system has consistently tested towards the very top of every major test since their inception. The XR variation of the Shadow uses new shock absorbers by RHEON that help it perform even better. The Shadow XR has a relatively small shell with a number of very large air vents helping the player’s head breathe during play. Their unique chinstrap system wraps around the head creating a consistent ‘custom’ fit on the fly.

Cons – Every Xenith helmet has been criticized rather heavily for its looks; quite frankly the general consensus is that they’re hideous. Customization options are rather limited; you have a rather small selection of facemasks and chinstraps to choose from.

Finals Thoughts – Xenith’s primary focus has always been to combat rotational forces with their bonnet system. If you’re not put off by the aesthetics of the helmet I would very highly recommend looking into Xenith’s technology.

The most popular and sought after helmet at every level of football the SpeedFlex which launched in 2014 packs every piece of innovation that Riddell offers into its sleek structure. Strap-Loc’s lock the top strap to the helmet the 4-point quick release facemask system helps medical staffs remove it in case of an emergency while the Ratchet-Loc and more recently the Cam-Loc systems have completely revolutionized how chinstraps are connected. Tua Tagovailoa wears a Riddell SpeedFlex

Pros – The SpeedFlex is incredibly popular and packed with technology.

Cons – The SpeedFlex is a large heavy helmet that may not be for smaller players. Customization options can be a bit limited; some of the more preferred facemask options can be a hassle to get your hands on and if you prefer the classic buckle chinstrap you’ll have to look outside of Riddell for good chinstrap options. Visors are a very popular helmet accessory but they’re typically a nightmare to put on the SpeedFlex due to its unique shape; newer models of visors are starting to combat this issue though.

Final Thoughts – When you think of helmets in 2020 your first thought is likely the SpeedFlex. Do some shopping to make sure it’s the right one for your position and body type but I’d be rather comfortable using it in-game.

Get the Speedflex for $410-$500 SportsUnlimited.com.

The fascinating plates along the top and back of the shell are likely the first thing to catch your eye; these are part of an impact system called the Tektonic Plate 3DM System. These plates move independently of the shell on impact absorbing energy. Schutt’s constant innovation has culminated in an impressive helmet the F7 VTD. The F7 VTD is worn by players like Jarvis Landry Kenyan Drake Mark Ingram and James Robinson.

Pros – The F7 utilizes the Helmet Stabilization System (HSS) jaw pads that help lock the player’s head into the helmet. The Tektonic Plate system and Schutt’s tried-and-true TPU padding are packed into the F7 VTD.

Cons – The F7 VTD is the most expensive helmet on this list sitting at $700 as of January 2021 (cheaper non-custom on Amazon). There are other models of F7 that can be found at a lower price but I personally favor the VTD model.

Finals Thoughts – The F7 is one of the fastest growing helmets at the NFL level and it’s easy to see why. If the price tag isn’t a concern the F7 could be a perfect option for you.

Get the Schutt F7 VTD for $385 Amazon.com / $700 SchuttSports.com (Custom).

1. Riddell SpeedFlex Diamond | $499 Riddell.com

Riddell teamed up with 3D printing company Carbon to produce 3D printed padding for their custom helmets in tandem with Riddell’s Precision-Fit technology. In 2020 they released a retail version of it but this one is available to the public without the eye-popping price tag and the need to be scanned for your own model. Tyler Lockett wears a Riddell SpeedFlex Precision Diamond the custom fit version of the Riddell SpeedFlex Diamond

Pros – The SpeedFlex Diamond offers Riddell’s latest technology that used to be exclusive to the pros. Carbon’s Diamond technology has tested incredibly well during its very short lifetime; all the perks of the original SpeedFlex with even further improved technology!

Cons – The SpeedFlex Diamond is heavy heavy heavy. Coming in at 5 pounds or more the Diamond is undoubtedly the heaviest helmet on this list.

Finals Thoughts – Maybe not for smaller players. If you know exactly what you’re buying the SpeedFlex Diamond will be a great choice for you! The Riddell SpeedFlex Diamond with a clear shell showing the 3D printed padding

There’s our top 5 but we’re not done yet! It was hard to narrow the list down to just 5 helmets so I’ve got two Honorable Mentions I’m going to briefly highlight.

Honorable Mentions

The Speed was basically a coin-flip for the fifth spot on our list. The primary reason the Vengeance Z10 LTD was chosen over the Speed was age. The Speed continues to test well in every major study and is still popular at all levels but it’s over 10 years old at this point. An older helmet does not equal a bad helmet by any means but the newer helmet received the #5 spot.

VICIS ZERO1 | Unavailable

The VICIS ZERO1 worn by Pat Mahomes and Russell Wilson topped every study it was entered into and was heavily funded by the NFL and players that invested in the company but nonetheless the company experienced some financial issues and declared bankruptcy in 2019. Reformed under new ownership and developing a new helmet VICIS should be worth keeping an eye on. The ZERO1 itself bolstered an astronomical price tag and coupled with an uncertainty of its obtainability (currently unavailable on the web) and future it missed our top 5. If you can get your hands on one you’d be very happy wearing it.

Middle Tennessee authorities are on the lookout for a large four-door truck possibly linked to a fire earlier this year that resulted in a significant number of Bibles being burned inside a utility trailer near Pastor Greg Locke’s church.

Surveillance footage provided by the Wilson County Sheriff’s Office shows a truck believed to be white or of a similar light color fleeing the area around the time of the fire The Tennessean reported.

The incident occurred in front of the Global Vision Bible Church on Easter Sunday according to the Wilson County Sheriff’s Office. Police responded to the scene at about 6:30 a.m. prior to the day’s church service. No arrests have been made in connection with the case.

Pastor Locke addressed the congregation regarding the incident during Global Vision’s Easter service estimating that about 200 Bibles were destroyed. No injuries were reported and the Easter service proceeded as planned.

Authorities are treating the fire as an intentional act and are continuing their investigation.

Global Vision Bible Church has previously organized burning events involving materials deemed connected to witchcraft and the occult the Tennessean said. Locke however asserted his belief that the fire targeting the Bibles was directed specifically at the church.

Cash rewards are being considered for any information leading to the apprehension of those responsible for the incident according to officials.

During the Easter Sunday service Locke condemned the burning of the Bibles as evidence of Christianity being “under attack” in the United States.

“If you think Christianity is not under attack more than ever before in the United States of America you’ve not been paying attention. You need to get your head out of the sand. Quit being lukewarm” Locke declared. “I’m telling you they are attacking churches in America. Can I remind you for Evangelical believers and for Catholics for that matter this is the most important day historically and biblically that you can imagine? And now Joe Biden makes it Trans Visibility Awareness Day.”

In a statement posted on Facebook at the time Locke said a witness saw a man dropping off the trailer of Bibles near his church and setting it ablaze.

“Happy Resurrection Sunday. This morning at 6:00AM our security cameras caught a man dropping off a trailer in the middle of the intersection and blocking the road into our church. He then got out and set fire to an entire trailer full of Bibles right in front of our church” Locke wrote. “There was a lady that had driven through the night to get to our church and she was in the parking lot and was able to get the police officers here quickly but it was quite the scene to wake up to on my first morning back from Israel. Had to block traffic in all directions but they are almost finished cleaning it up. It's going to be a great day in the Lord.”

Authorities are urging anyone with pertinent information to come forward as the investigation into this event continues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjEwMTFub3cuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDQvc291dGhlYXN0LWxpbmNvbG4tY2h1cmNoLXN1c3RhaW5zLTE1LW1pbGxpb24tZGFtYWdlLWZpcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southeast Lincoln church sustains $1.5 million in damage from fire,"LINCOLN Neb. (KOLN) - Lincoln Fire and Rescue responded to a fire at New Covenant Community Church on Saturday.

According to LFR a call for smoke showing from the church came in just before 3 a.m. When crews arrived they reported fire into the roof.

LFR said a lightning strike is suspected but not confirmed to be the cause of the fire.

Opinion contributor

This year has been challenging for so many of us. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have reached into virtually every facet of our lives – home work family school and most importantly health and wellness.

At the onset of the pandemic we knew Great Parks of Hamilton County would have a significant role in helping our community cope with immediate and long-term impacts. With businesses shuttered and families quarantined we understood our mission: make Great Parks of Hamilton County as accessible and safe as possible to all county residents.

Beginning in March our dedicated and professional staff remained focused on providing excellent service during an exceptionally difficult time. We temporarily eliminated the motor vehicle permit and quickly provided safe and accessible virtual resources for education. In a time of crisis such as what we faced and still face we need our parks.

With few options for safe refuge from COVID-19 city and county residents flooded our 21 parks and preserves over 17733 acres of land and 78 miles of trails repeatedly during 2020. As of December park visitation is up 17% and trail usage has increased an astounding 63% from 2019. That’s over 700000 additional trail users and nearly five million people who visited a Great Park facility this year.

However Great Parks was not immune to the financial impacts of COVID-19. While usage of the parks increased earned revenues declined significantly and new expenses emerged due to federal and state-mandated operating regulations. At a time when we were meeting the pandemic-influenced demands to serve more people we were bringing in substantially less revenue.

Great Parks made a $4.7 million cut to the 2020 budget to ensure we remained fiscally responsible while attending to the community. Being good stewards of your tax dollars is critical to our mission and has earned numerous accolades from the Ohio Auditor for properly managing taxpayer dollars.

Over the summer we explored the feasibility of placing a levy before voters. This was due to the documented need for critical infrastructure funding to support the master plan priorities as determined by residents and to offset the financial strains placed on the parks due to COVID-19. Despite the needs the public reaction was clear – this was not the year to make a financial ask of the residents of Hamilton County. We listened to our community and chose not to move forward with a levy in 2020.

Nonetheless our fiscal reality has not changed. More importantly Great Parks and park districts in general have been excluded from all federal and state funding related to COVID-19. For these reasons it is very likely there will be a financial ask of the voters in 2021.

To ensure the ask properly reflects what the people of Hamilton County want from their Great Parks we will be providing opportunities for public input and feedback while also clearly presenting the plans for their Great Parks with an organized process beginning in January. We want residents to be fully informed about their Great Parks and to have a clear understanding of our master plan and vision for the future. These are their parks and it is ultimately up to them to decide.

As we look back upon 2020 I hope residents will remember this: Great Parks of Hamilton County is here for everyone. From mental wellness and physical fitness to family outings and quiet escapes we are here for our residents. We have always been here. We are here now and we will be here for generations to come.

Todd Palmeter is chief executive officer of Great Parks of Hamilton County.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEvMy8yMjIxMTczMi9jaW5jaW5uYXRpLXJlZHMtc2hvcnRzdG9wLWRpZGktZ3JlZ29yaXVzLWZyYW5jaXNjby1saW5kb3Itc2VhZ2Vy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The robust MLB shortstop market is suppressing the robust MLB shortstop market,"General optimism about the future and ‘the promise of tomorrow’ is an overarching theme in every sport with every team. It’s especially important with clubs that haven’t had a lot of recent success which is an independent clause that I’m sure will resonate with fans of a certain baseball club about whom this blog spends most of its time a-blogging.

Every new manager opens a window of optimism. Every signing every trade every draft pick opens one an ambitious future beacon on whom we can structure our hopes for sports ascension even if we subliminally know the odds of it ever turning out brilliant are the longest of long.

All 30 franchises create these dream scenarios on the same plane and there’s only one World Series per year after all.

Anyway it’s that premise that brings me to the shortstop market a market that the Cincinnati Reds are trying to navigate to the best of their ability during financial times that aren’t exactly the rosiest. With Freddy Galvis a free agent and Jose Garcia slated for a bit more minor league seasoning the Reds are in the position of needing an outside addition at a position of major importance if they’re to have any legitimate shot of making waves in the National League this year.

Fortunately for them there are numerous solid options in free agency at the moment. There’s Andrelton Simmons and his platinum glove Marcus Semien a full year removed from an MVP-caliber campaign and former Red Didi Gregorius back and healthy after a successful ‘show me’ campaign with Philadelphia. All very good players with several more in-prime years left on their legs all deserving of multi-year deals and good chunks of money based on everything we’ve ever known about the business of baseball.

Here’s the conundrum though. For the Reds and every other team out there looking for a shortstop addition there’s the allure of the future at play. If you’re a team in need of a 6 with intentions of competing in 2021 adding any of the three names above is clearly in your wheelhouse. In almost every scenario they deserve multi-year guarantees even if knocks and less-than-stellar 2020 production are on their ledger. But in doing so and committing to anything beyond just 2021 every team almost immediately takes themselves out of the market for a shortstop during the 2021-2022 offseason.

Francisco Lindor will be a free agent in that offseason. So too will the likes of Carlos Correa Trevor Story Javier Baez and Corey Seager. The depth of that level of available talent at perhaps the most important position on the diamond is set to be staggering especially with the financial issues currently at play doing their part to eliminate any chance of extensions big enough to take them off the market before they reach free agency.

So the question for front offices and owners across the game becomes this - is it really worth pursuing any of Simmons or Gregorius or Semien right now if it takes you out of the running for the others? If you’re in need of a legitimate upgrade at such a vital position and the chance to land one of the second group is this close is it really worth spending what it should take to land one of the first group?

For some clubs it’ll still be worth the risk. The promise of a future with fans back in stands at some point will let the pressure on current revenue streams dissipate in next-year models. Some clubs might even have some versatility baked into their roster with openings at 2B or 3B in the next year accommodating the chance to sign two of the overall group.

But let’s be real here for a second - ownership groups league-wide aren’t exactly enthralled with spending money at all at the moment let alone money they don’t think is perfectly earmarked. It sucks from a player perspective to see so many worthy players who in other years would’ve been making life-altering money stuck waiting to see which billionaire will blink first.

For Simmons that could mean his recent injury history becomes his tagline this winter when we don’t hear of any long-term offers sent his way. For Semien it might be the 7 out of 8 years of his career he’s posted an OPS+ less than 100 with his brilliant 2019 scoffed at as an outlier. For Didi it may well be his statcast peripherals the weak contact suggesting he’s not the ideal fit as the way we evaluate the modern offensive game evolves. All pertinent points but not the kind of news in any vacuum-winter that would keep long-term deals being sent their way.

The wealth of options the wealth of future options and the larger revenue issues is likely going to make this position group more so than others the most suppressed this winter I fear.

From the perspective of the Reds pocketbooks that might end up an ideal scenario. There’s a very real chance that they’ll be able to end up with one of Gregorius Semien or Simmons on a deal that’s only a 1-year guarantee. The Reds pocketbooks won’t be on the hook for any bank-breaking money they’ll get an upgrade for 2021 and not price themselves out of making an even bigger splash again this time a year from now.

For those who will deftly note that there’s still a trade market this winter that could land the Reds or anyone else one of the prized shortstops who are a year removed from free agency that’s undeniably true. We know Cleveland would love to land half a farm system for Lindor before he walks. But for teams like the Reds potential acquiring teams it’s becoming clearer by the day that they’d much rather hold that farm system find a solid stop-gap option for a year and then chase the big fish next year. Thanks to the league-wide lack of spending they’re lucking into the precise ability to do just that.

(Though I do suppose it’s hard to truly call it ‘lucking into’ when they’re the market-makers themselves.)",,,,,,,,,

At a Glance A low-pressure system will track from the Great Lakes to New England through Saturday.

This storm will spread a wintry mess of snow and ice.

The snow and ice could contribute to travel problems in some areas. A New Year's storm spread snow and ice from Texas into the interior Northeast around New Year's Day causing hundreds of accidents from Missouri to Illinois.

The low pressure system named Winter Storm John by The Weather Channel took an unusual path from deep South Texas almost due northward through Texas and Oklahoma before taking a right and pushing across the southern Great Lakes and eventually through New England.

The storm started in Texas's Big Bend Region where it dumped up to two feet of snow near Alpine Texas on Dec. 30 2020.

Parts of western Texas picked up over 8 inches of snow. Big Spring about 35 miles east-northeast of Midland reported 14 inches of snow. Up to 2 feet of snow was reported in parts of Big Bend National Park. Snow drifts up to 20 inches were reported in Cisco about 45 miles east of Abilene.

Freezing rain was this storm's legacy in the Central U.S.

Ice accumulation was reported across several states from Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas to Michigan to Pennsylvania over the New Year's holiday making roads slippery and downing trees and branches.

A 38-year-old man was killed near St. Louis in the first couple of hours of 2021 when he jumped out of his crashed vehicle to warn other drivers of the icy roads but was then struck by another driver and fell from an overpass.

Advertisement In Kansas City hundreds of accidents were reported by state highway patrols including seven injuries.

Up to one-half inch ice accumulation was reported in Farmington Illinois and Seven Springs Pennsylvania. Accretions as high as 0.75 inches were reported in Missouri.

Over 100000 power outages were reported from Texas to Pennsylvania on New Years Day according to poweroutage.us.

Wichita Kansas picked up 6.5 inches of snow on Jan. 1 their heaviest calendar-day snowfall since Feb. 4 2014.

After an evening of freezing rain precipitation changed to heavy wet snow in Oklahoma by Friday morning. Snow fell at the rate of 2 inches per hour in Oklahoma City before sunrise Friday according to the National Weather Service. Will Rogers World Airport reported 5.1 inches of snow. Only the 2009-10 season (14 inches) has started out snowier in the Sooner State capital city than 2020-21.

The storm also produced a tornado in Central Georgia on New Years Day embedded in the storm's trailing cold front.

The winter storm moved eastward out of New England on Jan. 2 after dropping 6-12 inches of snow from northern New York to central Maine.

Do not read on unless you have watched season eight episodes one and two.

It’s hard to fathom that in just four weeks Spiral will be gone from our screens for good. Fifteen years an eight-season run and international acclaim is a good outcome for a French drama. It’s kept a high standard throughout with its signature blend of cerebral procedural and high-octane cops and robbers. Laure Berthaud and her crew of roughnecks will be missed – especially BTL on this blog.

The laundromat murder

The fallout from l’affaire Gilou continues to rain down on our heroes. Three months of criminal chump change have left the gang frustrated and forlorn. What better way to get back in the game than to take on a messy murder guaranteed to make them even less popular? When a dead kid shows up in a tumble dryer Laure is all over that action like caramelised onion on a croissant.

The unfortunate youth known nominally as Shkun was part of a loose collective of undocumented minors from Morocco living in squats and running wild in the 18th arrondissement. Early suspect Souleymane spends his days mugging tourists and his nights bombed on benzos. He is not above violence against his friends either as the assault on Shkun reveals. However when his laser-tag alibi exonerates him of murder we are forced to look elsewhere for the culprit.

The white van that spirits Souleymane away suggests exploitation by organised crime. Bigger players seem certain to enter the fray.

Gilou

That perennial survivor Escoffier is already making a big impression in prison. Turning down the protective custody offered to incarcerated flics he settles down into gen pop targeting le grand fromage of the wing Cisco. A summary beatdown followed by a high-risk bait-and-switch on Cisco’s phone leads to an intense steak-and-chill session in the Romanian’s cell. Cisco is quietly impressed that Gilou never ratted out his colleagues. Gilou is quietly impressed with the tender yet flavourful rump he is presented with. Lovers of bromance will be disappointed however as Gilou is working an angle – getting close to Cisco to try and pin a revenge murder on him. Brémont hints that when Cisco gets out in two days Gilou may be exiting with him to pull off the sting. Two career criminals back on the street – the French justice system continues to perplex.

Laure

We’ve seen Laure’s abandonment issues surface before and with Tintin gone Gilou in prison and Roban replaced with a younger and altogether less friendly model the very last thing she needs is Ali agitating to leave and head up his own crew. Like Tintin before him Ali despairs at the secrets-and-lies culture Laure perpetuates. Whether or not her (literally) phoned-in apology will get him back on board remains to be seen. When she tries to bond with new face Judge Lucie Bourdieu she immediately rubs her up the wrong way. That’s Laure for you – making enemies in high places wherever she goes.

Joséphine

If the early indications were that domesticity with Lola had blunted Joséphine’s edges we are quickly disabused of that notion once she catches a glimpse of herself in the smart feral Souleymane. She can still sniff a procedural infraction from 500 yards and with a flourish of her gown she gets the youngster out of custody and into child protection. The same old Joséphine then? Not quite. The trauma of the last two seasons has left its mark – she now specialises in rape cases presumably advocating for the victims. France’s serial killers and terrorists will now have to look elsewhere for their sturdy defence.

Sabbaticals are a new corporate perk

Citigroup is the latest big company to recognize that workers need an improvement in work-life balance said Elisa Martinuzzi at Bloomberg. The Wall Street bank announced last week it will begin offering three-month sabbaticals (at 25 percent pay) to staff with at least five years of service. Citigroup also promises ""a month of fully paid leave to anyone who wants to work pro bono for a charity."" So far sabbaticals are still not common. Many companies have feared that allowing workers extended time off would leave them with one foot out the door. But ""high performers are a flight risk with or without a sabbatical"" and their loyalty could ""strengthen after a company-endorsed three-month trek around the world.""

Illegal overdraft fees at Chase

Regulators have let banks get away with illegal overdraft fees with little publicity or penalty said Patrick Rucker at ProPublica​. Since 2017 the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has ""found at least six banks wrongly charged overdrafts and related fees"" but in each case the agency ""issued a quiet reprimand"" rather than penalization. The latest example was JPMorgan Chase which charged overdraft fees to roughly 170000 customers last year due to a software glitch. The customers had chosen to opt in to ""overdraft protection"" that promised ""they would get an alert before their accounts went negative."" But a ""coding hiccup"" meant those alerts didn't happen leaving customers in the dark. ""Chase charges $34 for an overdraft and allows three such charges a day on an account with insufficient funds."" Chase promised to repay its customers and the OCC's supervisory letter stayed largely out of public view.

Buying fractional shares in ETFs

More investors are buying fractional shares as a way to diversify risk said Julia Carpenter at The Wall Street Journal. Brokerages like Robinhood Charles Schwab and Fidelity advertised the option to purchase fractions of a stock ""as an easy way for small investors to buy a piece of Tesla or Apple."" But a growing number of investors are using the feature to ""slowly accumulate exchange-traded funds that give them a small piece of the broader market."" Online investment platform SoFi estimates ""about one-quarter of its clients' fractional buys are ETFs"" such as the Invesco QQQ Trust a fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100 index and costs about $300 per share.

Investor confidence of doing business in the Ugandan economy today has remained low one year after the general election an economist has said.

Ms Sarah Arapta Wojega the managing director Citibank said domestically the election was largely perceived to be peaceful but business confidence took a huge beating in 2016.



“Business confidence saw one it its lowest points in the recent past. Our GDP growth declined to 4.9 per cent against the target of 4.5 per cent. Under pressure from banks some business lobby teamed up and approached government for a bailout. The banking sector saw an unprecedented non-performing loans rate of 8.3 per cent the highest in banking sector industry in the recent past” she said.

She added: “All these events had a huge effect on our economic growth and had effect on the decline of the economic growth.”

Ms Arapta was speaking to Citibank clients who gathered to listen to Dr David Cowan a Citi Research Africa Economist at Citigroup Global Markets Limited.

“While loss of business confidence was understandable in the run-up to and immediately after the February 2016 elections the fact that it has remained under pressure throughout much of last year is perhaps more difficult to explain” Dr Cowan said.

Also addressing top company executives at Kampala Serena Hotel yesterday he said the low confidence is due to many reasons both political and economic factors.

He said the concerns over government fiscal policy particularly the high recurrent expenditure and increased domestic borrowing have spilled over into the Uganda Shilling causing it to weaken further.

During her visit to Uganda International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde warned Uganda on debt accumulation.

Ms Lagarde who held bilateral talks with President Museveni at State House in Entebbe said there was need for Uganda to scale up its infrastructure in order to boost production that would translate into better economic growth for the country. But the pursuit of infrastructural development is also piling up the country’s debt burden raising concerns around its sustainability.

“There has to be a good balance between concessional and non-concessional loans. The second point is that macroeconomic stability is a key that is looked at by the investors and by the lenders; be it from private sector or bilateral institutions or countries” Ms Lagarde said.

In November Uganda’s credit rating was downgraded by credit rating agency Moody’s in part because of concerns on debt affordability that had been a persistent vulnerability for Uganda.

Government arrears

Mr Cowan who is in the country at the invitation of Citibank Uganda also said the slow pace of arrears clearance and the ongoing internal reconciliation exercise of government arrears has slowed down the private sector led growth with many of these companies failing to pay back bank loans thereby crippling the financial sector.

In June last year a group of companies came together to seek for a government bailout to the tune of Shs1.3 trillion owed to banks. The companies claimed some of their debts were owed by government.

Indeed the failure to manage the loans affected some banks with Crane Bank being sold off to dfcu Bank by the industry regulator.

According to Bank of Uganda (BoU) one of the reasons Crane Bank became undercapitalised in a space of a year was because of the failure by borrowers to honour their debt obligations.

In 2015 Crane Bank had a non-performing loans portfolio of Shs142 billion. They made provisions of Shs50 billion for bad and doubtful debts. The high loans eroded the minimum capital causing the central bank to take over the bank.

Shilling depreciation

In 2014 the Shilling depreciated by 10.8 per cent due to the weak commodity exports and global strengthening of the US dollar.

The global strengthening of the US dollar coupled with wide current deficit saw the Uganda Shilling depreciating by 17.5 per cent in 2015. This reflected that the Shilling was weaker compared to the previous year. At 17.5 per cent the Shilling was worst hit by other currencies in the region.

In 2016 the local unit depreciated by by 5.5 per cent.

Mr Cowan said the factor which largely explains this trend is capital flows or the funding of the current account deficit.

“In Kenya this is much more private sector driven whereas in Uganda and Tanzania official flows are more important and they have become somewhat erratic. And the fact that large flows in the market can have a much more de-stabilising impact in Uganda and Tanzania than in Kenya.",,,,,,,,,

Addressing a news conference at the launch of the sale of National Insurance Corporation (NIC) right issue shares in Kampala yesterday the chief executive officer of Crested Stocks & Securities Mr Robert H Baldwin said the importance of having a Ugandan investment bank would help in building the expertise of local citizens as well as provision of jobs internally instead of relying on investment banks from outside Uganda to do investment banking services for stock market brokers who do the technical work of corporate listing of shares or issuing corporate bonds.

He said investment banking helps companies and governments and their agents to raise money by issuing and selling securities/shares in the markets.

One outstanding importance of investment banks services is that they provide corporate finance and advisory work normally in connection with new issues of securities for raising finance take-overs merges and acquisitions.



In the current NIC right issue Crested Stocks and Securities partnered with Standard Investment Bank of Kenya to do the technical work/advise in arranging the right issue shares currently on sale.



Mr Baldwin said most of the investment banks providing technical and advisory works regarding issuing of securities in the Ugandan market are from Kenya.

Uganda currently has licensing classes as per the 2004 Financial Institution Act under which the Bank of Uganda licenses commercial banks Microfinance Depositing taking Institutions Forex Bureaus and Money Remittance.

Commercial banks’ role is more of lending funds to the general public as opposed to investment bank’s roles is which provides advisory services to companies to raise funds in the capital markets.

Commenting on the NIC’s right issue Mr Baldwin said the right issue being done by NIC will lead to increased activities and liquidity levels of the Uganda Securities exchange.

The managing director of National Insurance Corporation Mr Bayo Folayan said that through the right issue they want raise Shs8.4 billion for expansion of the company’s operations to the country side.

The sale of right issue of NIC begins today (Friday November 22nd to December 13) and shareholders have been advised to take their right issue shares in full which go for Shs26 per share.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The suit [CS 213] filed on April 24 is seeking for an injunction restricting Riham from further infringement on Coca Cola brand contents and shelving all products on the market which are purportedly considered infringements.

The injunction also seeks to stop Riham from producing products that are confusingly similar to the plaintiff’s [Coca Cola]. The row between the two companies began at the start of this year after Harris International launched a soda line manufacturing two brands including Riham Cola and Riham Fun-time with a third one [Riham Wats Up] expected later this year.

The two brands [Riham Cola Vs Coca Cola (500ml bottle)] appear to have similarities in relation to brand colours packaging content colour and names among others.

In an e-mail exchange Mr Bob Okello the Coca Cola East Africa public affairs manager told the Daily Monitor that although they had alerted the offender Riham had seemed undeterred.

“This is a matter of pure trademark infringement which has left us with no any other recourse but to seek court redress” Mr Okello said.

However Mr Alex Rezida the Harris International lawyer told the Daily Monitor that his client was shocked by Coca Cola’s action since negotiations concerning a number of modifications had been on-going.

According to Mr Rezida Riham’s last exchange with Coca cola was on April 24 the date on which the case was filed. He says his clients had sent Coca Cola a modified bottle with a number of changes. However they (Riham) do not understand the turn around.”

Origin

The row originates from the 500ml bottle which according to Coca Cola is confusingly similar to theirs. But in regard to the negotiations Riham had initiated a number of modifications on its 500ml bottle introducing changes in brand colour and bottle top coulour.

The bottle which the Daily Monitor has seen had been modified with its bottle top colour changed from red to chocolate brown coupled with introduction of a brownish allure in the brand colour.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL2J1c2luZXNzL2NvbW1vZGl0aWVzL3J3ZW56b3JpLXdhdGVyLXRvLWJlLWJvdHRsZWQtYnktY29jYS1jb2xhLWluLW5ldy1tZXJnZXItZGVhbC0xNTkyMzQw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rwenzori water to be bottled by Coca-Cola in new merger deal,"Kampala- Rwenzori Mineral Water will soon be bottled by Coca-Cola following an agreement between SABMiller plc and Gutsche Family Investments (GFI majority shareholders in Coca-Cola Sabco) to combine the bottling operations of their non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages businesses in Southern and East Africa.

The new bottler Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will serve 12 high-growth countries accounting for approximately 40 per cent of all Coca-Cola beverage volumes in Africa.

Rwenzori MineralWater boasts of about 65 per cent share of the bottled water market in Uganda and the anticipated operational efficiencies of this merger are likely to see the company further strengthen its market leadership position.

“A combined Coca-Cola bottling operation is further evidence of our commitment to Africa and our firm belief in the tremendous growth prospects that the continent offers” said Muhtar Kent chairman and chief executive officer The Coca-Cola Company.

“As one of the top 10 largest Coca-Cola bottling partners worldwide Coca-Cola Beverages Africa can leverage the scale resources capability and efficiency needed to accelerate Coca-Cola growth and contribute to the economic and social prosperity of African communities.”

“Soft drinks are an important element of our growth strategy. This transaction increases our exposure to the total beverage market in Africa. The opportunity is significant with favourable demographics and economic development pointing to excellent growth prospects” said Mr Alan Clark the SABMiller chief executive.

He added: “This also signifies a strengthening of our strategic relationship with The Coca-Cola Company.”

On full completion of the proposed merger shareholdings in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will be SABMiller: 57.0 per cent Gutsche Family Investments: 31.7 per cent and The Coca-Cola Company: 11.3 per cent.

OPTIMISING AFRICA'S RAPIDLY EVOLVING BEVERAGES MARKET

Africa offers significant growth potential in beverages underpinned by rising personal disposable income a fast-growing population and increasing per capita consumption.

With more than 30 bottling plants and over 14000 employees Coca-Cola Beverages Africa is poised to be the largest Coca Cola bottler on the continent with the scale complementary capabilities and resources to capture and accelerate top-line growth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL2J1c2luZXNzL3Byb3NwZXIvcHJpY2Utd2FyLWFtb25nLXNvZnQtZHJpbmtzLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJlcnMtaHVydHMtcHJvZml0cy0xNTcwOTk00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Price war among soft drinks manufacturers hurts profits,"The days of wild growth and huge profits for Uganda’s carbonated soft drink manufacturers could be over as competition pressures which have resulted in a price war continue to intensify.

This follows the entry of three new players; Riham Fizzy and Azam soda manufacturers early last year which broke the duopoly of Century Bottling Company (commonly known as Coca-Cola) and Crown Beverages (Pepsi).

Although Coca-Cola and Pepsi had underestimated the impact the new entrants (Riham Fizzy and Azam) would have on their sales they were later forced to discount their prices to appear cheaper than the competition so as to appeal to price sensitive consumers a market that was getting more competitive.

For instance the 320ml Riham plastic bottled soda products which were cheaper and convenient (then retailing at Shs1000) were quickly gaining an edge over Coca-Cola and Pepsi whose cheapest 300ml returnable glass bottled products were also selling at Shs1000.

Price cuts

Refraining from price cuts would cause sale volumes of the former duopoly to plunge even further than had been experienced given the low per capita consumption of carbonated soft drinks in Uganda which is estimated at only 23 bottles compared to Tanzania’s 35 bottles and Kenya’s 40 bottles.

Coca-Cola for instance reduced the price of its 300ml glass bottled soda from Shs1000 to Shs800 while the 350ml plastic-bottled Ka-Mini soda was cut from Shs1500 to Shs1000.

Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi cut the prices for the 500ml and one-litre plastic bottled sodas from Shs2000 to Shs1500 and from Shs3000 to Shs2500 respectively.

Not to appear as an expensive brand Riham which ignited the price war also later slashed the price for its 320ml soda brands from Shs1000 to Shs800 and from Shs1500 to Shs1200 for the 500ml sodas.

Although price cuts are an advantage of consumers who are now paying relatively lower prices for sodas it is a disadvantage to manufacturers as it affects their profitability which also in turn reduces taxes to government.

Coca-Cola is said to contribute more than Shs100 billion in form of direct and indirect taxes annually while Pepsi is said to be contributing about Shs70 billion in taxes per year.

Although there are no readily available figures consumption trends show that the former duopolies no longer sell as much as they used to before the entrance of new players.

Reasons for constrained growth

Century Bottling Company managing director Norton Kingwill however dismisses reports of a price war saying price cuts witnessed in the market are a result of the sluggish growth seen in the carbonated soft drinks industry over the past few years forcing players to lower prices to boost consumption and stimulate growth.

Mr Kingwill attributes the constrained growth in the carbonated soft drinks market over the years to slow economic recovery from the lag effects of the 2011 economic challenges coupled with price increases for sodas.

He however adds that the lower contribution of carbonated soft drinks to the Non-Alcoholic-Ready-To-Drink (NARTD) category presents an opportunity for industry growth and that soda manufacturers have invested immensely in capacity to allow them meet the expected increase in demand.

Coca-Cola invested in a $26.7 million (about Shs67.3 billion) plastic bottle production line last year that is expected to boost its production capacity and lower production costs.

All manufacturers also increased their marketing budgets mainly for print electronic and bill boards advertising as well as building a nationwide network of distributors as they seek to grab a bigger chunk of the market.

While Mr Kingwill maintains that Coca-Cola still commands the biggest share of the market despite the entrance of new players Mr Simon Lugoloobi the Crown Beverages chief executive officer says Crown Beverages has managed to bridge the gap with its biggest competitor thus consolidating its place among the top two biggest players in the market.

However this newspaper was unable to get a comment from Riham as the CEO who the company said is the only authorised person to speak to the media was reportedly in meetings.

Market players however note that the industry is now stronger compared to about three years ago and is set for major growth going forward due to increased affordability and expected increase in people’s spending power.

Mr Lugoloobi explains that the market is witnessing strong growth in the plastic bottled soda sales compared to returnable glass bottle sodas which is reflective of the consumer trends.

“Many customers today are always on the move and hungry for packaging that is convenient and in line with their mobility” he says.

With the growing number of health-conscious consumers and other consumer trends beverage manufacturers are struggling to stay relevant with most of them deploying several measures including adopting alternative sources of revenue through product diversification by adding lines of healthier drinks such as water and juices."

in announcing its decision the board recognizes the global outcry commenting: ‘you have sought to remind us that the dormitories designed by louis kahn are a cultural legacy and that these buildings are to be seen as an integral part of the ensemble of buildings that constitute the campus… we are acutely cognizant of the place that the institute and its architecture occupy in the larger community and of the responsibility that comes with being custodians of the legacy that louis kahn bestowed on us.’

following the initial announcement to demolish the louis kahn-designed dorms at indian institute of management (IIM) in india the world monuments fund had called on the institute’s administration to reconsider. the group insists that the project stands as an important influence on the ‘modern development of indian higher education’ and that the environmentally sustainable design continues to exemplify locally-minded climate-sensitive architecture. the group states: ‘conceived as an ensemble the kahn campus must be preserved in its entirety to protect the aesthetic functional and symbolic values imbued within.’

in a letter to alumni director of the iconic institute in india errol d’souza defends the demolition proposal calling the louis kahn-designed structures ‘unlivable.’ as the project was constructed with ‘second-class bricks’ that had since become brittle and weak the director cites extensive structural issues. these issues include slabs of concrete falling from the roofs cracking and water seepage due to deteriorated brickwork and concrete encasing was not used to protect the embedded reinforcement bars. the work finally suffered a compromised structure resulting from a 2001 earthquake. although the school had previously commissioned an extensive restoration project for the iconic buildings the plans have been since reversed with the intention to rebuild entirely.

director errol d’souza says now that the buildings will require extensive restoration efforts due to their derelict condition. the revised plans include conducting a structural analysis of the dorms by an independent entity. d’souza will recommend an independent entity such as the central building research institute to perform a structural analysis of the dormitories and provide consultation on the feasibility of restoration. the cost of restoration has been projected to be at least RS 3.5 crore (approximately 480000 USD) per dorm a prediction which considers a recent preservation effort. in 2014 ‘dormitory 15’ had been restored by somaya and kalappa (S&K) consultants although officials claim that this effort will need to be repeated every three years.

questions are being raised about how the dorms reached such an irreversible state of disrepair. kirtee shah chairman of KSA design planning services and president of habitat forum comments: ‘IIM-A management and whoever is involved and responsible need to examine why is the institution in this predicament now why are the buildings in such a state of distress just 50-60 years after they were constructed? why in such a small period do they require major repairs big budget restorations and even demolition?‘

although immediate plans to remove the fourteen dorms have been put on hold the buildings are still under threat of eventual removal. with the substandard materials and derelict structure the historic modernist buildings still remain unsafe. with this in mind kahn’s three children sue ann kahn alexandra tyng and nathaniel kahn reached out to errol d’souza imploring him to preserve their father’s work. in a letter to the director the family writes: ‘with all due respect we find the arguments for demolition of the dormitories at iima put forward in your letter to the alumni and in your response to us to be illogical and misleading. you attempt to make the case that the dormitories are a lost cause yet you have already restored one of the dorms (d-15) and have announced intentions to restore three more. this is a contradictory position.’



image by abhishek donda

the letter from the kahn family continues referencing : ‘the photographs you show of the dorms in your letter to the alumni are clearly chosen to highlight problem areas but these are exactly the kinds of conditions that were encountered and already remedied in D-15 and in the library. in fact the first photo you show in your letter to the IIMA alumni has the number ’16’ above the lintel. dormitory 16 is one of the three additional buildings that you indicate you plan to restore. therefore we already know that the problems illustrated can be fixed. you also take issue with the quality of the bricks used in the original construction. but these are the same bricks used in the library and very effective measures have been developed by your restoration team to deal with the various brick-related challenges encountered.‘

the family continues referencing the previous restoration work by somaya & kalappa consultants: ‘why not celebrate the clear success of iima’s conservation efforts to date by sharing photographs of the restored vikram sarabhai library and dormitory D-15? below are a few screenshots from last month’s public lecture at CEPT given by brinda somaya the principal in your restoration team of somaya & kalappa consultants. these before and after shots clearly show the exemplary restoration of both the library and dormitory D-15.’



before and after comparison of the restoration work done at the vikram sarabhai library (CEPT university/youtube)

‘we and indeed many others worldwide find it confounding that IIMA would take such a radical course of action to destroy its heritage if the buildings can be restored successfully. if you need more student living spaces as you indicate in your EOI you are already building a new campus that can address that. if the problem is money please just say so. in addition to the many IIM graduates that revere the kahn buildings there are organizations and individuals the world over who support the cause of preserving great architecture. if you appeal to them with a clear commitment to conservation and restoration they can assist you.’



before and after restoration comparison of the brickwork at dorm 15 (CEPT university/youtube)

‘there is one point from our initial letter to you that we must clarify: the option of making sensitive adjustments to the dormitory interiors to suit changing needs is in no way the same as tearing the buildings down and constructing something else on the same footprint. please do not attempt to twist the meaning of what we wrote to you. you cannot retain the ‘grammar’ of our father’s buildings if you destroy them. period. in a recent statement to the press you indicate that adjustment of interior spaces in the kahn dorm buildings is problematic. but has your experienced conservation team actually studied its feasibility? if so we request that this study be made public.’

louis kahn’s family concludes its appeal to the director of the indian institute of management ahmedabad: ‘we implore you to reconsider this calamitous and irreversible decision. there are many people and organizations throughout india and the world ready to help you resolve this in a way that is beneficial to IIMA and that also preserves the timeless work of architecture in your care. please make use of the resources available to you. we are eager to speak directly with you and the IIMA board. will you please convene a meeting with us as soon as possible?’

In 1906 the family immigrates to Philadelphia. His father changes the family name to Kahn in 1915 when the family is awarded US citizenship. Kahn develops his artistic talents early on and is able to draw beautifully from a young age.



In his early years Kahn earns money playing the piano at neighbourhood theatres. He keeps this up during his university years until he graduates in 1924 with a bronze medal for ‘superior excellence’ and starts working as an architect.



In 1928 he leaves on a trip to Europe. In the Netherlands he learns about modern architecture such as the functionalist design of Johannes Duiker's Sanatorium Zonnestraal in Hilversum. He also gets to see the architecture of Hendrik Berlage Michel de Klerk and Willem Dudok.



Family life and work 1930 - 1955

Back in the US Louis Kahn marries Esther Virginia Israeli a research assistant in the field of neurology. Five years later Kahn is awarded the title of architect and starts working from home on his own projects. In 1940 Esther gives birth to their first daughter Sue Ann. In 1945 Kahn has an office with a few employees. Kahn develops a tough work ethic: he often only rests for a few hours sometimes sleeping at the office to be able to continue working straight away.



In the office Louis Kahn and architect Anne Tyng who is nearly 20 years younger become entangled in an affair. Because of his attitude towards work Louis Kahn is often away from home keeping the two worlds of family life and work strictly separate. In 1950 Kahn leaves on another extended trip to southern Europe and Egypt where he draws ancient Roman and Egyptian treasures. Kahn describes the beauty of these structures in letters to Anne Tyng. In 1954 Anne Tyng gives birth to Kahn's second child: Alexandra.



International fame: 1955 - 1974

In 1958 Kahn is introduced to landscape-architect Harriet Pattison (born in 1928) at a party. A relationship develops between the architect and Pattison resulting in the birth of Kahn's third child and only son Nathaniel. One year later Kahn attends the conference of a prominent group of international architects who have come together in Otterloo the Netherlands under the name of Team X (Team Ten). This group includes Dutch architects Aldo van Eyck and Jaap Bakema.



In the 1960s and 70s Kahn finally takes his place on the international stage with designs for government buildings museums laboratories libraries private homes and religious buildings. One high point is the government building in Dhaka Bangladesh which is only completed in 1983 years after his death. In the last decade of his life Kahn visits the Indian subcontinent no fewer than 40 times. On 17 March 1974 returning from one of these trips Louis Kahn dies in a toilet at Penn Station in New York. For uncertain reasons he had crossed out his name in his passport as a result of which he can only be identified a few days later.

Early on they shifted much of their in-person yarn business to their newly minted website offering pickup for local customers.

Once they were able to open to customers they reconfigured their Kerrytown shop to accommodate social distancing rules ditching their communal tables and other features.

But Spun is no longer cramped for space. In late May the Sickman-Garners relocated to the first-floor location previously occupied by Hollander’s.

Once just 1000 square feet upstairs Spun now occupies triple that amount. It also has two entrances–one inside Kerrytown’s Market Building the other in the Godfrey Building facing Fourth Ave.

The move has long been front of mind Pete emails. “Even before the pandemic we had mentioned to [Kerrytown owner Joe O’Neal] that if a bigger space came up we’d be interested.”

In the five years since Spun opened “we saw demand for many products that we didn’t have room to carry” he writes. “We did our best to stuff the original shop with new items but it became so crowded that it started to have an impact on everyone’s experience guests and staff alike.”

Spun also had a greater demand for classes than its available space could accommodate.

When Hollander’s spot came open “it became a guessing game–will the pandemic recede to the point where the economy can open enough to make it work and when will that happen? So we watched the news read everything we could from the CDC and other sources and eventually took the risk.”

Along with many new colors and types of yarn they’ve added a selection of cross-stitch and other embroidery kits and supplies fiber for spinning spinning wheels drop spindles and Cricket weaving looms used to make fabric.

There’s now a dedicated learning space with tables that can accommodate up to fifteen people when in-person classes resume this month. They plan to offer more than three dozen sessions ranging from beginning knit and crochet classes to ‘project-focused ones. There also will be basic spinning and weaving classes as well as in-person private lessons.

An especially exciting feature is the Fourth Ave. entrance which will let people stay for classes after the rest of the building closes. This month Spun will extend its evening hours from Monday through Thursday; watch its website or Facebook page for updates.

Along with drop-in sessions the store will offer Tuesday night sweater clinics and a beginners’ roundtable on Wednesdays. For those still wary of coming in they’re continuing to offer pickup and curbside collection.

Writes Pete: “We have re-launched everything we do and then some.”

Upstairs in the Godfrey Building Heather Dupuis has opened the Pilates Barn & Wellness–the successor to her Vie Fitness & Spa locations on Ashley downtown and in Arbor Hills Crossing on Washtenaw.

Along with one-on-one instructors spinning and Pilates classes Vie was one of the first places in town to sell upscale Lululemon workout gear along with a variety of skin and body products. When Dupuis installed a smoothie bar and added spa treatments Vie became a hangout for its clients as much as a fitness studio.

Now she’s going back to the basics. The Pilates Barn–the name refers to both the vintage barn she still hopes to find and the onetime warehouse’s open space and industrial feel–will concentrate on Pilates instruction one-on-one training and nutrition counseling with group classes taught virtually.

“I’m very excited about this new chapter and lifestyle” Dupuis said in an email. “No retail. No juice bar. No spa.”

From a staff of fifty-eight spread between her two previous locations Dupuis now will employ just fourteen people leaving her time to advise fitness clients and spend less time managing the business.

“The new business will be very simple which is my new obsession since the pandemic” Dupuis says. “It will be a different experience–no doubt!”

Amir Hamja | Bloomberg | Getty Images

A lot has changed in the entertainment industry in 2020. With the surge in coronavirus cases has come an increased uneasiness from audiences truncated theatrical windows and a stronger focus on streaming than ever before. But there's one thing that has remained the same: the symbiotic relationship between studios and movie theaters. ""Studios and exhibition have always had a lovely but contentious relationship"" one movie theater operator with locations in the southern part of the U.S. said on condition of anonymity. ""Exhibition is basically a business that has blank screens and empty seats and we can't do what we do without the studios."" In spite of massive disruption in the industry cinema owners and distributors are doing what they can to keep things professional during a time of high stress and emotion. Cinema owners who spoke to CNBC said that they understood why studios have had to postpone major films and place some of those movies on streaming services or on-demand platforms. ""Whether we agree with what their solutions are is a totally different story"" the movie theater operator said.

Disrupting the status quo

For decades theater owners have been resistant to change particularly when it comes to the length of time that movies should play in cinemas before being permitted to go to premium video on-demand home video or streaming services. Up until this year blockbuster films had to be shown in theaters for at least 90 days before they could be launched anywhere else. That window typically included around 74 days of exclusive theatrical showings two weeks of availability on digital release and then the inclusion of home video sales. These windows were created by studios decades ago in an effort ""to get multiple bites out of the same apple"" another movie theater operator said. In the months leading up to the pandemic some studios were actually already in talks with theaters to slightly alter these windows. The result would have kept bigger franchise films and blockbusters in cinemas longer and permitted smaller budget films to head to direct-to-consumer channels faster. However when the pandemic hit and theaters were forced to shutter for nearly six months desperation compelled cinema operators to agree to new and starkly shorter release strategies to get through the pandemic. After all bankruptcy concerns have been raised by cinemas chains big and small over the last nine months. Not to mention cinemas have seen their number of locations shrink in recent months. As of last weekend only around 35% of the theaters in North America were open. Many of these closures are due to local restrictions but some larger chains have opted to shut locations because they are losing too much money being open with such limited amounts of product.

Gal Gadot stars as Wonder Woman in ""Wonder Woman 1984."" Warner Bros.

""Most of the studios experimented with alternative distribution when they found themselves unable to distribute films in normal windows"" said Michael Pachter analyst at Wedbush. ""Universal tried premium [video on-demand] after a 17 day window Disney tried premium [video on-demand] exclusively at a very high price and Warner tried day and date streaming and theatrical."" ""The streaming window was always the last resort"" he said.

Business as usual

While larger chains like AMC and Cinemark were able to make deals with studios like Universal for a cut of on-demand profits once movies flipped to streaming smaller theater chains have less bargaining power. ""I would say our relationships are pretty much the same as before"" said a movie theater owner from the Midwest who requested anonymity. ""I'm dealing with presidents of distribution. In so many cases these decisions are above them. The HBO Max decision was way above the head of distribution. It's no good to get in a fight with the distribution teams they are afraid for their jobs too."" ""I'm mad at AT&T I'm mad at Comcast"" he said. ""I'm not necessarily mad at Warner Bros. distribution."" For these smaller circuits decisions like AT&T's to release its full slate of 2021 Warner Bros. movies on the same day in theaters and streaming are costly. Having these titles available at home decreases the incentive for customers to come out to the theater. Still there are worse alternatives. ""We're not happy with day and date"" the Midwest operator said. ""But I'd rather have product day and date than have zero product at all.""

watch now

While many movie theater operators are frustrated with the sudden surge of titles headed to streaming platforms it should be noted that studios have made similar decisions about direct-to-consumer content for decades in different forms. Before streaming there were films from major studios that went directly to VHS or DVD skipping cinemas entirely. ""The idea that studios make important content for direct-to-home is not a unique concept"" said a worldwide operator with a large national footprint who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""What tech has now done is allow more of that. Content is king. Content was king before the virus and content will be king after the virus. Content is where it begins and ends. That hasn't changed.""

The IRS valued Prince's estate at $163.2 million a number much higher than the $82.3 million valuation submitted by the estate's administrator Comerica Bank and Trust according to Minnesota's Star Tribute. Furthermore the report explains the gap is tied to Prince's music publishing and recording interests.

If the new estimates are correct the estate owes $32.4 million in addition to what has already been paid plus an additional $6.4 million for ""accuracy-related penalty.""

EW has reached out to the IRS the attorneys on file representing the estate and Comerica Bank and Trust for comment.

Prince died on April 21 2016 of an accidental overdose of fentanyl at his Paisley Park home in Minnesota at the age of 57. He died without a will leaving his sister Tyka Nelson and five half-siblings have legitimate claims over the estate. Comerica has requested a trial be held to settle the valuation issues though this path could prolong the settlement for many years and would cost the estate more in legal fees.

Sharon Nelson one of Prince's sisters spoke to Billboard in 2019 over her frustrations with Comerica over their ""thousands of court filings"" which have cost the estate ""millions in legal fees.""

MINNEAPOLIS – The ongoing controversy over the money left behind by Prince when he died without a will is heating up again after Internal Revenue Service calculations showed that executors of the rock star's estate undervalued it by 50% or about $80 million.

The IRS determined that Prince's estate is worth $163.2 million overshadowing the $82.3 million valuation submitted by Comerica Bank & Trust the estate's administrator. The discrepancy primarily involves Prince's music publishing and recording interests according to court documents.

Documents show the IRS believes that Prince's estate owes another $32.4 million in federal taxes roughly doubling the tax bill based on Comerica's valuation the Star Tribune reported.

The IRS also has ordered a $6.4 million ""accuracy-related penalty"" on Prince's estate citing a ""substantial"" undervaluation of assets documents show.

7 legendary stars who died without wills:Aretha Franklin Prince and more

Prince's death of a fentanyl overdose on April 21 2016 created one of the largest and most complicated probate court proceedings in Minnesota history. Estimates of his net worth have varied widely from $100 million to $300 million.

With Prince's probate case dragging on his six sibling heirs have grown increasingly unhappy particularly as the estate has doled out tens of millions to lawyers and consultants.

Comerica and its lawyers at Fredrikson & Byron in Minneapolis maintain their estate valuations are solid. Comerica sued the IRS this summer in U.S. Tax Court saying the agency's calculations are riddled with errors.

""What we have here is a classic battle of the experts – the estate's experts and the IRS' experts"" said Dennis Patrick an estate planning attorney at DeWitt LLP in Minneapolis who is not involved in the case. Valuing a large estate Patrick added ""is way more of an art than a science.""

Comerica a Dallas-based financial services giant has asked the tax court to hold a trial in St. Paul. A trial could dramatically lengthen the settlement of Prince's estate and generate more legal fees at the expense of Prince's heirs Patrick said.

Accuses Prince's Estate of Undervaluing Worth by Half,"He may have temporarily changed his name to an unpronounceable glyph mixing the symbols for male and female but apparently he also could have used this: $.

According to a report in the Star Tribune the Internal Revenue Service has accused Prince's estate of undervaluing the late performer's assets by 50 percent.

When Prince the sui generis pop rock and R&B star died in 2016 at the age of 57 he did so without a will. The Minneapolis-based Star Tribune newspaper has called the resulting legal entanglements ""one of the largest and most complicated probate court proceedings in Minnesota history."" The estate's administrator financial giant Comerica Bank & Trust originally valued Prince's holdings at $82.3 million. The I.R.S. says the true value is $163.2 million. As such the estate owes another $32.4 million in federal taxes.

The primary discrepancy concerns Prince's music publishing and recording interests. An expert quoted by the Star Tribune suggested that valuing a large estate is ""way more of an art than a science.""

Prince's six heirs include a sister and five half-siblings. Prince's only offspring died shortly after childbirth due to a rare disease called Pfeiffer syndrome. One of the star's half-brothers died in 2019 prior to the estate settlement which now could drag out for ""several more years.""

In addition to the ever-changing financial winds of the music industry there are curiosities in Prince's holdings like the private ownership of a forklift.

The estate began releasing posthumous work beginning in 2017. This includes the album Originals consisting of demo recordings of Prince songs that were later recorded by other artists and Sign o' the Times (Super Deluxe) a well-received massive collection including 63 unreleased tracks orbiting his 1987 masterpiece Sign o' the Times. An official ongoing podcast launched in May 2020 and archival material released via a TikTok partnership began in June.

Owing to their unique elemental abilities it is often hard to rank these characters in terms of power and utility. However it seems like the latest Cryo bow-wielder Ganyu can single-handedly dominate any battle in the game.

With every new constellation characters in Genshin Impact gain significant stats and Ganyu is no exception. At her sixth constellation using Trail of the Qilin causes the next Frostflake Arrow shot within 30 seconds not to require charging.

Ganyu’s C6 is a highly overpowered ability in itself and the community believes it to be more efficient than the C6 abilities of Diluc Tartaglia and Venti. Reddit user u/CryyoticFate has now discovered a bug that makes her powerful enough to break the game altogether.

Apparently using Ganyu’s elemental skill and switching to another character at the same time grants her with infinite Lv. 2 charged arrows. Players can deal continuous damage with them and defeat almost any boss and enemy with ease.

It is worth noting that this glitch is extremely hard to trigger and is exclusive to the character’s sixth constellation. Ganyu being a five-star entity is extremely rare and reaching her maximum constellation is still a dream for many players.

Will Genshin Impact give free primogems to the players now?

Genshin Impact runs on a system that resembles a vending machine better known as Gacha. It actively incentivizes the players to spend in-game currency primogems to receive random virtual items. It comes as no surprise that free to play players leave no opportunity to claim primogems for free and the aforementioned bug might lead to the same.

Ganyu’s constellation six bug is definitely miHoYo‘s fault. Some players have even claimed that the bug has been prevailing since the beginning of Ganyu’s banner and has been reported several times already. Regardless the developers haven’t patched it yet.

WEED CONTROL

Corn growers have a new choice for 2021 in AMVAC Chemical Corp.’s Impact Core herbicide which provides a quick takedown and long-term residual control of grasses and broadleaves in a range of field conditions.

Based on the proven effectiveness of Impact herbicide chemistry aimed at herbicide-resistant grasses and broadleaf weeds such as waterhemp Palmer amaranth and giant ragweed Impact Core contains an industry-leading level of acetochlor in a long-lasting stable formulation for extended periods of control. It is registered for in-crop use on field corn (grain silage and seed) and popcorn.

Impact Core contains topramezone (Group 27) foliar herbicide which controls susceptible weeds by inhibiting carotenoid biosynthesis causing a breakdown of chlorophyll and death of the targeted weed. Topramezone also provides limited but observable residual soil activity on weeds.

In addition the soil residual herbicide acetachlor (Group 15) is included to inhibit root and shoot growth in susceptible germinating seeds before or shortly after they emerge.

AMVAC also has registered Sinate as a new postemergence tool to fight herbicide-resistance in weeds in LibertyLink field corn and sweet corn such as waterhemp and giant ragweed with two modes of action from Impact Herbicide and glufosinate.

Dozens of people quickly responded to the thread with one man joking: 'Good I wonder if they will hold it for me I need that and a pack of AAA batteries.'

Some suggested the ring could be a 'replica' while one said 'surely they have a buyer after your tweet'.

Her post comes just two years after she shared the picture with many sharing their opinion on the very expensive sparkler.

'Imagine saying you got your engagement ring from Costco.. and it cost $499999.99' one wrote.

'How much is it at Aldi?' one joked and another added: 'And you have to pay the annual membership fee to get in to buy it.'

On Sunday she shared an update with her followers confirming the round diamond solitaire ring was still on display at the retailer

A Costco spokeswoman previously told the Daily Mail Australia that similar rings were available to purchase at all nine warehouse locations across the country.

'Each Costco warehouse has a ""WOW"" item in its jewellery department' the spokeswoman said in April 2018.

'Each one is unique to that warehouse but in each Australian warehouse the wow item is around that price.

'We pride ourselves on selling the highest quality products at the best possible price across a huge scope of departments including high-end jewellery.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ndWVscGh0b2RheS5jb20vbGV0dGVycy10by10aGUtZWRpdG9yL2xldHRlci1yZXNpZGVudC1jb25jZXJuZWQtd2l0aC1qYW1tZWQtY29zdGNvLXBhcmtpbmctbG90LWR1cmluZy1wYW5kZW1pYy0zMjIxMzkx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LETTER: Resident concerned with 'jammed' Costco parking lot during pandemic,"Resident questions why a small restaurant would have to close when Costco doesn't

Concerned citizen Jen Bailey submitted the following letter to the editor regarding COVID-19 protocols in big box stores like Costco:

Can someone please tell me why a restaurant like The Fat Duck has to close up (they have 4000 square feet of restaurant) because of COVID-19 but Costco can stay open full tilt?

I thought I would head to Costco at 3:00 p.m. today thinking it might be less busy.

As I approached the parking lot looked like what you might expect on a normal holiday season Tuesday. But as we all know this is anything but normal.

With a jammed parking lot you might expect a huge lineup as stores have been told to operate at limited capacity and I remember what it was like in the spring. BUT there was no lineup.

I decided that it wasn’t safe to go in so I turned my car around and left. (Couldn’t find a spot anyway).

Who’s checking up on these places?

A new downtown Kelowna hotel could receive final approval from city council later this month.

On Tuesday Jan. 12 council is expected to give final adoption to the rezoning of a lot at the corner of St. Paul Street and Clement Avenue one street down from the Kelowna RCMP detachment allowing for the development of a five-storey 88-unit hotel by Evergreen Lands Ltd.

In the past council has expressed concerns about parking with the developer planning for only 37 parking stalls and 10 bicycle stalls.

Under current city regulations 70 stalls would be required. City staff indicated the application came in before regulations changed in November 2019 meaning the development can be grandfathered into old parking regulations.

If there is a need for additional parking the developer said arrangements have been made with city parking services to allow for overflow parking at nearby city lots including the library parkade.

The hotel is just one of a few substantial projects in a loaded Tuesday meeting for Kelowna city council.

The same night council will also take a look at a large three-tower development on Leon Avenue and a public hearing is scheduled for the controversial Costco relocation.

January 2 2021

Story By Mike McGlothlin

Every automotive niche has its own way of representing itself. In the diesel realm enthusiasts often honor the engine under their hood more than the vehicle make it sits in. For trucks this means the Power Stroke Duramax and especially the Cummins are the primary celebrities often paid homage long before Ford Chevy and Dodge brand loyalty comes into play. Sometimes it’s a catchy vanity plate other times it’s an amusing sticker on the back glass and sometimes it’s flat-out ingenious. Every time it’s entertaining. From quirky to classy this is what some of the folks in the diesel world are up to.

The Perks Of Owning A Prehistoric Diesel

With older diesels such as the 12-valve Cummins and 7.3L Power Stroke often being described as dinosaurs thanks to their antiquated injection systems Miranda Neeley took it upon herself to have some fun. She had this HUEIsaurus sticker made for her 7.3L-powered ’99 Super Duty which happens to make more than 620rwhp and 1200 lb-ft despite its hydraulically actuated and electronically controlled (HEUI) injection system.

Connecting Rod Cupholders

A heavy-duty equipment mechanic in a previous life LinCo Diesel Performance’s Jeff McCord decided to put some spare 3306 Caterpillar connecting rods and 12-valve Cummins pushrods to use in his ’68 C30 Cummins swap project. The one-off cupholder assembly also plays into the rat-rod theme that’s big in the diesel world right now.

Engine Loyalty Can Even Be Found In Headlights

In the world of customized projector retrofit headlights showing loyalty to the diesel power plant under the hood is becoming commonplace these days. Here the 6.7L Power Stroke dwelling inside of an ’11-’16 F-350 is being celebrated. Some headlight mods are poorly executed while others (like this one) appear so well done you find yourself wanting to know who did the work.

BNT RODS

If you’re pushing the limits why not let everyone know about it. That was exactly what the owner of this Lariat trim F-250 was thinking. With the 6.7L Power Stroke’s connecting rods known to be a weak link beyond the 650rwhp mark—and with this particular engine sporting a Midwest Diesel & Auto 66mm VGT Exergy 10mm stroker CP4.2 custom PCM tuning and making 660rwhp—the license plate offers a hint of what could be on the horizon: bent rods!

6-Deep Burnouts

At least at Blackout in the Country a bustling event put on annually by Bean’s Diesel Performance you’ll find trucks full of people taking in a nice lengthy burnout. Of course one lucky passenger always has the task of recording the festivities on their phone. Watch out for flying rubber!

Soot Life

We swear stickers aren’t really a “thing” in the diesel world but surely you’ve heard of “Salt Life?” Well meet the “Soot Life” sticker a play on the ocean-centered lifestyle represented via the Salt Life banners you see stuck on everyone back glass currently. In this case it’s funny but also fits the mold perfectly. If you come across the average diesel owner you’ll quickly find that they truly do live breathe and sleep compression ignition.

The Vanity Plate That Taunts

Poking the competition through the use of vanity plates certainly isn’t unique to diesel owners—but it is fairly common. And when you’ve upgraded turbos and added a few other go-fast goodies to your ’11-’14 6.7L Power Stroke you can pull off this kind of messaging. Serving as the tow-rig for the guys at Unlimited Diesel Performance their dual rear wheel F-350 Platinum Super Duty is probably more than capable of holding its own against the average “juiced up” Duramax it encounters on the street.

Suburbamax

Surely you’ve heard the terms DuraBurb and DuraKon. Say hello to Suburbamax a name that means the owner took it upon himself or herself to build the SUV GM should’ve: a family hauler powered by the 6.6L Duramax V-8. This type of swap is accepted in all corners of the diesel world as the GM-built engine remains in a GM product keeping it all in the family so to speak. The naming part is simply the icing on the cake or the cue on the cowl in this case…

Not Just A Badge—He Really Swapped It!

Wait what? Your grandparents’ old four-door Lincoln got transformed into a four-wheel drive Cummins-powered luxury sedan… Well somebody’s did and Adam Naeck put in all the legwork. How does a Super Duty chassis a ZF-6 manual and a P-pumped 12-valve sound? It’s just more proof that Cummins die-hards are constantly thinking outside the box whether it’s a junkyard project or a top-of-the-line no-expense-spared build.

Why is this 1996 Ram HD 3500 so special? Believe it or not it’s because it is a crew cab with four regular doors. What’s the big deal? A huge majority of new trucks are crew cabs. Actually crew cab pickup trucks are a relatively recent phenomenon. These big-cab trucks became popular in the early 2000s. Most older trucks were configured as a regular two-door cab or an extended cab. This 1996 Dodge Ram truck belongs to Jordan Driver. It’s a specialty built truck by Custom Conversions in Cleburne Texas that was done in 1996 when the truck was brand new.

Here are more details from Jordan. Oh yea – this truck has a fold-out couch bed in the back. Jordan writes:

“The rear seat is not power-operated but it can move about a foot and a half toward the front seats and then the back can fold down making a bed. The rear seat is super plush like a soft mattress. The truck has 165700 miles and at some point was swapped from an automatic to a manual (NV4500). The bed is a little rough I have a new one that is a different color a decent dent by the 3rd brake light. Typical clear coat peel and one crack in the dash. There are some cracking in the paint where the welds were I would assume it is from them not adding a body mounts in the middle of the cab they only retained the stock 4 in the front and rear of the cab.

Nothing major is wrong with any of the conversion pieces. I’ve completed a decent amount of maintenance fixing all of the things that have been neglected over the years but so far nothing has been catastrophic. I find it weird they didn’t add speakers into the rear doors or wire up the rear dome light to turn on when a door opens.”

Here are few images of the truck.

Naturally this dually is powered by a Cummins straight-six turbo-diesel with a few modifications. This truck is far from stock inside and out. Jordan drove it home several hundred miles after purchasing it. He says the big turbo diesel average around 15 MPG. It’s unknown what rear axle ratio this truck has.

Here are the fancy rear couch/bed/seat images and the original window sticker for this truck that also shows the delivery of this Laramie SLT to Custom Conversion in Texas.

If you guys want to learn more about this truck we will try to get Jordan to do a “Dude I Love My Ride!” walk-around video of his truck.

It’s an absolute pleasure to debate the selections and my team may not be the same one selected by readers of The Irish Post it’s very much a subjective test and you will be judge and jury on my verdict.

I’m thinking of those summer days again and the spine-tingling sound of the clash of the ash - let’s bring on the seventies.

This decade belonged to Cork and Kilkenny who shared the spoils of four titles each.

Cork started the decade in devasting style when they defeated Wexford in the first 80-minute final. It was also a significant year for ‘The Rebels’ as it brought them level with Tipperary on the All-Ireland rankings with 21 titles apiece.

The Cork three-in-a-row period ’76 – ‘78 was a magnificent campaign and signalled the start of something special with a talented pool of players.

Kilkenny with an air of invincibility about them and a conveyor belt of new talent on show to compliment the old brigade began a winning sequence that would bring them four All Ireland titles in the decade.

In 1973 the cup returned to Limerick after a lapse of 33 years. The revival of Limerick was so welcome. The more teams challenging realistically for the top honour the better.

You may rightly ask what about Tipperary?

Well having bid farewell to some of the old heroes the wheels fell off the wagon after the golden sixties.

At last a time for realignment and the introduction of much needed fresh blood. Although the remedy didn’t immediately pay dividends they did at least get a windfall with victory in ’71.

There you have it the teams that made the ‘70s now time for my choice of the best hurlers of the decade.

Goalkeepers

Noel Skehan Kilkenny

Noel marshalled his defence as if his life depended on it. He was fearless around the goal mouth dashing out through a forest of hurls and clearing his lines.

Seamus Durack Clare

Although success eluded him in the championship he showcased his ability on the bigger stage of Railway Cup competitions. A fine custodian.

Defenders

Phil (Fan) Larkin Kilkenny

From a family steeped in hurling Phil was small of statue but he made up for his lack of physique with a shrewd hurling brain and tremendous skill and courage.

Ted Carroll Kilkenny

A delightful and elegant corner back with a deceptive burst of speed often leaving forwards trailing in his wake.

Pat Hartigan Limerick

Pat was a gentle giant well over 6’3 in height and built like a tank. He was a fullback of incredible talent and for a man of his size never resorted to physical confrontation.

Dan Quigley Wexford

The name Quigley has adorned Wexford hurling for decades. There were so many of them all brothers. A big man Dan was a tough traditional defender who did not stand on ceremony.

Pat Dunny Kildare

A renowned dual star who won provincial honours in both codes for Leinster Pat had this never-say-die attitude matched with great hurling intensity and astute vision.

Iggy Clark Galway

A hurler of great skill and composure who kept the ‘West’ awake during the seventies. He wasn’t around when the honours arrived in the eighties. If anyone was born in the wrong era it was Iggy Clark.

Tom Cashman Cork

From a famous hurling family it was only natural Tom would follow in his father’s footsteps. He was a superb hurling artist the bedrock of the Cork defence for many years.

Martin Coogan Kilkenny

A natural left-handed player with boundless energy Martin was utterly reliable fast hard and fearless.

Pat Henderson Kilkenny

From 1964 and 1991 the Henderson family name never left the Kilkenny team sheet. Pat the eldest played in ten All-Ireland finals winning five of them. He was a colossal hurler.

Ger Loughnane Clare

Ger was clever in his stickwork one of the many facets in his repertoire of skills. He later became manager of Clare hurlers and led them to glory.

Len Gaynor Tipperary

The tough-as-teak defender won his first All-Ireland medal in 1965 and his name is inextricably linked with the great years of Tipperary’s dominance.

Jim Treacy Kilkenny

A robust player with good mobility both on the ground and in the air Jim hurled with Kilkenny at a time when the team had a great understanding between themselves.

Mid-fielders

Mick Jacob Wexford

One of the greatest of all Wexford hurlers a class act who avoided the physical challenges by his swift awareness and movement Mick had a great spirit combined with total commitment.

Eamon Cregan Limerick

From his debut in 1964 to his farewell game in 1983 Eamon played a leading role in Limerick’s All-Ireland success. A born hurler and playmaker with delightful skills that were not fashioned overnight.

Forwards

Gerald McCarthy Cork

Gerald had determination and flair with unerring accuracy from frees as well as contributing scoring opportunities for his colleagues in his general play.

Eamon Grimes Limerick

The blonde-haired flyer was one of Limerick’s top score-getters. A tireless worker who thrived on one-to-one situations and never shirked a tackle.

Pat Delaney Kilkenny

Pat was one of the finest forwards ever to play for Kilkenny. He had the capacity to penetrate the tightest of defences and his scoring record was phenomenal.

Martin Cuddy Laois

Martin was very strong with huge physical presence. He arrived in Oxford around 1968 so I can vouch for his strength. He would go through a brick wall taking man and ball with him.

Babs Keating Tipperary

One of the greatest duel players of all time Babs arrived on the inter-county scene in the early sixties winning his first All- Ireland medal in 1964. A player of great style speed and strength.

Joe Henry Mayo

It is generally accepted that hurling is not native to Mayo. Joe undoubtedly Mayo’s finest hurler of all time carved a niche for himself in the hurling lore of the land winning three Railway Cup medals with Connacht.

Jimmy Barry Murphy Cork

A duel player with amazing talent that would fit into my selection for both the football and hurling all-time greats. A child prodigy who had this propensity for attack and scoring spectacular goals and points.

PJ Molloy Galway

PJ was graced with unlimited hurling skills and a real opportunist in or near the goals. He ploughed a lone furrow for many years but got his rewards at the end.

Ray Cummins Cork

Ray was another duel star with exceptional talent. He played in ten All-Ireland finals in both codes and eventually had a postage stamp issued in his honour.

Mick Birmingham Dublin

The only Dublin player to have won five Railway Cup titles with Leinster testament to his hurling prowess and ability.

Billy Fitzpatrick Kilkenny

Billy played in six senior All-Ireland hurling finals and was successful in five of them. He was Kilkenny’s leading marksmen over many years a classy player with a graceful style.

Joe Connolly Galway

From a famous family in Castlegar Galway he first pulled on the maroon jersey in the late seventies and was still wearing it when he captained the county to All-Ireland glory in 1980.

So that’s it folks. In the meantime do look after yourselves and stay safe.

Henry Wymbs has always had a love of Gaelic football and hurling and played inter-county football for Sligo in 1967. He now presents ‘Irish Eye' a weekly Irish music programme broadcast from Oxford across BBC Radio Oxford BBC Radio Berkshire and online via BBC iPlayer. Email [email protected]"

""We continue to do better and therefore meet the criteria to sit at the table when it comes to a possible consolidation of the European banks - and not just as a junior partner"" Sewing told Welt am Sonntag in an interview.

Sewing who is pursuing a long-term drive to boost earnings power at Deutsche after years of underperformance has consistently said that his priority was to complete a turnaround by 2022.

Talks on an all-German banking merger with Commerzbank failed in 2019 and with a stock market value of just 18 billion euros ($21.9 billion) Deutsche would be an affordable target for a more richly valued potential acquirer.

Sewing played up the bank's strategic importance for Europe's largest economy and top exporting nation however and said his restructuring drive was bearing fruit.

""It would be a mistake to rely on imports of financial services"" said Sewing. ""Every quarter in which we are successful makes us stronger.""

Earnings and costs in its private and corporate business were absolutely on track he added and Deutsche's investment bank has outperformed expectations. ($1 = 0.8239 euros)

Mike was a proud veteran of the United States Army. He devoted 36 years to John Deere where he worked as an inspector. Mike loved his job and made many lasting friendships there. One of his favorite things to do was to travel to California to visit his family a couple times a year. He always looked forward to those trips. Above all Mike’s family was most important to him. He treasured time spent with all his family and his grandchildren held a special place in his heart. They were his greatest joy. He loved doing everything with them from attending their sporting events or taking them out to dinner. He will be greatly missed.



He is survived by his children Kathi (Jeff) Phillips Kyla (Rick) Johnson and Mike Kerr Jr.; grandchildren Jordan Aspen Taylor Logan Carson Katelynn (Justin) and Hayden; siblings Nancy (Dick) Salyers Jane Thompson and Jimmy (Alice) Kerr; numerous nieces nephews other loving family members and countless friends.

And for 2021 Agco Corp. has a new boss. Meet Eric Hansotia.

Hansotia (pronounced Han-SO-tia) is just the third CEO for Agco and he's succeeding Martin Richenhagen an outspoken industry leader who has doubled sales at the company and pushed the stock price up fourfold during his tenure.

Big shoes to fill but Hansotia says he's ""beyond excited"" to take on the new role. And during the Fendt Global Media event in late 2020 Richenhagen gave Hansotia a rousing endorsement. Richenhagen countering some worries that a non-German CEO might leave Fendt behind answered that the idea was ""as the Americans say bullsh*t.""

Hansotia who recalls the comment with a smile says ""It was done in the classic German style. Here's the problem and why the problem won't happen.""

A new boss at a farm equipment company doesn't always immediately affect a farmer. If new well-made equipment comes to market the person at the top often means little.

But for a relatively new company like Agco corporate culture is important and for Hansotia carrying on what has been started by his predecessors — Richenhagen and company founder the late Bob Ratliff — will be important.

""I've been in the industry one way or another my whole life"" says Hansotia who grew up in central Wisconsin and as a youth worked on a crop and dairy operation. He was involved in 4-H and FFA was a Wisconsin Junior Dairyman and is ""all in on ag.""

He earned his engineering degrees — a bachelor's and a master's — at the University of Wisconsin and later earned a MBA at the University of Iowa. Hansotia worked at John Deere from 1993 to 2013 when he left to join the Agco team where he went to work right away.

""I was involved in the acquisition of Precision Planting and worked on the development of the Ideal combine"" he says. ""We've had a two-year transition and Martin was a tremendous help for me. He's brought Agco forward and we want to build upon that work and continue. Every new leader has the chance to stand on the shoulders of those that came before.""

Brands and the future

Agco through its history has acquired a wide range of companies from Hesston to Ag-Chem from Massey Ferguson to Fendt. And over time the company has worked to bring those brands together. How does the company make it work?

""We've done a lot of work on segmenting the market"" Hansotia says. ""There are certain customers that have certain types of equipment demands then others have a completely different set of requirements.""

Fendt fills one need with high-tech tools like its tractors the new Ideal combine and the Momentum planter. A customer looking for more straightforward power might turn to Massey Ferguson instead. ""It's like having different car brands"" he says. ""We go to market with the whole value proposition by brand — Fendt one way Massey Ferguson another.""

Hansotia uses a sports analogy for this. A team may head toward a goal but use different players. The wide receiver and the running back both move the ball but in different ways. ""They're all working together to be able to make the play"" Hansotia says.

The early years of Agco involved a lot of those acquisitions and while the company is on the lookout for purchase opportunities the focus is changing.

""We don't have any obvious holes in our line"" he says. ""We have sprayers; we have tractors. We'll be looking at technology opportunities."" And the startup field is rich with potential candidates that could bring value to the company.

As for the Challenger brand? Hansotia explains this brand has a solid place in the market for tracked machines and is an important part of the company. This is a targeted offering with key products for that customer segment.

Looking ahead with Hansotia

How dealers work with farmers is changing. The rising use of telemetry to help with service and changing data needs to enable enhanced management are important. As Hansotia looks ahead he is focused on that technology.

""We have great examples of smart machines where the machine can sense its environment make onboard calculations and then automate some of the most challenging tasks on the farm"" he says. ""Digital solutions are a big part of the next chapter [for Agco].""

But Hansotia goes one step further noting that 2020 was a big year for agriculture. ""All around the world I think the consumer has started to realize the importance of the farmer the importance of the global food supply and how fragile it can be"" he says. ""The value of the farmer rose this last year which is fantastic.""

But he has a warning. ""Agriculture must be careful its practices are not painted with a negative paintbrush as contributing to challenges like global climate change” he notes. ""There is a role that agriculture needs to play in reducing its footprint but at the same time agriculture is one of the only industries that can help contribute to solving the problem taking carbon out of the air trapping it back in the soil.""

The combination of smart machines being farmer-centric and putting those innovations to work is a way Hansotia sees Agco helping farmers boost that sustainability story. ""I see that as one of our [key] elements to help agriculture focus on the right things; help our farmers stay productive and sustainable."" The company recently named Louisa Parker Smith as the new director for global sustainability.

Agco's investment in an agronomy team and creation of the Agco Crop Tours showing a range of insights on planter technology fertilizer application planting data and other crop production issues will be part of that future sustainability strategy.

Hansotia says that team will be part of an effort to look at the issue and explore the economics behind those practices. ""And we'll work on how we can help the farmer make more money"" he says.

Carving a digital future

Every major ag equipment company is involved in digital agriculture. Hansotia says Agco is set apart because it is taking an open architecture approach to the future. Working with AgIntegrated in the U.S. and DKE in Europe Agco is developing a platform where a farmer's data can be housed securely in the cloud but easily shared with trusted advisers as needed.

""Our approach has been to make data capture movement analytics all of it easy and open"" he says. ""That's really our focus rather than come through our own proprietary network.""

As Hansotia looks toward his opportunities for Agco he sums it up succinctly: ""Digital solutions are a big part of the next chapter.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMudGhlYWR2b2NhdGUuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvdGhlYWR2b2NhdGUvbmFtZS9kYXZpZC1wb3J0ZXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9Nzg0NjQzMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Porter Obituary (2021) - Denham Springs LA - The Advocate,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.theadvocate.com/us/obituaries/theadvocate/name/david-porter-obituary?id=7846430 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMudGhlYWR2b2NhdGUuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvdGhlYWR2b2NhdGUvbmFtZS9kYXZpZC1wb3J0ZXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9Nzg0NjQzMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9saWFtLXNhbG1vbi01LWxvc2VzLWJhdHRsZS13aXRoLXRlcm1pbmFsLWJyYWluLWNhbmNlctIBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9saWFtLXNhbG1vbi01LWxvc2VzLWJhdHRsZS13aXRoLXRlcm1pbmFsLWJyYWluLWNhbmNlci9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Liam Salmon 5 loses battle with terminal brain cancer,"Five-year-old Liam Salmon lost his nearly year-long battle to a pediatric brain tumor on New Year’s Eve.

Liam is the son of Howard and Mary Salmon of Anderson California. The family plans to have a celebration of life service post-COVID-19 once large groups are allowed to gather again.

His infectious smile and love of big rigs and John Deere tractors captured the hearts of many in the trucking industry and agriculture community as they rallied around Liam to grant his wish for mail for his fifth birthday wish in October. Law enforcement agencies from across the country mailed him patches calling him “Officer Liam.”

Liam was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) a pediatric brain tumor that infiltrates the pons portion of the brainstem that controls breathing sleeping and balance on January 4 2020.

Soon after hearing about Liam’s fatal diagnosis the St. Christopher Truckers Relief Fund (SCF) provided the Salmons with financial assistance — paying two of the couple’s house payments — so Howard a 24-year owner-operator could take time off of the road to be with Liam during his radiation treatments according to the SCF statement.

Howard and Liam also were featured on the marketing materials for TravelCenters of America’s ‘Be A Champion of Change’ fundraiser benefiting SCF.

“Liam touched so many lives in his short life” Howard Salmon a veteran truck driver said in the SCF statement. “This trucker’s son was a ‘mini-me.’”

Since 2008 SCF a nonprofit 501(c)(3) has helped thousands of professional truck drivers and their families with financial needs due to current medical problems.





“His name will remain in the hearts of many people” Salmon said. “He wanted daddy to be able to help other kids so that is what we will be doing from now on.”

Liam’s heartbreaking prognosis

On Jan. 4 2020 doctors at UC Davis Children’s Hospital in Sacramento discovered a brain tumor. Liam was quickly scheduled for a biopsy but the results were not good Salmon told FreightWaves in October.

After digesting this news the Salmons were dealt another devastating blow. Currently there is no cure for DIPG which has a 0% survival rate.

As an owner-operator Howard Salmon only makes money when his wheels turn. However the Salmons made the decision to park the truck and spend every day with Liam.

Liam was later transferred to the University of California in San Fransisco where he underwent 30 rounds of radiation which he completed on March 17. Before Liam’s death his doctors in California had joined forces with a North Carolina doctor who is working on a new chemotherapy treatment to shrink brain tumors.

‘Tractor boy’ Liam loved mail

Before Liam’s terminal diagnosis of DIPG Salmon described Liam as his “shadow.”

“He used to walk around my truck with me” Salmon said. “If I kicked the tires so did he. That’s what little boys do. They follow dad.”





Liam also known as “tractor boy” by his friends and family had a simple request for his fifth birthday: mail. And boy did he get his wish after FreightWaves posted an article about Liam’s love of mail John Deere and Legos. The trucking industry and John Deere’s Twitter followers quickly responded and found birthday cards and little surprises to send him.

His supporters also donated to his Liam Strong GoFundMe page set up by his aunt Jennifer Syfert so that his dad Howard could park his truck and “make every day about Liam.”

However Liam’s condition worsened in late December. His family and friends held a prayer vigil for him a night before his passing.

The Salmons plan to honor Liam by helping other kids affected by DIPG as they have witnessed firsthand the physical emotional and financial toll this devastating fatal disease takes on families.

Howard Salmon also appeared on WHAT THE TRUCK?!? to update listeners and readers about Liam’s condition educate the industry about DIPG and advocate for more research funding to study this fatal brain cancer affecting children.

According to The Michael Mosier Defeat DIPG Foundation only 4% of all cancer research money is spent on pediatric cancers. The organization said the entire amount spent annually on DIPG research — approximately $3 million to $5 million — is less than 0.0005% of the total funding for cancer research.

Approximately 300 children are diagnosed with DIPG each year in the U.S. The average life expectancy of a child diagnosed with this disease is 6 months to 1 year.

His parents also wanted to thank everyone who helped make Liam’s last year special.

“Drivers please take it from me — make every day with your family full of love” Howard Salmon said. “Liam taught me the meaning of love.”

CEO Ed Bastian writes in a New Year's Day memo to employees that he expects 2021 to start with travel deeply depressed like it was last year. But as vaccines become more widely available he expects a turning point especially in business travel. He says Delta should generate positive cash flow by the spring.

Bastian wrote that there is uncertainty over what travel demand will look like once significant numbers of people are vaccinated and that Delta must be nimble and ready for change.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % DAL DELTA AIR LINES INC. 51.56 +0.53 +1.04%

“Just as we've never experienced a global pandemic in our history we've also never had to create and execute a plan for recovery from one” Bastian wrote. “Our success will depend on our collaboration our willingness to be open to new ideas our ability to adapt and our humility in recognizing that we won't always know the answers.”

GENERAL MOTORS POACHES DELTA CFO TO FILL FINANCE SEAT

Air travel is less than half of what it was in 2019 but it has recovered a bit from a staggering 96% decline in mid-April of last year.

It's unclear just how quickly vaccines will be distributed across the U.S. Over the past few weeks Trump administration health officials had talked about a goal of shipping enough vaccine by the end of the month to inoculate 20 million Americans. Earlier this week the government said 14 million doses had been shipped but only 2.8 million injections had been given. Officials said there is a lag in reporting vaccinations but they are still happening more slowly than expected. They expect the pace will pick up next week.

Virgin Atlantic has massively devalued Delta awards eviscerating any value in all but the narrowest of circumstances without notice. Even absent official confirmation this devaluation has Delta’s fingerprints all over it.

Huge No-Notice Delta Devaluation Via Virgin Atlantic Flying Club

Without notice Virgin Atlantic moved to a distance-based award chart on Delta redemptions. Awards are still priced on a per-segment basis and in some cases 175% higher than before.

As a point of comparison prior to 2021 Virgin Atlantic charged the following for Delta premium cabin redemptions:

Let me give you an example. For over a year I have been eyeing a Los Angeles – Shanghai trip on Delta Air Lines to experience Delta One on the A350. The pandemic meant such travel was impossible in 2020 but I hoped to do it this year.

Two days ago the trip cost 60000 miles for a one-way business class ticket. Now the same flight costs 165000 miles one-way. That’s right folks a 175% increase in price without notice.

There really are no more sweet spots in premium cabins unless you are making a shorthaul redemption under 500 miles.

Was Delta Behind This Sudden Move?

Delta acquired a 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic in 2012. The two carriers are joint venture partners. Delta charged significantly more miles for its own flights than did Virgin Atlantic. Now the playing field has been leveled.

Do you really think Virgin Atlantic decided to make this change without pressure from Delta? Not when its business model (with partnerships including American Express Chase and Citi) relies upon incoming transfers and consumer redemptions.

I pressed Delta for details and received no response.

Virgin Atlantic’s statement is laughably misleading:

“We recognise how much our members value the extensive range of redemption partner options available through Flying Club including flights with our joint venture partner Delta Air Lines. The recent changes contribute to some considerable savings on reward seats meaning members can go further for fewer Virgin Points. Across all classes the redemption pricing remains competitive.”

Here’s what I think happened: Delta saw an uptick in partner bookings from Virgin Atlantic and decided that it was simply too much. In many cases Virgin Atlantic was charging less than half of what Delta charged for the same flight.

In that sense I suppose the change should not come as a surprise. What does come as a surprise however is that Virgin Atlantic gave us no notice. That is shameful and shows a total and complete lack of transparency and respect for Flying Club members.

CONCLUSION

I have miles in Virgin Atlantic and have no idea what I’ll use them for…certainly not on Delta any longer. It is a reminder that points are a depreciating asset and unpredictable in nature and value. As a consequence make an effort to collect points in flexible currencies like American Express Membership Rewards or Chase Ultimate Rewards and only transfer when you are ready to book.

I’m done transferring prospectively when a lucrative 40% transfer bonus appears. Because the price of my award went up 175%…

Oh and if you were planning on booking an ANA award with Virgin Atlantic I’d get on that. Today.

Referring to the 2020 rollover campaign Kathryn Steel a spokeswoman for Delta stated ""The MQM rollover.. should take 1 - 2 weeks.""

This year the rollover has started earlier than expected. TPG's Scott Mayerowitz woke up today to find that his MQMs had already rolled over as of January 3.

How the Delta MQM rollover works

If you're new to Delta Medallion status here's a quick overview of how the rollover works: You already know that you needed to fly a certain number of miles (MQM) or segments (MQS) and spend a certain amount of money (MQD) to reach each status tier. For Silver Medallion the lowest status tier the thresholds are 25000 MQMs or 30 MQSs and $3000 MQDs.

In a normal year any extra MQMs earned beyond a specific status level would roll over to the next year. Once you crossed the threshold for Silver (or higher) in 2019 (thus earning status for 2020) you may have continued earning MQMs in 2019 but not quite enough to reach the next status tier. The extra MQMs you earned were automatically deposited into your account toward your 2021 status.

For example if you earned 32000 MQMs in 2020 and reached Silver Medallion the ""extra"" 7000 above your status threshold get rolled over into the new year and help you get a head start for elite-status qualification. However due to the pandemic Delta will be rolling over all MQMs earned last year not just the extras earned beyond a specific status level. So if you earned 101000 MQMs last year as Scott did you should see the same number of MQMs posting to your account in the coming days.

Both India and the United States have further relaxed their respective guidelines for fully-vaccinated international arrivals. Though unlike before travel between USA and India is still subject to certain regulations. There is a new update every other day in the constantly volatile scenario of international air travel.

We at IndianEagle.com a leading travel-booking partner of Indians in USA keep this space up to date in order to ensure hassle-free travel for you. This article is part of the continued series on the US-India air bubble travel from departure to arrival as Indian Eagle is committed to making travel simpler and easier these unprecedented times.

No RT-PCR tests for children (below 5 years) traveling to India

After 15 months of air bubble flights between USA and India children under 5 years of age are exempted from taking an RT-PCR test before and after arrival in India. The most sought–after relaxation for children from abroad came into effect on November 12 2021. Until then even infants on lap were subject to pre-arrival COVID-19 testing for travel to India.

India resumes e-visa services for most categories

Since the onset of the pandemic in India e-visa services had been suspended. With effect from March 30 2021 the Government of India resumed e-visa services in some categories including e-medical visa e-medical attendant visa e-business visa and e-conference visa to India. Those who have obtained an e-visa in any of these categories on or after March 30 2021 will be allowed entry into India. The visas issued in these categories before March 30 2021 are redundant.

On November 15 2021 India started issuing e-Tourist visa e-Emergency visa and e-X Misc visa. All tourist visas to India issued before October 6 2021 are currently invalid. Foreign citizens need to apply for a fresh e-Tourist visa that is valid for 120 days from issuance for a single entry to India. Currently an e-Tourist visa allows maximum 30 days on stay in India on a single entry.

India’s quarantine rules for international arrivals

The quarantine rules for international travelers to India have been relaxed to a great extent since the revised guidelines took effect on October 25 2021. There is no institutional quarantine in India unless an international traveler shows symptoms similar to those of COVID-19 and tests positive for the novel coronavirus on arrival.

Even there is no home-quarantine for fully-vaccinated international arrivals in India. The current guidelines for entry to and arrival in India exempt fully-vaccinated overseas travelers from additional testing and home-quarantine. You are eligible for this relaxation only if you are found asymptomatic during thermal screening on arrival at an entry airport in India. Self-health monitoring will apply to you for 14 days.

If you are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated you are subject to a self-paid RT-PCR test on arrival 7-day home quarantine and a COVID test on day 8 in India. If the result of the test to be taken on day 8 is negative you shall only self-monitor your health for the next 7 days.

Airlines that B1/B2 visa holders can travel on from India

Since November 8 2021 fully-vaccinated B1/B2 visa holders from India have been traveling to the United States; all thanks to the Presidential Proclamation that lifted the #travelban and #entryrestrictions on the premise of vaccination. Indians having a valid US visitor visa do no longer need NIE approval or 14-day stopover in a third country if they are fully-vaccinated with Covishield of Covaxin at least 15 days before their scheduled travel.

However airline-specific restrictions do still apply to their travel from India. Indian passport holders except spouses of US citizens cannot board European airlines for travel to USA from India. It is because of the air bubble agreement with Indian government that British Airways Lufthansa Air France and Virgin Atlantic are not onboarding Indian citizens if their final destination is beyond Europe. They can travel on flights from India to USA operated by Air India United Airlines American Airlines Delta Airlines Emirates Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways.

Regulations for travelers from India if Dubai transit time is over 10 hours

Travelers from India among the restricted countries are required to leave Dubai Airport’ terminal if the transit time or layover is over 10 hours in Dubai. In this case you can apply for Dubai Connect online at least 24 hours prior to your scheduled departure from India. A request for Dubai Connect is subject to the UAE immigration approval. If approved you will get complimentary accommodation outside the airport complimentary visa on arrival and free airport transfer service.

If denied you will have to arrange accommodation outside the airport and must apply for a visa on arrival or have a pre-approved Dubai transit visa. In case you are unable to provide evidence of accommodation (hotel or a friend/relative’s residence in Dubai) outside Dubai Airport (DXB) you are likely to be denied boarding at the departure airport in India.

As per the UAE’s current regulations travelers from India with the transit time/layover more than 10 hours at Dubai Airport must take a COVID-19 PCR test within 48 hours prior to scheduled departure from India and a (additional) Rapid PCR test at the departure airport within 6 hours of scheduled boarding. These two test reports must be negative and have a QR code.

The above restriction does not apply to passengers from India if the transit time/layover is less than 10 hours.

Indians need International Travel Certificate for flying to USA

An International Travel Certificate is nothing but proof of vaccination that a fully-vaccinated Indian must have for traveling to the United States. You can download it from the government of India’s CoWin portal. The certificate is compliant with WHO’s digital format for vaccination proof. The vaccine certificate/international travel certificate should specify the vaccine name vaccine type vaccine manufacturer number and dates of the doses administered other than your date of birth and passport number. Log in to the CoWin portal with your registered phone number navigate to the ‘International Travel Certificate’ section and click on it. Enter your date of birth (as per the given format) and passport number. Then click on ‘Submit’. The certificate is ready to be downloaded. You can take a printout or carry a soft copy on your mobile device.

Can PIO cardholders exit India after December 31 2021?

PIO cardholders can travel to India before or on December 31 2021 but they are likely to face issues with return travel from India if their PIO card is not converted into an OCI card by December 31. This is the extended deadline for the PIO to OCI conversion. “Indian Immigration Check Post(s) will continue to consider all PIO cards valid for exit from/entry into India till December 31 2021 as the last and final opportunity” according to the Indian Embassy USA. If you are a PIO cardholder traveling to India you must enter and/or exit India by the end of 2021.

The same relaxation is in place for OCI cardholders below 20 and above 50 years of age with renewed passports but old OCI cards.

Travelers from India must have negative COVID reports with QR code

Effective from May 22 2021 a QR code is mandatory for all negative COVID reports that people traveling out of India need. If you are scheduled to travel to USA or any other country on or after May 22 your negative COVID PCR report must have a QR code linking to the original report. Airlines departing India will not accept negative COVID reports without a QR code which will result in denial of boarding. This mandate came in view of the incidence of forging negative reports for international travel.

No registration for flights to and from India

Good news for international travelers flying into and out of India! Now booking VBM flights and air bubble flights is simpler and easier. India’s Ministry of Home Affairs has eased the regulations for passengers of flights under the Vande Bharat Mission and the air transport bubble arrangement. Those planning to travel on Air India’s VBM flights from abroad need not register with the Indian Embassy or consulates in the countries where they are currently residing or stranded. Similarly travelers booking air bubble flights inbound or outbound are no longer required to apply to the Ministry of Civil Aviation. It is enough to fill out a self-declaration form with your details and submit it on Air Suvidha within 72 hours prior to traveling to India.

New Guidelines for Unvaccinated Americans Returning to USA

The United States’ new international air travel system will take effect in November 2021. Accordingly the COVID-19 testing rules have been amended for unvaccinated Americans irrespective of age returning to the country from abroad this November onwards. If you are a US citizen and currently in India you will have to take a COVID-19 PCR test within 24 hours of your return flight to the US rather than within 72 hours. On top of that you will need to purchase a viral test that you will take after arrival in the US. You may be asked for a proof of the purchase at the time of boarding the return flight and/or on arrival in the US. The new guidelines effective from November 2021 will also apply to children according to Jen Psaki the White House Press Secretary.

Unvaccinated Americans traveling back from abroad will self-quarantine for seven full days even though they test negative in the viral test after arrival. However vaccinated Americans won’t be required to self-quarantine on testing negative after arrival. Whether the amended rules will apply to partially-vaccinated Americans flying back home is still not clear. What type of a viral test to be bought and taken by unvaccinated US citizens returning from abroad is yet to be specified by the CDC. Basically nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) and antigen test are the two types of a viral COVID-19 test.

Delhi Airport’s AI-based COVID testing facility delivers results in 10 minutes

Delhi IGI Airport is home to India’s first and only AI-enabled COVID-19 testing facility. Located in Terminal 3 for international civil flight operations the new facility can conduct antigen tests on passengers of an entire international flight in a couple of minutes and deliver results in 10-15 minutes. This makes it easier for passengers traveling to destinations including the United States which require negative antigen test reports for entry. Some of the passengers of Lufthansa Air France and KLM have successfully used the facility and got digital reports on their mobile phones. New Delhi Airport’s artificial intelligence-enabled COVID testing facility uses computer vision technology paper-free backend and scalable node architecture to cater to last-minute testing needs of outbound international flyers.

COVID-19 Test is mandatory for travelers flying into USA

With effect on January 26 2021 all international travelers flying into the United States must provide a negative RT-PCR test report or valid documentation of recent recovery from COVID-19 at the time of boarding flights for any destination in the US. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requires you to take an antigen or NAAT (nucleic acid amplification test for example RT-PCR) test within 3 days prior to your scheduled departure for the US and submit the negative report to the airline. Antibody test reports will not be accepted for entry to the United States. Airlines are directed to deny boarding to those who do not provide a valid negative test report or proof of recovery. The documentation of recovery could be a letter from a certified healthcare provider or a public health official ascertaining that you are safe to travel.

This requirement for traveling to the United States applies to all international travelers including US citizens and legal permanent residents. The CDC also recommends that international arrivals get tested within 5 days and quarantine themselves (stay indoors) for 7 days after their arrival in the US.

Qatar’s guidelines for transit of travelers from India

Traveling to USA from India via Doha in Qatar? Effective April 29 2021 Qatar’s guidelines for transit in Doha apply to travelers from India. It requires you to take an RT-PCR test at a medical center/lab approved by the government of India within 48 hours prior to boarding your flight in India and produce a negative report at the time of check-in at the departure airport. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in denial of boarding on Qatar Airways flights from India.

Onsite COVID-19 test at Indian airports

Online booking of slots for COVID-19 tests at major Indian airports is available. Currently the COVID testing facility for international arrivals is available at Delhi IGI Airport Mumbai CSMI Airport BLR Kempegowda Airport Chennai MAA International Airport and Kochi International Airport Kerala. Not every passenger arriving from abroad needs to undergo a COVID test at the entry airport. Those arriving into India on nonstop flights from USA and other countries are not required to take a test on arrival provided they carry a negative RT-PCR report uploaded on Air Suvidha. If your flights to India transit in the Middle East Europe Brazil or South Africa you must take a molecular test on arrival at the entry airport in India.

Lufthansa’s COVID-19 test policy

In September 2020 Lufthansa will be operating 160 round-trip flights to India. In the September schedule of air bubble flights to India Lufthansa will serve Bengaluru Mumbai and New Delhi. India’s continued air transport bubble arrangement with the United States and Germany has facilitated the September schedule of Lufthansa flights to India from USA and Canada via Frankfurt or Munich.

A negative COVID-19 test is not mandatory for boarding Lufthansa flights. Only asymptomatic people are allowed to travel on Lufthansa though. However Lufthansa requires passengers to carry a medical certificate and a negative COVID test report in case they will not be able to keep wearing masks on board due to medical reasons. The conditional exemption to wearing masks during the flight will take effect from September 1 and apply to passengers of Lufthansa group airlines. The COVID-19 test must be taken within 48 hours of undertaking the journey.

India’s new no-fly rule for COVID19 travel

In a zero-tolerance approach to ensuring COVID protection on board India’s aviation regulator directs airlines to put travelers refusing to cover their face on the no-fly list. If a passenger does not comply with the obligation of wearing a mask or face covering he/she is likely to be denied boarding or deplaned. They may also be barred from flying for a certain period of time. The crew members of a flight reserve the right to decide who to put on the no-fly list. Several major airlines including Delta Airlines have the same ‘no-fly’ policy for passengers amid the COVID19 pandemic. The consequences of ending up on a no-fly list may include a lifetime ban on flying in India.

Hot meals and inflight entertainment are back on board

India’s civil aviation ministry has issued new directives for airlines operating domestic and international flights under the Vande Bharat Mission and the air transport bubble arrangement. As per the new SOP passengers can be served pre-packed meals snacks and beverages aboard domestic flights depending on the flight time and the policy of the operating airlines. Airlines operating international flights are also allowed to serve hot meals with limited beverages on board amidst precautions against COVID19. Airlines are directed to ensure that completely disposable trays plates cutlery and containers are used on board. In all travel classes flight attendants will be serving beverages in single-use disposable units. In-flight beverage-pouring service will continue to remain suspended. They will wear a new set of gloves for serving every meal.

Since international travel resumed under the Vande Bharat Mission inflight entertainment had remained banned. The latest directives allow inflight entertainment on domestic and international flights. Airlines need to follow certain regulations concerning inflight entertainment like providing disposable earphones or disinfecting earphones before every flight. With the lifting of ban on inflight entertainment family travelers won’t have a tough time controlling kids on board."

How Juan and Robyn Dixon lost their fortune

Juan and Robyn were living the good life off of Juan’s NBA fortune but it all came crumbling down in 2012. According to Robyn she trusted a close friend of the couple’s fellow basketball player Earl Badu to invest their money. Instead of investing the money Badu reportedly stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Dixons. Badu later jumped to his death in a suicide.

Robyn filed for bankruptcy claiming that she was $217000 of debt and earning just about $2000 monthly per Radar Online. Among her debts included $1489813 to a mortgage company $28372 in car payments $16577 to American Express $10871 to Discover and about $3000 to Bloomingdale’s.

A bankruptcy dismissal came in 2014. Still she was forced to enroll in credit counseling as well as pay the IRS $16183 in back taxes. Unfortunately the Dixons also lost their Maryland mansion and divorced in the process.

Robyn has expressed much guilt regarding the loss of their fortune on RHOP explaining that she was the one who chose to invest the money. She told Bravo TV in 2016:

“The pain and hurt that I felt in 2012 was beyond any other hurt that I have ever felt. And although the loss of money really created huge problems for us it was the evil lies and deception that hurt the most. On top of the devastation from the loss of money and the loss of a friendship (he was even a groomsman in our wedding) I experienced the shock of my life when that same friend took his own life in order to avoid the consequences of his actions. This truly was the most difficult time of my life.” Robyn Dixon Bravotv.com

Juan and Robyn rebuilt their finances and are now building their dream home

Robyn and Juan spent the next few years working hard to rebuild their finances. Though split up at the time the couple began living together to save money. They downsized and lived off of a budget.

Juan transitioned into coaching college basketball eventually getting a head coaching position at Coppin State University. Robyn began appearing on RHOP in 2013 and used the money earned from the show to start various business ventures including buying and flipping homes. She also has a hat line now available for purchase online.

The Dixon’s also reconciled and got re-engaged in December 2019. Robyn revealed during the season 5 reunion that the couple are now building their dream home.

“We actually are building a house. We just got the permits so they’re gonna break ground very soon” she said on part three of the reunion. “And then hopefully we’ll be done by May.”

Despite their progress Robyn did run into a snag when the IRS hit her with a $90000 bill. Juan made it clear that Robyn would be responsible for paying it. She now says the debt is behind her.

Her future on the show however is unclear. Rumors are surfacing that she has not been asked to return for season 6. Hopefully she’s invested her money well to extend beyond her time on the show.",,,,,,,,,,,,

How about one who told you the pandemic was no big deal while buying shares in a company that sells body bags?

Both Republican incumbents in Georgia’s crucial runoffs that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate were investigated this year for allegedly engaging in pandemic-related insider trading.

The two are the Senate’s wealthiest member Kelly Loeffler appointed in 2019 and running for a full term of her own and its seventh wealthiest member David Perdue a businessman sued for wage theft and discrimination while losing $150 million in two years as CEO of Dollar General.

After the notorious briefing Loeffler who joined Trump in dismissing the pandemic and her husband who almost never trades to avoid conflict with his job as chair of the Intercontinental Stock Exchange made 27 trades worth between $1.2 and $3.1 million that helped them weather the virus-triggered crash. On the same day Perdue began accumulating $825000 worth of stock in DuPont a company that makes personal protective equipment and body bags and sold an equal amount of other stocks in over a hundred other transactions. He’d already raised eyebrows when as a member of the Senate’s cybersecurity subcommittee he promoted FireEye a cybersecurity firm in which he held $250000 worth of stock a fraction of his 2596 trades since joining the Senate. It makes you wonder when he has time to legislate and why Martha Stewart who prepared the country to bake sourdough bread as a hedge against insanity will be remembered for going to jail over one trade.

Bill Barr’s Justice Department and the Senate Ethics Committee so-called both ended their investigations into the suspiciously timed trades. The only investigation for insider trading that remains open just happens to be against a senator who’s retired.

But while Washington has turned a blind eye Georgians have not. During the Republican primary the candidate Trump backed former Rep. Doug Collins said he was “sickened” by Loeffler “profiting off the pain” of COVID victims. Whenever it comes up Loeffler talks about her humble beginnings growing soybeans. In the general election Perdue’s opponent Democrat Jon Ossoff got off the ground when he ripped through the accusations at their first debate and Perdue just stared ahead speechless. Rather than endure that again there’s been an empty podium at subsequent debates where Perdue would be if he could muster a defense.

On Monday the final day of campaigning President-elect Biden will try to help get Democrats Ossoff and Raphael Warnock over the top while President Trump taking time from his exhausting schedule of golfing pardoning his friends and pushing through the most federal executions since 1896 will try to un-depress turnout after two months of bitter complaints about how Georgia’s Republican officials supposedly allowed Biden to steal the election from him. The charge was supported by little more than a purported eyewitness found by Rudy Giuliani who was actually a temp who wiped down computer screens for one day at one polling place. Weeks of Trump telling voters the “system is rigged” GOP strategist Frank Luntz told Fox is having “a debilitating impact on whether his people will vote.” He’s right. Why bother if a gremlin named Roy Raffensberger—the Republican Secretary of State’s imaginary brother in Trump’s warped mind—is going to eat your ballot?

On New Year’s Eve in the pouring rain early voters in Cobb County were standing in a line two football fields long telling reporters they would be staying for a long as it took to vote. It’s a race that will decide whether Mitch McConnell remains majority leader or lives out what’s likely his last term under the thumb of Chuck Schumer and if the pandemic some profited from will finally be treated like the threat to the country it is.

Perdue and Leoffler got off for now. Of course they did. The legislation supposed to stop insider trading largely sets up disclosure rules that do little to stop inside trading since members of Congress are by definition insiders. That’s so obvious that uber-capitalist Republican Sen. John Cornyn said that the only way to deal with the problem is to prohibit members from trading stocks altogether.

Or to send those that game the system packing.

In a very brief message on its website ALDI wrote the new store at 3140 Floyd Blvd. will open Jan. 15. No further details were provided.

ALDI a German discount grocery chain first announced plans to open a Sioux City location in early 2018. The store was initially expected to open by 2019 but that year passed without any noticeable progress at the corner lot of Floyd Boulevard and Outer Drive.

Construction finally commenced in the middle of this past year though ALDI remained tight-lipped about when the store would open or any other details.

The store is expected to be around 22000 square feet and employ around 15 people. It will compete directly with Sioux City's five other major grocery retailers -- Hy-Vee Fareway Walmart Sam's Club and Save-A-Lot as well as the various retailers that sell some food items including Target Dollar General Fleet Farm Bomgaars Menards Dollar Tree Walgreens and some others.

ALDI supermarkets are known for their modest physical footprints and highly efficient operations -- shoppers have to deposit a quarter to use a shopping cart and bring their own grocery bags (or use empty display boxes and crates to box their purchases). The vast majority of ALDI merchandise consists of in-house brands.

Given ALDI's history in other metro areas it seems possible that more than one store may eventually appear in Sioux City as all the surrounding metros have more than one. But the chain has not said anything on the subject.

Justin Tyler Simmoneau of 8681 SW 34th Place was charged with domestic assault and resisting without violence after the incident which happened Wednesday night at his residence.

A Marion County sheriff’s deputy responded to the incident location where the victim was parked across the street. She said she went to Simmoneau’s home to pick up an item from him. She said Simmoneau gave it to her but he was extremely hostile and aggressive. The nature of the item that was being picked up was redacted from the sheriff’s office report.

The victim said she recorded audio of the exchange because she knew Simmoneau would be hostile with her. The deputy listened to the audio and heard Simmoneau say “I’ll beat both y’all’s asses.” The victim said her father was present during the exchange and Simmoneau was talking to both of them according to the report.

The deputy also heard Simmoneau say “I’m about to beat the (expletive deleted) out of y’all.” A female voice is heard telling him to calm down and stop and the victim said the voice belonged to Simmoneau’s sister the report said.

Simmoneau also said on the recording “If you don’t bring me (redacted) back I’m going to (expletive deleted) you up.” The victim said at the time he said that she was holding (redacted). Simmoneau then said “You think this is good? I’ll (expletive deleted) kill you. You don’t deserve (redacted)” according to the report.

The victim said Simmoneau was about 10 feet away from her when he made these statements. She said Simmoneau’s sister was using her body to keep him from approaching her. The victim said she was in fear that Simmoneau was going to carry out his threats the report said.

Deputies responded to Simmoneau’s residence where they immediately tried to detain him. Simmoneau tensed his arms to keep from being handcuffed. He also tried to pull his arms away after being told he was being detained according to the report.

After being read his Miranda warning Simmoneau admitted to making the threatening statements to the victim. He was taken to the Marion County Jail where he was being held Sunday on $2000 bond. Simmoneau is scheduled to appear in Marion County Court on Feb. 19.",,,,,,

I can usually pick up a copy of The News Tribune for a buck at The Dollar Tree on Sixth Avenue in the Highland Hill Shopping Center so that is my first stop. I was in shock and disbelief when I approached The Dollar Tree and found a temporary chain link fence blocking access and plywood over the windows and doors. I was devastated knowing that people on a budget need The Dollar Tree for everything from household needs to food items.

Of course in today’s world most big corporations NEVER publish a contact address to answer questions so I found out who rents the space at Highland Hill (a firm in Bellevue) and sent an email to Betsy. Perhaps I will get an answer next week however I also published a message on Facebook asking if anyone knew why it was closed. In about an hour I had an answer. Friend Danelle Votta had the answer and images. The roof gave way on the 21st of December and crashed through the ceiling.

It looks like much of the damage initially came down on the holiday decorations but of course the rain damaged most of the goods. The incident happened about one in the morning so no one was there to be hurt from falling debris. Water and temperatures will cause most of the destruction.

The Dollar Tree is a great place for purchasing all kinds of affordable items as well as food. From Jimmy Dean sausages to packages of egg noodles The Dollar Tree has bargains galore. For example I love Peppadew peppers but you can’t find them everywhere. The last time I checked at Metro Market they were ten dollars a pound. I can purchase fourteen ounce jars of Peppadew peppers for only a dollar. I bought five jars for five dollars total.

A woman shopping in a store. A guy gulping beer.

All represent behaviors people have displayed while testifying in Benton County courtrooms -- online ones.

Judges across the country are using video conferencing systems for court since the covid-19 pandemic started last year. Online proceedings have affected the usual formal courtroom settings.

Benton County Circuit Judge Robin Green said she or her bailiff have had to ask individuals to put on clothes for hearings. She's asked people to pull their cars over and park instead of participating as they drive.

""Some defendants will use their phone for their court hearing while clearly shopping in a store"" Green said. ""There have also been a few defendants caught on a hot microphone saying inappropriate things they did not realize we could hear.""

Green recalled one case where the woman was seen standing in an aisle near the cookies at a Dollar Tree.

""I would have been angry but she had good reception"" on her phone Green joked after the October hearing.

Green said she hasn't ruled anyone in contempt of court related to an online courtroom hearing.

Benton County Circuit Judge Brad Karren has warned some about wearing hats. He's also told the occasional person to park his car. Karren reprimanded a man in October who was sitting in a barber's chair waiting for a haircut when his case was called.

Judges have targeted some attorneys for not wearing coats or neckties.

""People using video conferencing still need to conduct themselves in the same fashion as if they are sitting in the courtroom"" Benton County Circuit Judge John Scott said. ""They are still in a courtroom.""

Scott said several of his cases each day now involve using online conferencing. Some of the cases are in person but witnesses may testify using the video conferencing technology.

He stopped a hearing to tell one of the parties to put her dogs out of the room. He's also told one attorney to pull over his car and stop so they could have the hearing Scott said.

Scott said circuit judges sent notices to attorneys the requirements and expectations for video conferencing court are the same as being in a courtroom. He believes it's important to maintain the traditional rules in court.

Benton County Circuit Judge Doug Schrantz agrees with Scott.

""It's coat and tie attire"" Schrantz said of the dress code for male attorneys. ""It's a hearing and just because attorneys are sitting at their desks it doesn't mean the same rules do not apply.""

Schrantz believes it's important that all parties respect observe and preserve the dignity of the legal proceedings. He's had his own unusual video conferencing encounter.

He was presiding over a divorce case during an online morning hearing. Schrantz granted the couple's divorce and then saw the man gulp a beer. He asked one of his staff if it was actually beer she responded ""Yes that's my brand of beer.""

Schrantz didn't confront the man about the incident.

Mike Armstrong a Rogers attorney said it's difficult to have some proceedings via video conferencing. He said one hearing had to be stopped because a man involved in the hearing was outside and there was a train going by. Armstrong said dogs also were barking in the background.

Armstrong doesn't believe the formal setting of the courtroom should be relaxed for video conferencing. He feels more formality should be inserted in the online proceedings.

""I'm not sure how we do that but I feel like allowing the other party to appear in a hoodie from his back porch with dogs barking and trains cruising by in the background takes away from the reverence of a court proceeding"" he said.

Armstrong reminds his clients to dress appropriately for court.

Rogers attorney Drew Miller said he and other attorneys at the law firm tell clients to act and wear clothing like they are going to court. Miller said he thinks judges should keep the formal rules.

Jay Saxton Benton County's chief public defender said he's seen topless men grabbing shirts after the judge comments on their lack of clothing. He said the other classic incidents are people shopping or the ones that constantly walk during their hearings.

""We tell them to stand still and don't go anywhere and it doesn't help"" Saxton said.

Saxton said he feels it important the same court decorum remains.

""I don't think they need to have hats or sunglasses on in court or on video"" he said. ""I don't think they need to be disrespectful to the court in any manner. I guess I'm just that way.""

Armstrong said the difficulties with online conferencing extend beyond court decorum.

He said cross-examination of witnesses is the toughest part. It's impossible to recreate the meaningful interaction that attorneys have with the opposing party or their witnesses for the judge over a computer monitor.

Armstrong said he's found the presentation of evidence to be one of the toughest aspects of online hearings.

""Getting exhibits before the judge can be tricky on a normal day"" he said. ""It's sometimes impossible when you're trying to thread the needle via"" online conferencing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9vaGlvL25hbWUvYW5uZS1ydWZmbmVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMzMzg2NDc10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Anne Ruffner Obituary (2021) - St. Petersburg FL - Akron Beacon Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/ohio/name/anne-ruffner-obituary?id=33386475 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9vaGlvL25hbWUvYW5uZS1ydWZmbmVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMzMzg2NDc10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3Npb3V4Y2l0eWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYWxkaS1ncm9jZXJ5LXN0b3JlLWV4cGVjdGVkLXRvLW9wZW4taW4tc2lvdXgtY2l0eS1vbi1qYW4tMTUvYXJ0aWNsZV80ODRhNzA4YS02MzMzLTUxYmMtOTZjOS00YzgwMGVlMTg5ZjguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ALDI grocery store expected to open in Sioux City on Jan. 15,"SIOUX CITY -- The long-awaited opening of an ALDI grocery store in Sioux City is at hand.

(WKRG) — A video of a teenage driver in a Walmart parking lot has gone viral.

The viral TikTok video shows a teenager apologizing to the person recording the video for hitting their car. You can then see the damage to the blue car he refers to. After that you see the teen try to drive off before ramming into the back of a parked truck in turn hitting another car.

The latest video has 3.9 million views with it being posted multiple times with similar view counts. Even social media icon pages like “Barstool Sports” shared the video.

The woman who owns the blue car in the video and the best friend of the woman who posted it to TikTok spoke to NewsNation affiliate WKRG about what happened.

I was checking out inside of Dollar Tree when a witness came in and told everyone that a blue car had just been hit in the parking lot. Just my luck it was my little blue car that had been hit while parked. After confronting the 17y/o he lied and said he didn’t hit my car. While listening to witnesses tell me otherwise he attempts to elude the scene of the wreck. He then hits two more PARKED cars during his failed escape. He gets out of the car runs into the nail salon to get the owner of the car. Apparently he was unlicensed and driving the car without permission.

There was no police report filed since the parking lot is considered private property. The owner of the cars said their insurance company has ensured that everything will be taken care of."

It was the longest the hardest the darkest — and on top of everything else full of bad climate news. The Trump administration continued its steady assault on environmental protections even as the COVID-19 pandemic devastated the country. Despite some late-breaking clean energy funding in the U.S. global stimulus spending devoted far more money to fossil fuels than renewable energy. The dip in emissions brought on by the pandemic was just that — a dip.

But we're here to tell you that this year wasn't a total wash. Even during a global pandemic with powerful forces working against it momentum toward a less fiery future kept pace. Please join us in taking a look back at six ways climate action moved forward this year.

* * *

1. Climate change was a major election issue

2020 was the year climate change finally entered the political spotlight. Look no further than the Democratic primaries where dozens of candidates competed for the title of fiercest climate hawk and tried to one-up each other with progressively more ambitious climate plans. (Senator Elizabeth Warren wowed voters by producing 14 separate documents outlining her climate agenda but the title of ""most ambitious climate plan"" still goes to her Senate colleague Bernie Sanders' $16 trillion ""Green New Deal."")

The one-upmanship continued even after Joe Biden had clinched the Democratic nomination when Biden unveiled an updated and more aggressive version of his primary climate plan. And he doubled down as the general election drew nearer — Biden released three climate-themed ads in the weeks leading up to November 3 and made history by saying he'd ""transition the oil industry"" at the final presidential debate in October.

(Clayton Aldern / Grist)

Why did presidential candidates bend over backward to show voters that they're serious about climate action? Because polls show that climate change matters to Americans. A lot. Ahead of the election a national survey showed that 58 percent of Americans were either ""somewhat concerned"" or ""very concerned"" about their communities being affected by climate change. Exit polls from the League of Conservation Voters showed that among conflicted voters (those who considered voting for both Trump and Biden) Biden was preferred over Trump on ""climate change clean energy and the environment"" by a 58-point margin.

2. Big institutions pledged to pull their cash out of fossil fuel companies

Fossil fuel companies lost a lot of money this year and not just because of the drop in demand for oil and gas caused by the pandemic. The divestment movement scored major wins as schools faith institutions and cities all over the world made new pledges to pull their investments from companies that extract and sell fossil fuels.

Prestigious schools like Oxford and Cambridge in the U.K. and Georgetown Brown American University and Cornell in the U.S. joined a growing list of colleges and universities planning to divest their endowments from fossil fuel companies. Pressure mounted on two of the wealthiest universities in the country Harvard and Yale which have a combined endowment of $72 billion as divestment activists ran for open seats on the boards that oversee the teams that manage how their endowments are invested. And while neither school committed to divestment Harvard is dipping its toes in the concept with the announcement of a still-vague plan to bring its endowment to net-zero by 2050 arguing that it will be able to work with fossil fuel companies to achieve it.

Activists weren't happy about that but they did celebrate when the $226 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund the third-largest public pension fund in the U.S. announced it would basically do the same thing by 2040. The main difference was that Tom DiNapoli the state's comptroller laid out a detailed roadmap for how he would achieve net-zero including a pledge to divest from companies that aren't preparing for a low-carbon economy. He's already eliminated 22 coal companies from the fund.

Whether divestment promotes the broader changes needed to decarbonize the economy is still debated. But what became more apparent in 2020 is the risk of maintaining investments in companies that aren't ready for those changes which are happening regardless. Exxon which hasn't made any commitment to reduce its total emissions did so poorly this year that it got booted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average an influential benchmark of top stocks. So if you have money in index or mutual funds there's a chance that you've divested some of your own savings from fossil fuels without even knowing it.

3. Renewables kept growing despite the pandemic

Fossil fuel companies took a catastrophic hit this year when the COVID-19 pandemic ground the economy to a standstill and sent oil prices tumbling. But the renewable energy industry proved to be far more resilient.

Skies clear of smog and other pollutants gave solar panels a boost this year especially in the U.K. where the uptick in solar power efficiency helped the country run on zero coal-fired power plant generation for more than two months for the first time in over a century. And on this side of the pond electricity generated by solar wind hydro and other renewables outpaced electricity generated by coal for 40 days straight.

In November a report from the International Energy Agency projected that renewables will account for 90 percent of the new power capacity added to grids worldwide in 2020. A different report from the global research and consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie published in December found that U.S. solar installations are expected to grow 43 percent this year.

Renewables are still getting cheaper too. A study by clean energy research firm BloombergNEF found that solar and onshore wind power are the most affordable new sources of electricity for two-thirds of the world's population. The price of electricity from onshore wind farms dropped 9 percent since mid-2019. And falling costs more efficient technology and government support in some parts of the world have fostered larger renewable power plants with the average wind farm now double the capacity it was four years ago.

To boot polling on how Americans think about energy sources like solar and wind remained consistent this year: The vast majority of Americans say developing alternative sources of energy should be prioritized over developing fossil fuels.

4. Pipelines became nearly impossible to build

Pipeline or pipe dream? Pipeline construction companies and the energy companies paying them to create the infrastructure to transport oil and gas across long distances ran into roadblock after roadblock this year. So many roadblocks in fact that some energy companies just gave up trying to build them.

That's what happened to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline over the summer: The U.S. Supreme Court gave the pipeline the green light to cross under the Appalachian Trail but a few weeks later Dominion Energy and Duke Energy the lead developers of the project decided to take a hike and dump the pipeline altogether.

(Grist)

The Dakota Access Pipeline the approval of which sparked the protests at Standing Rock in 2016 also took a critical hit over the summer when a federal judge said the company behind the project Energy Transfer and the Army Corps of Engineers had failed to conduct a sufficient environmental review. The judge ordered the pipeline to shut down while the review was conducted. An appeals court swiftly overturned that order but the company and the Army Corps still have to conduct the environmental review. When Biden takes office he could opt to shut down the pipeline entirely.

Speaking of Biden the president-elect has promised to shut down the Keystone XL pipeline by revoking the presidential permit President Trump granted the project in 2019. TC Energy the company building the project has already built some 120 miles of pipeline since last spring but if Biden makes good on his campaign promises (and green groups expect him to) he could put the kibosh on Keystone XL after he's inaugurated.

More pipelines were put on the chopping block this year: The Mountain Valley Pipeline is struggling to keep construction going as judges keep tossing out crucial permits forcing the company to hunt down new ones. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer delivered a serious blow to Enbridge's Line 5 pipeline in November ordering it shut down. Enbridge filed suit against Whitmer arguing that only the federal government has the jurisdiction to shut down pipelines but the incoming Biden administration can reaffirm Whitmer's authority and take other steps to stymie Enbridge's plans.

5. Cities put a check on emissions from buildings

A recent United Nations report found that the carbon emissions from heating cooking and using electricity in buildings hit an all-time high last year and were responsible for 28 percent of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Fortunately in 2020 efforts to rein in emissions from buildings took off.

Just a few weeks ago the cities of San Francisco Oakland and San Jose passed laws limiting the installation of appliances that run on natural gas in new buildings joining 37 other jurisdictions across California that have already done so. These ""gas bans"" have been catching on around the country: Seattle's mayor wants to update the city's building code to prohibit the use of fossil fuels in new buildings; St. Louis has new building performance standards that will effectively phase out gas appliances in larger buildings; and Brookline Massachusetts has petitioned the state to let it ban gas hookups in new buildings after an earlier effort to do so was found to conflict with state laws.

In December Washington state proposed what could be the nation's first state-level gas ban and several new state climate action plans and task forces including in New Jersey Michigan Nevada and Maryland explicitly mentioned the need to electrify buildings.

(Clayton Aldern / Grist)

But as the idea of moving away from gas in buildings gained currency some states ran in the opposite direction. Under pressure from industry lawmakers in Arizona Louisiana Oklahoma and Tennessee passed nearly identical bills this year that prohibit their own municipalities from banning gas.

To be clear decarbonizing buildings is not as simple as banning gas hookups or appliances. As more buildings go fully electric gas utilities could undergo a slow death spiral and fewer and fewer customers could end up paying to maintain a vast network of gas pipelines. But states are finally reckoning with these questions — New York California Colorado and Massachusetts all opened new investigations this year into the future of gas distribution to try to answer them.

6. The world agreed on achieving net-zero by mid-century

The idea of ""net-zero emissions"" has been around for years but in 2020 it was thrust into the mainstream as an essential tenet of climate policy around the world.

Every week seemed to bring a new announcement of a state country bank utility tech giant or even oil company promising to get to net-zero over the next few decades. Generally that means they'll get to a place where their net emissions between the CO2 they release into the atmosphere and the CO2 they suck out of it through natural and technological means are zero. Microsoft even said it would go beyond that point to ""carbon negative"" by removing all the carbon it has emitted since its founding in 1975.

In theory net-zero is a valiant goal — a 2018 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that the world needs to get to net-zero by 2050 in order to avoid the catastrophic effects expected to occur if the globe warms more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F).

But that conclusion was based on a crucial premise: First we have to dramatically reduce emissions. The whole ""net"" part of the deal should really only apply to the parts of the economy that are hardest to decarbonize like aviation and shipping. But many of the net-zero pledges made this year by companies are nebulous about when they will reduce their emissions or whether they'll do so at all. The energy companies with net-zero pledges are still expanding the fossil fuel side of their businesses and many of the tech companies with net-zero pledges are still helping those energy companies find and extract more fossil fuels.

The most important development in 2020 may not have been the slew of net-zero pledges but something a little more obscure. Companies finally began publicly accounting for the emissions tied to their supply chains and the products they produce known as ""scope 3"" emissions. Transparency around scope 3 puts more pressure on reducing emissions throughout the economy.

Next year we'll be looking to see which companies shore up their pledges with near-term targets and which ones show up in Washington to lobby for the policy changes that will help them deliver on net-zero.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbWluaW9ucG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8wMy9ub3Rld29ydGh5LWNvbW1pc3Npb24tcHJvamVjdHMtb2YtMjAyMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Noteworthy commission projects of 2020,"Be it an individual a family a business an agency a city county state or nation 2020 can essentially be summed up in eight characters COVID-19.

And while that’s certainly true for Monongalia County there was some other stuff that happened too.

But we might as well get it out of the way.

In the red

Festive as it may be red isn’t the color you want to see representing the rate at which COVID-19 is burning through your county.

In July Monongalia County became the first county in the state to hit that grim designation based on a seven-day rolling average of daily positive COVID-19 cases per 100000 population.

At that time Monongalia County represented about 30% of the state’s active cases with 436 the vast majority of which were between the ages of 18-29.

This prompted a number of reactions both locally and at the state level including an executive order by Gov. Jim Justice to shut down the county’s bars from July to October — minus a few days in September.

Throughout all of this the Monongalia County Health Department has undertaken a Herculean effort — working essentially around the clock since March to provide information testing contact tracing and now vaccine distribution.

In the black

While we’re all literally sick of hearing about the spread of COVID-19 the continued spread of development in the county is far more welcome news.

In January the Monongalia County Commission authorized $70 million in additional bonding tied to the ongoing WestRidge development in the expanded University Town Centre TIF district.

A portion of those bonds will be used to finance a new access to Mylan Park from Exit 155 (WVU/Star City) on I-79.

The Division of Highways is expected to reconfigure Exit 155 starting sometime in 2021. In August the DOH estimated the project at $66 million and said the original plan would be to turn the existing infrastructure into a divergent diamond interchange with a flyover heading west.

In October the commission extended the Morgantown Industrial Park TIF from 25 to 30 years and increased the principal amount of the district by $1.5 million to help finance studies of a new I-79 interchange that would provide direct interstate access to the back of the park and open an additional 100-plus acres for development.

Tied to the interchange and park expansion is a private investment by Mountaintop Beverage estimated at $100 million.

In lieu

With a vote on Dec. 16 the commission finalized a 30-year payment in lieu of taxes agreement with daughter companies of Longview Power clearing the way for the company’s billion-dollar gas and solar expansion.

The agreement in the works for some 18 months between the commission Longview and the Monongalia County Board of Education will result in $60.7 million for use within the county.

Those dollars include $2.5 million when Longview — going under Mountain State Renewables for the solar facility and Mountain State Clean Energy for the gas facility — finalizes project financing.

Once construction is complete just over $58.2 million will be paid over the next 30 years. Those funds will be split between PILOT ($3100000) and lease payments ($55122516).

Because the agreement is structured so the bulk of the money comes through lease payments the commission needed additional consideration from the board of education.

The PILOT/lease ratio is structured to get around the state holding PILOT payments against school districts when calculating school aid formula as it is with the original Longview PILOT passed in 2003 and worth $108 million — $105 million in PILOT payments and $3 million in lease payments.

“About 98% of these dollars will stay here in Mon County as opposed to the other agreement where only 69% stays here in Mon County” Commissioner Sean Sikora explained.

The expansion will include a 1200 megawatt combined cycle gas facility powered by two high-efficiency low-heat-rate gas turbines. It will occupy 54 acres north of and adjacent to the existing coal-fired plant in Maidsville.

It will also include solar array fields near the existing coal plant and in Pennsylvania. Combined the arrays will generate about 70 megawatts and cover hundreds of acres.

Leaving 2020 one can only stand on one peculiarity.

In the remarkable resilience of the ruling New Democracy (ND) government a year and a half after the elections something unusual for the political life of the country especially in the unpredictable conditions and in the turbulent times we live in is observed.

To date almost all polls give the government of Kyriakos Mitsotakis similar percentages to those of the July 2019 elections and at the same time record an impressive difference of 16-17% from opposition party SYRIZA (December 2020 MARC Metron Analysis Pulse).

Never before at least in the last twenty years has an election-winning party maintained its electoral performance for a long time.

For example the ND of Costas Karamanlis who in March 2004 won with an impressive 45.4% in only twenty months (December 2005) lost 10% of its electoral percentage.

Even worse ND which had won the elections of September 2007 a year and a half later (December 2008) lost fifteen points from its electoral percentage.

For George Papandreou's PASOK which won the elections of September 2009 with the emblematic 43.92% just nine months later (May 2010) had already lost seventeen whole points.

And somewhere there everything changes as ND and PASOK slowly enter the margins.

From the meager 29.6% that Antonis Samaras' ND got by winning the elections in June 2012 in less than a year (May 2013) they lost eight and a half percentage points.

Even more impressive however is the deterioration of the (until then incorruptible) SYRIZA which had won the elections of September 2015 with the support of Panos Kammenos.

According to opinion polls at the time it took just five months (January 2016) to lose almost half of its electoral power. It was the government with the biggest and fastest deterioration.

And in fact with ND which in the meantime had changed leadership to gradually increase its percentages and to have a clear lead over SYRIZA.

Already from February 2016 five months after the victory of SYRIZA in September 2015 an MRB survey gave a clear lead for ND with a percentage of 26.9% against 23.2% of SYRIZA.

One month after the Pulse poll it gave a difference of 6 percentage points in favor of ND (31% against 25% of SYRIZA) while in May 2016 a poll by the University of Macedonia gave ND 25.5% compared to 17.5% of SYRIZA.

With the sole exception of the high turnout of the elections of July 2019 when SYRIZA had a glimpse of 31.5% - as was the case with ND in June 2012 - there was nothing special about the recovery of its electoral impact.

To this day its percentages in almost all polls are stuck in the 20% zone away from the electoral performance of July 2019.

However one carefully reads the percentages of the two parties over time in the polls one sees something really interesting.

The striking resemblance of ND in 2007 which in a year and a half after the elections lost almost half of its electoral power with SYRIZA in 2015.

Costas Karamanlis' ND since the 2007 elections had to spend thirteen whole years to change four presidents (K. Karamanlis Ant. Samaras V. Meimarakis K. Mitsotakis) to go through fire and iron to redefine itself politically and recover in 2019 with 39.9% for Mitsotakis.

A small exception was the elections of June 2012 when under very special circumstances ND reached just short of 30% (29.66%).

Mitsotakis deliberately downgraded the relationship with the right-wing (after all a large part of this space cooperated with SYRIZA in government) and invested in the left-wing adjacent space of the liberal center and social democracy.

A move that certainly involved risk for Mitsotakis but which as a result proved to be successful.

In the case of SYRIZA the heavy electoral defeat was not met with the reflexes one would expect from a party that was distinguished for its flexibility in political alliances and the comfort of changing face and policies.

Apart from questioning the polls and the invocation of bias against them from the media little has been done in the direction of reviving its policy of repercussions.

This is evidenced by the ease with which SYRIZA uses today the outdated and less convincing accusatory speech.

Today SYRIZA a prisoner of its hardcore political party leader Alexis Tsipras seems to have limited room for maneuver.

Tsipras of 2020 has nothing to do with Tsipras of 2015!

But there is something else.

In a recent poll (published in the Journal of Authors on December 3) 64% of SYRIZA voters prefer the electoral alliance with Yanis Varoufakis's MERA25 compared to only 27% who would choose SYRIZA's alliance with the Movement for Change.

Although this finding is politically paradoxical from an electoral base too tolerant of the alliance with Panos Kommenos it also shows the narrow margins of Alexis Tsipras' moves today.

In any case SYRIZA has a very difficult way to go. However the good thing for SYRIZA is that as long as KINAL (PASOK) is stuck in low single-digit percentages SYRIZA in one way or another will survive politically.

If at some point the KINAL (PASOK) space is revived politically this will automatically mean the return of SYRIZA to the Stone Age.

Conclusion… As long as KINAL remains shrinking to low single-digit percentages SYRIZA will survive. And as long as SYRIZA survives Mitsotakis' ND will have a predictable opponent!

The intention to vote is not an evaluation of the government or Mitsotakis nor is it a kind of rating for their work.

It is the ""preferred"" choice of those who are the sample of the poll.

Even if it is not a very good government as long as it is a significantly better choice than its main rival it is enough for Mitsotakis!

After all it is a tradition in Greece for the vote to often have the character of a protest.

Jubilant FoodWorks has said that it’ll invest Rs. 92 crore to buy a 10.76 percent stake in the Barbeque Nation chain of restaurants. “The company will acquire 3650794 fully paid-up equity shares of face value of ₹5 each aggregating to 10.76% stake in Barbecue Nation Hospitality Limited (BNHL)” Jubilant said in a regulatory filing. The all-cash deal is expected to conclude by 25 January.

“We are happy to announce our investment in Barbeque Nation a differentiated casual dining restaurant brand of scale with strong unit economics. We are confident that the proposed investment will create value for our shareholders” a statement by Shyam S. Bhartia chairman and Hari S. Bhartia co-chairman Jubilant Foodworks said.

Over the last few years Jubilant Foodworks has been expanding outside its core pizza offering of Domino’s Pizza. The company already runs Dunkin Donuts in India and had launched casual Chinese dining brand Hong’s Kitchen last year. After Covid had hit it had forayed into the ready-to-cook sauces gravies and pastes market under the ChefBoss brand. A few weeks ago Jubilant had also announced a new biryani brand called Ekdum which would operate restaurants and also do deliveries.

Barbeque Nation for its part has 138 restaurants that offer over-the-table barbeque live grills for diners in 73 cities across India and seven restaurants overseas. It also has a presence in the Italian cuisine segment under the brand Toscano.

It’s not a worst time to pick up a stake in a restaurant chain — the coronavirus pandemic has meant that most restaurants have been shut for an extended period and it’s likely that Jubilant has managed to get an attractive price for Barbecue Nation. But with the vaccine around the corner restaurants could well see footfalls go back to normal in the foreseeable future. Also with many companies perhaps continuing to work from home even after the pandemic is over the demand for places for teammates to bond with one another could increase and this is where Barbecue Nation could really come into its own — the chain was already popular with office teams and could see that aspect of its business pick up over the coming years. And having a sit-down barbecue chain would only add to Jubilant’s already-impressive — and rapidly-expanding — portfolio in India.",,,,,,,,,

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 382.59 points lower or 1.3% at 30223.89. At one point the Dow was down more than 700 points. Monday marked the first negative start to a year for the Dow since 2016.

The S&P 500 dipped 1.5% to 3700.65. The Nasdaq Composite also slid 1.5% ending the day at 12698.45. Both the Dow and S&P 500 hit record highs at the open before turning lower.

It was the biggest one-day sell-off since Oct. 28 for the Dow and S&P 500 while the Nasdaq had its worst daily performance since Dec. 9.

""In my day I've seen a lot of wild rallies with a lot of mispriced stocks but there is one thing they all have in common. Eventually they hit a wall and go into a major painful correction"" billionaire investor Carl Icahn told CNBC's Scott Wapner on Monday.

Coca-Cola and Boeing were the worst-performing Dow components falling 3.8% and 5.3% respectively. Real estate stocks fell 3.2% to lead the S&P 500 lower.

Monday's decline came as traders fretted over the growing number of coronavirus cases around the world and its potential impact on the global economic recovery.

In the U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a national lockdown on England to curb the spread of the new coronavirus variant. As part of the new restrictions people can only leave their homes for essentials work if they can't from home and exercise. Most schools will also move to remote learning including universities.

""I completely understand the inconvenience and distress this change will cause millions of people and parents up and down the country"" Johnson said. ""The problem isn't that schools are unsafe for children ... the problem is that schools may act as vectors of transmission causing the virus to spread between households.""

Data compiled by Johns Hopkins University showed more than 85 million coronavirus cases have been confirmed globally including 20.7 million in the U.S. and 2.7 million in the U.K.

Wall Street was also keeping an eye on Georgia as the state prepares for Senate runoff elections on Tuesday which could give Democrats a majority in the chamber.

""If the GOP wins just one seat they will likely stonewall some of Biden's more ambitious proposals but a Democratic sweep of both elections might give the incoming administration free rein on their policy agenda"" wrote Jason Pride CIO of private wealth at Glenmede.

John Stoltzfus chief investment strategist at Oppeneheimer said Monday the S&P 500 could fall by 10% if the Democratic candidates win the Georgia runoffs.

""It is thought by not just a few folks on Main Street as well as on Wall Street that if tomorrow's run-off results in a sweep for the Democrats — providing them with control of the Senate as well as the House — that it would bode ill for business with the likelihood that corporate tax rates could rise substantially"" said Stoltzfus.

The 30-stock Dow ended last year with an advance of 7.3% and the S&P 500 rose 16.3% in that time. At one point in 2020 the two market benchmarks were down more than 30% as the coronavirus pandemic ravaged the global economy. The real standout of 2020 was the Nasdaq Composite which surged 43.6% for its biggest one-year gain since 2009.

Unprecedented fiscal and monetary support for the economy — coupled with the development and rollout of multiple Covid-19 vaccines — helped the market recover from its massive drop to trade back at all-time highs.

""The stock market is positioned for further gains in 2021 based on the twin pillars of coordinated fiscal and monetary policy from the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board and a successful COVID vaccine rollout"" said Marc Chaikin CEO of Chaikin Analytics. ""However we envision some bumps in the road on the way.""

Get ready for the return of Dr. Laura Horton on “Days of our Lives.”

On Facebook actress Jaime Lyn Bauer announced that she has filmed six episodes of “DAYS” set to air in early February starting with the Tuesday February 2 episode.

“Under COVID rules with 2 tests at the beginning of each work week and one test every day after that. You come into the building test then go back out and wait in your car until your test comes back negative and then they wave you back in. A mask is worn everywhere. Rehearsing your lines with another actor happens over the phone” shared Bauer of her experience filming during COVID-19 protocols in December.

“Once you are called to your set your mask can only be taken off once you are on your set and doing your camera rehearsal. We come into the studio already having done our own makeup and hair (to the best of our ability) as we can only be in a makeup or hair chair for 15 minutes! And they set timers! The strange new world of Hollywood!” added Bauer who also shared how she and her family have been handling life in a COVID-19 world particularly dealing with quarantine social distancing and togetherness among other matters.

Bauer who last appeared on the soap in 2018 will appear in additional episodes through Thursday February 11. It’s unknown at this time which characters she’ll interact with but it’s expected she’ll at least be around for scenes with her character’s daughter Jennifer (now played by Cady McClain).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zcGFydGFuYnVyZy9uYW1lL2NsZW1lbnQtaGFycmVsc29uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTc4Njk2NjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Clement Harrelson Obituary (1932 - 2020) - Roebuck SC - Spartanburg Herald-Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/spartanburg/name/clement-harrelson-obituary?id=7869662 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zcGFydGFuYnVyZy9uYW1lL2NsZW1lbnQtaGFycmVsc29uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTc4Njk2NjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

""It's always better for industry if the state has control instead of EPA"" said Abel Russ a senior attorney for the Environmental Integrity Project who helped draft the organization's comments on Texas' coal ash program. ""States are typically more favorably inclined to what industry wants. That's true not just in Texas but across the country.""

Oklahoma and Georgia are the only two states that currently have approval to operate the EPA's coal ash program. Texas' program won't be effective until at least February when the public comment period ends.

The Texas Mining and Reclamation Association an industry group that represents coal and other mining industries in the state supports the proposal arguing that state-level environmental regulation is more effective.

""This system is designed to give decision-making authority to a level of government that is closer to the people and recognizes that states are in a better position to address specific problems as they arise"" said Michael Nasi an Austin lawyer on behalf of the industry group.

Getting control from the EPA

High-profile accidents involving coal ash in recent years highlighted by the failure of a coal ash impoundment in Tennessee that spilled a billion gallons of coal ash slurry put pressure on the EPA to introduce tougher standards. Before 2015 there were no requirements for coal companies to properly line the pits where they dumped the toxic ash — nearly 130 million tons of which was generated in 2014.

Under former President Barack Obama the EPA for the first time introduced standards on what experts say are poorly lined pits and ponds containing coal ash across the nation. But in 2016 the EPA under President Donald Trump began to delay and then walk back that proposal and the agency was soon directed by Congress to create a program allowing states to operate the federal standards instead of the EPA. That set off a multi-year effort in Texas to wrangle control away from the federal agency but first Texas had to change its rules.

During the 2017 legislative session state lawmakers earmarked $390000 per year to fund four full-time Texas Commission on Environmental Quality employees to seek the federal approval for a state program they would then manage. In 2019 the TCEQ created the coal ash management program which became effective in May of 2020.

Finally in September Texas was ready to apply to the EPA for approval of its newly created coal ash regulation which would issue state registrations to companies that last for the life of a facility.

Molly Block an EPA spokesperson said the agency is required to approve the applications from states that want to take over coal ash regulation if their application meets federal coal ash standards. And while the EPA said it retains authority to require Texas to change its standards if stronger federal rules are implemented later companies that already have a state registration would not need to meet any new standards until the state requires them to.

Texas would first need to revise the state's program to meet tougher federal requirements according to the TCEQ. Then the agency would need to complete a separate process to modify the registration for each of the 17 facilities that produce and dispose of coal ash — a potentially time-consuming task.

Gary Rasp spokesperson for the TCEQ said in a statement that the TCEQ has the authority to amend any registration if good cause exists such as a change in state rules.

""We have 17 facilities with similar but unique situations so we would work with the EPA and each impacted facility to bring the facilities into compliance"" Rasp said.

The EPA must review state programs within three years after any change in federal regulations and the agency has the authority to withdraw approval if the state program is not as protective as federal requirements. The EPA will retain its authority to inspect coal ash facilities. That's why Nasi the Texas Mining and Reclamation Association lawyer said the industry group's stance is that coal ash standards in Texas will be as protective as federal rules.

The EPA proposed the Texas program for partial approval this month. Because sections of the federal program were being challenged in court by both industry and environmental groups — including a rule allowing unlined coal ash pits to operate a proposal overruled in court — Texas did not apply to assume all of the EPA's oversight authority. That means facilities in Texas would have to comply with some federal and some state requirements if the state's application is approved.

Coal ash contamination

A 2015 regulation known as the ""Coal Ash Rule"" that Trump's EPA has partially rolled back required companies to report how much contamination was found in groundwater surrounding coal ash ponds and pits. The rollbacks loosen the requirements for public reporting of the data.

In Texas an Environmental Integrity Project analysis of that public data found that all of the coal power plants in Texas were leaking contaminants including arsenic boron cobalt and lithium into groundwater near the coal ash pits at unsafe levels.

The report also found that almost none of the impoundments where plants dispose of coal ash are properly lined to prevent leakage into groundwater — a requirement of the Coal Ash Rule.

One analysis of coal ash pollution data by environmental groups found that people of color and low-income residents are more likely than white or wealthier residents to live within three miles of the most contaminated coal ash sites.

The toxic mix of mercury arsenic and lead leaking from the ponds or pits can pollute groundwater and drinking water supplies as well as contaminate surrounding soil. At a Christine Texas ranch owners have claimed that coal ash pollution from San Miguel Electric Cooperative's coal-fired power plant has destroyed huge swaths of their land creating dead zones of vegetation. More than 40 percent of the people living within three miles of that plant are not white according to an Earthjustice analysis.

But while a Biden-led EPA is expected to roll out tougher rules on that kind of pollution it will be difficult to reverse approval of Texas' program now that the EPA has set it in motion said Russ of the Environmental Integrity project.

""If the Biden administration wants to do something different they'll have to explain why they're changing positions from the proposal"" Russ said.

He noted that the EPA will also have a long list of rules to re-implement nationwide and Texas' proposal may already be too deep into the process to justify spending the political and administrative resources needed to reverse it. The Trump Administration has taken aim at rolling back more than 100 EPA rules according to a New York Times analysis.

""It's not impossible"" Russ said but ""you have to prioritize.""

Master Dep. Joe Brocato was on patrol when he spotted a white pickup truck with a license plate seizure order in place. He saw the same vehicle later in the morning traveling on Grays Airport Road. The driver later identified as 33-year-old William Alan Labree Jr. noticed Brocato’s marked patrol vehicle and turned onto a dead-end street a sheriff’s office report states.

As Brocato was approaching the work truck which had a company name of “A Job Well Done” printed on the driver’s side door was coming back out of the dead-end street with no headlights in the rain. The deputy then conducted a traffic stop the report says.

As Brocato was talking with Labree of Umatilla he kept his hand clinched to conceal something. After a brief struggle and two taser deployments Labree was taken into custody under a nearby pool deck after fleeing. He was seen discarding a plastic baggie containing a crystallized substance which tested positive for methamphetamine the report says.

Labree’s work truck was towed and he was transported to the Lake County Jail where he was charged with resisting a law enforcement officer without violence possession of a controlled substance without a prescription (methamphetamine) possession and/or use of drug equipment and concealing physical evidence. He was being held on $6000 bond and is due in court Feb 1 at 8:30 a.m. jail records show.

Labree also was arrested in July 2019 in the vicinity of U.S. Hwy. 27/441 and Griffin Avenue in Lady Lake for driving a pickup without proper registration or insurance. He claimed he had just purchased the truck and was on his way to register it.

It was the longest the hardest the darkest — and on top of everything else full of bad climate news. The Trump administration continued its steady assault on environmental protections even as the COVID-19 pandemic devastated the country. Despite some late-breaking clean energy funding in the U.S. global stimulus spending devoted far more money to fossil fuels than renewable energy. The dip in emissions brought on by the pandemic was just that — a dip.

But we're here to tell you that this year wasn't a total wash. Even during a global pandemic with powerful forces working against it momentum toward a less fiery future kept pace. Please join us in taking a look back at six ways climate action moved forward this year.

* * *

1. Climate change was a major election issue

2020 was the year climate change finally entered the political spotlight. Look no further than the Democratic primaries where dozens of candidates competed for the title of fiercest climate hawk and tried to one-up each other with progressively more ambitious climate plans. (Senator Elizabeth Warren wowed voters by producing 14 separate documents outlining her climate agenda but the title of ""most ambitious climate plan"" still goes to her Senate colleague Bernie Sanders' $16 trillion ""Green New Deal."")

The one-upmanship continued even after Joe Biden had clinched the Democratic nomination when Biden unveiled an updated and more aggressive version of his primary climate plan. And he doubled down as the general election drew nearer — Biden released three climate-themed ads in the weeks leading up to November 3 and made history by saying he'd ""transition the oil industry"" at the final presidential debate in October.

Why did presidential candidates bend over backward to show voters that they're serious about climate action? Because polls show that climate change matters to Americans. A lot. Ahead of the election a national survey showed that 58 percent of Americans were either ""somewhat concerned"" or ""very concerned"" about their communities being affected by climate change. Exit polls from the League of Conservation Voters showed that among conflicted voters (those who considered voting for both Trump and Biden) Biden was preferred over Trump on ""climate change clean energy and the environment"" by a 58-point margin.

2. Big institutions pledged to pull their cash out of fossil fuel companies

Fossil fuel companies lost a lot of money this year and not just because of the drop in demand for oil and gas caused by the pandemic. The divestment movement scored major wins as schools faith institutions and cities all over the world made new pledges to pull their investments from companies that extract and sell fossil fuels.

Prestigious schools like Oxford and Cambridge in the U.K. and Georgetown Brown American University and Cornell in the U.S. joined a growing list of colleges and universities planning to divest their endowments from fossil fuel companies. Pressure mounted on two of the wealthiest universities in the country Harvard and Yale which have a combined endowment of $72 billion as divestment activists ran for open seats on the boards that oversee the teams that manage how their endowments are invested. And while neither school committed to divestment Harvard is dipping its toes in the concept with the announcement of a still-vague plan to bring its endowment to net-zero by 2050 arguing that it will be able to work with fossil fuel companies to achieve it.

Activists weren't happy about that but they did celebrate when the $226 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund the third-largest public pension fund in the U.S. announced it would basically do the same thing by 2040. The main difference was that Tom DiNapoli the state's comptroller laid out a detailed roadmap for how he would achieve net-zero including a pledge to divest from companies that aren't preparing for a low-carbon economy. He's already eliminated 22 coal companies from the fund.

(Clayton Aldern / Grist)

Whether divestment promotes the broader changes needed to decarbonize the economy is still debated. But what became more apparent in 2020 is the risk of maintaining investments in companies that aren't ready for those changes which are happening regardless. Exxon which hasn't made any commitment to reduce its total emissions did so poorly this year that it got booted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average an influential benchmark of top stocks. So if you have money in index or mutual funds there's a chance that you've divested some of your own savings from fossil fuels without even knowing it.

3. Renewables kept growing despite the pandemic

Fossil fuel companies took a catastrophic hit this year when the COVID-19 pandemic ground the economy to a standstill and sent oil prices tumbling. But the renewable energy industry proved to be far more resilient.

Skies clear of smog and other pollutants gave solar panels a boost this year especially in the U.K. where the uptick in solar power efficiency helped the country run on zero coal-fired power plant generation for more than two months for the first time in over a century. And on this side of the pond electricity generated by solar wind hydro and other renewables outpaced electricity generated by coal for 40 days straight.

In November a report from the International Energy Agency projected that renewables will account for 90 percent of the new power capacity added to grids worldwide in 2020. A different report from the global research and consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie published in December found that U.S. solar installations are expected to grow 43 percent this year.

Renewables are still getting cheaper too. A study by clean energy research firm BloombergNEF found that solar and onshore wind power are the most affordable new sources of electricity for two-thirds of the world's population. The price of electricity from onshore wind farms dropped 9 percent since mid-2019. And falling costs more efficient technology and government support in some parts of the world have fostered larger renewable power plants with the average wind farm now double the capacity it was four years ago.

(Clayton Aldern / Grist)

To boot polling on how Americans think about energy sources like solar and wind remained consistent this year: The vast majority of Americans say developing alternative sources of energy should be prioritized over developing fossil fuels.

4. Pipelines became nearly impossible to build

Pipeline or pipe dream? Pipeline construction companies and the energy companies paying them to create the infrastructure to transport oil and gas across long distances ran into roadblock after roadblock this year. So many roadblocks in fact that some energy companies just gave up trying to build them.

That's what happened to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline over the summer: The U.S. Supreme Court gave the pipeline the green light to cross under the Appalachian Trail but a few weeks later Dominion Energy and Duke Energy the lead developers of the project decided to take a hike and dump the pipeline altogether.

(Grist)

The Dakota Access Pipeline the approval of which sparked the protests at Standing Rock in 2016 also took a critical hit over the summer when a federal judge said the company behind the project Energy Transfer and the Army Corps of Engineers had failed to conduct a sufficient environmental review. The judge ordered the pipeline to shut down while the review was conducted. An appeals court swiftly overturned that order but the company and the Army Corps still have to conduct the environmental review. When Biden takes office he could opt to shut down the pipeline entirely.

Speaking of Biden the president-elect has promised to shut down the Keystone XL pipeline by revoking the presidential permit President Trump granted the project in 2019. TC Energy the company building the project has already built some 120 miles of pipeline since last spring but if Biden makes good on his campaign promises (and green groups expect him to) he could put the kibosh on Keystone XL after he's inaugurated.

More pipelines were put on the chopping block this year: The Mountain Valley Pipeline is struggling to keep construction going as judges keep tossing out crucial permits forcing the company to hunt down new ones. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer delivered a serious blow to Enbridge's Line 5 pipeline in November ordering it shut down. Enbridge filed suit against Whitmer arguing that only the federal government has the jurisdiction to shut down pipelines but the incoming Biden administration can reaffirm Whitmer's authority and take other steps to stymie Enbridge's plans.

5. Cities put a check on emissions from buildings

A recent United Nations report found that the carbon emissions from heating cooking and using electricity in buildings hit an all-time high last year and were responsible for 28 percent of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Fortunately in 2020 efforts to rein in emissions from buildings took off.

Just a few weeks ago the cities of San Francisco Oakland and San Jose passed laws limiting the installation of appliances that run on natural gas in new buildings joining 37 other jurisdictions across California that have already done so. These ""gas bans"" have been catching on around the country: Seattle's mayor wants to update the city's building code to prohibit the use of fossil fuels in new buildings; St. Louis has new building performance standards that will effectively phase out gas appliances in larger buildings; and Brookline Massachusetts has petitioned the state to let it ban gas hookups in new buildings after an earlier effort to do so was found to conflict with state laws.

In December Washington state proposed what could be the nation's first state-level gas ban and several new state climate action plans and task forces including in New Jersey Michigan Nevada and Maryland explicitly mentioned the need to electrify buildings.

(Clayton Aldern / Grist)

But as the idea of moving away from gas in buildings gained currency some states ran in the opposite direction. Under pressure from industry lawmakers in Arizona Louisiana Oklahoma and Tennessee passed nearly identical bills this year that prohibit their own municipalities from banning gas.

To be clear decarbonizing buildings is not as simple as banning gas hookups or appliances. As more buildings go fully electric gas utilities could undergo a slow death spiral and fewer and fewer customers could end up paying to maintain a vast network of gas pipelines. But states are finally reckoning with these questions — New York California Colorado and Massachusetts all opened new investigations this year into the future of gas distribution to try to answer them.

6. The world agreed on achieving net-zero by mid-century

The idea of ""net-zero emissions"" has been around for years but in 2020 it was thrust into the mainstream as an essential tenet of climate policy around the world.

Every week seemed to bring a new announcement of a state country bank utility tech giant or even oil company promising to get to net-zero over the next few decades. Generally that means they'll get to a place where their net emissions between the CO2 they release into the atmosphere and the CO2 they suck out of it through natural and technological means are zero. Microsoft even said it would go beyond that point to ""carbon negative"" by removing all the carbon it has emitted since its founding in 1975.

In theory net-zero is a valiant goal — a 2018 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that the world needs to get to net-zero by 2050 in order to avoid the catastrophic effects expected to occur if the globe warms more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F).

But that conclusion was based on a crucial premise: First we have to dramatically reduce emissions. The whole ""net"" part of the deal should really only apply to the parts of the economy that are hardest to decarbonize like aviation and shipping. But many of the net-zero pledges made this year by companies are nebulous about when they will reduce their emissions or whether they'll do so at all. The energy companies with net-zero pledges are still expanding the fossil fuel side of their businesses and many of the tech companies with net-zero pledges are still helping those energy companies find and extract more fossil fuels.

The most important development in 2020 may not have been the slew of net-zero pledges but something a little more obscure. Companies finally began publicly accounting for the emissions tied to their supply chains and the products they produce known as ""scope 3"" emissions. Transparency around scope 3 puts more pressure on reducing emissions throughout the economy.

Next year we'll be looking to see which companies shore up their pledges with near-term targets and which ones show up in Washington to lobby for the policy changes that will help them deliver on net-zero."

Once a month four union construction workers and a facilities worker from the hospital – better known collectively as the Bingo Guys – would film a Wednesday bingo show to provide some entertainment to the children at the hospital and their families.

These days that TV studio is buzzing.

Since the coronavirus kept some volunteers out of the building the Bingo Guys are now a weekly feature because they're already in the hospital almost daily. They still do their usual educational bingo game but they mix in some trivia and other games to keep things fresh. On Thursday they held a trivia game with a New Year's theme.

""We’re taking care of the kids making sure they have a happy New Year"" said Patrick Creedon a union electrician with Local 313 who is better known as ""Pirate Pat.""

""We do this to help make their stay more enjoyable"" said Josh Manners aka ""Buzz Lightyear"" of Local 199.

Those two are joined by Local 332's Danny Shaw (""Hula Dan"") Local 74's Bill Wintrup (""Officer Richard"") and Nemours plumber George Wilson (""Dr. Pinky) to make up the Bingo Guys.

""They’re like the five stooges"" said Sara Narimanian the Child Life Program coordinator at the hospital.

The ""stooges"" started volunteering their time nearly a year ago before the COVID-19 pandemic. Narimanian said she reached out to the group in March when things were changing and asked if they would be interested in doing more shows. They could even film some she told them.

""They want to go off the cuff"" she said. ""They want to be live.""

COVID-19: Who's next in line for the vaccine?

The weekly interactive shows allow for real-time participation by patients and their family members. They can watch on video and call into the show from their rooms. The studio broadcasts out to a hospital-wide channel that can be viewed in each room.

""As contractors on the job we get to see patients in the hospital all the time"" Manners said in a video produced by the hospital. ""But we don’t really get to interact with them because that’s not what we do. We’re not health care professionals. We build things. Bingo is an avenue that allows us to engage with the patients. … It’s fulfilling for us and hopefully for the patients too.""

""You can just feel it; they’re doing it from their heart"" said Rosa Mendez the mother of a patient in the Nemours-produced video. ""They’re really putting their heart into it and really genuinely care about the kids.

""They were really truly our light in the darkest of moments that we were going through.""

The unions aren't just donating time for smiles. When Halloween came around this year funds were low. Narimanian said James Maravelias of Local 199 and Angelique Rodriguez of Delaware LECET stepped up and helped raise $12500 in funds. Narimanian said the funds went to among other things providing 250 Halloween costumes.

Away from the studio Narimanian said the Bingo Guys have become ""like rock stars."" The kids see Buzz Lightyear (Manners) on their television screens and then occasionally run into him in the halls. The Bingo Guys reciprocate sometimes giving on-air shoutouts to patients.

""A lot of these kids aren’t in the best shape and they really enjoy it"" Narimanian said.

So too does everyone else.

""It’s like therapeutic hours for all of us"" Narimanian said.

How about one who told you the pandemic was no big deal while buying shares in a company that sells body bags?

Both Republican incumbents in Georgia’s crucial runoffs that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate were investigated this year for allegedly engaging in pandemic-related insider trading.

The two are the Senate’s wealthiest member Kelly Loeffler appointed in 2019 and running for a full term of her own and its seventh wealthiest member David Perdue a businessman sued for wage theft and discrimination while losing $150 million in two years as CEO of Dollar General.

After the notorious briefing Loeffler who joined Trump in dismissing the pandemic and her husband who almost never trades to avoid conflict with his job as chair of the Intercontinental Stock Exchange made 27 trades worth between $1.2 and $3.1 million that helped them weather the virus-triggered crash. On the same day Perdue began accumulating $825000 worth of stock in DuPont a company that makes personal protective equipment and body bags and sold an equal amount of other stocks in over a hundred other transactions. He’d already raised eyebrows when as a member of the Senate’s cybersecurity subcommittee he promoted FireEye a cybersecurity firm in which he held $250000 worth of stock a fraction of his 2596 trades since joining the Senate. It makes you wonder when he has time to legislate and why Martha Stewart who prepared the country to bake sourdough bread as a hedge against insanity will be remembered for going to jail over one trade.

Bill Barr’s Justice Department and the Senate Ethics Committee so-called both ended their investigations into the suspiciously timed trades. The only investigation for insider trading that remains open just happens to be against a senator who’s retired.

But while Washington has turned a blind eye Georgians have not. During the Republican primary the candidate Trump backed former Rep. Doug Collins said he was “sickened” by Loeffler “profiting off the pain” of COVID victims. Whenever it comes up Loeffler talks about her humble beginnings growing soybeans. In the general election Perdue’s opponent Democrat Jon Ossoff got off the ground when he ripped through the accusations at their first debate and Perdue just stared ahead speechless. Rather than endure that again there’s been an empty podium at subsequent debates where Perdue would be if he could muster a defense.

On Monday the final day of campaigning President-elect Biden will try to help get Democrats Ossoff and Raphael Warnock over the top while President Trump taking time from his exhausting schedule of golfing pardoning his friends and pushing through the most federal executions since 1896 will try to un-depress turnout after two months of bitter complaints about how Georgia’s Republican officials supposedly allowed Biden to steal the election from him. The charge was supported by little more than a purported eyewitness found by Rudy Giuliani who was actually a temp who wiped down computer screens for one day at one polling place. Weeks of Trump telling voters the “system is rigged” GOP strategist Frank Luntz told Fox is having “a debilitating impact on whether his people will vote.” He’s right. Why bother if a gremlin named Roy Raffensberger—the Republican Secretary of State’s imaginary brother in Trump’s warped mind—is going to eat your ballot?

On New Year’s Eve in the pouring rain early voters in Cobb County were standing in a line two football fields long telling reporters they would be staying for a long as it took to vote. It’s a race that will decide whether Mitch McConnell remains majority leader or lives out what’s likely his last term under the thumb of Chuck Schumer and if the pandemic some profited from will finally be treated like the threat to the country it is.

Perdue and Leoffler got off for now. Of course they did. The legislation supposed to stop insider trading largely sets up disclosure rules that do little to stop inside trading since members of Congress are by definition insiders. That’s so obvious that uber-capitalist Republican Sen. John Cornyn said that the only way to deal with the problem is to prohibit members from trading stocks altogether.

Or to send those that game the system packing. Nothing gets a senator’s attention like a colleague paying a price for forgetting why he’s there.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHA6Ly93d3cudGltZXNhZXJvc3BhY2UuYWVyby9mZWF0dXJlcy9tYWludGVuYW5jZS93aGVuLWlubm92YXRpb24tY29tZXMtd2l0aC1hLXByaWNlLXRhZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When innovation comes with a price tag,"Frederic Dupont: “We’re always looking at how we can reinvent ourselves from an efficiency and operational perspective.” Picture: Etihad Group

Adaptability is the key to success as an MRO says Frederic Dupont Etihad Engineering’s vice-president technical sales and customer service.

“We’re always looking at how we can reinvent ourselves from an efficiency and operational perspective – how we can loop into MRO innovations that can deliver benefits to our customers.”

Companies need to be able to see beyond today’s ‘buzzwords’ to the customer benefits now and in five or 10 years. A customer doesn’t ask if additive manufacturing (AM) for example will produce a part that’s 10g lighter or with lower CO2 emissions; they want to know the cost.

Etihad Engineering has broken new ground with AM since first receiving European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) approval. Its AM lab in Abu Dhabi produces cabin parts from polymers – items such as arm rests and arm caps. Dupont says the system “works well”.

Drone technology is rapidly advancing but is not yet mature enough to provide sufficient returns for Etihad Engineering to implement ‘as is’ in a heavy maintenance environment.

A critical success factor is to link the entire ecosystem: from measuring the cracks/defects to the regulatory/OEM approval of the analysis of such data – still a work in progress. At that point he said “You will be talking about bringing real benefits to the customer.”

Etihad Engineering set up an innovation steering committee and roadmap to look at technologies “through our customers’ eyes” and structure the activity surrounding assessment. “We have a business to run” said Dupont. “We don’t have 20 people standing by to explore every new thing that comes along.”

Technology and innovation is never cheap; its adoption and ultimately its success depends on feasibility assessment proof of concept trials and development.

“We can’t go and buy [technology] off the shelf” said Dupont. “We need to customise it adapt it to our business in order to maximise the returns to our customers.”

The overriding question is always: “When will a technology bring enough benefits to effectively outweigh all the implementation costs and disruption to operations?

“At end of the day we’re just MROs we’re not OEMs.”

While re-upping is limited to click and collect for now a unique interior is the easiest way to stand out especially if the store looks like if a Scandinavian vase had a baby with that white room from the Matrix.

Taking the sleek Apple Store approach to weed store blueprint to peak minimalism is Edition X the first location of this Toronto-based cannabis company at 270 Dupont St.

The company from Ryan Roebuck and Dennis Bennie employed Toronto design firm StudioAC to create a shopping experience that at first glance looks like it sells dangly earrings made out of rare moon stones maybe or vials of mountain air.

Product which is relatively on par with most other brands is displayed on counters made out of industrial grating like an airport ramp but stylish.

Edition X sells the usual weed product supply along with a number of lifestyle goods like candles tote bags ashtrays from furniture studio Mary Ratcliffe and vape pens from Greentank.

Image shows from L to R: David (David Tennant) Michael (Michael Sheen)

Lockdown hit Staged is back for eight more episodes. Michael Sheen David Tennant Georgia Tennant Anna Lundberg Simon Evans Lucy Eaton and Ben Schwartz explain more.

What can you tell us about the new series of Staged?

Michael: David and I are still being ridiculous with and about each other - that's still very much the tone of it. We have a lot of amazing surprise appearances which I hope people will enjoy as much as David and I enjoyed doing the scenes with them.

David: It's the same set up as before. Michael Sheen and I talking rubbish to each other over the internet from our respective homes with Georgia and Anna our other halves keeping us from becoming too self-indulgent not always successfully. But there is a bit of a twist to it all which I'm not going to reveal here...

In the show you play exaggerated versions of yourselves are you anything like these characters in real life?

David: I imagine not at all but probably... quite a lot.

Michael: I think David would say that he's not at all like his character in the first series. Whereas I would say I probably am quite like that. But I think between the two series there's a slightly more representative version of ourselves emerging or at least that's what I would say anyway.

Why do you think the first series was so popular?

Michael: We didn't take ourselves too seriously and made fun of ourselves - I think people enjoyed that. I'm using the sort of format and medium that everyone is using. Having to do calls on Zoom and all that kind of stuff - so we've been able to tap into what's funny and absurd about that as well. Also having lovely surprises like Judi Dench and Samuel L. Jackson we have lots more of those surprises in this new series.

David: People seemed to recognise what the characters were going through. Not the specifics of being an actor in lockdown as such but the sense of helplessness the frustrations and occasional joys of being stuck at home while the world trundled on. That and the fact that Simon wrote a really funny script - I mean without that we'd have been stuffed.

Staged. Image shows from L to R: David (David Tennant) Michael (Michael Sheen)

Did you think you'd be back for another series?

David: If you had told me a year ago that I'd end up making a series for BBC One from inside our house without a crew wearing my own clothes and being entirely responsible for turning the camera on and off I would have found it wholly implausible so the idea that we would do it twice is just one of the many unpredictable eventualities that this weird weird year has presented.

Michael: I certainly thought that if it went down quite well then there was no reason why we couldn't do more because it was such an innovative way to make a series - filming in my kitchen with just the laptop and a smartphone. It was very nice to come back and do more of it.

What was it like working with your partners?

David: The scenes between Georgia and myself had to be fitted in around school drop-offs baby naps and unloading the dishwasher so there is a certain urgency to getting them done but we have really enjoyed making Staged together and we do laugh a lot - perhaps it's the sleep deprivation.

Michael: I thoroughly enjoyed it it was great. The difficulty for Anna and I was that one of us had to go and look after the baby so that presented a bit of a challenge and limited how much we could do together. But the positive side of this was that it meant Anna could do more scenes with other people. So there's more scenes between Anna and Georgia Lucy and Simon as well. It was lovely not taking ourselves too seriously and to play around with it.

Will any of your children be making an appearance in the new series?

Michael: There's that fantastic moment in the first series where you see David and Georgia's daughter in the background coming down the stairs and then going back up the stairs - that's very funny. I'm sure you can hear Lyra in the background of some scenes; you'll have to be eagle-eyed and eagle-eared for that.

David: No I think they find it slightly risible that mum and dad are making a TV show from the house and are mostly just annoyed when we tell them to be quiet for a take.

What can you tell us about working with the guest stars?

David: Well I think it's out there that we have Ben Schwartz joining us this series playing the assistant to Michael and my US agent. I've known Ben for a few years now we both play the voices of ducks on Disney's Duck Tales. Ben is very very funny and is a master at comic improvisation. Michael and I both had to sprint to keep up with him once he started going off script. Recording those scenes was a particular joy. But beyond that I'm saying nothing - that would spoil some nice surprises.

Michael: In the first series one of the most enjoyable things was being able to do a scene with Dame Judi and with Samuel L. Jackson. In this series we have plenty more where that came from and it was an absolute joy - a real thrill! We have some special guests this series who David and I both enjoy the work of. I hope the audience enjoy it half as much as we did and also see that it's not just us who have difficulty with the technical stuff!

Staged. Image shows from L to R: Georgia (Georgia Tennant) Anna (Anna Lundberg)

What can you tell us about the new series of Staged?

Georgia: We are all still in lockdown but things are starting to open up a little and everyone is trying to feel their way through their new normal. David's hair is longer and my wine cellar (metaphorically speaking... we don't actually have a wine cellar) is emptier.

How did you come up with the idea for the new series?

Georgia: We always said we would just do one and hope people didn't hate it. Much to our amazement people really didn't hate it and of course it's much more tempting to visit something again if the reception has been good! When we filmed the first series I think we felt like it was a small window of time where the world had shifted and before long we'd all be back to normal and Staged would end up being this nice little time capsule. Simon Evans and Phin Glynn then came up with a brilliant little seed of a premise and we all took it from there.

In the show you play exaggerated versions of yourselves are you anything like these characters in real life?

Anna: Well we're all slightly different from the first season. I certainly don't bring Michael charcuterie boards like I did in the first season hah! I think in this season I have lost most of my patience with Michael and although that isn't true in real life it seems closer to how we would behave with each other if we were living through those exact circumstances. I'd tease him for being so serious and a bit of an arse but at the end of the day we got each other's back. I've also gotten to know Georgia and Lucy a bit more since the first season so those scenes seemed a bit closer to real life this time. Although I don't think there's a world that exists where I'd actually offer David Tennant advice on using Viking methods with an axe to deal with a conflict.

Georgia: This series 'Georgia' is slightly less tired and has gotten her fight back a little. The kids are back at school and she's trying to get everyone else back to some sort of normality. She's even less indulgent of 'David'.

Why do you think the show was so popular?

Georgia: I think for the first time in probably ever the whole world was doing the same thing - sitting in their homes. To be able to watch a show where the actors are doing exactly as you and much less elegantly was probably the secret to its charm. To be able to laugh during this time has also certainly saved my sanity and having a comedy escape albeit for 15 minutes was probably very needed.

Anna: I think a lot of people around that time were happy to see something light and a bit silly as opposed to another heavy drama about what everyone was already going through but without ignoring what was going on at the same time.

What was it like working with your partners?

Georgia: That was the best bit for me. He is my favourite person actor and makes me laugh like no one else. I think I may struggle working with anyone else now!

Anna: The biggest challenge of filming with Michael is figuring out what to do with the baby when we do. Once we've managed to work that out around naps it's great! He's very encouraging and patient with me. Serious about the work though and likes to be in charge of all the technical stuff even though I helped him to set it up in the first place. But I let him.

Will any of your children be making an appearance in the new series?

Anna: There's always a chance you'll hear Lyra's voice in the background. She likes to get in on the action and has a great ability to project and be heard like her father. But no not in vision.

Georgia: No. I cannot tell you how little they care about what we do. We were just annoying them by asking them to keep the noise down for takes.

Staged. Image shows from L to R: Lucy (Lucy Eaton) Simon (Simon Evans)

Co-creator Simon Evans and his sister Lucy Eaton talk about returning for more...

What can you tell us about the new series of Staged?

Simon: It's a natural progression of our story. David and Michael are still the same world we're all in still struggling to come to terms with what this 'new way of doing things' might be. They've still got Anna and Georgia with them trying to both help them and keep them sane. Simon is still trying to get ahead in the world with a few new tricks up his sleeve. There are some other surprises too and we're joined by some friends (both familiar and new) but I wouldn't want to say too much about that yet.

Lucy: There was a real sense that to do a second series of Staged we had to 'go big or go home' but when I first heard the premise for Staged Two I was absolutely floored! It's fabulous: super ambitious but without losing sight of everything that worked so well first time round. It's got the same kind of smart silliness understatedly empathetic storylines and star-packed guest appearances but in a surprising new storyline.

How did you come up with the idea for the new series?

Simon: It was important for me and Phin Glynn [producer and co-creator] to find a different theme to work on. We went into Series 1 a little (dare I say) nervous about how audiences would respond to a Zoom-based show about boredom: surely everyone had enough of that in their day to day life. Thankfully everyone responded very warmly to it (how can you not when you get to share the Zoom with David Michael Dame Judi Dench and Samuel L Jackson) but we didn't want to take that for granted.

It seemed to me that the world was changing again: businesses were beginning to reopen people were beginning to travel again but it was all happening at different rates. People were making choices based on their own understanding of the benefits and risks of the world and having choices made for them by an understandably fluid set of rules.

We thought it would be fun to explore that with David and Michael too. These are two hugely successful professionals but that doesn't mean mother nature (or the rule of law) makes exceptions for them. They get excited about going back to work then get angry when they can't... just like anyone else.

In the show you play exaggerated versions of yourselves are you anything like these characters in real life?

Lucy: Except for the 'blowing raspberries down Zoom' scene Staged One 'Lucy' was thoroughly unlike myself. I'm nowhere near as serious or as well-off! Simon and I are obviously brother and sister in real life but our relationship is the polar opposite of the cold and awkward one audiences saw in the first series. My brother is my best friend and in the real world we are a constant support to each other (being cruel to him on a daily basis during filming always felt a little uncomfortable!) We've worked together professionally on many occasions and it's always an absolute dream. He is hands-down one of the most talented directors of this generation and I love getting the opportunity to work together on any creative venture.

Having said all that the Lucy that you see in Staged Two is basically me. It's perhaps the easiest role I've ever played. Not one for showing my range!

Simon: How dare you. I think there are certain similarities between me and 'Simon'. He's ambitious and nimble (he moves quite quickly in Series 1 to capitalise on the strange new situation); and I think I would respond exactly as 'Simon' did if Michael Sheen told me he didn't like me and found me weaselly. But I hope I'm not quite that ineffectual. I also loathe warm-up games in real life.

Why do you think the show was so popular?

Lucy: I think what made it so popular was its goofy tenderness because more than ever in 2020 we needed escapism that was funny and silly and soft. David and Michael's chemistry sat in the centre of that added to which was their invaluable real-life chemistry with Georgia and Anna and hopefully mine with Simon. I've heard from so many people that Staged really ""cheered up their summer"" or ""saved their lockdown"". It's all credit to Simon and Phin working incredibly quickly to respond to the situation that we as a country (and a world) had suddenly found ourselves in and what they made was something relentlessly joyful. That's why it captured people's hearts I think.

Simon: I'd hoped people would find it funny and that it might be a brief distraction from the madness we were living through but it seemed to connect on other levels as well. This wasn't really an upfront intention we just wanted to amuse but it proved a delightful surprise.

I think we were all - are all? - feeling a sense of helplessness in the face of what was happening outside of our doors and the melancholy which began to infuse the script seemed to speak to people. David and Michael are so funny but their brilliance is also in being able to keep sadness side by side with that and that seemed - at least to me - to reflect the general mood: absurdity sitting hand in hand with tragedy.

I also think it helped that we didn't mention 'covid' or 'virus'... it's not a show about the actual situation we're living through; it's a context whereby two friends have to spend time together through this new technology and talk rubbish just to keep fear and madness at bay. I can certainly relate to that.

Then throw in Dame Judi Dench swearing and you've got everything you need.

What was it like working with each other?

Lucy: This team has been wonderful without exception. Filming was a joy from start to finish and everyone in the cast gave so much in terms of energy and patience to help each other in our remote performances. We've become a little family despite being such separate entities throughout filming. I particularly enjoyed getting waves from the Tennant and Sheen newborns on my birthday during filming in May.

Simon: It's been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. It's not an easy show to make: both series have been quite time sensitive (and we had to shoot some of Series 2 across LA/New York/UK time differences) the technology isn't always the most reliable and it's not particularly sociable - David Michael and me have actually yet to spend any time in the same room.

But they are such a dream pairing. Writing for them is wonderful and filming is such a joy: they make anything I've come up with 250 percent better just by showing up and reading it. Then we add in our returning faces and some new guest stars and I have to pinch myself.

Then our editor Dan Gage and composer Alex Baranowski - both complete masters - get their hands on it and suddenly we've got a thing. It's an extraordinary process and one I couldn't have dreamt off back in February.

It would be lovely to actually meet one of these days but until the world allows I couldn't be happier.

Staged. Tom (Ben Schwartz)

Ben Schwartz who played Jean-Ralphio Saperstein in Parks And Recreation joins the cast as an assistant character...

How did you become involved with Staged?

I got a text from David Tennant on behalf of him and the talented Georgia Tennant asking if I would be interested in joining the cast for a few episodes. That was all it took I was in.

Were you a fan of the first series?

I hadn't seen the series before I got the text but afterwards watched a bunch of episodes and immediately loved the vibe of the show. It looked like so much fun and would allow me to perform with actors I absolutely adored.

What can you tell us about your character Tom?

Tom is the assistant to David and Michael's agent. He's a hard worker and is an enormous David Tennant fan. The director Simon Evans did a great job of creating the character and keeping it loose to find fun little moments throughout to play.

What was it like working with Michael Sheen & David Tennant?

A dream. They are such talented actors and kind humans. I feel so fortunate to have acted virtually with them and created something to make people smile during these times.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL2J1c2luZXNzL2NvbW1vZGl0aWVzL2p1bWlhLXNoYXJlLWRyb3AtcmVncmV0dGFibGUtbXRuLTE4NTc3NTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jumia share drop regrettable - MTN | Monitor,"MTN Group a major shareholder in Jumia Technologies AG has said the fall in the e-commerce group stock price is unfortunate.

Speaking to Bloomberg a US-based media agency the MTN Group chief executive officer Mr Rob Shuter said: “It is regrettable that the value has gone down so much.”

The decline in Jumia’s share price according to the African Report has accelerated since the e-commerce platform said in August that sales consultants in Nigeria had been involved in placing improper orders which were then cancelled.

Jumia has traded as high as $49.77 per share but the stock has fallen to about $11 compared with the IPO price of $14.50 which gives the company a market value of about $867m from $1.5b in 2016.

MTN’s interest in Jumia according to Bloomberg is now worth less than $100m.

The move comes at a time when MTN is behind schedule in its bid to generate about $1b in asset sales over the next three years.

The fall Bloomberg reported makes the e-commerce group less viable for MTN to sell a stake in the near term.

This follows a six-month lock in period where the telecom would not sell its shareholding in the e-commerce platform.

“The post IPO lock up period of Jumia in which we have an 18.9 per cent stake has expired and as at 29 October this stake is valued at approximately $94.3m” Mr Ralph Mupita the MTN Group chief financial officer said in a statement earlier.

Assets disposal

According to Mupita MTN has through its Asset Realisation Programme which was announced in March achieved $141m out of the $1b target.

However the telecom said it hopes to attain more money through disposal of its tower assets in Uganda and Ghana.

“We continue to make steady progress in this regard and following American Towers Corporation’s announcement of its acquisition of Eaton Towers we are in advanced discussions to dispose of our 49 per cent holdings in ATC Ghana and ATC Uganda which we value at between $471m and $539m respectively” he said.

The sale is expected to help MTN meet its target of generating a $1b in asset sales over three years.

A statement by ATC highlighting the definitive agreement to acquire Eaton Towers including the assumption of existing debt of approximately $1.85b said the company continues to expect the transaction to close by the end of 2019 subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

Acquisition of the stakes in each of the joint ventures with MTN in Ghana and Uganda ATC said are also subject to the closing of the Eaton Towers transaction.

MTN group performance

According to Mr Shuter: “Service revenue grew by 9.6 per cent while earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) marginally improving by 0.6 per cent to 35.1 per cent.



“We remain committed to driving access to Internet and financial services and in quarter three we added 4.7 million active data users and 2.2 million mobile money subscribers across the portfolio. Our Ayoba messaging platform is now available across five markets and is already recording 515000 active users per month” Mr Shuter revealed.

Various disposal efforts

Botswana’s Mascom for $300m has been scrapped and events at Jumia Technologies AG have made a sell less viable.

Further proceeds could be generated by the redemption of the Nigeria unit’s preference shares which MTN values at $315m according to Mr Mupita.

The MTN group is awaiting a ruling from the central bank of Nigeria on the matter.

A proposed sale of HIS Towers - which is separate to the $1b plan - may be revived as shareholders including MTN prepare for a fresh tilt at an IPO next year people familiar with the matter said this week.

Michael Lill Director of eBay Partner Network (ePN) said despite the challenges of the pandemic ePN had a busy and successful year.

“We made great improvements to our program that built upon the launch of our new platform in 2019” Lill said listing some of the 2020 improvements as follows:

Faster reporting reducing the time lag for partner earnings reports from 48 hours to 5 – 10 hours;

A new simplified global rate card;

A new modern Data Feeds platform with programmatic access faster downloads larger feeds files and new fields such as Shipping Details and Global Trade Item Numbers;

An improved Link Generator with URL shortener and QR code options;

A new and improved Sales & Events widget to help you easily find the most relevant sales and deals events;

A new Deal API allowing you to search for and retrieve details about eBay deals and events.

However eBay made some changes that were unpopular with some affiliates.

In May eBay cut loyalty affiliate rates to zero commissions.



At the end of May it announced another change that affiliates interpreted as placing limits on certain payouts.



In June it announced it was killing the ePN Dynamic Feed Generator a popular tool that did not require the use of APIs in effect disabling RSS feeds sellers reported.

Another change in 2020: eBay gave sellers an incentive for enrolling in the program – as of June 15 sellers enrolled in ePN receive commission-free sales when buyers purchase through the sellers’ affiliate link.

eBay described the benefits in a nutshell: “For US sellers signed up with the eBay Partner Network you can earn a 100% final value fee credit when you bring a customer to eBay who buys one of your listings within 24 hours. You can even earn a commission when a customer you bring in makes a qualifying purchase from a different seller in that same timeframe.”

It’s a bit surprising not to see eBay promoting the ePN affiliate program to sellers more – we’d enjoy hearing from sellers about their experiences.

In his post ePN’s director Lill thanked members for being part of the program and wished them a new year and wrote “Our team is only just getting started. We have many more exciting improvements planned for 2021 so stay tuned!”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYXVndXN0aW5lZm91LzIwMjEvMDEvMDIvd2hlbi1iaWctYnJhbmRzLXN0b3BwZWQtc3BlbmRpbmctb24tZGlnaXRhbC1hZHMtbm90aGluZy1oYXBwZW5lZC13aHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When Big Brands Stopped Spending On Digital Ads Nothing Happened.

All Classic Motors located in tiny Velva North Dakota apparently overbought parts and now has a glut they need to sell.

In the photos I spotted Ford original parts along with Autolite and Motorcraft branding. According to the eBay listing All Classic Motors is looking to divest 20000+ line items (40000+ actual items) made up of 1963 - 1978 NOS and original Ford parts mostly 1964 - 1973 Mustang Shelby Mach 1 & Boss. If you’re starting a restoration on a Galaxie Torino Pantera Cobra Jet Tiger Fairlane Cyclone Cougar Maverick or Falcon (or all of the above) this would be a wonderland. Engine parts for Ford 289 390 427 428 and 429 are also in the mix.

All Classic Motors has been selling 1960’s and 1970’s vintage Mustang and Ford parts to customers all over the world for over 30 years and it sells complete assemblies. JD Larson the owner of All Classic Motors has four decades’ worth of classic Mustang experience and is an accredited judge with the Mustang Club of America.

Larson fell in love with Mustangs when he was 13 when a neighbor took him for a spin in his 1970 Mach 1 and by the time he was 16 he had saved up $650 to buy his own Mustang. He scoped out a 1967 Mustang Coupe and was ready to put his money down but his mom put the kibosh on the idea. I’m sure his mom took the wrath of his disappointment until his 16th birthday when she showed up in the driveway with that same 1967 Mustang as a gift to him.

For people who want to get on the property ladder buying an Insta-ready showhome is rarely an option.

If you’re a stickler for your interiors though you can always opt to buy an older house and make it your own – just like this Nottingham couple did.

Helen and Ben who have been sharing their renovations journey online bought a 1930s fixer-upper in March and have turned it around since then.

Sharing videos of their formerly-dated abode on their Let’s Make This House a Home TikTok and Instagram you can see just how much work has gone into the property.

The kitchen for example had to be fully ripped out and started again as well as digging into the garden to make an extension.

Old-fashioned tiles and bathroom fittings (such as the blue sink and bath) were taken down the outside of the house was re-rendered and walls were removed or repainted to create an open and modern space.

Many of the walls were panelled or ceilings were artexed which the couple took down opting for a less retro look.

The colour scheme throughout is now mostly neutral and pastel with pops of gold and matte black.

The kitchen is unrecognisable from its former state (Picture: Instagram/@letsmakethishouseahome)

Many of the items the couple have bought for their ‘new’ abode have been from eBay as well as sale bargains from the likes of Zara Home and La Redoute.

The couple’s kitchen was made by Howdens and further products were purchased from Sklum House of Dotcom and Made.

Helen and Ben also saved money by doing digging clearing up sanding and varnishing floors and removing paint and repainting themselves.

The pair’s videos have been a huge smash on TikTok with one in particular having been viewed over two million times.

‘The whole house has been done so beautifully and tastefully. Timeless’ one commenter said.

Another wrote: ‘Finally a house that isn ‘t all grey and boring and the same as everyone else’s. Love your interior.’

Although the couple haven’t been able to have people over due to coronavirus restrictions they’ve been focusing on getting it looking perfect (with plenty of interiors content on their socials) in the meantime.

The Milan Rotary Club has a record of various public service projects over the years.

They also have a student affiliate: The Edison High School Interact Club.

It originated eight years ago with a question to a Milan Rotarian who was a guest at an Elyria Rotary meeting.

Now it has grown to include 74 students – about 20 percent of Edison High’s student body.

“It’s a community service type of organization where we just come up with different projects and we go out into the community and try to do good and be genuine about everything that we do” said Anna James 17 co-president of the Interact Club.

“I think people just really like getting involved and seeing that their helping is directly impacting someone else” said fellow co-president Katelyn Chenevey 18.

“It’s definitely a genuine thing” James said. “It’s very genuine.”

They both are seniors at the school.

Getting started

Nick Georgiafandis is a Milan Rotarian and retired band director of Edison. His wife Kelley Georgiafandis is secretary of the Milan Rotary Club.

While he still was working at the school he recalled visiting the Elyria Rotary Club and speaking to Sam Battle now a retired teacher from Lorain County JVS.

“He said ‘what do you know about Interact?’ I said ‘what’s that?”‘ Georgiafandis said.

He credited Battle for inspiring the group while Battle complimented the high school students and the adult Rotarians.

“I may have been the spark because I was in a position to be the spark but they just flew” he said. “Once they got their wings they just took off. They’re a great example of how an Interact Club and Rotary work together and depend on each other.”

Battle remains Interact Club co-chairman for Rotary’s District 6600 which covers 64 clubs with 3500 members in northern Ohio.

“To me it’s a win-win situation” Battle said. “That’s what gets the teachers and the students and the parents and the Rotary Club all fired up and they do outstanding service for the community.”

The Edison High group began with 14 students recruited by twos from other clubs at the school.

Nick Georgiafandis still serves as Rotary liaison.

“I love doing it” Georgiafandis said adding “So this gets me back into the building.”

School librarian Patty Moyer is club adviser. She said her goal is “to be invisible” in a sense letting the students discover community needs and find ways to help.

“In all honesty at Edison we just have really good kids” Moyer said.

Whenever there is a call for volunteers the students are eager to get to the signup sheets said Kelley Georgiafandis.

“People who knock teenagers have no concept” she said. “They really are awesome. They want to help.”

It happens with little if any recognition for the work she added.

“There’s no list of names of who did what” Kelley Georgiafandis said. “You get nothing except you helped.”

Expanding reach

Rotary International works with almost 15000 Interact Clubs with almost 343000 students across 145 countries.

In Milan the club is open to students of all grades at Edison.

The club started with a $1000 contribution from Milan Rotary and students pay no dues.

Now it is self-sufficient raising money through the annual Pizza Palooza all-you-can-eat fundraiser with local restaurants. That event was canceled this year due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.

The beginning of November is Rotary International’s World Interact Week.

On Nov. 3 Chenevey and James spoke to the Milan Rotarians as part of their regular meeting.

During the COVID-19 pandemic the students communicate via email and social media Chenevey said.

They planted flowers at the high school and helped with Milan Rotary’s annual Halloween event. They will assist with loading backpacks with food for students who need them.

There is more to come and it will grow out from Milan.

Interact Club members assist OH-go the Sandusky-based mobile food pantry with its Project Happy effort that delivers wrapped boxes with toys snacks toiletries across Erie and Huron counties.

The Edison students have gone as far afield as Willard to give away the gifts. Chenevey will be co-leader of that work this year.

James a member of Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost’s Teen Ambassador Board said the club aims to join efforts to raise awareness of human trafficking – and maybe offer a way to help others out of it with a national hotline included on hotel soap.

In 2018 the Milan Chamber of Commerce presented its Youth Service Award to the club.

Edison School Superintendent Thomas C. Roth described the work of the club.

“Interact has certainly done outstanding things for the betterment of youth of our community” said Roth who also is a Rotarian. “First by their selfless acts to improve their school community and the world.

“But more importantly in my eyes by setting an example for all of our younger children as to what life is truly about: service above self.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The track is the second promotional single off his upcoming album “Tyron” which is set to release in February 2021. The project is the follow up to his 2019 studio debut “Nothing Great About Britain” and it sports an impressive tracklist including features from first time Slowthai collaborators A$AP Rocky Deb Never and Dominic Fike. In September Slowthai released the first single off the album “feel away” with help from acclaimed British electronic artists James Blake and Mount Kimbie a departure from the bangers that defined much of “Nothing Great About Britain.” As a follow up “nhs” continues the mellow trend of “feel away” perhaps signalling a new era for Slowthai.

Producer Kwes Darko wears his James Blake inspiration on his sleeve. Darko who made multiple contributions to “Nothing Great About Britain” ditches the string instrument loops used in his earlier work with Slowthai in favor of spacey James Blake-inspired pedal tones. Darko’s layering and drum structure takes melodic cues from Blake’s 2011 self-titled debut album. The song also employs the rolling harmonies explored by Darko on tracks like “Gorgeous” and “Ladies” off of Slowthai’s debut resulting in a rhythmic warmth similar to that of “feel away.”

Yet the track achieves much more than simple James Blake cosplay thanks to Slowthai’s melodic and smooth delivery. The rapper is battle-tested when it comes to flowing over aggressive beats — releasing a run of hard-edged singles over the summer including one with current hip-hop it-man Kenny Beats. As a result “nhs” represents a pivot for Slowthai away from his signature upbeat sound towards a softer more intimate narrative. Like “feel away” the track is another entry that nicely diversifies the rapper’s discography.

Slowthai transitions to a fresh lyrical approach one that allows him to explore his emotions and express his gratitude. On the track Slowthai takes an inward look at his emotions a rare occurrence within his catalogue: “My demons pry feelings die dreaming / No glass ceiling try peelin' back layers to find meaning.” In the song’s accompanying music video Slowthai stands on a tower of toilet paper a reference to the hoarding that took place at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Midway through the track he dedicates the song to the UK National Health Service: “NHS this one's for the NHS.” There have been only a few songs written about the coronavirus pandemic and even fewer thanking health care workers. Slowthai’s singing on the hook and effortless flow heighten the sincerity of his words.

The North Hampton rapper is in the midst of a rebrand from rabble-rouser to well-rounded artist. Up to this point in his career Slowthai’s public persona has been unfiltered and divisive which equally earned him fans as it drove others away. At the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize hosted by the BBC the rapper went viral for walking onto the stage with a prosthetic of Boris Johnson’s severed head yelling “Fuck Boris.” Slowthai had a similarly controversial experience at the 2020 NME awards drunkenly accepting his “Hero of the Year'' award and attempting to make a pass at presenter Katherine Ryan. Following the incident Twitter users moved to “cancel” the rapper. In the months since the incident Slowthai has apologized to Ryan and NME on multiple occasions calling Ryan “the true hero of the year” on Twitter. Ryan has also expressed that she was not made uncomfortable by the altercation.

Slowthai’s latest music seems to suggest that he’s turned a new leaf with less focus on rage and more attention to growth",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vZWRtLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy90b3AtMTAtZWRtLWFydGlzdC1sb2dvc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Love at First Sight: The Top 10 EDM Artist Logos,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://edm.com/features/top-10-edm-artist-logos on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vZWRtLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy90b3AtMTAtZWRtLWFydGlzdC1sb2dvc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbGFidXNpbmVzc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL2NvbnRpbmVudGFsLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LWxvdy1yaXNlLXByb2plY3RzLWF0dHJhY3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Continental Development’s Low-Rise Projects Attract High-Profile Tenants,"Straddling Manhattan Beach and El Segundo on the Rosecrans Corridor Continental Park today bills itself as the largest mixed-use office park in Los Angeles County.



The origins of the site home to the new headquarters of electric vehicle-maker Fisker Inc. stretch back more than 50 years.



In 1969 entrepreneur and general contractor Charles Lundquist launched Continental Development Corp. The basis of his new company was 20 acres of land in the South Bay that he had acquired for UNIMERC an investment group Lundquist had formed 14 years earlier.



He merged UNIMERC into Continental Development Corp. and started building out the plot of land that would become Continental Park.



Over the next five decades Continental Development would steadily grow its presence in L.A. The company now holds roughly 4 million square feet of commercial and office space in California and its expansion continues today under the leadership of the founder’s son Richard Lundquist who came aboard in 1972.



“Growing up I always knew I wanted to be involved in real estate development” he said.



But Lundquist’s first big role was not in his father’s company. Instead he and a friend started a home building business creating spec homes.



His dad then asked him to join Continental but Lundquist continued building homes on the side. By 1988 he was working on Continental’s commercial properties full time.



Lundquist became president of Continental after holding other roles at the company including construction project manager and working with the property management department. After his dad retired in the mid-1990s he acquired the company.



Lundquist said he “enjoyed the relationships with our (commercial real estate) tenants. Tenants are a little different than residents and I really loved the aspects of that type of development that we do. The office the medical office retail restaurants and we’ve done a movie theater complex and fitness facilities. I enjoyed the variety and the aspect of holding onto the assets instead of just selling a home to a buyer.”



Continental also has several projects in the construction or planning phases.



Most recently the company developed an office campus called Del Rey in partnership with Mar Ventures Inc. It’s also working on the Nash Street Exchange a 7.3-acre site near the El Segundo Boulevard Green Line station that will have 75000 square feet of retail dining and medical office space.



And in July Boston Properties Inc. acquired a 50% interest in Continental Development’s planned Beach Cities Media Campus a 6.4-acre site on the western border of Continental Park.



El Segundo and beyond

Continental Development has long been interested in El Segundo.



“That’s where my father’s manufacturing business was that he would end up with the land. The buildings were in Manhattan Beach on Rosecrans … and they had acquired approximately 20 acres for expansion in El Segundo” Lundquist said.



At the time the market had higher vacancy rates. That plus its proximity to the airports and ocean and the fact that the city is very business-friendly made it a desirable area to develop Lundquist said.



“It seemed like an excellent place to continue our development activity” he said.

El Segundo known as an aerospace hub and for its Chevron refinery has been attracting a greater variety of tenants lately.



During the third quarter of 2020 the asking rate for Class A space in the area was $4.44 a square foot up 5 cents in a year according to data from Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. That number might seem high but it’s still a discount compared to parts of the Westside like Santa Monica where the average asking rent was $6.64 a square foot during the third quarter.



Continental has also worked on projects in other L.A. County cities and it has substantial holdings in Torrance in the medical office field.



Lundquist said Del Rey the company’s most recently completed project was “a very nice development that is suited for the post-Covid world.”



Del Rey is comprised of three two-story buildings on roughly 5.7 acres.



In November Electronic Arts Inc. announced it had signed a 10-year lease for a new studio headquarters at the campus. The video game company is leaving its longtime offices in Playa Vista for Del Rey which features lots of outdoor areas and balconies.

“The fact that it was a campus with individual buildings was of interest to (EA) so they could have their own building” Lundquist said.



Some experts say that during and after the Covid pandemic many tenants are likely to seek out their own buildings rather than shared properties.



Lundquist said the company is also incorporating features such as touchless doors and entrances as well as stairways in buildings that allow tenants to avoid elevators.

“We do everything we can to make the buildings work under this new world we are living in” he said.



Adding hotels and more

Continental Park started as an industrial park. Over the years it has added a variety of other uses including a large movie theater complex a fitness facility restaurants and creative office buildings.



Beyond traditional office and retail the company also has substantial medical holdings.



Its Skypark medical office complex in Torrance spans 13 buildings and more than 500000 square feet. It is served by two hospitals.



“Our medical offices are in Torrance and we acquired that property because it was a good value-add opportunity that was presented to us” Lundquist said.



Initially he planned on the project being traditional office space but quickly changed gears.



“After a few months we didn’t have any new tenants signed up after building out a few of these spec suites but we’re receiving a tremendous number of calls for medical space and being in close proximity to Torrance Memorial Hospital decided to concentrate on medical there” Lundquist said.



When Continental acquired the property it was 15-20% medical office space. It is now 80-85% medical office space.



The company has also ventured into hospitality. In 2008 it opened the 32-story InterContinental San Francisco. According to Continental it was the largest new hotel development in the city in more than 20 years.



Lundquist said the company owned the land and the Moscone Center — the city’s biggest convention center — was expanding “all the way up to (our) doorstep.”



“We decided it made the most sense to develop a hotel” Lundquist said. “It’s our first hotel and it could quite possibly be our only hotel.”



Still he said the company could be interested in a high-end boutique hotel being added to the Continental Park area.

Manchester United star Bruno Fernandes and Manchester City playmaker Kevin De Bruyne have had their 29 in-game FIFA 21 stats compared to determine the best player out of the two.

Fernandes 26 has established himself as one of the best midfielders in the Premier League thanks to his sensational impact since January.

De Bruyne 29 was in scintillating form last season as he became the first City player in history to win the PFA Players' Player of the Year award.

However former Crewe Alexandra striker Dean Ashton ruffled some feathers recently as he claimed that Fernandes has ""overtaken"" De Bruyne as the best player in the Premier League.

The 37-year-old explained: ""I think Fernandes has already overtaken De Bruyne.

""You can see the difference when [Sergio] Aguero doesn't play for Man City. You can see the difference in De Bruyne in terms of he looks like a frustrated figure in a lot of the games.

""He's still class of course as he's got seven assists this season and the same as Bruno.

""It's that goal tally I think that Fernandes brings you. That goal threat that's the difference between him and Kevin De Bruyne and that's why I'd pick him and why I think he's gone ahead of him as for me the best player in the Premier League.""

Now FUTBIN has been used to do a side-by-side comparison of Fernandes and De Bruyne's FIFA 21 stats to determine who is the winner across all categories.

Fernandes holds an 87 rating in FIFA 21 while De Bruyne boasts a whopping 91 rating in EA Sports' latest title in the franchise.

A staff writer for The Sentinel-Record reported that as of 11:30 p.m. Thursday all of downtown Hot Springs was without power and Entergy's online outage map indicated the outage stretched as far east as Cloud 9 RV Park and as far west as Cedarglade Road.

J. Paul Brewster customer service manager for Entergy Arkansas said a crossarm on a transmission line was damaged causing the outages.

""All services have been restored"" Brewster said at around noon Friday.

Brewster said there was no obvious cause but it ""appeared to be lightning-related.""

The eye-catcher on the AJ13 is the hologram on the heel that literally mimics a black panther’s eye with the theme extending to the paw-shaped outsole. The shoe also boasts a carbon fiber support plate once again for lightweight support. That is combined with the heel and forefoot Zoom Air units for a quick and responsive first step.

Jimmy notably rocked the “He Got Game” colorway of the AJ13 in 2017.

The Nike Air provides a classic touch when the Jordan Brand was still a part of Nike while the eye-catching Air unit shows how cushioned the shoe is.

Jimmy specifically wore Air Jordan 3 “White Cement ’88’ in 2016. He also rocked the “BHM” colorway in 2018 with the Timberwolves.

For context always refer to the full article.

Rappler speaks to Barbara de Laere about the shift and what it means for Aveda's customers

Beauty brand Aveda announced on January 1 2021 that all of its products are now 100% vegan. That means both future launches and older products are now produced without beeswax one of the last animal-derived ingredients in the brand’s inky list.

The process Aveda global brand president Barbara de Laere told Rappler involved combing through all of the ingredients they used – over 900 of them – going up and down the supply chain and making sure animal-derived ingredients are not involved in any step of the process.

De Laere said the process took several years because the goal was always “go over and beyond the expectations the consumer has when they use a certain product.”

The most difficult to find plant-derived alternatives to said De Laere were honey beeswax and beeswax absolute. Beeswax is used in color cosmetics and hair products and helps in making products easier to apply. Beeswax absolute meanwhile helps in the aroma of Aveda’s products. The company eventually developed a proprietary blend to replace these ingredients.

Carbon-negative goal

Aveda founded in 1978 has always made sustainability a goal.

It’s been cruelty-free since it was founded (which means it doesn’t test on animals) which means going full vegan made “a huge amount of sense for the brand” said De Laere. The point of Aveda she said is to prove that you “don’t need to compromise between being responsible and sustainable and being profitable successful and profitable at the same time.”

It’s important to note however that while Aveda is cruelty-free and 100% vegan its mother company the beauty giant Estée Lauder Companies (ELC) is not. While ELC itself does not test on animals “animal testing on cosmetics products exists if a regulatory body demands it for its safety or regulatory assessment.” Some countries require animal testing on products including cosmetics because they get permits to be sold. Aveda is one of 6 ELC brands that are fully cruelty-free

Neither formulas nor price points will be affected by the shift to vegan said De Laere.

“We have been producing vegan since August of 2019… if there would have been any issue we would have about it and we would have solved it. Luckily we haven’t heard any issue” she told Rappler ahead of the company’s announcement.

On top of consistency with the brand’s ethos De Laere explained that shifting to 100% vegan was a necessary response to consumer behavior. “We’re also seeing with our consumers this incredible drive for ethical consumerism. People vote with their dollars and they’re interested more than ever in the heart and soul of the brand” she said.

Aveda the company announced in a media briefing in December 2020 has bigger goals in mind – it aims to be carbon negative in its production by fiscal year 2024. “Carbon negative” entails the company’s entire ecosystem – which includes its affiliate salons and sourcing pool for its ingredients which had already become smaller because of its shift to 100% vegan. “The ROI (return on investment) on these investments are enormous – not just from a business perspective” she said.”

“The future of beauty has to be sustainable. There’s going to be – and rightly so – an explosion of demand from people wanting to know: what is this product what’s the footprint how about the environment and how are you taking responsibility as a company? It’s a role that we have to play” she added.

The shift has to do with giving people both the choice and the education to consume what’s best for one’s “three homes” – “the body the people that you love and the planet that you live on” said De Laere.

De Laere will also be the first to acknowledge the (rightful) skepticism that comes when a multinational pledges sustainability and environmental consciousness. For Aveda she said the key was “transparency and being very open.” In late October Aveda and ELC tapped blockchain technology to track the production and processing of vanilla from Madagascar.

Veganuary too

Play Video

To mark and perhaps boost the company’s push to 100% vegan products it’s also joining in Veganuary an event run by a UK-based nonprofit that encourages people to go vegan for an entire month. The preparations at the Aveda HQ in Blaine Minnesota is almost as intensive as ingredient audit. De Laere said that months prior non-vegan members of the Aveda team had been slowly switching to vegan alternatives – like using plant-based milk instead of dairy milk.

The effort is company-wide and company-backed – vegan cooking lessons and seminars are being line-up to help the non-vegans ease into the challenge. “We’re using our partners to help our teams without fear to start to dabble into the vegan world” she said.

In a way the Veganuary challenge and how it’s unfolding over at Aveda proves that moving towards sustainability entails both an individual’s and a community’s efforts. Speaking to media during a briefing De Laere said Aveda’s shift to being 100% vegan wasn’t just a challenge to its competitors and colleagues and in the beauty industry but an invitation.

“Naively I believe that we can change the world. The power of one and the choices we make even if they’re tiny [make an impact]” said De Laere who herself is a vegan. – Rappler.com

Play video content 12/26/20 @keyonharrold / Instagram

Miya Ponsetto is now in the crosshairs of authorities for her antics in an NYC hotel and TMZ has learned she also caused quite a fuss -- allegedly -- at the Peninsula hotel in Bev Hills back in February.

Miya and her mom Nicole apparently wore out their welcome when Peninsula staff ordered them to leave but they refused. Law enforcement sources tell us someone from the hotel called police told them the women looked drunk and refused to leave ... so Beverly Hills cops showed up to handle the situation.

Our law enforcement sources say when they arrived and tried to get Miya and Nicole to leave Nicole allegedly pushed and kicked a cop. Both women were arrested ... Nicole for battery on a police officer and being drunk in public. While Miya was arrested for being drunk in public. They have a court hearing later this month.

Now get this ... the L.A. County District Attorney charged both women on May 27 2020. The very next day Miya was arrested again this time for drunk driving. She pled no contest and was sentenced to 3 years probation 30 hours of community service and she must take a 9-month alcohol/drug counseling program.

As for the phone incident -- in case you don't know turns out she left her phone in an Uber -- seems Miya has a thing for phones -- her Etsy page is littered with custom phone cases she favors. Even if she's obsessed with phones it's no reason to flip out on 14-year-old Keyon Harrold Jr. New York authorities are considering serious charges against her.

‘Snooki’ left ‘Jersey Shore: Family Vacation’ because it was best for her

The drama surrounding Angelina Pivarnick’s wedding broke the Jersey Shore family apart. Despite the men’s best efforts to pick up the pieces at Pivarnick’s ceremony Polizzi Jenni “JWoww” Farley and Deena Cortese said they were done working with Pivarnick. In Polizzi’s case she was done filming with Pivarnick for good.

“I am retiring from Jersey Shore” Polizzi explained on her podcast It’s Happening With Snooki and Joey. “I am not coming back for season four if there is one. Don’t hate me for my decision but I have to do what’s best for me at the moment.”

Polizzi mentioned how she felt like the show had become “so serious” and she didn’t “like the person [she was] portrayed as.” In an April 2020 interview with HelloGiggles Polizzi added how she wasn’t “in the mood to do [the] drama with Angelina anymore.” She also expressed her desire to work on “fun shows.”

Nicole Polizzi plans to expand her line of Snooki Shops in 2021

In addition to owning and operating an Etsy shop Nicole’s Craft Room Polizzi has two other business ventures: Meatball Merch and the Snooki Shop. Meatball Merch is an online retailer coined “the number one spot for all meatballs” while the Snooki Shop is a brick-and-mortar store.

https://twitter.com/snooki/status/1341774876475056131

“Snooki’s” boutique offers shoppers hand-selected clothing curated by Polizzi herself. So far the Snooki Shop has two locations: one in Madison New Jersey and one in Beacon New York.

During an Instagram “Ask Me Anything” session Polizzi revealed her plans to expand her store with more locations. In the future Polizzi wants to open Snooki Shops in Long Island New York Dallas Los Angeles Chicago Miami and Boston.

Nicole ‘Snooki’ Polizzi said she’s not done with reality television

In May 2020 Polizzi said she’s “not done with TV — I’m just done with [Jersey Shore: Family Vacation]” (via People). During her Instagram Q&A a fan asked Polizzi if she would ever return to the reality television circuit. Polizzi replied: “YAS HOE!”

“I miss filming so much!” she added in her reply. “Def not done making shows for you. 2021 come thru.”

Answering another fan’s question Polizzi mentioned not having any regrets about her time on MTV adding that she is willing to work with the network again in the future.

“Omg NO!” Polizzi said. “MTV has been my family for 10+ years and will continue to be moving forward with new projects.”

What the future projects Polizzi is referring to are remains shrouded in mystery. When asked if she would consider being a star on The Real Housewives of New Jersey Polizzi said she would “bring the wine!!” At this time there has been no official word of Polizzi joining the Bravo series but anything is possible.

However they are all in the same two categories. There are apps like eBay Etsy and Amazon where you can sell in a vast storefront in competition with other people. The other type are online marketplaces like Facebook Craigslist Letgo etc where you list your stuff and wait to hear from someone.

There is technically a third type but we have a totally separate list of garage sale apps that we recommend in case you want to sell your stuff the old-fashioned way with a modern twist. For now let’s check out the best Android apps to sell stuff online.

The best Android apps to sell stuff

5miles Price: Free / $39.99 per month

5miles is one of the more popular apps to sell stuff. It’s an online marketplace where you can post your stuff to have it sold. It uses GPS and zip code to show your post to people in your area. Additionally it has Facebook integration built-in seller-buyer messaging and more. It’s fairly easy to use as well. This is definitely good for those who want to sell things on Craigslist and also want another place to post it as well. Some people have experienced issues but most seem to enjoy the experience well enough.

Amazon Seller Price: Free

Amazon Seller is for those who want to take this seriously. The app allows you to manage your Amazon seller account. You’ll have to create your account on Amazon’s website. Otherwise you can do most of the stuff in the app. Included with the app is a photo studio where you can get pictures of your stuff. Additionally you can respond to messages start special offers and do plenty of other stuff. It’s a little over the top if you only want to sell one or two things. However it’s good to have this just in case you want to sell more than that.

Craigslist Price: Free

Craigslist is one of the most popular places to sell things online. You can post an ad people respond and you can work out details like where to meet or how the person is picking up the thing you sell them. The website doesn’t have any flashy graphics or bells and whistles. You simply post the ad add images add your contact info and wait for the texts to come in. The app works well enough. It basically looks like the website itself so you can easily do this on a browser as well.

eBay Price: Free

eBay is the king of apps to sell stuff. People and companies have been using eBay for years to sell their things and it’s one of the most trusted names in the genre. It comes with a couple of ways to sell your stuff (auction or Buy It Now) various security features and you can do everything in the app that you can on the website. There really isn’t a limit to what you can sell on eBay. Even the listings are generally more informative and helpful than smaller sites. It’s a pain to get set up if you don’t have an account for some reason but otherwise it’s pretty fantastic.

Etsy (Sell on Etsy) Price: Free

Etsy is a great place to sell some of your stuff. It’s a website for artists and tinkerers where you can sell homemade art crafts and various other objects. It’s not the kind of place where you’d sell a couch or a TV. However if you have some paintings or some oven mitts that you made this is a good place to go. The app itself works pretty well and you can even use it to sell things in person. It also comes with order management listing management and you can talk to potential buyers. It’s not a bad place to go for independent artists. However we wouldn’t recommend this for selling the stuff out of your garage. There are better options for stuff like that.

Facebook Marketplace Price: Free

Facebook is also getting into the apps to sell stuff market. Semi-recent updates have included a new marketplace feature. You can browse and search there to find goods based on your location. Similarly you can post your stuff on there and hope that someone takes an interest. It’s kind of like they built the sell section of Craigslist right into Facebook. Since many people use the Facebook app anyway why not try to sell something there too? The only downside is we’re not sure how many people actually know about the marketplace feature on Facebook so we don’t know how many people will see it.

Letgo Price: Free

Letgo is one of the larger apps to sell stuff. With over ten million downloads (at least) there is a good-sized audience of people to sell yourself to. It features a clean interface simple posting and plenty of additional features. It boasts an AI built-in that tries to categorize and name your items without your input to make things easier. You can even chat with potential buyers and sellers to get things worked out. It’s not perfect but people seem to enjoy using it. The pitfalls it does have seem to be indicative of the app type. A lot of apps to sell stuff have things like bots and jerks that parade around the site. You won’t escape them by simply moving to another app so just use the one that works best for you.

OfferUp Price: Free / Up to $21.99

OfferUp is another one of the local apps to sell stuff. You can post your stuff relatively quickly or browser around for stuff that’s already there. On top of the basics the app also allows people to earn reputation points for being good sellers. This helps weed out the spammers and scammers. Otherwise the app is actually pretty simple comparatively. The interface can be a little cluttered but it works. It’s a good option for those looking for something simple. They also have plenty of users so there’s a good chance your stuff will be seen.

VarageSale Price: Free

VarageSale is an app that focuses on a lack of anonymity. Users are required to sign up via Facebook so that everyone can see everyone. The idea is to help lower the qualms that people have about buying and selling online. In addition to that VarageSale covers the basics pretty well. You can list your stuff arrange sales through the app and browser stuff from other people. Admins also regulate the service. That should help lower the number of spammers. It’s a fairly decent site overall and one of the better apps to sell stuff.

Specialty sites and forums Price: Free / Varies

There are a variety of sites that specialize in certain items. For instance Swappa is an excellent place to sell your used smartphones tablets etc. The Head-Fi forums are a great place to sell high-end audio gear (although you must pass their forum introductions first). Those are just two examples. There are forums and sites all over the Internet for enthusiasts. Some of them let you sell stuff. Specific subreddits on Reddit are good places as well. It’s not great for every demographic and unfortunately we’re only the most familiar with tech stuff. However it’s worth looking at various large communities to see if they allow you to sell things on the site. Just be cool about it you know?

The $30 million (Shs111.9b) Afrexim Bank regional headquarters’ establishment in Kampala is an African financial institution formed by 50 states and private investors. The bank is expected to promote and finance trade within the African continent and trade between Africa and other continents.

In an interview yesterday Mr Patrick Bitature chairman Private Sector Foundation Uganda and a renowned businessman said: “Afrexim having foot prints in Kampala is good news that the continental bank will have a satellite regional home in Uganda.”

He said this brings decision makers nearer to the businesses giving the private sector here easier access to the bank.

“Uganda needs more pockets of money parked here. Nearly 80 per cent of the long-term funds are in South Africa Ivory Coast or Kenya. The good news should be spread around more equally” Mr Bitature said.

High rate

Responding to the 10 per cent interest rate the continental bank will be offering for long-term loans Mr Bitature said this is still relatively high in dollar terms.

“The rest of the world has been trading at four to five per cent since 2008. Interest rates are poised to increase now with USA leading the way. So we should expect a rise in the coming days” he said.

Dr Fred Muhumuza a Makerere University lecturer and economist says Afrexim is an international bank which follows member countries’ applications.

“If Ugandan firms don’t compete or qualify they may fail to comply much as the regional headquarters will be in Kampala” Mr Muhumuza shared.

Kampala City Traders’ Association (Kacita)’s chairman Mr Everest Kayondo said: “Afrexim offering 10 per cent interest rate is being offered by some local commercial banks in Uganda. So they will be doing nothing special but they shall only join the competition with the existing banks.”

He said if you are taking a loan in foreign exchange Afrexim will be offering alternative services like the existing banks.

“When you compare this rate with what the African Development Bank offers which staggers at about 2 and 3 per cent it makes Afrexim’s rate more expensive and not appealing” Mr Kayondo said.

Yearwood and Singh both expressed gratitude for being among the supporting cast of the two-day four-team tournament which kicked off Tuesday.

They stated that they were looking forward to building a stronger partnership with football and the sports fraternity in the new year. Forde thanked Yearwood and Singh whilst underscoring the safety of the players competing in the tournament. “It is also important for me to use this occasion to state that the Bounce Back’ football event is being organized and managed in the strictest possible compliance with the conditions that were outlined by the COVID-19 Task Force.

The following paragraphs cover results of a review of the governance structure and board compositions of a few select multinational PSEs and guidelines of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in this regard.

SABIC is a Saudi Arabian petrochemicals giant having operations in over 50 countries and earned $45 billion in revenue in 2018 alone. Its chairman is a PhD in chemical engineering from the US who started his career from the company.

Earlier he served as chairman of a joint venture of ExxonMobil and SABIC for 12 years and on boards of Aramco and Ma’aden. How many PSEs in Pakistan have got chairpersons of this stature? All the other directors have similar profiles. Malaysia’s oil and gas giant Petronas has annual revenue of $55 billion and has presence in 35 countries. Its chairman is a graduate of Ohio University and he started his career in 1981 from Petronas.

Another member is a leading economist another an engineer who started his career from Petronas with all others having similar profiles. Compare this with the current board of any PSE in Pakistan and we would know the reasons for them being on ventilators. Ma’aden is a Saudi mining PSE having $6 billion in annual revenue. The reason for its success is its nine-member board of directors. Amongst other leading relevant professionals on its board it has two expatriates who are accomplished professionals in mining and corporate leadership. Where does PMDC stand in this regard?

Statoil is an oil and gas PSE of Norway with annual revenue of $80 billion and presence in more than 30 countries. The reason for its success is its 11-member professional board of directors. Its chairman is a geophysicist with extensive relevant corporate experience another director is an engineer an economist and an ex-CEO of Shell and all others having similar profiles.

Similarly the Annual Corporate Governance Report of an energy company generating annual revenue of $50-60 billion proudly lists a set of essential skills for a board to possess as a whole and the percentage availability in its board as follows: top management experience 87% energy sector knowledge 80% international experience 93% financing and accounting knowledge 73% risk management 93% strategy 87% institutional experience and public sector 60% legal and corporate governance 87% and technology 47%. How many PSEs in Pakistan can boast of this experience?

Also the OECD provides explicit guidelines for the efficient management of PSEs vide “OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises 2015 Edition”. While presenting prime responsibilities of the state or ministry it describes them as “establishing well-structured merit-based and transparent board nomination processes”.

At another place it states “the nomination of SOE boards should be … based on … competencies and experiences required.”

An assessment report of the World Bank on Pakistan’s corporate governance in light of the OECD guidelines also repeatedly highlights the importance of professional boards.

A few of its observations and recommendations are that “the ministries play a strong role in taking many decisions that good practice assigns to the board of directors or management”. “In practice the boards of most PSCs are seen as weak with ineffective oversight and prone to political interference.”

As to the ministry’s foremost responsibility it defines it as “professionalise and create the infrastructure for the process of board appointments”. And this is where we have failed.

First our boards are populated mostly with irrelevant directors and then bureaucrats have invariably strong presence in every board. This not only compromises the independence of boards but their interaction with the management results in creation of factions and sacrifice of professionalism.

The atmosphere coupled with the fact that independent directors also mostly remain aligned with the bureaucrats proves too stifling for merit and professionalism.

Thus the root causes of current status of the PSEs come out to be as follows: 1) Absence of required competence at the board level. 2) Lack of independence of boards because of the bureaucrats serving as directors and even the independent directors being selected by the ministry. 3) The decline of PSEs’ performance does not affect the career of any director.

So what should be done then? A few suggestions are: First professional boards are essential. In this regard guidelines of the OECD are quite explicit. Also the implementation of the yardstick in the PSC (Corporate Governance) Rules 2013 ie “is a reputed businessman or a recognised professional with relevant sectoral experience” for a director is essential.

How many reputed businessmen and recognised professionals with relevant sector experience are deployed in our boards?

Second there is a need to develop a transparent process and an independent advisory board authorised to nominate board members and later also evaluate the performance of the board of directors. This board should consist of eminent professionals. Third annual performance contracting between the government and each PSE is essential. Fourth independent boards can never be achieved until sufficient “social distancing” is created between the PSEs and ministries as per the available models such as Norwegian and Middle Eastern or the holding companies’ model (Temasek Holdings Khazana Sasac etc).

Fifth a measurable yardstick should be introduced for the annual evaluation of board of directors. So as demonstrated above in order to make our PSEs genuine engines of progress they just need professional boards and an effective governance model which should be priority No 1 for the government.

Pacioni announced Wednesday that her Consumer Protection Unit — along with the San Diego County District Attorney’s office and the Stanislaus County District Attorney’s office — has entered into a final stipulated judgment with Minnesota-based Fastenal Company regarding allegations that it charged walk-in retail customers undisclosed “shipping and handling” fees.

Fastenal sells industrial and construction supplies at its 138 retail facilities in California. Many of these stores are open to the public for walk-in sales including at its branch stores in Seaside Salinas and Soledad.

Since at least 2015 prosecutors alleged Fastenal sold certain in-stock goods to customers at these stores without disclosing that it was adding “shipping and handling” surcharges for these products in violation of California’s Unfair Competition Law and False Advertising Law.

The prosecutors alleged that Fastenal further failed to provide customer-facing screens that display the prices of goods and surcharges as they are scanned as required by section 13300 of the Business and Professions Code preventing customers from noticing the surcharges prior to payment.

At the time of these violations Fastenal was under a permanent injunction not to intentionally engage in these same acts within California.

On Sept. 13 2011 the California Superior Court for the County of San Diego entered a stipulated judgment against Fastenal Company in a similar public enforcement action by the People of the State of California which enjoined Fastenal Company from these violations and from otherwise engaging in false advertising or unfair competition.

Pursuant to the stipulated judgment in this current case Fastenal Company must pay $625000 in investigative costs and civil penalties plus $25000 in cy pres restitution to the California Consumer Protection Prosecution Trust Fund. Fastenal is also ordered to establish and maintain an audit program and an employee training program to ensure future compliance. The stipulated judgment includes a new permanent injunction that enjoins Fastenal from intentionally engaging in similar violations in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,

That's about 59.5% of the price the mall traded for in 2015.

The Shops at Sunset Place in 2016

The parcel located at 5701 SW 72nd St. is situated along U.S. 1 a major road. It was originally developed as a site for Holsum Bakery and in the 1980s was transformed into the Bakery Centre Shopping Plaza. That was demolished in 1996 to make way for The Shops at Sunset Place which opened in 1999 with an FAO Schwarz and a Virgin Megastore both long closed.

The mall struggled with vacancies in recent years and Simon Property Group sold the property for $110M in 2015 to the publicly traded Maryland-based REIT Federal Realty Investment Trust along with local partners Grass River Property and the Comras Co. An annual report disclosed the mall was only 62% leased in 2019 though it still had major tenants including an AMC Theatres and an LA Fitness.

The owners planned to tear down half of the shopping complex about 80K SF of vacant retail space and replace it with three 17-story towers that would include apartments and hotel rooms. However the partners defaulted on a $61M loan during the coronavirus pandemic.

In November Federal Realty Investment Trust CEO Don Wood said the partners would be abandoning the redevelopment plans. On New Year's Eve FRIT Shops at Sunset Place Fee Owner LLC sold the property to Midtown Opportunities a Miami-based firm that developed portions of Midtown Miami including co-developing the recently opened 32-story GIO Midtown tower and it is developing 22 acres in Orlando.

“When the opportunity came to purchase Sunset Place a landmark property located in South Miami we jumped on it. For us this is about more than just real estate"" Alex Vadia principal of Midtown Development Midtown Opportunities’ development arm said in a statement. ""Although Midtown Opportunities has closed significant transactions in various key sectors South Miami is our home turf. We look forward to re-imagining the possibilities of Sunset Place alongside our community partners.”

Grass River will continue to manage the property.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pYW1paGVyYWxkLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2NvbW11bml0eS9taWFtaS1kYWRlL2NvY29udXQtZ3JvdmUvYXJ0aWNsZTI0NzkyODE4MC5odG1s0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAubWlhbWloZXJhbGQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY29tbXVuaXR5L21pYW1pLWRhZGUvY29jb251dC1ncm92ZS9hcnRpY2xlMjQ3OTI4MTgwLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who opens a mall in a pandemic?

This was not the first time it had disappeared. I once paid to have it shipped to our old apartment from a hotel in St. Louis where I had left it. I like to imagine my hat alone in its carefully prepared shipping box in the FedEx plane like a passenger in one of those deluxe Qatar Airways cabins resting in suffocated luxury. In the same year I also managed to leave it in New York. In fact my hat took more solo flights in 2016 than the average American.

The hat in question is (or was: as we will see I have some curious opinions about the metaphysics of lost items) a white snapback cap with a navy bill. On the front panel in blue letters surrounded by stitched gold ""U of M"" was embossed with ""The University of Michigan"" just below tautologically as if somebody needed to be reminded that it was not a Mizzou or an Ole Miss hat. When I purchased it in the summer of 2015 (just before the start of Jim Harbaugh's first season as the head coach of his alma mater's football team) it was new in the sense that it still had the tags on it but research suggests that it had been made in the late '90s. It brought me back to the golden era of Charles Woodson and Saturday afternoons on my father's lap to beery kisses and shouts of joy.

The saddest thing is that it is not even an especially lucky hat. I know a man who swears the New England Patriots are incapable of losing playoff games when he watches them at a certain bar in Alexandria Virginia. (This is not idle speculation; it is based upon years of irrefutable data and if he had the time and the inclination the results could probably be verified by scientists.) In my years of wearing it Michigan football did not reach a single Big 10 championship; we went 1-4 in bowl games and of course continued our long slump against Ohio State.

Most fans are familiar with the football gods with last-minute field goal jinxes and willed interceptions in the half world given over to preternatural forces that govern the destinies of teams. Somehow my hat never quite managed to appease these mysterious beings. In certain games — the 10-3 win over Iowa last year — its influence was unmistakable but in the really big moments — the infamous ""spot"" game against Ohio State in 2016 — it appeared all but powerless for reasons I could not explain. Perhaps it was only when I wore the hat after my children and I had taken part in our pre-game ""parade routine"": blasting an ancient 78-era recording of ""The Victors"" while stomping around the house. It is also possible there was some other unguessed configuration — donning the cap at the opening kick-off or only wearing it on defensive possessions — that I was never able to discover. What I know for certain is that however mixed the hat's results had been during the previous four years Michigan football had the worst season in its 141-year history without it. The oracles are dumb.

But it seems to me ungracious to suggest that my relationship with the hat was narrowly transactional that I loved it only because on rare occasions it teemed with mystic promise. I met Lena Dunham wearing this hat. I smoked a cigarette five feet away from Hillary Clinton wondering whether this apparently keen Razorbacks fan remembered the only meeting between the two teams in 1999. I wore it at the New York Hilton on the night of Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election. Only a few days after purchasing it I paced up and down King Street during my wife's long labor with our oldest. I wore it in Rome for the canonization of St. John Henry Newman including rather perversely in the presence of a priest friend and the group of pilgrims from the University of Notre Dame he was leading. I used to wear it every time I visited South Bend. Napkin math suggests that I have grilled at least 1200 hamburgers 900 bratwursts and 120 steaks with the hat at parks and in our backyard and drunk goodness knows how many thousands of adult beverages. I had it with me at the hospital when I learned that we had lost our daughter Winifred earlier this year well into the second trimester a comfortable object reached for unthinkingly in a moment of near-despair.

What became of the hat I wonder? When I was a child the repeated experience of losing something for several weeks only to see it appear suddenly in a place where I was certain I had looked dozens of times convinced me that lost things were spirited away to some mysterious realm a kind of limbo until whatever mysterious authority was in charge of such things decreed their return. But a part of me has always feared that an even worse fate awaits our lost objects: extinction. It seems to me somehow impossible that beloved possessions sit on park benches or in landfills for months and years and even decades awaiting decomposition. Instead upon assuming the status of a truly lost item in violation of the supposed law of the preservation of matter they simply lapse into non-being.

There are more prosaic explanations. It is possible that someone found it in South Carolina where we had been traveling for a wedding. A surprising amount of public polling suggests that Michigan is the most hated team in college football. I rather like the idea that someone saw the hat and lit fire to it. If I found a hat emblazoned with the logo of a team I despise — Florida say — lying on a bench or a sidewalk would I destroy it? Until recently I almost certainly think my answer would have been yes. But now I am convinced that I would do everything in my power to return it to its owner.

Last week on Christmas morning one of the packages I opened contained a new hat. It was not exactly the same as the old one but one feels that it would have been a kind of living blasphemy — like the revived corpse of the son in ""The Monkey's Paw"" — if the hat or at least a simulacrum of it had been arrived from the unknown country. But thanks to my wife's solicitousness it belonged to more or less the same era: identical white panel ditto the words and the gold stitching; the only real difference in fact is that the bill is also white instead of navy. Instead of a hat one can imagine Kid Rock wearing on the set of a music video in 1998 it looks like something a wealthy graduate of the University of Michigan School of Dentistry would wear on a golf outing with the marketing representative of a fluoride supplier.

This is the promise of Something New in which the Christmas season is bound up. If it seems absurd that I have written slightly more than a thousand words about it on the website of a respectable current affairs magazine I can only say that it would be a much drearier world if we did not mourn the losses of small things and herald the coming of new ones.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMDMvbGFrZXJzLW1hcmMtZ2Fzb2wtbWFrZXMtbWVtcGhpcy1yZXR1cm4tYnV0LW1pc3Nlcy10aGUtZmFucy1oZS1ncmV3LXVwLXdpdGgv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub2NyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8wMy9sYWtlcnMtbWFyYy1nYXNvbC1tYWtlcy1tZW1waGlzLXJldHVybi1idXQtbWlzc2VzLXRoZS1mYW5zLWhlLWdyZXctdXAtd2l0aC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lakers’ Marc Gasol makes Memphis return but misses the fans he grew up with,"Memphis Grizzlies center Gorgui Dieng (14) battles for the ball with Los Angeles Lakers forward Anthony Davis (3) as center Marc Gasol (14) defends during the second half of an NBA basketball game Sunday Jan. 3 2021 in Memphis Tenn.

For the first time in two years Marc Gasol was forced to leave the court at FedEx Forum.

Blood dribbled at the corner of his left eye as he shot two free throws in the second quarter after he got the gash from tumbling to the hardwood on a tussle for a loose ball. Officials sent him off to the Lakers’ medical staff to get mended and floor attendants cleaned a few stray drops off the floor.

To Gasol what’s a little more blood left in Memphis? He’s already left a house an army of friends and two decades worth of memories in a town that he’s lived in on and off since he was in high school.

“It’s a special place to me that’s been my home like I’ve been here so long” he said. “It’s a huge part of who I am and what I stand for as a man and the values I try to teach my kids.”

Given how closely Gasol’s career is tied to Memphis it’s almost difficult to believe that Sunday marked his first game there since Jan. 28 2019 — the last home contest of 769 total games he played for the Grizzlies. He had seven points six rebounds four assists — and four stitches in his return to the arena he once made famous as “The Grindhouse.”

The 35-year-old nitpicked his comeback performance by circling the 0 for 3 mark from deep: “I just wish I hit one of those threes. That would have made it much much better.”

What really would have made the evening better was what Memphis can’t safely accommodate at the moment: a packed arena. Gasol and team officials alike were disappointed that his return already delayed when the hiatus cancelled Toronto’s road game in Memphis last season was necessarily sparsely attended due to the pandemic. Less than 100 invited guests and family were permitted to attend on Sunday. Like most NBA markets Memphis has not permitted any general admission fans in the stands.

Memphis played a tribute video for Gasol during a first quarter timeout. His favorite part of the tribute he said was remembering interactions with the fans which included big games he played but also off-court interactions especially visits to nationally renowned children’s hospitals St. Jude and Le Bonheur.

“Those kids go through very tough times for a long time and they follow the team” he said. “They feel they’re a part of it. You go visit them and interact with them and you understand how much you mean to them. As a basketball player it’s such a huge honor that you’re giving them that special I don’t know treatment in a way — that you can bring happiness to kids that are in a very tough tough situation and families.”

Gasol is the franchise’s top rebounder shot-blocker and has the most minutes played in a Grizzlies uniform. He’s the second-leading scorer behind his former teammate Mike Conley.

But the lasting legacy of Gasol’s 11 seasons with Memphis where he landed after the Lakers traded away his draft rights for his brother Pau is the culture he created. He and then-head coach Lionel Hollins (now a Lakers assistant) were key in the “Grit-N-Grind” era that saw Memphis scrap annually in the Western Conference playoffs.

LeBron James was among those who hoped Gasol got a second homecoming reception next season when the Lakers return. As a former competitor he appreciates how hard it was to beat Memphis on their home court.

“It was hell coming here playing them” he said. “Playing Marc and Z-Bo (Zach Randolph) and (Tony Allen) and the rest of that group man throughout those years you knew it was going to be a grind.”

Gasol has been back to Memphis since he was traded and this four-day trip afforded him the opportunity to visit his home there — he quipped that he had to change all the batteries in his smoke detectors. But the pandemic kept him from seeing friends as it’s kept many from being with those they love and miss.

The Lakers will wrap up their road games in Memphis this season on Tuesday which probably means the next time Gasol will wind up in Memphis is next season. But he tried to take the silver lining that playing to an empty crowd made it a little easier to play.”

“A full arena would have made it a little more special and a little harder too at the same time” he said. “It would have been a little more emotional.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHltZW1waGlhbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNzI1NS93b3JsZHdpZGUtcmluZ21hc3Rlci1mbHktYS10aG9uLXBhbmRlbWljLW1vZGVsLWFpcnBsYW5lLWJ1aWxkZXJzLXBpbG90c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Up up and away:Through pandemic model airplane builders/pilots doubled down,"They are grown men. More than grown men really because many of them can share pictures of their grandchildren.

But they have the heartbeats of wide-eyed boys the boys they were when they built and flew their first model airplanes in the 1950s and 1960s.

They speak of these planes especially their dear “Ringmaster” which is being honored with a 13th annual Worldwide Fly-A-Thon this weekend with undying affection. And on Saturday more than a dozen of these builders/pilots will gather at Audubon Park.

Ready to ride and roll: Pandemic pastimes get more Memphians outdoors

Lester Goldsmith 68 whose father first took him to Audubon Park in the 1950s to see these magnificent if miniature flying machines can’t help missing those long-ago days.

“No such thing as computers” he said “and we hadn’t landed on the moon. A model airplane with a running engine was a fascination.”

Said 75-year-old Allen Worley: “When I got into it in the 50s I was 12 years old and my dad bought me a little airplane at the hardware store. From then on I never lost the desire to build and fly them.”

And so boys will still be boys. Lester Goldsmith and Allen Worley kept at it. They weren’t alone.

Jim Lynch 77 and retired for 12 years now would finish his career in sales as an executive vice president. But he has been a member of AMA (Academy of Model Aeronautics) since 1954 when he just a kid.

Al Robinson 68 is a retired FedEx pilot. Grew up in an aviation family – both parents were pilots – and served as an aircraft mechanic in the Marines before flying for FedEx.

“I loved flying” Robinson said. “That was my happy place.”

But he always loved building and flying the models too.

And the Ringmaster has taken all of them back to that simpler time.

“It’s an old design we all flew when we were kids” Robinson said.

So they started pointing toward the 2020 Ringmaster Fly-A-Thon. And then the COVID-19 pandemic shut society down.

Their hobby however proved to be pandemic-proof.

“The pandemic hit” Robinson said “and everybody went on a building frenzy.”

Where it all began

That Audubon Park will be the local site for the Ringmaster Fly-A-Thon is not happenstance.

In the 1950s and 1960s that was Memphis’ model airplane Mecca. At age 14 in 1966 Goldsmith met Worley who was then about 20 and in young Lester’s eyes everything he wanted to be.

“He could really do it” Goldsmith said. “His models were more exotic than mine. And he could really fly them.”

Worley agreed to take Goldsmith to a contest.

“Didn’t have seatbelts in those days and so he was sitting in the backseat in the middle” Worley recalled. “For 100 miles both ways he did nothing but ask questions about airplanes. I’ve never seen anybody talk so much.”

They didn’t know it then but Audubon Park was in its last years as their airfield. By the 1970s Goldsmith says the park was overrun with “hippies.”

The Ringmaster he remembers was “easy to build easy to fly. Low-priced always fun.”

And fun is the goal Saturday when they the return to Audubon Park. Last year according to ringmasterflyathon.com the annual event featured 6121 flights by 581 pilots in 14 nations.

“Each year it’s grown. The first year it was like a couple hundred flights” Goldsmith said adding that this is the first time any of them have participated. “Of course it’s all on the honor system. Nobody knows what anybody else is doing.

“The Ringmaster Fly-A-Thon’s not a competition. It’s just a worldwide celebration of the model and the time.”

In their own time

What better time for a unified celebration than 2020 amid a pandemic?

Saturday’s event at Audubon Park likely will get going in the late morning and likely wind down by mid-to-late-afternoon. It’s rather informal which is a bit ironic given the meticulous nature of the hobby.

The Ringmaster model has a wingspan of 42 inches Goldsmith says is fueled by methanol in a .35 cubic engine and the plane weighs all of 35 ounces. A pilot cranks the engine to get the plane airborne and that’s when the real fun starts for spectators.

These are not radio-controlled planes but “line-controlled” he says adding “The plane is very acrobatic but tied to two lines like a two-line kite.”

Sometimes pilots will engage in their version of combat: Each pilot attaches a 10-foot crepe paper streamer on the tail of his plane and tries to fly in such a way as to cut the other pilot’s streamer.

“The crowd loves it” Goldsmith said “because sooner or later – if you do it enough times – you’re going to hit the other plane.”

Lynch has won two national championships for “control line stunt” as a pilot and also earned multiple national awards for his construction and design of model airplanes.

He can detail the specific pattern he flew in winning those national stunt championships. Suffice to say it’s a lot of different loops and figure 8 maneuvers the plane turning this way and that – upside down a lot – the flight finishing with the air-drawing of a four-leaf clover.

“It’s really quite beautiful as a spectator” Lynch said “watching maneuvers being painted in the sky. It takes years of practice to do it.”

But just getting the plane in the sky is half the fun. Goldsmith says someone who is “reasonably skilled” can put the Ringmaster model together in about 40 hours.

While the pandemic kept them grounded for several weeks it couldn’t stop them from constructing planes.

“Order it put it together piece by piece paint it and you can do all that without going out anywhere” Worley said.

“I have two shops in the backyard” said Lynch. “My daily routine is building and designing model airplanes. My routine really hasn’t changed.”

For Robinson the retired FedEx pilot it was a good time to go deeper into the hobby. He says he has been diagnosed with the early stages of Alzheimer’s and so any recreational flying was out.

“I do a lot of scratch building not from kits” he said. “There’s no pressure when you’re retired you don’t have to get it done. You can do it tomorrow.”

Patience and the payoff

They know how much the times have changed. But they also know what aviation – their version of it – has meant to them over these now many decades.

Robinson’s father introduced him to model planes and that was that: He was hooked. Even when his dad died in an airplane accident in South America it didn’t stop him from making aviation a career.

“It is unfortunate more young people aren’t involved” he said. “But it’s easier for Mom and Dad to buy Johnny an Xbox.

“It’s a different set of skills obviously” Robinson said of piloting a control line model airplane “but in some ways it’s more difficult than flying full-size.”

Just as a football coach might speak of the sport teaching life lessons Lynch says the same for “aero modeling” ticking off all that can be learned: “Endurance patience commitment focus.”

Worley will have three generations flying: a son a 19-year-old granddaughter and possibly one or two younger grandsons.

There is joy in that of course but there is still joy at age 75 when he builds another plane makes it air-worthy and then turns it loose in the sky.

It’s accomplishment meshing with freedom – no computer technology necessary no one else’s help required.

TAMPA Fla — It's official! The Tampa Bay Buccaneers will take on the Washington Football Team at 8:15 p.m. Saturday in the NFL's Wild Card round.

The Bucs will play on the road on Jan. 9 making their way to FedEx Field. Saturday's showing will mark the team's first playoff appearance in 13 years.

In 2007 the Buccaneers fell to the New York Giants 24-14 in their wild-card game. Ever since the team has been chasing its next playoff berth-- until now.

Tampa Bay has been playing well leading up to this weekend's game. First bulldozing the Detroit Lions 47-7 in a record-setting game followed by a regular season-ending win over the Atlanta Falcons.

Defeating Atlanta put the Bucs 11-5 for the first time since 2005 in addition to being only the fourth time in the team's 45 seasons that they have won 11+ games.

As for the No. 5 seeds continued playoff future? It all rides on their performance. Who knows...maybe the Bucs can pull off playing in a hometown Super Bowl. Only time will tell.

A lot can change in a decade. For example ten years ago it cost between $140 to $150 per megawatt-hour (MWh) for solar energy and that's with the benefit of investment tax credits. However by 2020 that cost was down to $25 to $35 per MWh making solar cheaper than fossil fuels. That downward trend in solar energy costs should continue over the next decade as it's on track to be the lowest cost form of bulk energy even after adding battery storage.

Solar energy capacity additions are also on track to accelerate over the coming years. The industry expects to install an average of 10 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity per year through 2022 which should rise to an average of 18 to 20 GW annually in the 2023 to 2030 timeframe.

This appears as if it will be a golden decade for solar energy. Three stocks poised to benefit from this mega-trend are Brookfield Renewable (BEP 4.54%) (BEPC 4.96%) First Solar (FSLR 6.12%) and NextEra Energy (NEE 1.87%). They're great stocks to buy and hold until at least 2030.

A solar-powered growth plan

Brookfield Renewable is currently one of the global leaders in hydroelectric power. However it sees the brightest future in solar thanks to the dramatic decline in costs which has significantly improved the economics of developing new solar energy projects. Brookfield wrote in a recent shareholder letter: ""We believe it is possible that in ten years from now the majority of the production capacity of Brookfield Renewable will be solar capacity. It is not that we do not believe in wind or hydro but the growth in solar and the ability for us to develop and earn strong risk-adjusted returns should enable us to grow our solar operations at a far greater pace.""

The company spent much of the past couple of years bulking up its solar energy platform. It bought the rest of TerraForm Power it didn't own acquired a 50% stake in solar energy project developer X-Elio purchased several solar energy development projects in Brazil and most recently agreed to acquire Exelon's solar energy business. As a result Brookfield now a pipeline of more than 10 GW of solar energy projects in development. To put that into perspective Brookfield's current operating renewable energy portfolio is 19.4 GW. Those solar energy development projects are a key source of power driving the company's forecast that it can grow its cash flow at a double-digit annual pace through at least 2025.

A bright future lies ahead

First Solar is a leading developer of thin-film solar panels which are ideal for utility-scale projects. The company currently has a backlog of contracts totaling 12.2 GW of system sales and 8.3 GW of additional mid-to-late stage opportunities in the pipeline. For perspective the company's current manufacturing capacity is 5.5 GW meaning it has years of future sales lined up.

Meanwhile First Solar has one of the best balance sheets in the sector boasting a $1.4 billion net cash position at the end of the third quarter. It has unparalleled financial flexibility to continue expanding its manufacturing capacity to meet accelerating demand while investing in developing even better panels. That should enable it to stay one step ahead of its rivals and capture a significant share of the solar panel market in the coming decade.

This renewable energy behemoth is only going to get bigger

NextEra Energy is already the global leader in producing power from the wind and sun. However it currently has 15 GW of renewable projects in its backlog which is larger than its existing portfolio. A significant portion of those new additions are solar energy projects due to the falling costs of panels and energy storage.

That extensive backlog leads NextEra Energy to believe it can grow its earnings per year at a 6% to 8% annual pace through at least 2023. Meanwhile given its expertise and financial strength it should be able to continue capturing opportunities to grow at an above-average rate over the next decade. That could give it the power to continue outperforming the market. That has been the case over the past decade as NextEra has generated a more than 500% total return more than double that of the S&P 500.

Well-positioned for the solar energy mega-trend

Solar energy is starting to shine. It's on track to become the lowest cost form of near-firm bulk power thanks to the dramatic decline in costs for panels and battery storage. Companies focused on the industry appear poised to grow at a brisk pace over the coming decade led by Brookfield Renewable First Solar and NextEra Energy. That makes them great stocks to buy and hold through at least 2030.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEvMi8yMjIxMDY2Ny9zb2xhcndpbmRzLWhhY2std29yc2UtZ292ZXJubWVudC1taWNyb3NvZnQtY3liZXJzZWN1cml0edIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SolarWinds hack may be much worse than originally feared,"The Russia-linked SolarWinds hack which targeted US government agencies and private corporations may be even worse than officials first realized with some 250 federal agencies and business now believed affected the New York Times reported.

Microsoft has said the hackers compromised SolarWinds’ Orion monitoring and management software allowing them to “impersonate any of the organization’s existing users and accounts including highly privileged accounts.” The Times reports that Russia exploited layers of the supply chain to access the agencies’ systems.

The Times reports that early warning sensors that Cyber Command and the NSA placed inside foreign networks to detect potential attacks appear to have failed in this instance. In addition it seems likely that the US government’s attention on protecting the November elections from foreign hackers may have taken resources and focus away from the software supply chain according to the Times. And conducting the attack from within the US apparently allowed the hackers to evade detection by the Department of Homeland Security.

Microsoft said earlier this week it had discovered its systems were infiltrated “beyond just the presence of malicious SolarWinds code.” The hackers were able to “view source code in a number of source code repositories” but the hacked account granting the access didn’t have permission to modify any code or systems. However in a small bit of good news Microsoft said it found “no evidence of access to production services or customer data” and “no indications that our systems were used to attack others.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWxpZW4tb2JqZWN0LWNsb3NlLXRvLWVhcnRoLWluLTIwMTctc2F5cy1oYXJ2YXJkLXByb2Zlc3Nvci0yMDIxLTHSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2FsaWVuLW9iamVjdC1jbG9zZS10by1lYXJ0aC1pbi0yMDE3LXNheXMtaGFydmFyZC1wcm9mZXNzb3ItMjAyMS0xP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harvard professor Avi Loeb: Alien debris passed near Earth in 2017,"Scientists in 2017 detected the first sign of intelligent life outside Earth according to a new book by Avi Loeb a Harvard University professor.

An extraterrestrial object skimmed through space close to Earth in 2017 wrote a Harvard University astronomer Avi Loeb in a book to be published this month.

It was the first sign of intelligent life outside Earth according to Loeb.

Scientists at a Hawaiian observatory saw ""an object soaring through our inner solar system moving so quickly that it could only have been from another star"" according to the marketing summary for the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt book ""Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth.""

More likely it will be an alien civilization’s trash.

Avi Loeb chair of Harvard’s Department of Astronomy believes he’s already found some of that garbage.

In his upcoming book “Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth” (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt) out Jan. 26 the professor lays out a compelling case for why an object that recently wandered into our solar system was not just another rock but actually a piece of alien technology.

The object in question traveled toward our solar system from the direction of Vega a nearby star 25 light-years away and intercepted our solar system’s orbital plane on Sept. 6 2017.

On Sept. 9 its trajectory brought it closest to the sun. At the end of September it blasted at about 58900 miles per hour past Venus’ orbital distance and then on Oct. 7 it shot past Earth’s before “moving swiftly toward the constellation Pegasus and the blackness beyond” Loeb writes in the book.

The object was first spotted by an observatory in Hawaii containing the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) — the highest-definition telescope on Earth.

The space object was dubbed ‘Oumuamua (pronounced “oh moo ah moo ah”) which is Hawaiian for — roughly — “scout.”

As space travelers go it was relatively small at just about 100 yards long but it was a big deal in the scientific community.

For starters it was the first interstellar object ever detected inside our solar system. Judging from the object’s trajectory astronomers concluded it was not bound by the sun’s gravity — which suggested it was just traveling through.

No crisp photos could be taken but astronomers were able to train their telescopes on the object for 11 days collecting reams of other data.

At first scientists thought it was an ordinary comet. But Loeb said that assumption ran the risk of allowing “the familiar to define what we might discover.”

“What would happen if a caveman saw a cellphone?” he asked. “He’s seen rocks all his life and he would have thought it was just a shiny rock.”

Loeb soon opened his mind to another possibility: It was not a comet but discarded tech from an alien civilization.

A number of unusual properties about the object helped Loeb make this conclusion.

First were ‘Oumuamua’s dimensions.

Astronomers looked at the way the object reflected sunlight. Its brightness varied tenfold every eight hours suggesting that was the amount of time it took for it to complete a full rotation.

Scientists concluded the object was at least five to 10 times longer than it was wide — sort of like the shape of a cigar.

No naturally occurring space body we’ve ever seen has looked like it — or even close.

“This would make ‘Oumuamua’s geometry more extreme by at least a few times in aspect ratio — or its width to its height — than the most extreme asteroids or comets that we have ever seen” Loeb writes in his book.

What’s more ‘Oumuamua was unusually bright. It was at least “ten times more reflective than typical solar system [stony] asteroids or comets” the author writes.

He likens its surface to that of shiny metal.

But the anomaly that really pushed Loeb toward his ET hypothesis was the way ‘Oumuamua moved.

“The excess push away from the sun — that was the thing that broke the camel’s back” he said.

Using physics scientists can calculate the exact path an object should take and what speed it should travel due to the gravitational force exerted by the sun. The sun’s pull will speed up an object massively as it gets closer then kick it out the other side only for the object to slow considerably as it gets farther away.

But ‘Oumuamua didn’t follow this calculated trajectory. The object in fact accelerated “slightly but to a highly statistically significant extent” Loeb writes as it moved away from the sun.

In other words it was clearly being pushed by a force besides the sun’s gravity.

At first the explanation seemed simple. Comets show a similar acceleration because as they approach the sun their surface is warmed releasing once-frozen gases which act like a rocket engine.

Those released materials however form a comet’s distinctive tail. Scientists looked carefully for that tail or any sign of gases or dust that might propel ‘Oumuamua and came up empty.

Loeb calculated that with these and other anomalies the chances that ‘Oumuamua was some random comet was around 1 in a quadrillion leading him to his blockbuster hypothesis.

But what was it exactly?

One possibility weirdly enough could be found in technology we already have here on Earth.

Some 400 years ago astronomer Johannes Kepler observed comet tails blowing in what looked like a solar breeze and wondered if that same force could propel rocket ships through space like the wind pushes boats through water.

It was a smart idea that scientists now use to develop light sails for probes. Thin reflective sheeting is unfurled in space to capture the particles streaming off the sun propelling a ship at great speeds through the empty void. Alternatively powerful lasers from Earth could be aimed at the sail to make it go even faster.

Loeb who is involved in a light-sail project to send a tiny unmanned craft to a nearby star said if we Earthlings have thought of this idea then why couldn’t aliens?

He and a colleague crunched the numbers and hypothesized that ‘Oumuamua was not actually cigar-shaped but possibly a disk less than a millimeter thick with sail-like proportions that would account for its unusual acceleration as it moved away from the sun.

As to its purpose Loeb isn’t entirely sure. He speculated it could be “space junk” that once served as a kind of space navigation buoy used by a long-ago civilization.

“The only way to look for [alien civilizations] is to look for their trash like investigative journalists who look through celebrities’ trash” Loeb said.

Of course not everyone in the scientific community agrees with his theory.

In July 2019 the ‘Oumuamua Team of the International Space Science Institute published an article in Nature Astronomy concluding “We find no compelling evidence to favor an alien explanation for ‘Oumuamua.”

Loeb admits his theories have raised astronomers’ eyebrows but he is resolute about his findings. “Some people do not want to discuss the possibility that there are other civilizations out there” he told The Post. “They believe we are special and unique. I think it’s a prejudice that should be abandoned.”

‘Some people do not want to discuss the possibility that there are other civilizations out there.’ Avi Loeb Harvard astronomer and author of “Extraterrestrial”

Loeb said the skeptics are bending over backwards to assign natural origins to the object and that the explanations they’ve given to explain its weird properties don’t stand up to scrutiny.

For example some scientists have suggested that ‘Oumuamua’s acceleration was caused by frozen hydrogen on its surface turning to gas and driving it like a comet and that hydrogen would have been invisible to Earth’s infrared cameras which is why we didn’t detect it.

But Loeb and a colleague published a paper showing that “a hydrogen iceberg traveling through interstellar space would evaporate long before it reached our solar system.”

Whatever the truth the stakes are high.

The acceptance that an alien race has made contact — even through its trash — would trigger a serious search for more trash leading us to scour the moon and Mars for example for debris that might have crash-landed thousands or millions of years ago.

And if more evidence is found we Earthlings would have to start building tools to help us grapple with extraterrestrials such as space treaties and academic fields like astro-linguistics and astro-economics.

But perhaps more important any further discoveries could redefine our place in the universe.

“It would put us in perspective” Loeb said. “If we are not alone are we the smartest kids on the block? If there was a species that eliminated itself through war or changing the climate we can get our act together and behave better. Instead we are wasting a lot of resources on Earth fighting each other and other negative things that are a big waste.”

Since ‘Oumuamua’s appearance a second interstellar object known as 2I/Borisov was spotted entering the solar system by a Crimean telescope in 2019. But that turned out to be a plain old comet.

Until recently our instruments have not been sensitive enough to pick up these kinds of visitors. But Loeb said technology will soon make it possible to locate more space travelers and the only way the mystery of ‘Oumuamua will be settled is if a similar object is spotted and more thoroughly investigated with a probe.

He said his book “should motivate people to collect more data on the next object that looks weird.”

“If we find another and we take a photo and it looks like a light sail I don’t think anyone will argue with that.”"

Their previous meeting Nov. 14 2019 at FirstEnergy Stadium turned into the one of the most infamous incidents in recent NFL history when Garrett a two-time Pro Bowler received a six-game suspension to end his season for hitting Rudolph on the head with his helmet in the final seconds of the game. Garrett alleged Rudolph using the N-word spurred his actions a charge the quarterback denied.

He and Rudolph talked briefly after the Browns' 24-22 win over the Steelers on Sunday.

“I just told him good game – he played a hell of a game – and we will see you all in a week. He played tough. He had 300 yards and a couple of touchdowns"" Garrett who served as the team's captain said. ""He played very well and he kept them in it to the very end. Had to show a little praise that he did well in this game and he was able to make some big plays for them.”

Rudolph sounded ready to move on.

“Myles came over and said ‘Good game’ postgame” Rudolph said. “And that’s all it was. I told him good luck. I have a lot of respect for him.”

It was a of little matter as Garrett still suffering the lingering effects of his bout with COVID-19 apparently didn’t receive his usual number of snaps and though he appeared to come close a couple of times to getting to the quarterback he was unable to register a sack.

Showing confidence

In the absence of offensive line coach Bill Callahan who missed Sunday’s game against the Steelers due to COVID-19 center JC Tretter served as a player coach according to an ESPN report. That wasn’t entirely true however according to a Browns spokesman. Ryan Cordell a coaching assistant served as acting offensive line coach but Tretter is “essentially a coach on the field” and his teammates relied on that expertise and experience.

Tough hit

In the closing minute of the first half wide receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones took a shot to the back while leaping to catch a pass over the middle. Steelers safety Sean Davis delivered the hit which led to Peoples-Jones leaving the field for the locker room. He was ruled out with a concussion but he showed a sense of humor afterward tweeting:

“They asked if I knew where I was at... I said the PLAYOFFFSSSS…”

Tough hit II

Browns defensive end Olivier Vernon went down with 10:18 left in the fourth quarter grabbing his left leg. He did not put weight on the leg while team medical staff helped him to the sideline. He was eventually carted off to the locker room with an injured ankle and did not return. He will undergo an MRI Monday. Vernon had made an impact all afternoon applying pressure and recording a sack and two tackles-for-loss.

Out of sync

The Browns practiced just twice this week because of various COVID-19 issues. It showed especially on the team’s first possession of the second half. Facing fourth down and less than a yard from their own 44. Left guard Joel Bitonio flinched and drew the false start penalty forcing the Browns to punt. It set up a Steelers field goal which cut the Browns' lead to 10-9 with 8:29 left in the third quarter.

Missed call

The Browns caught a break on M.J. Stewart’s interception in the third quarter. Linebacker Jacob Phillips forced Rudolph into a bad throw. What the officials missed was safety Ronnie Harrison coming on a safety blitz making contact to the quarterback’s head. The interception eventually led to a 3-yard run by wide receiver Jarvis Landry to put the Browns ahead 24-9.

Entering the club

Though this was their first meeting since last year’s infamous ending Rudolph said he hardly interacted with Garrett Sunday. The only time they talked was at the end of the game.

Rudolph was asked if he spoke to Garrett at all Sunday.

“Myles came over and said good game” Rudolph said. “Post game. And that’s all it was. I told him good luck. Lot of respect for him.”

He nearly had a sack of Rudolph but Alejandro Villanueva grabbed Garrett’s arm resulting in a holding call that negated the chance. Rudolph ended Sunday throwing the ball 39 times for 315 yards two touchdowns and an interception.

The focus Sunday rightfully so was on football. This game meant plenty more to Rudolph and Garrett than rehashing their history. For Garrett it was a chance to get his team in the playoffs for the first time since 2002 snapping the longest drought in football. For Rudolph it was a chance for his first start of the season. Who knows how many more he’ll make in Pittsburgh.

Now the focus for both men – and both teams – will be about beating the other in the postseason. Rudolph won’t be slated to start of course but he’ll be one snap away as Ben Roethlisberger’s backup. Garrett and the Browns will aim for their first playoff win since 1994. To put that in perspective the last time Cleveland won a playoff game neither Garrett or Rudolph were born yet."

WEED CONTROL

Corn growers have a new choice for 2021 in AMVAC Chemical Corp.’s Impact Core herbicide which provides a quick takedown and long-term residual control of grasses and broadleaves in a range of field conditions.

Based on the proven effectiveness of Impact herbicide chemistry aimed at herbicide-resistant grasses and broadleaf weeds such as waterhemp Palmer amaranth and giant ragweed Impact Core contains an industry-leading level of acetochlor in a long-lasting stable formulation for extended periods of control. It is registered for in-crop use on field corn (grain silage and seed) and popcorn.

Impact Core contains topramezone (Group 27) foliar herbicide which controls susceptible weeds by inhibiting carotenoid biosynthesis causing a breakdown of chlorophyll and death of the targeted weed. Topramezone also provides limited but observable residual soil activity on weeds.

In addition the soil residual herbicide acetachlor (Group 15) is included to inhibit root and shoot growth in susceptible germinating seeds before or shortly after they emerge.

AMVAC also has registered Sinate as a new postemergence tool to fight herbicide-resistance in weeds in LibertyLink field corn and sweet corn such as waterhemp and giant ragweed with two modes of action from Impact Herbicide and glufosinate.

The use of topramezone (Group 27) is non-volatile with selective systemic foliar activity as well as limited residual soil activity while glufosinate…",,,,,,,,,,,,

Special to the Star-Banner

Jean Morillo one of the conservators of the 200-plus National Parts Depot collection housed in Ocala recently provided a close-up look at a 2006 Ford GT from the array of specialty cars.

The blue GT has about 1200 miles on the odometer and NPD Chief Operating Officer Rick Schmidt stated in an email the car was purchased through Village Ford of Dearborn Michigan.

The car is powered by a 5.4-liter aluminum four-valve V-8 which produces 550 hp.

About 4000 of the GTs were made in 2005 and 2006 Schmidt indicated.

Many people have been wondering if the pony car still has a place in the lineup but the Blue Oval doesn’t plan to discontinue the iconic nameplate anytime soon.Although the Dodge Challenger is outselling the ‘Stang and sports cars as a whole aren’t doing too hot the head of Mustang marketing Jim Owens says that Ford is “confident in the sports car market. It’s still a healthy 1.2 percent of the industry and we’re continuing to be the market share leader globally.”Excluding December the Mustang sold 51756 units in 2020 in the United States according to Ford Authority . That’s a bit worrying because the U.S. is the largest market for the most recognizable pony car of them all but then again the Blue Oval would lose a lot by discontinuing this fellow over low sales. Priced from $26670 to $72900 excluding freight the Mustang will be redesigned from the ground up next year as a 2023 model.Codenamed S650 the seventh generation will be manufactured in Flat Rock Michigan on the same assembly line as the S550. The rumor mill suggests a Mustang-specific platform with various elements from the CD6 the vehicle architecture shared by the Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator.Not that long ago Jim Owens stopped short of confirming all-wheel drive for the 2023 model even though we all know it’s inevitable. Hybridization is on the menu for the Mustang ever since Raj Nair was chief technical officer and believe it or not even Dodge plans to embrace hybrid muscle.The Challenger and Charger which will be treated to three new variants before their redesign will adopt an eight-speed automatic transmission with a built-in electric motor. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is one of the first automakers to have placed an order on the hybridized 8HP which promises a boost of 32 to 215 horsepower on top of the internal combustion engine.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9jYXJpbmRpYS5jb20vY2FyLW5ld3MvdGhlLWZpcnN0LWNhcnMtb2YtdGhlLXdvcmxkcy1tb3N0LWZhbW91cy1jYXJtYWtlcnMtNDE5NTM20gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXV0b2NhcmluZGlhLmNvbS9jYXItbmV3cy1hbXAvdGhlLWZpcnN0LWNhcnMtb2YtdGhlLXdvcmxkcy1tb3N0LWZhbW91cy1jYXJtYWtlcnMtNDE5NTM2?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The first cars of the world's most famous carmakers,"Some have humble beginnings and some have rather extravagant ones. The origins of more than 50 carmakers are charted here.

Karl Benz built the first car in 1885 and since then many thousands of companies have sprung up trying to make a name for themselves.

But few have survived and here we take a look at how some of those survivors. Sometimes things are a lot more convoluted than you think though with some companies claiming two (or even three) first cars…

Mercedes-Benz (1886)

This is where it all started – the first company to build a car. Karl Benz built his first car in 1885 and he patented it in January 1886 but the Mercedes name wouldn't be adopted until 1901. That first car (called the Patent Motorwagen pictured here) had just three wheels and a 0.75hp 954cc single-cylinder engine but in 1893 Benz built his first four-wheeler the Viktoria powered by a 3hp 1745cc engine.

Peugeot (1891)

Peugeot started out in 1842 making salt and pepper grinders before moving into bicycle production 40 years later. Then in 1891 Peugeot built its first car a four-wheeled machine with a rear-mounted V-twin engine driving the rear wheels via a chain. Just five cars were made in that first year but this grew to 29 in 1892. By 1900 Peugeot production was up to 500 cars in one year.

Ford (1896)

Henry Ford built his first experimental car in 1896. Known as the Ford Quadricycle the vehicle would remain a one-off. By 1899 Ford had set up the Detroit Automobile Company which in 1901 was renamed the Henry Ford Company. Within a year Ford had fallen out with his financial backers and he left to set up a new venture in 1903 – the Ford Motor Company.

Renault (1898)

Louis Marcel and Fernand Renault set up Société Renault Freres in 1899 having already built a prototype 1CV voiturette the previous year. Capable of 32kph the Type A got an annual facelift until it went out of production in 1903 by which point it was fitted with a 5hp engine in place of the original 1hp unit.

Fiat (1899)

Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino was founded in 1899 and its first factory opened in 1900; that year just 24 cars were made. The company's first model was the 4HP which was initially fitted with a 679cc flat-twin engine; later cars got an 837cc unit. Fiat started out with just 35 employees; by 1908 it had 2700 people on the payroll and was capable of producing 5000 cars each year.

Opel (1899)

Adam Opel set up a company in 1862 to make sewing machines before diversifying into bicycles in 1886. He died in 1895 but his widow and five sons continued the business introducing their first car in 1899. The engine was a 1545cc 3.5hp single-cylinder unit and buyers could choose from two- or four-seat editions but the car didn't sell well; just 11 found buyers in 1899 and 24 in 1900. Opel became part of General Motors in 1931 which then sold the company to PSA in 2017.

Buick (1899)

America's oldest surviving car maker Buick was founded in 1899 which is when it produced its first car – although it didn't make a second until the following year with the third coming in 1903. Initially named the Buick Auto-Vim and Power Company series production didn't start until 1904; a year later the company was renamed the Buick Motor Company. That first car was the Model B (pictured here) with a 2605cc flat-twin engine rated at 16hp. By the end of the year Buick had sold 37 cars but by 1908 annual production had mushroomed to 8800.

Oldsmobile (1901)

Ransom Eli Olds built a series of experimental and prototype cars in the late 19th century before launching his first production car in 1901: the snappily named Oldsmobile Curved-Dash Runabout which featured a 1565cc single-cylinder engine a two-speed gearbox and chain drive. Despite anything Ford might have to say on the subject it was Oldsmobile that was the first to offer a mass-produced car with 425 Runabouts rolling off the production lines in the first year – a figure that jumped to 2100 in 1902.

Cadillac (1902)

When Cadillac was incorporated in 1902 by Henry Leland to make affordable cars for the masses his initial offering was the Runabout retrospectively named the Model A which was facelifted in 1904 to become the Model B. Power (all 10hp of it) came from a 1609cc single-cylinder engine mounted under the rear seat.

Ford (1903)

The Ford Motor Company's first product was the Model A which went on sale in July 1903 and by the time production ended in October 1904 an impressive 670 examples had been made. Pictured is Henry Ford's great grandson Bill Ford Junior with the world's oldest surviving Model A built in 1903 – he bought the car for USD 264000 (nearly Rs 2 crore) in 2012. The Model A featured a 1645cc flat-twin engine mounted under the rear seat a two-speed transmission and chain drive.

Rolls-Royce (1904)

Engineer Henry Royce built his first car in 1904 just a month before he met the wealthy aristocrat Charles Rolls by chance. The latter had seen the Royce in action and said to its maker that he would take every car that Royce could make as long as it also had his name on it too. By December 1904 the first Rolls-Royce was ready although Rolls-Royce Ltd wouldn't be founded until 1906.

That first car was fitted with a two-cylinder 1809cc engine but by the end of 1906 Rolls-Royce had already built its first car with an eight-cylinder engine.

Rover (1904)

When Rover created its Safety Bicycle in 1885 it created the modern template for the pushbike. Next came motorcycles (in 1902) then in 1904 Rover built its first car the two-seater Rover Eight. In production right the way through until 1912 the Eight was fitted with a 1327cc single-cylinder engine that developed a decently gutsy 8hp at 900rpm but the engine was red-lined at a screaming 1500rpm. Your Range Rover Evoque ultimately started here.

Skoda (Laurin & Klement 1905)

Skoda grew out of a company called Laurin & Klement which started by making bicycles in 1895 moved into motorcycle manufacture in 1899 and then built its first car in 1905. That first car was the Voiturette A (seen here) which was powered by a 1005cc (later 1100cc) V-twin engine that developed 7hp. Just 55 were made before the Voiturette B took over in 1906 with a 9hp 1399cc engine.

Lancia (1907)

One of the most innovative carmakers ever it's a tragedy that Lancia is now just about defunct. Founded to build sporting and race cars Vincenzo Lancia set up his own company in November 1906. His first car was ready for trials in February 1907 but before it had left the workshop the factory burned down taking the car the drawings and Lancia's tools with it. Seven months later Lancia had a new car built from scratch; 100 examples of the Type 51 would be made each with a 2544cc four-cylinder engine.

Audi (1910)

August Horch's first car company (founded in 1904) bore his own name but when he fell out with fellow board members he set up a new company in 1910 called Audi. Its first model was the Type A fitted with a 2612cc four-cylinder engine. Just 140 examples were made before the Type B arrived in 1911.

Alfa Romeo (1910)

Launched in 1910 Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili realised that it really needed a snappier name; ALFA was the result. After Nicola Romeo took the company over in 1915 it was renamed Alfa Romeo in 1918 and its first car was the Torpedo 20-30. However ALFA's first car was the 4.1-litre 24HP seen here which remained in production until 1914.

Morgan (1910)

Harry (HFS) Morgan opened a garage in Malvern to sell and service cars. By 1909 he'd built his own car for his personal use; a year later he put his three-wheeler into production. The first cars were single-seaters but these were never going to be very popular in the marketplace so by 1911 Morgan's three-wheeler was available with either two seats or four. Power came from a 961cc JAP V-twin engine.

Chevrolet (1913)

Although Louis Chevrolet set up his company in 1911 his first car wasn't sold until 1913. Introduced at that year's New York Auto Show the Chevrolet Type C (or Classic Six) was pretty impressive with its six-cylinder engine and three-speed gearbox. But it was costly compared with rivals which is why Chevrolet quickly introduced a four-cylinder model to compete.

Dodge (1914)

John and Horace Dodge set up shop in 1901 to produce bicycle components before moving into car parts supply in 1903; very quickly virtually their entire output was for Ford. Seeing that Ford was producing more and more parts in-house they decided to go it alone with their own car which arrived in 1914. Offered only as a five-seat tourer Dodge's car featured a 35hp 3480cc four-cylinder engine and a three-speed gearbox. By 1916 Dodge was America's fourth best-selling brand of car with over 70000 made in that one year.

Aston Martin (1915)

The first Aston Martin named Coal Scuttle was built in 1915. Following Coal Scuttle and the Great War three more prototype cars were built including one called Bunny but none of these cars survive. By 1921 Aston Martin was ready to start selling cars and its first production model featured a 1496cc four-cylinder engine. Just 69 were made before the company went bust – and not for the last time. The car pictured is the oldest surviving Aston Martin chassis number 3 now owned by the Aston Martin Heritage Trust.

Mitsubishi (1917)

Founded as a shipping firm in 1870 Mitsubishi didn't build its first car until 1917. Just 22 of these leviathans were built each powered by a 2765cc four-cylinder engine. Capable of seating seven the Mitsubishi Model A was based on the Fiat Tipo 3 with a front-mounted 35hp engine that drove the rear wheels and could take the car to 96kph.

Bentley (1919)

Walter Owen (WO) Bentley and his brother Horace sold cars before WW1 but in 1919 they set up Bentley Motors to make and sell sporting carriages for the well heeled. The company's first car was ready for delivery in 1921; by 1930 Bentley had won the Le Mans 24 Hours five times. Bentley's first model was the 3-Litre 1622 of which were produced between 1921 and 1929 each with a 2996cc four-cylinder engine with four valves per cylinder.

Citroën (1919)

Throughout WW1 André Citroen's factory was churning out armaments and although he didn't make his first car until 1919 as early as 1916 he'd decided to go into vehicle manufacture. In March 1919 just four months after WW1 ended Citroen showed his Type A with a 1327cc four-cylinder engine that gave a top speed of 64kph. By the time production ended in 1921 more than 24000 Type As had been built.

Jaguar (Swallow Sidecars 1922)

Jaguar didn't start out as Jaguar – it began life in 1922 as Swallow Sidecars or SS to make bodies for an array of small cars such as Austin Singer and Wolseley. Trying to sell cars after the events of World War Two with the name ‘SS’ was never going to be successful which is why the name Jaguar was adopted. This was first used as a model name in 1935.

MG (1923)

William Morris (later Lord Nuffield) founded Morris Motors in 1913; a decade later Morris Garages (MG) was born. There's much debate as to what MG's first car was but it seems to be the Morris Garages Chummy a sporting two-seater based on the Morris Cowley. Those first cars featured Morris and MG badges and the first adverts for MG were placed in 1923 although the trademark wasn't registered until the following year.

Triumph (1923)

Based in Coventry Triumph entered the bicycle market in 1885; motorcycles followed in 1902 and then in 1923 the company built its first car. This was the result of a takeover of the Dawson Car Company with Triumph's first model being the 1.4-litre 10/20. Built until 1926 around 2500 of these two-seater steel-bodied tourers were made although there was also an aluminium-panelled sports model offered.

Chrysler (1924)

Walter Chrysler had turned around the ailing Maxwell-Chalmers car company which had been founded in 1904. That company closed down in 1923 so the next year Walter created a new company bearing his own name – and here he is with his very first car the 70. Fitted with a 3301cc side-valve straight-six the 70 was highly innovative with its aluminium pistons full-pressure lubrication and oil filter. No wonder 32000 were sold in the first year.

Skoda (1925)

Just like Laurin & Klement Skoda was also started in 1895 mainly to build armaments but it expanded rapidly to also offer locomotives bridges power stations ships and much more. In 1919 it started to build steam trucks and heavy road tractors but in 1925 Skoda merged with Laurin & Klement to start offering cars. The company's first model was the Type 110 an evolution of L&K's Types 100 and 105 powered by a 1791cc four-cylinder water-cooled engine.

Pontiac (1926)

In the 1920s General Motors had Chevrolet at the bottom end and Cadillac at the top. There was also Oldsmobile which was closer to Cadillac than Chevrolet; what was needed was a brand that offered affordable high-quality cars. Pontiac was launched in 1926 to fill that gap; its first model was a 3.1-litre car available in two-door sedan or coupé forms both priced at USD 825 (about Rs 60000). The car proved a big hit with almost 77000 sold in the first year.

BMW (1927)

BMW started out as a manufacturer of aircraft engines in 1916 in 1923 it launched its first motorcycle then in 1927 came the Dixi 3/15 BMW's first car. It was an Austin Seven built under licence with barely any changes; aside from the steering wheel moving from the right to the left the two were pretty much interchangeable.

Volvo (1927)

Founded by Assar Gabrielsson and Gustav Larson Volvo built its first car in 1927. Called the OV4 and offered only as an open tourer power came from a 1940cc four-cylinder engine with a peak power output of just 28hp at 2800rpm. At this stage only eight airbags were fitted as standard along with 31 warning lights on the dash and 14 buzzers but Volvo soon upped its game.

Nissan (1931)

Nissan started out as the Kaishinsha Motorcar Works in 1911 before changing its name to DAT Motorcar Co in 1925 then again to Nissan in 1934. However many of the company's products were sold as Datsuns (initially Datsons) until 1986 when Nissan was adopted as the global brand. Although cars were made in limited numbers from as early as 1914 the first Datsun didn't arrive until 1931.

The Type 10 was a clone of the Austin Seven and initially it featured a 495cc four-cylinder engine which was later enlarged to 747cc – the same displacement as the Austin unit.

Toyota (1936)

Toyota’s first car was the AA presented in 1936 and powered by a 3.4-litre six-cylinder engine; 1404 were made. The first home-built car for the Japanese market its public debut at an exhibition in Tokyo together with a cabriolet version (the AB) helped prompt the Japanese government to give the Toyoda Automatic Loom Works permission to build vehicles opening the way for the founding of Toyota and the immediate construction of its first auto factories.

Jeep (Willys 1941)

Hmm – where to start with this one? The first Jeeps were made by Willys and Ford in 1941 and later on by French companies Hotchkiss and Delahaye. Power came from a 2.2-litre four-cylinder engine which drove all four wheels via a three-speed manual gearbox. In time the Jeep would become a staple product for Willys-Overland which went on to launch the Station Wagon Truck and Jeepster.

Jaguar (1945)

Rising from the ashes of SS Cars was Jaguar which was incorporated in March 1945. With six years of hostilities just having taken place Jaguar hadn't been able to develop a new car so it just put the SS 2.5-litre sedan back into production. Alongside a 3.5-litre sedan this 2664cc car would have to sustain Jaguar until the arrival of the MkV in 1948.

Volkswagen (1945)

Although the first examples of Hitler's KDF wagen were built in 1936 the first production cars weren't made until 1945. When the British Army liberated VW's Wolfsburg factory the car the Type 1 was offered to various British companies all of which turned it down saying it could never be commercially successful. Unofficially called the Volkswagen Beetle the air-cooled sedan went on to become the most successful car in history with more than 21 million built by the time production ended in 2003.

Ferrari (1947)

When Enzo Ferrari severed his ties with his previous employer Alfa Romeo (he was the company's competition manager) he was forbidden from building any cars bearing his own name for seven years. So his first cars were built under the Auto Avio banner in 1940; after just two were built the company's focus turned to making machine tools and ball bearings for the war effort. The first Ferrari appeared in 1947: the Tipo 125 featured a 1498cc V12 rated at 118bhp. A year later Ferrari would take part in its first Grand Prix using this engine in supercharged form.

Maserati (1947)

There were six Maserati brothers and five of them (Carlo Bindo Alfieri Ettore and Ernesto) devoted their lives to cars and motorsport. They launched their own car-making company in 1926 but the focus was exclusively on racing cars; it wouldn't be until 1947 that the Tipo A6 arrived powered by a 1488cc straight-six. Later would come a 2.0-litre version and an array of special-bodied cars.

Jaguar (MkV 1948)

So here it is – Jaguar's third first car. The company's original first car was when Jaguar was called Swallow Sidecars the second was just an SS car that was sold as a Jaguar and this was the first car from Jaguar that didn't start out as an SS. The MkV came in saloon or drophead forms and was fitted with the same choice of 2664cc or 3485cc straight-six engines as before. Production lasted until 1951 when the MkVII took over; there was no MkVI probably because Bentley was selling its own MkVI at the time.

Land Rover (1948)

Now owned by Tata Land Rover was originally an offshoot of the Rover Car Company which wanted to increase its exports and it also spotted a gap in the market for a vehicle capable of tackling harsh terrain. The result was the Series 1 of 1948 powered by a 1.6-litre petrol engine. Production started in July 1948 and within three months Land Rover had dealers in an astonishing 68 countries around the world.

Porsche (1948)

Ferdinand Porsche founded a design and engineering consultancy in 1931 but he wouldn't build his own car until 1948 having already created the VW Beetle before WW2. Porsche's first car was the 356 and here is Ferdinand Porsche with his son (confusingly also Ferdinand Porsche) with that first car which was effectively a rebodied Beetle complete with 1131cc engine.

Jeep (1953)

Willys continued production of the Jeep until 1953 when it was swallowed up by Kaiser Motors renamed Kaiser-Jeep in 1963. At first there was an updated version of the wartime Jeep available but the big news was the Wagoneer station wagon which came with a 3770cc six-cylinder engine and could be ordered with rear- or four-wheel drive.

Suzuki (1955)

Suzuki started out as a motorbike manufacturer but in 1955 it moved into making cars and small trucks with the Suzulight brand – the first ever kei car. First came the SF (Suzuki Four-wheel car) in two-door sedan van and pick-up forms each with a 360cc two-cylinder two-stroke engine driving the front wheels. But with just a handful of sedans built these first forays into four-wheeler production were effectively just commercial vehicles.

Subaru (1958)

A world away from the turbocharged four-wheel drive rally monsters of the 1990s this was Subaru's first passenger car which arrived in 1958. It featured a rear-mounted 356cc two-cylinder engine a three-speed gearbox and came in two-door sedan estate or convertible forms. Incredibly the 360 proved popular in the US – until the press ran stories of how badly the Subaru fared in a head-on crash with a contemporary US car.

Mazda (1960)

Mazda started out as Toyo Kogyo in 1920 making machine tools. Four decades later the company built its first car the R360 pitched squarely against rivals from Subaru and Suzuki. With room for four (allegedly) the R360 initially came in two-door coupé form only although a convertible was added later. The 356cc V-twin engine was rated at a throbbing 16hp; enough to whisk its occupants all the way up to a heady 84kph.

Honda (1963)

Soichiro Honda didn't build his first four-wheeled vehicle until 1963: the T360 pick-up. But he'd started out as a mechanic in 1937 before moving into parts supply motorised bicycles engines and motorcycles; by 1959 Honda was the world's largest motorcycle manufacturer. Within two months of the T360 going on sale Honda launched its first car; the S500 roadster with a 531cc four-cylinder engine. Honda built 1363 of them in a year before the S600 took over.

Lamborghini (1963)

Lamborghini got off to something of a false start as its first attempt at producing a road-going production car was so badly received that it had to go back to the drawing board and come up with something different. That first prototype was the 350 GTV unveiled in 1963 and fitted with a front-mounted 3.5-litre V12 rated at 365hp.

Lamborghini (1964)

After the 350 GTV had been so poorly received Lamborghini tried again to come up with a two-seater grand tourer with a V12 in the nose. The result was the 350 GT launched in 1964 and fitted with the same V12 that featured in the Miura. However while the 350 GT's V12 displaced 3.5 litres the Miura's was a 4.0-litre powerplant. Production of the 350 GT ran until 1966 with 120 examples produced.

Kia (1974)

When you consider what Kia has achieved it's incredible to think that it's one of the newest mainstream carmakers here. Kia was founded in 1944 as Kyungsung Precision Industry and started to make Honda motorcycles under licence in 1957 and Mazda trucks under licence from 1962. However it wouldn't be until 1974 that Kia would make its first car. Even this was a Mazda produced under licence. Called the Brisa a 1.0-litre engine was fitted and production ran through until 1981.

Hyundai (1975)

Hyundai was founded as a construction company in 1947 and 20 years later it started to build various Ford cars and trucks under licence. Having hired Brit George Turnbull (formerly of British Leyland) Hyundai introduced its first car in 1975. The Pony was a rear-wheel drive sedan that looked like a hatchback and was fitted with Mitsubishi-sourced engines and running gear. Styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro the Hyundai Pony was simple rugged and affordable which was just what the market demanded at the time.

Acura (1986)

Honda launched its upmarket Acura brand in 1986 as a response to import limits set by the US government. Allowed to import only so many cars Honda focused on its more costly models and stuck an Acura badge on them to appear more exclusive. Few were fooled though; the first models were the Integra and Legend sold through 60 dealerships across the US.

Infiniti (1989)

Introduced in a bid to take Nissan upmarket in the US the Infiniti brand could offer just one model when it was launched. The Q45 was a luxury saloon with a 288hp 4498cc V8 borrowed from the Nissan President. Launched in 1989 within a year the Q45 could be ordered with four-wheel steering and hydraulically controlled active suspension.

Lexus (1989)

When Toyota decided to move upmarket in the US in 1989 it created a new brand that would go on to revolutionise the luxury segment. Uncannily refined incredibly well equipped and supremely reliable the Lexus LS400 wasn't much fun to drive but for those who wanted a luxurious large sedan it was a world apart from the usual offerings from the likes of Cadillac Mercedes and Jaguar.

McLaren (1992)

The first McLarens were M6 racing cars built by a company called Trojan in the late 1960s. A couple of these were converted into road cars but the McLaren we know wasn't born until 1985 when Ron Dennis set up a new company to build road and racing cars. The first fruits of McLaren's labour was the incredible F1 of 1992 – a car that went on to claim the production car speed record at a monstrous 386kph.

Tesla (2008)

Even Tesla probably didn’t realize how important its first car the Tesla Roadster would be to not just Elon Musk’s own company but the wider industry as well. This Lotus Elise-based sports car was not only the first mainstream electric car with a usable range (of around 240-320km) but also totally reversed perceptions of electric cars with sweet performance with 0-96kph acceleration of under four seconds. Tesla didn’t look back and the industry has been playing catch-up with it ever since. In leading the world to electrification the last car company in this story may also be one of the most important.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbmFuY2lhbGV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2F1dG8vaW5kdXN0cnkvbWFoaW5kcmEtYW5kLWZvcmQtbW90b3ItcGFydC13YXlzLWFzLWpvaW50LXZlbnR1cmUtY2FsbGVkLW9mZi8yMTYyNTk3L9IBemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbmFuY2lhbGV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2F1dG8vaW5kdXN0cnkvbWFoaW5kcmEtYW5kLWZvcmQtbW90b3ItcGFydC13YXlzLWFzLWpvaW50LXZlbnR1cmUtY2FsbGVkLW9mZi8yMTYyNTk3L2xpdGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mahindra and Ford Motor part ways as joint venture called off,"Mahindra has confirmed that this decision will not have any impact on its product plan. The company management said it will focus resources on and build a strong brand and capability to deliver high-quality top-notch SUV portfolio which is based on EVs.

Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) and US-automaker Ford Motor Company announced on Friday that they will not complete a previously announced automotive joint venture between their companies. The action followed passing of the December 31 “longstop” or expiration date of a definitive agreement the organisations entered into in October 2019.

Speaking to the media about the development Pawan Goenka managing director Mahindra & Mahindra said “Given the fundamental changes in the global economic and business conditions caused in part by the pandemic both partners decided that we should not extend the date of the business transfer agreement and therefore as of midnight business transfer agreement expired and there will be no further discussion that will happen on the JV between Mahindra and Ford.”

He said the changes influenced separate decisions by Ford and Mahindra to reassess their respective capital allocation priorities.

Giving up majority control in its India operations Ford was said to transfer these to a joint venture formed with M&M. While M&M was supposed to own a 51% controlling stake in the JV valued at $275 million or Rs 1925 crore Ford was to hold 49%.

M&M and Ford had signed a definitive agreement to create a joint venture to develop market and distribute Ford brand vehicles in India and Ford brand and Mahindra brand vehicles in high-growth emerging markets around the world.

Mahindra had said that it would invest Rs 1400 crore in the JV but the number would have been much higher if it would have gone ahead with the investment based on the demand as this JV was also supposed to manufacture and export globally. Anish Shah deputy managing director and Group CFO M&M said “We will continue to look at opportunities to collaborate together but not go ahead with the JV as announced.”

However Mahindra reiterated that this decision will not have any impact on its product plan. The company management said it will focus resources on and build a strong brand and capability to deliver high-quality top-notch SUV portfolio which is based on EVs.

Rajesh Jejurikar executive director (auto and farm division) M&M said that the SUV segment will be in focus and the company plans to launch two cars on all new platforms this year with XUV500 and Scorpio also in the pipeline.

“We will be focusing on renewing the brand strengthening our engagement with communities leveraging Mahindra adventure and working to make our brand more aspirational with higher engagement and greater affinity” he said. He added that in the short term the company will focus on markets similar to India and will not try to build an international presence beyond these."

Niels Teusink of Dutch cybersecurity firm EYE discovered a secret hardcoded administrative account in the latest 4.60 patch 0 firmware for some Zyxel devices.

$ ssh zyfwp@192.168.1.252 Password: Pr ******* Xp Router> show users current No: 1 Name: zyfwp Type: admin (...) Router>

This account does not show in the Zyxel user interface and has a login name of 'zyfwp' and a static plain-text password. Due to the severity of this vulnerability BleepingComputer decided not to publish the password.

Teusink found that the account could be used to log into vulnerable devices over both SSH and the web interface. Since the SSL VPN interface operates on the same port as the web interface Teusink found that many users have allowed port 443 to be accessible on the Internet.

""As SSL VPN on these devices operates on the same port as the web interface a lot of users have exposed port 443 of these devices to the internet. Using publicly available data from Project Sonar I was able to identify about 3.000 Zyxel USG/ATP/VPN devices in the Netherlands. Globally more than 100.000 devices have exposed their web interface to the internet"" Teusink reported.

VPN device vulnerabilities are extremely dangerous as they can be used to create new VPN accounts to gain access to an internal network or create port forwarding rules to make internal services publicly accessible.

""Someone could for example change firewall settings to allow or block certain traffic. They could also intercept traffic or create VPN accounts to gain access to the network behind the device. Combined with a vulnerability like Zerologon this could be devastating to small and medium businesses"" Teusink warned.

These types of vulnerabilities have become a favorite among threat actors who are known to exploit Pulse Secure Fortinet and Citrix Netscaler VPN vulnerabilities to deploy ransomware or compromise internal corporate networks to steal data.

Administrators of affected devices should upgrade their devices to the latest firmware as soon as possible.

Zyxel releases new firmware for firewalls

In an advisory Zyxel thanked EYE's for their disclosure and stated that they used the hardcoded credentials to deliver automatic firmware updates via FTP.

""A hardcoded credential vulnerability was identified in the “zyfwp” user account in some Zyxel firewalls and AP controllers. The account was designed to deliver automatic firmware updates to connected access points through FTP"" states Zyxel's advisory.

Zyxel has released ZLD V4.60 Patch 1 to remove the hardcoded credentials in vulnerable ATP USG USG Flex and VPN devices. Zyxel states that ATP USG USG FLEX and VPN firewalls using earlier firmware or SD-OS are not affected.

The patch for NXC AP controllers is expected to be released in April 2021.

The table of affected Zyxel products and the patch availability is below.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Dave Gadhia has a message for anyone who questions the value of good governance: It can be worth $9-billion.

Mr. Gadhia is deputy chair of Flutter Entertainment PLC one of the world’s largest gambling companies. He took a long strange trip to help build what’s now a $40-billion business It was a journey filled with boardroom intrigue including showdowns with a former chief executive officer regulators and major shareholders Blackstone Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc.

The four-year odyssey turned the Vancouver-based executive into an outspoken advocate for strong boards of directors a role he’s taking on at a time when investors are increasingly focused on understanding the hard-to-measure environment social and governance components of a company.

“The lesson from my experience is compelling value can be created by a board that takes its responsibilities seriously and is willing to engage with shareholders” Mr. Gadhia said in an interview.

Mr. Gadhia 57 never intended to have a second career as a board member. He ran then sold Burnaby B.C.-based Gateway Casinos & Entertainment Ltd. one of Canada largest gambling companies. In 2010 he agreed to what he expected would be a six-month stint as a director at what was then called Amaya Inc. He did it as a favour to the co-founder David Baazov.

What followed was a governance baptism by fire. Pointe-Claire Que.-based Amaya acquired a number of online gambling businesses including PokerStars the dominant player in the sector. Then the company almost collapsed in 2016 when Mr. Baazov faced insider trading charges from Quebec’s securities regulator an investigation that played out as he tried and failed to take Amaya private.

In the spring of 2016 the Amaya board named Mr. Gadhia as chair. Mr. Baazov departed in August. The stock price slumped and although the company was the leading online poker platform with a $3-billion market capitalization institutional shareholders pushed for its sale. Looking back Mr. Gadhia said: “David was a great deal maker but a poor operator.”

To fix Amaya Mr. Gadhia and the board called a halt to acquisitions. The chair renewed the board by recruiting proven directors then hired executives with experience in the gambling sector. Amaya set a new course diversifying away from a poker business that accounted for 70 per cent of revenue.

Then Mr. Gadhia hit the road for what he recalls as “intimidating” meetings with disgruntled shareholders including Blackstone and BlackRock two of the world’s largest fund managers.

“We had to look shareholders in the eye explain we went wrong and explain exactly what we were going to do to fix it” he said.

Blackstone BlackRock and a number of other institutions agreed to back the turnaround. A Canadian company that had nearly failed leaving shareholders with nothing found international suitors. Rather than being sold Amaya returned to the acquisition trail snapping up British-based Stars Group for $5-billion in 2014. The combined companies were taken over by Dublin-based Flutter in May for $9-billion one of the largest successful deals in pandemic-plagued 2020.

“In my experience boards should look at engaging with their stakeholders as an opportunity not a threat especially when you’re in crisis” said Mr. Gadhia. “At a minimum you’ll learn something. Beyond that you might just find the allies you need to succeed.”

Flutter’s stock price is up 60 per cent since Mr. Gadhia joined its board in May continuing a two-year rally in the company’s shares that reflects a more liberal approach to sports betting in the lucrative U.S. market. Flutter is already a major player in British sports wagering and the company partnered with Fox Corp. as part of a push into the United States. Recent filings show BlackRock owns a 5-per-cent stake in Flutter worth more than $2-billion.

As a board member Mr. Gadhia said he cannot comment in detail on Flutter’s performance and strategy but said the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the shift to sports betting through mobile devices such as cellphones.

Dave Gadhia has a message for anyone who questions the value of good governance: It can be worth $9-billion.

Mr. Gadhia is deputy chair of Flutter Entertainment PLC one of the world’s largest gambling companies. He took a long strange trip to help build what’s now a $40-billion business It was a journey filled with boardroom intrigue including showdowns with a former chief executive officer regulators and major shareholders Blackstone Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc.

The four-year odyssey turned the Vancouver-based executive into an outspoken advocate for strong boards of directors a role he’s taking on at a time when investors are increasingly focused on understanding the hard-to-measure environment social and governance components of a company.

“The lesson from my experience is compelling value can be created by a board that takes its responsibilities seriously and is willing to engage with shareholders” Mr. Gadhia said in an interview.

Mr. Gadhia 57 never intended to have a second career as a board member. He ran then sold Burnaby B.C.-based Gateway Casinos & Entertainment Ltd. one of Canada largest gambling companies. In 2010 he agreed to what he expected would be a six-month stint as a director at what was then called Amaya Inc. He did it as a favour to the co-founder David Baazov.

What followed was a governance baptism by fire. Pointe-Claire Que.-based Amaya acquired a number of online gambling businesses including PokerStars the dominant player in the sector. Then the company almost collapsed in 2016 when Mr. Baazov faced insider trading charges from Quebec’s securities regulator an investigation that played out as he tried and failed to take Amaya private.

In the spring of 2016 the Amaya board named Mr. Gadhia as chair. Mr. Baazov departed in August. The stock price slumped and although the company was the leading online poker platform with a $3-billion market capitalization institutional shareholders pushed for its sale. Looking back Mr. Gadhia said: “David was a great deal maker but a poor operator.”

To fix Amaya Mr. Gadhia and the board called a halt to acquisitions. The chair renewed the board by recruiting proven directors then hired executives with experience in the gambling sector. Amaya set a new course diversifying away from a poker business that accounted for 70 per cent of revenue.

Then Mr. Gadhia hit the road for what he recalls as “intimidating” meetings with disgruntled shareholders including Blackstone and BlackRock two of the world’s largest fund managers.

“We had to look shareholders in the eye explain we went wrong and explain exactly what we were going to do to fix it” he said.

Blackstone BlackRock and a number of other institutions agreed to back the turnaround. A Canadian company that had nearly failed leaving shareholders with nothing found international suitors. Rather than being sold Amaya returned to the acquisition trail snapping up British-based Stars Group for $5-billion in 2014. The combined companies were taken over by Dublin-based Flutter in May for $9-billion one of the largest successful deals in pandemic-plagued 2020.

“In my experience boards should look at engaging with their stakeholders as an opportunity not a threat especially when you’re in crisis” said Mr. Gadhia. “At a minimum you’ll learn something. Beyond that you might just find the allies you need to succeed.”

Flutter’s stock price is up 60 per cent since Mr. Gadhia joined its board in May continuing a two-year rally in the company’s shares that reflects a more liberal approach to sports betting in the lucrative U.S. market. Flutter is already a major player in British sports wagering and the company partnered with Fox Corp. as part of a push into the United States. Recent filings show BlackRock owns a 5-per-cent stake in Flutter worth more than $2-billion.

As a board member Mr. Gadhia said he cannot comment in detail on Flutter’s performance and strategy but said the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the shift to sports betting through mobile devices such as cellphones.

Just a super quick post to provide a tiny bit of context on an issue some (but not all) folks are seeing where your recorded GPS track is offset by upwards of a hundred meters or more. In general the pattern of your route is correct but it may be displaced to one side or the other. However in many cases by the completion of the workout it sorts itself out. In other words it’s mostly a one-time issue.

The issue largely appears to be impacting companies that leverage the Sony GPS chipset in their devices which is basically all new Garmin devices in the last few years most new Suunto devices in the last few years all Polar devices in the last few years all COROS devices the Wahoo RIVAL and more. More or less everyone except Apple.

Very rough list of impacted devices (I’m missing a ton here these are just the most popular ones)

– COROS GPS watches (need to double-check original Pace though)

– Garmin Forerunner 45/245/745/945/Fenix 6/MARQ/Vivoactive 3/4/Venu

– Garmin Edge 130 Plus 530/830/1030 Plus

– Polar Vantage V/M/V2 Grit X Ignite

– Suunto 5 & Suunto 9

– Wahoo RIVAL

Again I’m missing a boatload here but that’s the big-ticket ones off the top of my head.

All these companies have switched to the Sony GPS chipset since around 2018 with Polar and Suunto initially jumping onboard followed quickly thereafter by Garmin COROS and more. The Sony GPS chipset is widely used by these companies because of the power savings delivering longer battery life.

But – that’s all besides the point and not the cause of the issue. The issue has to do with the ephemeris data file also called the EPO file (Extended Prediction Orbit) or Connected Predictive Ephemeris (CPE). Or simply the satellite pre-cache file. That’s the file that’s delivered to your device on a frequent basis (usually every few days). This file is what makes your watch near-instantly find GPS satellites when you go outside. It’s basically a cheat-sheet of where the satellites are for the next few days or up to a week or so.

Your watch or bike computer automatically gets this file via Bluetooth Smart from your phone WiFi or USB depending on how you connect your watch. Most companies deliver it anytime your watch syncs and needs a new version. So from your side you never do anything – it just quietly happens in the background.

Right now the data in this file is wrong and thus the data your watch uses for those first few minutes is also wrong – leading to the offsets. You can see an example of this below from one DCR reader:

And another:





As the watch sustains its connection with GPS satellites over the length of the workout it’ll generally re-correct itself as it pulls in updated data from above. Most people are reporting that it’ll resolve itself either by the end of the workout or the next workout. You can see that here from yet another DCR reader:

Same here – identical errors on start point on my Fenix 6X Pro and my wife’s Forerunner 45S then they sort themselves out – I walked she ran so my route is more accurate as it had more time to get a fix I guess… pic.twitter.com/tZ4ysgYPtW — ac72 (@ac72) January 2 2021

To help resolve this you can simply stick your watch/bike computer outside and let it record an hour workout then just discard it after that. It’ll have received the required satellite information to likely correct itself.

But it won’t impact everyone. For example I tried today with two Sony-based watches (Garmin FR745 and FR945) to get it to lay down an incorrect track – and it wouldn’t. I suspect this is because in my case the watch had been bumped on a few times while playing with my kids yesterday and today so my guess is it had already re-downloaded what it needed to be correct out of the gate. I also tried with two non-Sony chipsets (Fenix 5S and Apple Watch SE) and didn’t see any problems either.

In talking to Garmin today they’re working on a fix for the issue that they believe will most likely be that they just update the satellite pre-cache data from the server which in turn your watch will grab just as it always does. But first they (and others) are working to sort out what exactly is wrong with the data that’s causing this.

In talking to another person in the industry dealing with the issue they noted that technically 2020 had 53 weeks and this is the 53rd week. As such the suspect Sony data file issue might actually be tied to that complexity.

See…just when you thought you escaped 2020 it’s still there waiting for you at the start of your run.

With that – thanks for reading!

The reason with hindsight should be obvious: the UK was just over a week away from its first coronavirus lockdown and it didn’t feel responsible to take public transport to an event where I’d be sharply inhaling and exhaling around a whole bunch of fellow potential viral hosts.

It would turn out to be the last UK parkrun of the year with events still yet to return to the country as the pandemic continues to dominate headlines and mindsets.

I still don’t know for sure if I got coronavirus later that month — as a freelancer who works from home 90% of the time it didn’t feel necessary to use one of the tests to find out. All I can say for sure is that I had mild flu-like symptoms while my girlfriend developed the more obvious ones. Nonetheless months later I would go on to develop symptoms that the CDC tags as common long covid ones: fatigue chest pain and joint pain.

(Image credit: Garmin)

These literal painful symptoms prompted another more figurative pain: my 5K times plummeted. I went from running the distance in a respectable 24-26 minutes to being unable to run 3km without needing to stop to walk. This added an unacceptable 5 to 10 minutes to the average times I’d nurtured over 212 parkrun events.

I know that in the greater scheme of things that there are worse things in the world than this but nonetheless I found this a depressing turn of events. I genuinely feared that I would never get up to full speed again and that the pride in running a medium distance (let alone a long distance) without stopping was something that I would never enjoy again.

But then I remembered the device that was tracking my decline could also be used to put that trend into reverse. I bought a Garmin Forerunner 245 back in 2019 but hadn’t bothered with the built-in Garmin Coach because I hadn’t needed it. Now however I was certainly in need of coaching. I wasn’t sure how much of the inability to run more than 3K was in my head. Maybe in lockdown I’d just forgotten what the feeling of runner’s discomfort felt like?

(Image credit: Alan Martin)

For those unfamiliar with Garmin Coach it’s a feature of select Garmin watches (the Forerunner 45 or Vivoactive 3 seem to be the cheapest compatible options) that schedules a training program based on your 5- or 10K goals adapted to your performance and the metrics it picks up along the way. This can be as simple as just running it without stopping or it can train you to a certain time goal. You select the days you can work out on and Garmin comes up with instructions for that day all readable on the wrist.

So I set up a 3-month training program with the ultimate goal of hitting 5K in 26 minutes by February. This involves four runs per week with different goals each time; sometimes it will involve a slow-pace run for 30 minutes and other times it will involve doing short sprints. For each segment the watch has a handy meter to show you if you’re going too fast or too slow — just stay in the green segment and you'll be fine. Each session has a built-in warm up and warm down time and there’s usually the option of doing an extra 5 to 10 minute ‘encore’ if you’re feeling strong.

Four weeks into the program and I have to say the goal still feels a touch optimistic to me but currently the Garmin ‘confidence’ rating about my chances of success has me just on the edge of “extremely confident”. Tomorrow’s run is a “Time Trial” where I have to run 1.61km as fast as I can so I guess we’ll see how far I’ve come then.

(Image credit: Alan Martin)

But whether I succeed or not I would recommend anyone in a similar running slump give it a go provided they feel up to it (and if in doubt consult your doctor). Not only is it making me feel better and more confident that my illness was just a blip but the schedule is giving me a sense of purpose in a pandemic-packed world where it’s all too easy to feel adrift as days blur into one.

Now I'm rolling on to February 20 for race day. If all goes to plan I might start it all over again with a more ambitious time target or up it to 10K.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vc3R1ZmYuY28uemEvMjAyMS8wMS8wMi9nYXJtaW4tdmVudS1zcS1yZXZpZXctMi_SAT1odHRwczovL3N0dWZmLmNvLnphLzIwMjEvMDEvMDIvZ2FybWluLXZlbnUtc3EtcmV2aWV3LTIvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin Venu Sq Review - Going For A Run - Stuff South Africa,"8.5 Solid The fact that the Venu Sq is stuffed with so many features touts the battery that it does and comes in a cheaper than it's siblings means that it's definitely worth paying attention to.

Whether you’re a tough-as-nails mountaineer a mad person who likes competing in triathlons or just an appreciator of long walks outside Garmin has always your back with a series of wearables that are ready for a tumble and capable of providing all the info you could possibly need.

The only downside to this is that Garmin has largely marketed its fitness gear to those diehard enthusiasts willing to spend a little more for a quality product. With more and more people beginning to take an interest in healthier more active lifestyles Garmin has been in need of a product to appeal to those users. You know the kinds who enjoy a jog four days a week but aren’t really enthusiast about climbing mountains.

That’s where the Garmin Venu Sq comes in. The cheaper version of Garmin’s beefy Venu swaps out some of the more expensive parts of it’s older siblings for assets that may be more cost efficient but certainly don’t degrade its performance. If anything after using it for a week this has turned out to be an excellent new smartwatch for the average joy and it’s always nice to have more options.

Design

Apple really has been massively influential in the design space with it’s range of smartwatches huh? The Venu Sq looks like it’s borrowed more than a single page for the Apple Watch; more like an entire chapter. Having said that if something ain’t broke it might be worth copying it. The 1.3in touchscreen and double-button design have been used because they clearly work well and the use of the square display will probably trick a few folks into thinking you splurged on Apple’s product.

The aluminium bezel is a nice clean touch but at the same time the actual size of the screen feels very… small. The unfortunate side effect of this is that the entire watch feels dated to use and look it. Fortunately there’s a wide range of colours for the watch face and strap to choose from. By the way the quick-release silicone strap is very comfortable to wear but you could replace it with other materials such as nylon suede and leather if you so choose.

Overall the Venu Sq is certainly not as utilitarian as Garmin’s more specifically focused fitness watches. It actually looks pretty nice if you’re willing to ignore a screen that’s a touch small by today’s standards.

Features

Despite it’s notification system being somewhat limited (hope you have an Android device lying around) it’s also stuffed with all the kit you’d need to monitor your fitness and health levels. Seriously this thing can track things like hydration respiration menstruation as well as a boatload of different exercises. It also comes with GPS an optical heart-rate sensor and can even run PulseOx tests. PulseOx actually just means blood-oxygen levels but it sounds way cooler to say right?

The amount of things the Venu Sq is able to monitor is truly staggering and it’s made all the better by how simple it all is to use. Just a single press of the button and you’ll be stopping and starting your workouts with everything displayed in an easily visible fashion on the screen. It’s efficient which is arguably the most important part of a smartwatch.

Software

The Venu Sq is running Garmin’s own software which if we’re honest is a little basic. Having said that you’re not exactly looking to calculate NASA launches with something like this right? It does what it needs to do and that’s perfectly okay. Still the pre-installed and downloadable watchfaces aren’t especially appealing considering many of them are user created. It’s nice to have that as an option but it would be nice if a there was a touch more attention pay to presentation.

Really the biggest issue we have with the software of the Venu Sq is that you have to use Garmin Connect to make the most of it. The companion app is very hit-or-miss in that it handles the basics well enough but need to use it at all complicates what should be a very straight forward process. Once you get to grips with it though the displays for all the data and important information are straight forward and easy to understand. Just a pity you have to jump through a few extra hoops to get to them.

Performance and Battery Life

As can be expected the battery life of the Venu Sq is fantastic. You’ll easily squeeze out six days of life from this thing without a charge. Of course that depends on what features you’re using but an average user won’t have to worry about the watch dying at an inopportune moment. If you’re looking at using more intense features such as the PulseOx mode combined with music and a sizable run every day you should still get roughly three days of battery life which is nothing to turn your nose up at. Oh and flat to full charge only takes 90 minutes which is a real pleasure even if you do have to use Garmin’s special charging cable.

It can struggle to keep up with activity on the watch face though. If a WhatsApp chat is particularly busy it there’s a notable bit of lag which can make using it a pain a hassle exacerbated by the fact that the display is so small but we’ve harped on about that long enough at this point.

Garmin Venu Sq Verdict

The fact that the Venu Sq is stuffed with so many features touts the battery that it does and comes in a cheaper than it’s siblings means that it’s definitely worth paying attention to.

The former Tour de France champion scored a fourth-place finish up there with some of the world’s best pure TT riders including his Ineos team-mates Filippo Ganna and Rohan Dennis.

But the most surprising detail of Thomas’s result came after the finish when he revealed he’d ridden his effort without his power readings after forgetting his Garmin GPS device before the start.

The Welshman’s outstanding ride without the most essential data for a time trial raised questions about how much better he would have ridden if he knew his wattage and also about how important pacing is for riders of every level.

Cycling Weekly asked Matt Rowe from Rowe and King coaching and a Garmin ambassador to get his thoughts on how essential pacing is for pros and amateurs alike.

“In time trialling you're on your own” Rowe said. “It's an individual event. Pace judgment is absolutely critical.

“For road racing pacing is still important but you need to maintain pace with the bunch with the leaders of the race. So pace judgement is less important in road racing.

“So pace judgment important for road racing for parts of road racing - key climbs key sections - and for time trialling absolutely fundamental. Races are literally won and lost World Championships are decided by your ability to pace your effort.”

How important is pacing for the pros?

There are a few notable examples of riders ditching the power data and still getting the best out of themselves in a TT - most famously Chloe Dygert in the 2019 World Championships and Tadej Pogačar in the penultimate stage of the 2020 Tour de France both of whom secured victories on feel alone.

But for most pros in the modern era pacing with power data is key.

Rowe said: “If you're looking to perform in a time trial especially. If you take the top 10 at the Worlds chances are nine of them are heavily reliant on the data using a Garmin.

“Courses are programmed into the Garmins they know what turns are coming up they know the gradients how to pace the effort swiftly they would know how long the next climb is how steep the next climb is where it flattens out they would know how much power to produce on which seconds of the climb.

“Data is knowledge knowledge is power.”

And how did the lack of data effect Thomas's Worlds ride in Imola?

""By and large most riders heavily rely on data"" Rowe said.

""And they use data all through the season to really kind of fine tune and hone themselves in and Geraint would have known exactly what power was required over what sections of the course to get the best best out of him.

""So we're going with a very solid game plan and then have basically the means to follow that game plan just stripped away from you both physically is a massive detriment because you're not going to get the most out of yourself physically but psychologically as well that's a massive blow. Straight away you're gonna feel on the back foot because you become so reliant on that data so for sure it impacted him psychologically

""This is a prime example of how the sport is getting so technologically advanced.""

So what data is most important?

Opening up the options screen on your Garmin or other GPS device can be slightly daunting from power and heart-rate to cadence and speed so which are most useful?

Rowe said speed while interesting is more a byproduct of the effort you put into the bike so power measured in watts are the most fundamental numbers followed by elevation and then a map of your course.

Pacing for amateurs

Pacing isn’t just for the pros either - working on your effort can have huge benefits for amateurs taking part in time trials road races and even sportives.

Rowe said: “The best way to pace your effort with power is first knowing roughly what power you can sustain for a given duration.

“Looking at your power you're producing is the best way to pace your effort and you need to kind of you need to know what you're capable of within certain situations.”

A good way of testing the importance of pacing yourself is finding a stretch of road around 4km-long and riding from A to B as fast as possible first on feel and then again with power comparing your times after the ride.

Rowe said he “almost guarantees” that any rider would go faster the second time around.

He added: “Pacing yourself in training is absolutely fundamental because you get good at what you practice and you get to learn and understand your body a lot better.

“So by pacing yourself in training you get a feel for what good pace looks like come event day whether the event is the World Championships for Geraint or it's your local club 10 or even a sportive whatever it is.

“After learning how to pace yourself using data using metrics in training you're then able to kind of replicate that come race day.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjMTMuY29tL3RleGFzLXNoYXBlZC1iaWtlLXJvdXRlLWhvdXN0b24tamVzc2UtYWxzdG9uLXRvdXJpc3QtYXR0cmFjdGlvbnMtaW4vOTIzNzYwNS_SAWJodHRwczovL2FiYzEzLmNvbS9hbXAvdGV4YXMtc2hhcGVkLWJpa2Utcm91dGUtaG91c3Rvbi1qZXNzZS1hbHN0b24tdG91cmlzdC1hdHRyYWN0aW9ucy1pbi85MjM3NjA1Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cyclist Jesse Alston created an outline of Texas across bike routes in downtown Houston,"Texas-shaped bike route takes you through Houston's newest paths and trails

HOUSTON Texas (KTRK) -- Need a fun family activity to enjoy while practicing safe social distancing? Look no further!

The challenge is on to see who can complete this bike route that outlines the shape of Texas.

Creator Jesse Alston said the idea came to him and his cycling-partner while they were looking for ways to switch-up their everyday workout.

""I thought this would be a way to flex the creative muscle and tour parts [ of Houston ] that I've might not seen"" Alston said.

He said mapping out the route wasn't easy. He printed an outline of Texas placed it over a map and said he had to adjust it many times until the outline matched the streets.

As all Houstonians know there is no quick way to travel through the city. Alston said he had to travel through side streets trails and even on roads with no sidewalk to create the outline.

The path was around 14.4 miles long and he said he was able to complete it in under an hour.

Alston said he plans to continue finding new ways to enjoy the newest bike routes and is excited about the growth of Houston's cycling community.

Things are rather different when the employee is the client manager for the firm’s largest customer or the production manager at a microprocessor plant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZW1pdW1iZWF1dHluZXdzLmNvbS9lbi90aGUtaHVtYW5pemF0aW9uLW9mLXRoZS1kaWdpdGFsLWlzLDE3NzQ40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,“The humanization of the digital is the next step” Sabrina Herlory M.A.C.,"What was your experience of the lockdowns at M.A.C. Cosmetics?

Sabrina Herlory - I’m not going to lie it was - and still is - hard! But at the same time it was exhilarating. The world to come is going to be like this: we’re all going to be disrupted 70000 times in our lives and we’re going to have to get out of our comfort zone more regularly. For managers like me this means making quick decisions based on partial information and no longer with full knowledge of the facts. And this is not an ability that can be learnt overnight it’s a muscle that you train throughout your life.

What measures have you taken to withstand the crisis?

Sabrina Herlory - We have trained our sales consultants in ""virtual selling"" i.e. one-to-one personalized advice at a distance. This has been appreciated by the teams who have suffered quite a lot during these periods of partial unemployment which are very depressing. They realized that even if there was pressure on the retail sector their occupation could evolve thanks to digital technology and not disappear!

And does ""virtual selling"" work for makeup?

Sabrina Herlory - Many doubted it but I can tell you that yes it’s very interesting from a human point of view and from a pure business point of view as well. The one-to-one digital concept is a bubble even more insulated than the physical experience in the store. It allowed us to maintain a connection with our customers who are used to human interaction when buying makeup. We launched these virtual appointments in September 2020 and 70% of the customers who received advice remotely then moved on to a physical store. Real remote personalized advice can channel traffic for brands when the stores reopen.

Is the humanization of digital the next step?

Sabrina Herlory - I’m convinced it is! This was the missing piece and the lockdown allowed us to implement it thanks to digital tools. It’s quite satisfying to say that yes there has been an explosion of the digital but what we’re learning is that consumers need to talk to real people! For me the brands that understand this will be the ones that will remain sustainable. If we can prove that the humanization of digital is turning into R.O.I. live chats will be one-to-one remote consultations will be one-to-one... Because we are all social animals with a real need for quality human interactions. And that goes beyond sales.

What does that mean?

Sabrina Herlory - Today if a brand is not organically socially committed to a 360-degree project I think it will not be able to count in the world to come: it’s ""how I treat customers my suppliers what footprint do I leave how do managers treat their employees"". I see more and more managers deeply preoccupied by this global commitment. They often come from the next generation I must say. They are socially engaged and that’s very gratifying!",,,,,,

GEHC,GE HealthCare,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZHBhZ2V0b2RheS5jb20vcHVibGljaGVhbHRocG9saWN5L2dlbmVyYWxwcm9mZXNzaW9uYWxpc3N1ZXMvOTA0NzfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Op-Ed: Beware of Health Insurance Brokers,"Health insurance brokers market themselves to employers as a buyer's agent promising to use their expertise to find employers the best deal. A new study however reported a positive association between health insurance broker commissions and premiums paid by employers offering fully insured group health plans to their workers.

What's more brokers are also paid various types of bonuses by insurance carriers based on the amount of total business the broker has placed with the carrier the amount of new business delivered to the carriers or other types of metrics based on profit delivered to the carriers.

If you're an employer looking for fully insured health insurance plans your broker has every incentive to sell you a higher-priced plan compared to a lower-priced plan a plan structured to produce more profit for the carrier rather than savings to you a plan sold by the carrier that has a better bonus structure compared to a better plan for you offered by another carrier.

Larger employers often hire one of a handful of major insurance carriers to administer a self-funded plan in which the employer pays all of the medical claims incurred by its workers. The carrier is merely a claims processor writing checks to hospitals and doctors out of the employer's own bank account. What incentive does that carrier have to make sure the employer isn't being overcharged billed erroneously fraudulently or billed for inappropriate and unnecessary care at more expensive sites of care? None. They just mail the check. It's not their money on the line.

So fully insured employers buy plans sold by agents who have no incentive to keep costs down or recommend the most suitable plan; self-funded employers have carriers that have no incentive to keep costs down or quality high. That economic jujitsu is stealing prosperity and growth from American businesses and stealing the American dream from the working class.

What are employers to do? First smoke it out. Fully insured employers should ask their broker to disclose all dollars flowing to them as a result of the employer's business including all commissions and bonuses paid for health plans as well as for ancillary lines such as disability or life insurance. Employers should also ask their broker to disclose any end-of-year carrier overrides or bonuses that the broker will receive and from which carriers. If a broker is suggesting a specific plan offered by a carrier the employer should ask whether the broker is paid a different commission or monthly fee for that plan compared to other plans not being recommended. Transparency will help the employer understand the incentives the broker has to recommend certain carriers.

Second self-funded employers may want to enter into a direct fee arrangement with their broker who would receive no commissions from any carrier and instead is paid a flat rate or a per-subscriber-per-month rate directly from the employer. Some innovative brokers are also willing to guarantee their work by taking a portion of their fee as a percentage of savings year over year. The broker serves as a plan architect designing benefits and building a plan using an independent administrative entity an independent stop-loss carrier pharmacy solution and patient navigation services usually without needing the help of any of the well-known health insurance oligarchs. These unbundled plans are increasingly being used by employers who want to both save money and offer their workers generous benefits at the same time. Through flexible management and financing structures these plans are also becoming possible for small employers -- even those with under 50 employees.

Our broken healthcare status quo makes service providers brokers and insurance carriers do better financially when patients are sicker and are charged higher prices. Re-humanizing employer-sponsored health benefits will require competition on the basis of delivering the highest quality care for the lowest possible cost. The only way this will happen is when all the incentives in the supply chain including brokers and carriers are re-aligned to the best interest of employers and their workers.

With her husband stuck overseas the mother of a toddler found herself juggling work from home (WFH) caring for her child and house work all on her own. With her performance at work inevitably taking the hit Jayanthi had to eventually move to working part-time for her employers. As the world grappled with the Covid pandemic many like Jayanthi have been trying to make the best of a hard situation and struggling.

Jayanthi is not alone. Covid disruption has altered the career paths of many especially women. On the positive side feels Neha Bagaria CEO and founder JobsForHer a career platform for women the pandemic has prodded companies to re-evaluate how women work and view it differently. “Companies are working out flexible work options” she says. “We have been trying to convince corporates of the need for flexible working options and the pandemic has done that rather well for us” she says. A caveat remains though. WFH for women works only if she has adequate help and support at home.

And not just women working from home was no breeze for most people. Many were forced to work without appropriate WFH equipment in noisy rooms and with patchy internet all the while keeping up with the responsibilities of home-keeping. Shachi Irde chief consulting officer of eXlygenze SenseWorks a firm that provides solutions related to digital technology organisational development data analytics and behavioural neuroscience for companies talks of the “pressure cooker moment” in meetings. “Nearly all homes will have a pressure cooker whistling in the background—it’s just how Indian homes are” she says. Irde also explained the initial challenges that both companies and employees had to deal with. “Companies were suspicious of how productive the employees would be working from home. Organisations went into extremes. There were instances of HR calling employees out on log-in and log-out hours. Employees on their part either wanted to be available 24x7 because of anxiety over losing their jobs or would just be too overwhelmed.” Irde who has consulted with about 70 companies reports that a lot has changed over the past nine months and many companies have embraced different styles of working that entail greater flexibility and smarter monitoring. “There is now a greater sense of trust. Companies want to know how to measure performance how to upskill and create new competency frameworks” she adds. Companies are organising virtual tea sessions and happy hours and employees are being encouraged to speak about any mental health challenges they might be facing.

The changes

Companies have been forced to look at how women work and are more willing to offer flexible work options

Organisations have embraced digital technology Cloud and AI in a matter of months

Companies now have a greater sense of trust in their employees and are focusing on how to fairly measure performance and provide them with back-end support

The manufacturing sector adapted very quickly to ensure there were no disruptions

Subram Natrajan chief technology officer of IBM talks about the quick adoption of Cloud AI and other technologies by firms—a process that typically would have taken much longer. From ensuring data security and meeting changing customer demands to keeping employees motivated and coping with WFH challenges 2020 forced businesses and individuals to reinvent. Sarthak Gahlaut founder and CEO FeedingBillions a food tech company providing meal solutions to several Fortune 500 companies kept his employees in his facility at Noida for nearly 50 days after the lockdown was announced. As a corporate caterer he had to allay his clients’ safety concerns overnight. His kitchen is now subject to regular auditing by clients and his employees are working in shifts.

In the service-driven sector the transition was perhaps easier as compared to in the manufacturing sector where new protocols had to be put in place. And fast. FMCG giant Parle Agro for instance tapped into AI solutions for demand prediction. Mother Dairy an essential service brand that couldn’t have afforded any disruption in its supply was quick to instal a WFH protocol while ensuring back-end infrastructural support to its employees. IBM had to ensure the process without any site visits. Milagrow an Indian robotics firm witnessed phenomenal growth during this period. According to founder and chairman Rajeev Karwal “the company grew over 2000 per cent in October over the previous year and 500 per cent in November.” Online platforms took products like robots to tier 2 and tier 3 cities. While demand from facility management companies and hotels declined residential demand picked up.

With Covid there is an evident push to make what was being seen as the disrupted style of working “the new normal”. “Employers are working on putting together e-enabled systems which break down tasks and behaviours to nano tasks. Does an employee need more skill training? Does the role need to evolve? These are just some of the questions employers are asking” says Irde. Many in fact are rethinking the need for a physical space at all. Amid all this change one thing is certain—traditional workspaces need to evolve to survive.

CASE STUDY | The two sides of WFH

KL NARASIMHAN 53: Senior Manager regulatory affairs India and South Asia Wipro GE Healthcare Pvt Ltd

The experience

K.L. Narasimhan and his family had to upgrade their bandwidth and sort out the digital devices each member needed to work or study from home

WFH has helped him save time but not being able to travel for meetings has been a problem for him

Narasimhan’s employer GE has been flexible about the company’s work culture during the pandemic which has helped immensely

It has been nearly 10 months since K.L. Narasimhan and his family stepped out of their three-bedroom home in Kalkaji New Delhi. When the lockdown was announced Narasimhan his wife Deepa a school teacher and two children had to quickly adapt to working and studying from home.

The initial days were challenging. There were bandwidth issues to be dealt with a working space for each family member had to be set up. With his son Abhinav in class 12 and daughter Ritu a college student making the switch to online classes the transition period was tough on the family. His wife was initially using the iPad to teach her classes but she eventually had to upgrade to a laptop at which point his son got the iPad. “We had to sort out our devices first” says Narasimhan. “With all of us working from home we had to upgrade our bandwidth and demarcate areas for us to work from.”

The family begins work/ classes for the day at around 8.30 am takes a break around lunch time and then it’s back to the screens. For Narasimhan working from home has helped him save time—he doesn’t need to travel to Gurgaon every day for work which saves him two hours if not more in a day. But on the flip side as a senior in the regulatory affairs department his work entails meeting government officials which has become a challenge. “We have to find ways and means of reaching out to government officials while working from home” he says.

However after the hiccups and challenges of the initial few months of the lockdown things says Narasimhan have fallen into place. “General Electric has been very flexible about the work culture during the pandemic. We have deliverables so as long as our projects are complete we don’t have to account for every minute” he says.

On whether he wants to continue with this new way of working he says: “WFH has its own advantages and disadvantages. Though it has helped me save my commute time in my job one-on-one meetings are more effective rather than virtual meets.”",,,,,,,,,

Audiophile speaker brands like Bowers & Wilkins and Focal now have a big presence in the headphone space and can be found on display in everyday places like Best Buy and Apple’s retail stores. Heck you can buy Bowers & Wilkins headphones in some airports these days. Fifteen years ago the idea of buying a B&W product in an airport would have seemed ludicrous. That just goes to show how important the headphone business has become to the audio industry as a whole. While most loudspeaker manufacturers that now offer headphones — including B&W Focal KEF and PSB — got into the personal audio business after the advent of Beats by Dre Klipsch was ahead of the curve when it launched its first in-ear monitor in 2007 a year before the first Beats headphone was introduced. In the intervening years Klipsch has maintained its position as an important player in the headphone business particularly with the company’s in-ear monitors. (My friend Bill who is a Grammy-winning mixing/mastering engineer used a pair of Klipsch in-ear monitors as his daily drivers for several years before eventually upgrading to some very expensive custom IEMs from JH Audio.) Now in 2020 Klipsch is poised to get ahead of the curve once again via a recently-announced collaboration with the DSP wizards at Dirac. Together the two companies aim to “pioneer the next generation of headphone audio performance” according to a press release from Dirac. The first product to be born of this partnership is expected to debut shortly after the holidays. Though details are scarce at this time it will probably be a true wireless earbud or in-ear monitor (like Apple’s AirPods) and will reportedly leverage Dirac’s sound optimization algorithms to “boost every detail of the music and unleash the full potential of the earphones.”

Klipsch is the preferred choice of audiophiles and aficionados around the world thanks in large part to our unwavering commitment to engineering excellence and innovation. By working with Dirac we combine our decades of headphone expertise with their digital audio expertise to introduce to our customers a new level of listening experience. Dirac shares our commitment to excellence and innovation and we look forward to continued collaboration.

— Vlad Grodzinskiy Sr. Product Manager at Klipsch

I’m personally hoping to see an updated version of the Klipsch Heritage HP-3 over-ear headphones ($1200) at some point down the road. The companies have said that “the integration of Dirac’s software with Klipsch’s premium speaker hardware will establish new performance standards across Klipsch earphones demonstrating the ability to level-up any listening experience through the use of pioneering digital audio solutions.” So it’s reasonable to expect more than one Dirac-enhanced Klipsch headphone product coming down the pipeline. The engineering teams at the two companies have worked closely to customize Dirac’s technology so that it delivers “peak performance and (the) maximum degree of audio upgrade” when combined with Klipsch earphone hardware.

Dirac has long been a pioneer in the home theater automotive and mobile market working with the industries’ most well-respected brands. Collaboration with Klipsch – a legendary acoustics pioneer – further establishes our position as an innovator in the headphone market and reasserts our commitment to working closely with premium brands to leverage the latest in digital audio to elevate hardware performance to new levels.

Klipsch / Dirac Future Product Collaborations in the Making?

Dirac’s sound optimization solution provides impulse response and frequency response correction resulting in improved clarity sound-staging voice intelligibility and bass fidelity according to Dirac. The Swedish digital audio experts have also developed a technology called Dirac 3D Audio which they describe as “audiophile-quality 3D audio DSP tailored to your headphones.” Dirac 3D Audio is ideal for gaming and for immersive surround-sound effects but can be applied to all kinds of headphones. The tech promises a more convincing outside-of-your-head sound presentation with a realistic sense of space and accurate spatial positioning of different audio objects.

Although this is the first time that Klipsch has teamed up with Dirac the iconic brand has been a part of some interesting partnerships in the past. Back in 2008 Klipsch collaborated with Best Buy to develop the five-model Icon V Series of loudspeakers which was designed to deliver superior sound from slim attractive and lifestyle-friendly cabinets all for a low price. More recently Klipsch became the official headphone and portable audio partner of the McLaren Formula 1 racing team and earlier this year the two brands announced several new headphone products featuring McLaren’s signature Papaya Orange color and suitably high-tech styling. The range-topping Klipsch x McLaren T10 True Wireless in-ears will set you back a cool $1000. For the T10 Klipsch partnered with a technology group called Ear Micro to develop the internal electronics which are claimed to be the smallest in the world (about 50% smaller than those inside Apple’s AirPods Pro) yet with much more powerful processing capabilities than any competing solution. It seems likely that Ear Micro’s small yet powerful “ear computers” will again be put to use in the next generation of Klipsch earphones as it takes quite a bit of computing horsepower for Dirac’s DSP-based sound solution to work its magic. We’ll be sure to keep you updated as soon as more information becomes available about the fruits of the Klipsch/Dirac collaboration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zb2NpZXR5LzIwMjEvamFuLzAyL2hvc3BpdGFscy13aXRob3V0LXdhbGxzLXRoZS1mdXR1cmUtb2YtZGlnaXRhbC1oZWFsdGhjYXJl0gFoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3NvY2lldHkvMjAyMS9qYW4vMDIvaG9zcGl0YWxzLXdpdGhvdXQtd2FsbHMtdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1kaWdpdGFsLWhlYWx0aGNhcmU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hospitals without walls: the future of healthcare,"St Mary’s hospital was slated for a £1bn redevelopment before the pandemic struck with work due to start in 2027. The main emergency and specialist hospital serving north-west London will still get its upgrade but it might look quite different now. “Covid-19 has dramatically changed things” says James Kinross a surgeon who works at St Mary’s and sits on its redevelopment planning committee.

Before the pandemic Kinross says the committee’s goal was to improve the efficiency of existing care pathways; now it’s to rethink those pathways entirely. St Mary’s is a test case but the shape of healthcare is being reconsidered everywhere and that has major implications for the way hospitals will look in future.

George Mann an architect and pioneer of evidence-based hospital design at Texas A&M University in College Station compares the coming transformation to that of commercial airports in the past. The first airports resembled train stations because it took people time to realise that transport would never be the same again. “I don’t think we totally understand that we’re in the middle of a paradigm shift” he says.

That might sound like hyperbole given the eternally cash-strapped state of many healthcare systems and the anticipated economic downturn due to Covid-19 but think of the changes the pandemic has already forced through. The Chinese built a hospital in 10 days while in many countries medical consultations shifted online. Meanwhile existing hospitals – even and perhaps especially in the wealthy global north – buckled under the sudden immense strain.

Pictures flashed around the world of Covid-19 patients sitting in their cars outside a hospital in Naples breathing oxygen from tanks. Non-Covid patients have seen their potentially life-saving treatments postponed indefinitely while hospitals have themselves seeded Covid clusters.

None of this is surprising says hospital architect Thomas Schinko of Vasconi Architectes in Paris because the world’s richest countries have all but eliminated the concept of contagion from their hospitals infectious diseases no longer being the biggest killer there. “We’ve lost that reflex of protecting personnel from patients or patients from other patients” says Schinko. Result? “Our health systems are completely unadapted to this kind of disease.”

The pandemic has accelerated some trends such as the one to a “hospital without walls” – the hospital conceived as a digitally connected community rather than a circumscribed physical space. The twin pillars of digital health are electronic health records (EHRs) which allow patient information to be shared across health systems and telehealth which allows patients and physicians to communicate at distance.

Almost overnight we’ve gone from face-to-face consultations to the vast majority being by phone text or online

Many countries had been moving towards both since the 1990s but at different speeds and with different degrees of success. In the UK for example most GP surgeries now use EHRs but hospitals are further behind. There are genuine obstacles to embracing digital health provision says Saira Ghafur a respiratory physician and the lead for digital health policy at Imperial College London’s Institute of Global Health Innovation. These obstacles include inequality of access to IT and concerns about cybersecurity.

The risk of cybersecurity breaches was dramatically highlighted in 2017 with the WannaCry hack of the NHS while in the last year US hospitals have seen a wave of them. Such breaches can happen in any tech-enabled industry or domain but the case in September of a patient who died during a cyber-attack on a German hospital served as a reminder that the stakes when it comes to healthcare are the highest.

Nevertheless Ghafur says since Covid during which we have experienced the benefits of receiving care in the comfort of our own homes such obstacles seem surmountable. “Almost overnight we’ve gone from face-to-face consultations to the vast majority being what we’d call digital-first – by phone text video call or online” she says. “That has fundamentally changed the way that we deliver care.”

And she thinks those changes are here to stay. The results of a survey of nearly 10000 patients in London which her group will publish soon suggest that in general they want more not less digital healthcare. Though it certainly doesn’t suit everyone in future people will have more choice in how they access healthcare – being able to mix and match channels.

With the move to digital Schinko says we’ll see medicine becoming more preventive as well as more personalised and precise. Patients with asthma and diabetes are already used to monitoring their peak flow and blood sugar (respectively) through dedicated apps for example. And the adoption of a more “salutogenic” approach which emphasises health rather than disease is visible in China and the US which have invested heavily in digitisation.

In China for example the care pipeline for infectious disease starts at the airport with routine temperature checks (even outside a pandemic) while the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia considered one of the most technologically advanced in the US offers services through its web portal and in 2019 launched a pilot telehealth programme in schools. The goal in each case is to prioritise surveillance and early intervention.

This is the hospital without walls – the hospital that is everywhere embedded in our lives. And since some medicine will always require patients and medical personnel to meet it will inevitably shape the places where that happens too. Kinross says that before the pandemic the St Mary’s planning committee was considering shifting resources from inpatients to outpatients. Now they’re thinking more boldly. “Maybe we can just do away with some aspects of outpatients and deliver all of this care outside the hospital” he says. “Maybe we can leverage digital in a radical new way.”

Kinross envisages primary- care physicians or GPs taking on more responsibility (aided by decision-support technology) secondary care or specialist doctors spending more time in the community and an expansion of social care. Hospitals as physical entities will become specialist hubs he says with each specialism concentrated at one or a few hubs within a region rather than replicated across many generalist hospitals.

Such a health system might have been better equipped to manage this pandemic and reduce its impact but it’s unlikely to have prevented it. Since future pandemics are inevitable and since we don’t know when or where they will emerge how should healthcare systems prepare? “What we can’t afford to have is lots of empty beds in hospitals doing nothing waiting for a once-in-a-century surge” says Kinross.

Hospitals plan for all kinds of mass casualty events. But as John Mazziotta who runs the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) healthcare system said in a recent podcast planning is easier when these events involve a sudden influx of patients whose numbers then taper off. “This [pandemic] is a mass casualty event that evolves in slow motion in the other direction and keeps getting worse until it peaks and it was harder to plan for” he said.

Several solutions have been proposed. All patient rooms at the Ronald Reagan hospital which was opened on the UCLA campus in 2008 can be converted into intensive care rooms and all of them can be switched to negative pressure which stops airborne germs from escaping the room. Similarly after the Asian epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in 2003 Singapore and Hong Kong adapted their hospitals equipping them and developing protocols so that they could be transformed quickly in the event of an epidemic.

The disadvantage of this approach is that the disease may erupt far from the hospital so an alternative solution is to rapidly build a facility dedicated to the detection and treatment of epidemic patients where it is needed as the Chinese did during Sars completing the Xiaotangshan hospital in Beijing in just seven days. They replicated that feat several times this year building Wuhan’s Huoshenshan hospital in 10 days for example. Made out of prefabricated units Huoshenshan incorporated testing and research labs and accommodation for personnel.

Other countries built fast too in response to Covid-19. Surge hospitals went up all over the US last spring while the UK constructed the temporary Nightingale hospitals. But many of these were underused or not used at all sometimes because they were understaffed. Architect Huang Xiqiu of the China IPPR International Engineering Corporation in Beijing who designed both Xiaotangshan and Huoshenshan hospitals says that the facility alone is not enough: “A systematic approach should be followed.”

That involves conceiving of the temporary hospital as part of a larger city- or area-wide disaster prevention plan organising on-site stores of medical and protective equipment maintaining a roster of available qualified staff and setting up an emergency command centre to oversee the execution of the disaster plan. It helped in China that the state assumed all the costs of the Covid-19 response.

Annmarie Adams a historian of hospital architecture at McGill University in Montreal says that it’s no coincidence the UK’s temporary Covid-19 hospitals are named for nursing pioneer Florence Nightingale. Architecturally they mark a return to the “pavilion plan” favoured in the 19th century when infectious diseases were still the biggest killer globally and ventilation was considered key. The original Nightingale ward had a barracks-like arrangement of bed-window-bed-window embedded usually in plenty of green space. After the advent of antibiotics the pavilion gave way to the “hospital-as-office-tower” model which bundled the specialties together in the name of efficiency and relied on those very antibiotics along with hygiene to keep infection at bay. Not surprisingly this model has proved the least well adapted to a novel viral disease. “We became addicted to antibiotics” says Mann.

If the hospital of the future is a specialist hub digitally embedded in the community those that specialise in infectious disease must also be capable of responding to an epidemic meaning that they must have built-in flexibility. Luca Aldrighi a hospital architect with RMJM Prague in the Czech Republic envisages a pavilion-monoblock hybrid. “In my opinion the future of the hospital is to take the best of these two layouts” he says.

There are different ways of achieving that but one way he could imagine is to have pavilions surrounded by gardens or piazzas and connected underground. In the event of a surge the pavilions could be expanded into the surrounding space through the addition of modular units.

Hospitals don’t just reflect the evolution of medicine Adams says. They are also shaped by wider cultural influences. Hospitals that once looked public resembling prisons and other reform institutions now look more like hotels shopping malls or airports reflecting a more consumerist culture. Nevertheless she agrees that adaptability will be the watchword in the post-Covid-19 world which has learned that it is still vulnerable to infectious disease. As she said recently: “I suspect hospital architects will focus on preparing for the unexpected.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvYnJpZWZpbmcuY29tL2JpdGNvaW4tYmlydGhkYXktc2F0b3NoaS1oaWRkZW4tbWVzc2FnZS1leHBsYWluZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bitcoin's Birthday: Satoshi Nakamoto's Hidden Message Explained,"Key Takeaways Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin in January 2009 during the global financial crisis.

The “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks” message has a much deeper meaning one that still resonates with ardent Bitcoiners years later.

Satoshi’s Symbolic Bitcoin Message

Despite the growing attention Bitcoin has earned since 2009 there’s a lot of mystery surrounding its creator Satoshi Nakamoto.

It’s now the digital currency’s 12th anniversary and their true identity is still unknown. Several candidates have been declared “the one” (or in Craig Wright’s case put themselves forward) though no conclusive answer has materialized.

Whoever Satoshi Nakamoto really was it’s widely believed that they had a disdain for the traditional finance system.

They released the Bitcoin whitepaper on Oct. 31 2008 when the world was going through the global financial crisis. By late 2010 they’d vanished still unwilling to lay claim to the groundbreaking monetary system they’d created.

The trail of messages Satoshi Nakamoto left prior to their sudden disappearance has led many to believe that Bitcoin was a response to the events of 2007-2008. On the message board for the P2P Foundation an organization focused on peer-to-peer technology Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a memorable post introducing Bitcoin in February 2009.

In it they showed their uneasiness at placing trust in fractional reserve banking:

“Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.”

Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin’s Genesis Block on 18:15:05 UTC on Jan. 3 2009. The moment would become a keystone of Bitcoin history.

There were several unique features to the block also known as block 0. The 50 BTC mining reward from the first transaction was made unspendable. Though the reason for this has been a topic of debate among Bitcoiners there’s a good chance that Satoshi Nakamoto had accounted for the anomaly in their plans—this was an expert coder after all.

Whereas new blocks are produced at an average of every 10 minutes it took six days to find the next one on the chain. The reason behind this is also a mystery.

Some have even suggested that there could be a religious link: in the Book of Genesis God created the heavens and earth in six days then took a day of rest.

Notably Satoshi Nakamoto only publicly announced Bitcoin to The Cryptography Mailing List on Jan. 9 the same day the next block on the chain was found.

The Times 03/Jan/2009

But the most famous feature of the block was the message Satoshi Nakamoto left in its coinbase parameter which read as follows:



“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”

The same message appeared in reverse on line #1616 when its hexadecimal string was converted to text:

“sknab rof tuoliab dnoces fo knirb no rollecnahC 9002/naJ/30 semiT ehT.”

This subtle memorandum gave the Genesis Block an immutable timestamp by referring to The Times newspaper’s front page on Jan. 3 2009.

But it likely had another hidden meaning. In the messages they posted online Satoshi Nakamoto made it clear that they weren’t a fan of the financial system so it wouldn’t be a stretch to assume that their reference to the failings of traditional banking was a statement on what Bitcoin was setting out to fight against.

If they really did create Bitcoin in response to the financial crisis they’d be hard-pressed to find a more fitting message to launch with.

Like Bitcoin itself copies of The Times newspaper Satoshi Nakamoto immortalized are now much more valuable than they were in 2009.

That’s because they’re widely sought-after and incredibly rare. A handful has appeared on Bitcoin fan forums over the years though these have been few and far between.

There’s also a dedicated website where a few original copies are listed on sale accompanied by a certificate of authenticity. Prices range from $250000 to over $1 million.

“Value is determined by scarcity” the website says. “There are only 8 verified copies of this newspaper in existence.”

Satoshi Nakamoto would make their final public post on the bitcointalk.org forum in December 2010 their identity still concealed even as Bitcoin began to draw wider interest. Though their deeper motives for creating the digital currency are still fairly opaque to this day The Times reference is one of a few clues that hint at their intentions.

What’s indisputable though is the gravitas of the monetary revolution Satoshi Nakamoto laid the foundations for.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9hcnQtYW5kLWN1bHR1cmUvZm9yLXRoZS1yZWNvcmQtZ2VuLXotaXMtdGFraW5nLXRvLW9yYWwtaGlzdG9yeS9zdG9yeS1odVBURnlnZEFCZjVwdENsdmxKUUhJLmh0bWzSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL2FydC1hbmQtY3VsdHVyZS9mb3ItdGhlLXJlY29yZC1nZW4tei1pcy10YWtpbmctdG8tb3JhbC1oaXN0b3J5L3N0b3J5LWh1UFRGeWdkQUJmNXB0Q2x2bEpRSElfYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For the record: Gen Z is taking to oral history,"To the digital recorder Vincent Stone talked about his father John Stone the army intelligence man.

With the world in a tailspin oral histories have never seemed more urgent. For self-preservation. To add to collective memory. And to make sense of who we were how we got here and where it could all be headed.

“Oral history works on recording presenting and interpreting the voices of those who are often not included in mainstream history. This is about preserving an alternative public history” says Chowdhury who teaches at the Centre for Public History of the Srishti Institute of Art Design and Technology Bengaluru. She is one of the founders of the Oral History Association of India (OHAI) set up in 2013.

In the pandemic a new generation has been logging on. As OHAI moved all its activities online in October its Zoom workshop Starting Your Oral History Project was overbooked. Over 90 people — most of them students — signed up and OHAI had to conduct two workshops instead of one.

This was followed by two public lectures again well attended on Zoom and Facebook. The themes here were how Partition touched the lives of ordinary people conducted by OHAI member and author Saaz Aggarwal and oral histories of the Narmada struggle conducted by current OHAI president Nandini Oza 55 a writer and archivist.

OHAI members include chief archivist of the Godrej Archives Vrunda Pathare; Surajit Sarkar associate professor at the Centre for Community Knowledge Ambedkar University Delhi; and Pramod Kumar Srivastava retired professor of Western history at Lucknow University.

If it seems surprising that Gen Z would be interested in oral histories it might help to think of them as public histories instead. And in that sense it is easy to see why the OHAI mission resonates with a generation committed to recording the everyday in real time — on Instagram Twitter Facebook YouTube.

So is any person willing to tell their story automatically an oral historian? “While personal memoirs and diaries can be a rich historical source these do not fall under oral histories as here an interviewer is absent. In oral history the interviewer or oral historian is an integral and an important part of the process” Oza says.

A core skill for all oral historians to develop is the ability to listen without judgement to probe with the right questions. “For example when someone says ‘my first salary was Rs 100 per month’ ask gently or curiously how much did bread cost in those days or what was the rent for your home. And you might learn that the Rs 100 was a respectable sum back then” says author Saaz Aggarwal 59 who has recorded the oral histories of Sindhis and is an OHAI member.

Author and OHAI member Saaz Aggarwal interviews Ram Advani the renowned late bookseller of Lucknow .

The biggest give-backs of oral historians is that business histories and other institutional histories could be a new social history and throw new light in the making of modern India. At OHAI conferences Pathare who is also secretary OHAI has talked of her independent oral history work at Godrej.

“While corporate oral histories provide insights into responses of employees to changes in policies processes office culture etc. sports also emerges as an essential part of office culture in the 70s and 80s and employees’ participation as a part of ‘the Godrej team’ in various sports tournaments including cricket tournaments such as the Thane Vaibhav Tournament that helped create a sense of belonging” she says.

What are the histories that OHAI hopes young people will record? S Bharat 29 an OHAI member and an archivist at the French Institute of Pondicherry says young historians should find interesting ways of “capturing the contemporary moment”.

“We are at a major point of transition. There is so much social upheaval. There are stories and conversations such as those of the migrants that need to be caught so that they don’t fall through the cracks when we try to tell larger narratives of the nation” he adds.

Bharat a volunteer since July joined OHAI in December. “I joined because I felt it was important for practitioners to come together in a space that can give rise to collaborative work” he says. “Archiving can be lonely work. You can’t just work in isolation.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmdlZWsuY29tLzEyLXllYXJzLXNpbmNlLXRoZS1nZW5lc2lzLWJsb2NrLWEtcmVtaW5kZXItb2Ytd2hhdC1iaXRjb2luLWlzLXJlYWxseS1hYm91dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,12 years after Genesis Block: Reminder What Bitcoin is About,"Happy New Year and Happy 12th Genesis Block anniversary! The Genesis Block timestamps the beginning of the Bitcoin blockchain—and since Bitcoin SV (BSV) is the only blockchain that still maintains Bitcoin’s original protocol it’s BSV’s holiday alone to celebrate.

The Bitcoin Genesis Block is also known as Block #0 and was not “mined” in the way subsequent Bitcoin blocks were. Instead it was constructed by creator Satoshi Nakamoto aka Dr. Craig S. Wright as a reference point and hard coded into the protocol software using a key value pre-computed externally. Bitcoin Block #1 mined six days later using the protocol’s proof-of-work algorithm after Satoshi released the software to the public marks the true “beginning” of Bitcoin as we know it today. You can read more details and trivia on Bitcoin’s birth story here.

Satoshi’s easter egg

We can’t talk about the Bitcoin Genesis Block without mentioning the now-famous “easter egg” Satoshi coded into the original 50 Bitcoin coinbase. It reads:

The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.

If only government bank bailouts were our biggest economic problem in 2021! Dr. Wright has said he included this line as a real-world timestamp to mark Bitcoin’s beginning and also as a call for accountability and transparency. Bitcoin was created on capitalist principles (sadly lacking in today’s economy) with built-in incentives to reflect them. It is neither anti-bank nor anti-government but exists on a global “ledger of truth” that would make their decisions and actions more honest since they’re recorded on the blockchain forever.

On the Genesis Block’s 10th anniversary—in 2019 and less than two months after Bitcoin BSV formally declared its independence—BSV mined a transaction block 103MB in size. This was the first ever Bitcoin block to top 100MB making a mockery of those who claimed for years that the network couldn’t scale.

Restoring the original Bitcoin protocol

Today there are still other blockchains that claim or use the “Bitcoin name.” The best-known are BTC and BCH. However neither of those chains follow the original protocol rules and may even be using Bitcoin’s 12-year long transaction database illegally. BSV is the only true version of Bitcoin still in existence today.

BTC officially separated from the Bitcoin blockchain when its developers introduced SegWit or “segregated witness” that separated digital signatures from the transaction block data. They also decided to keep transaction blocks limited to 1-4MB in size and move all but large payments to separate networks (still in development) outside the blockchain.

These changes not only made BTC transactions unfeasibly expensive but also broke the ability to legally prove Bitcoin ownership and many transactions. That may have been intentional or it may have stemmed from a poor understanding of what Bitcoin was supposed to be. It was never meant for “anonymous” payments and it was never meant to be “digital gold” traded but never moved. Bitcoin was designed to be used for millions of transactions a day and it was designed to be auditable. Without these factors Bitcoin has no place in the world.

BCH avoided SegWit and tiny blocks but it had its own plans to change the protocol. So in November 2018 those wishing to keep only the original rules bid them farewell as well. Thus was Bitcoin Satoshi Vision Bitcoin SV or BSV born. BSV developers restored the Bitcoin protocol software as it was originally released in February 2020 with the public release of “Genesis.” Bitcoin today as BSV has no transaction block limits and can handle transactions for around 1/100 of a U.S. cent. Its data processing capabilities are literally unbounded and the network could one day replace the Internet itself.

With that in mind it’s on to Bitcoin’s proper birthday which happens in six days’ time. As we mark these anniversaries it’s important to reflect on what Bitcoin is supposed to be for and why its original rules matter.

More than three-quarters of the Pittsfield company's employees switched to remote working during the pandemic. PITTSFIELD Mass. — One of Pittsfield's largest employers has been able to maintain successful operations and help its neighbors during the pandemic.

General Dynamics Mission Systems has given back to the community with donations modified its workplace to prevent transmission of the virus preserved their internship program and were even able to expand in these unprecedented times.

""Despite the ongoing pandemic"" Director of Strategic Communications Brenda L. Burdick said. ""General Dynamics Mission Systems' Pittsfield team has adjusted their operations to ensure the safety of Pittsfield employees their families and the community while fulfilling our commitments to our vital U.S. and partner nation customers.""

Since the pandemic began the company has donated $194000 to various food banks and other charities that support communities near their operating locations with more than $85000 donated to organizations in and around Pittsfield.

General Dynamics have also supported medical facilities across several operating locations including Pittsfield donating more than 57000 pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves gowns and face coverings.

About 1250 of Pittsfield's 1600 General Dynamics employees have been working from home since March. To ensure the safety of employees and their families GD has shifted the majority of its more than 12000 employee workforce to work from home.

Manufacturing or classified workspace employees who are not able to work from home are protected from the exposure of COVID-19 by procedures such as restructuring work schedules to reduce the number of employees in the workspace requiring social distancing and mask-wearing in all GD facilities restricting travel to only support mission-critical needs and increased cleaning and sanitation in the workspace.

Burdick noted that despite the new regulations GD has delivered products to their customers in the same timely fashion they did before the pandemic.

""Despite this major shift in how and where we operate General Dynamics Mission Systems has maintained a nearly 100 percent on-time delivery rate"" she said. ""Ensuring our customers receive the capabilities they need to accomplish their vital missions.""

General Dynamics was able to provide internships to 50 Pittsfield professionals by preserving the annual internship program with adjustments made for it to be COVID-19 safe. Interns involved in non-manufacturing processes were provided equipment to work from home and a curriculum was established to ensure that interns have critical interactions with fellow interns and mentors in their programs.

""General Dynamics Mission Systems' internship program is a critical component to recruiting highly sought-after specialized engineers"" Burdick said.

GD's Pittsfield team also opened a new 8400 square-foot state-of-the-art manufacturing space for building the middle fire control system for the nation's new Columbia class and the United Kingdom's Dreadnaught class submarine fleet. The new addition will support about 40 production and test personnel into the next decade as the program's production phase will go through the early 2030s.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9idXp6L3dvbmRlci13ZWFwb24tbWVldC11cy1zcGVjaWFsLW9wZXJhdGlvbnMtcm9hZC1mbHllci0xNzU0MzLSAWVodHRwczovL25hdGlvbmFsaW50ZXJlc3Qub3JnL2Jsb2cvYnV6ei93b25kZXItd2VhcG9uLW1lZXQtdXMtc3BlY2lhbC1vcGVyYXRpb25zLXJvYWQtZmx5ZXItMTc1NDMyP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wonder Weapon: Meet the U.S. Special Operations Off-Road 'Flyer',"The General Dynamics Flyer doesn’t take to the sky but it can go over almost all-terrain on the ground.

Introduced in 2013 the Flyer was developed to fill a need for special operations forces—offering a unique modular Internal Air Transport (IAT) compliant military-grade mission-ready ground vehicle. It was built with speed as well as mobility and maneuverability in mind and it allows operators to access previously denied terrain in the most demanding environments. The tubular lightweight modular base can also offer reconfigurable gun mounts scalable seating and flexible payload. The weapons turret can be mounted with a variety of weapons including small-caliber to 40-millimeter grenade launchers and provide 360-degree coverage for use in light assault operations.

The U.S. military has used rugged off-terrain vehicles since even before World War II but after operations in Afghanistan it was determined that the current generation of vehicles lacked the ability to traverse truly rugged terrain. General Dynamics was among the companies that sought to provide a solution for the U.S. Army’s Ultra Light Combat Vehicle (ULCV) program which has since been re-designated as the Army Ground Mobility Vehicle (AGMV) and Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV).

Spec Ops Off-Road Transport

Developed specifically with special operations forces in mind the Flyer can operate at high speeds including off-road and in all-weather conditions. It can be configured for a variety of missions including reconnaissance communications light strike and personnel rescue and recovery.

In addition to offering a modular platform General Dynamics also created two versions of the vehicle which include the Flyer 60 and the Flyer 72. It is important to note that both are based on the same modular chassis while the commonality between the two-vehicle designs further provides for similar training maintenance and common inventory. In addition sustainment costs have been also been substantially reduced by the extensive use of common components across the platforms.

Flyer 60

The Flyer 60 can tackle rugged terrain but it is small and compact enough that it can be airdropped to the remotest parts of the globe. It was designed specifically to fit within a V-22 Osprey and yet it still maintains a 1:1 ratio of payload to vehicle weapon. The purpose-built military-grade vehicle seats four and can carry payload up to 4100 pounds; it has a cruising range of 425 miles; a top speed of 70 miles per hour and it can negotiate gradients up to sixty percent and has a fording depth of thirty inches.

In addition to the V-22 Osprey the Flyer 60 can also be transported in the CH-53E Super Stallion CH-47D Chinook C-130 Hercules C-5 Galaxy and C-17 Globemaster; or externally transported by a UH-60L Black Hawk.

Flyer 72

The Special Forces Flyer 72 is a supersized variant of the vehicle and it offers flexible crew seating that can be reconfigured for three to nine operators. It has a top speed of 95 miles per hour and has a cruising range of 300 miles at mission profile across rough terrain or 500 miles on flat ground at a traveling speed to 40 miles per hour. It is also fully compliant with C/MH-47 internal/sling transport and C-130 Low Velocity Air Drops.

Both versions of the Flyer platform can be integrated with a robust command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) solution. This can ensure special operates are never out of touch even in most remote locations. In this way General Dynamics has provided a true “Radio Flyer” for the twenty-first century.

American aerospace giant Lockheed Martin is known for fielding some of the most modern aircraft in the world including the Nighthawk Blackbird SR-71 and the F-22 Raptors.

And its most advanced fighter to date F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat single-engine all-weather multirole fighter designed to perform both air superiority and strike missions.

The fighter is incredibly stealthy has advanced avionics and can provide electronic warfare and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.

The fighter which comes with an impressive weapons load will turn more lethal with the integration of the Gatling guns.

The four-barrel 25mm Gatling gun also known as the Gun Airborne Unit or GAU-22/A has been designed for rapid-fire so as to quickly blanket an enemy with gunfire and to destroy targets.

The weapon’s maker General Dynamics said in a statement that it can fire 3300 rounds per minute. It has been under development for a number of years and was successfully test-fired in California back in 2015.

“This milestone was the first in a series of test flights to functionally evaluate the in-flight operation of the F-35A’s internal 25mm gun throughout its employment envelope.” according to a Pentagon statement.

The integration of the gun to the F-35 has been carried out in separate phases with the first phase of test execution consisting of 13 ground gunfire events. According to the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) office this was carried out over a period of three months to verify the integration.

On the other hand the second phase of testing was aimed at the further integration of the gun into the fighter’s airframe during various types of flying conditions.

The integration of the weapon to the F-35 stealth fighter will further enhance its ability to carry out air-to-air attacks and provide close air support to troops on the ground.

According to reports the gun is also set to be integrated with the fighter jet’s software which will enable the pilot to spot and take down targets with the help of his helmet-mounted display.

The F-35 is the most sought-after fighter in the world currently with the demand coming from the Middle East and a host of other nations. It is already in service with nine nations.

The US F-35 is probably the only fighter that has the ability to take on the lethal Russian-made S-400 missile defense systems.

The F-35s and F-22 Raptors are the most capable fighters especially due to their advanced stealth features which enable them to evade detection on enemy radars.

Anything installed on the F-35 needs to be integrated in a manner that the fighters remain stealthy as ever and the integration of the Gatling gun has not made any impact on its stealth configuration.

A statement released by the JSF office said “Three bursts of one 30 rounds and two 60 rounds each were fired from the aircraft’s four-barrel 25-millimeter Gatling gun. In integrating the weapon into the stealthy F 35Aairframe the gun must be kept hidden behind closed doors to reduce its radar cross-section until the trigger is pulled.”

Quila Yancy owner of Tequila's Upscale is in the running for her deep-fried pound cake.

""I guess it was just fate that I ran across the General Mills recipe contest"" said Yancy a sergeant in the Tennessee Army National Guard who opened her food truck this year.

The 14-year military veteran is new to the food truck scene but she's an experienced cook.

""I've been cooking my entire life"" the Smyrna resident said.

Yancy's mother battles sickle cell anemia which causes extreme fatigue and pain.

""My mother was in and out of the hospital so we had to cook. .. My siblings and I were in the kitchen cooking meals. It started from there"" Yancy explained.

Both sides of her family are known for their culinary prowess too and her grandparents had large gardens that provided fresh food for the family.

Over the years she's seen the power of food and how it ""brings people together.""

As an adult Yancy became ""really interested"" in honing her cooking skills. She's been cooking in the military for nine years. Two years ago she enrolled in culinary school at Nashville State Community College and lacks one more year to finish.

But the food truck has allowed her to spread her wings.

""Being on this food truck and looking at people taking a bite of my food and seeing the reactions on their face it's amazing a great feeling"" Yancy said. ""It warms my heart.""

The name of her food truck is a reflection on her culinary expertise: Southern-style foods with a gourmet twist. She's got Philly cheesesteak egg rolls deep-fried deviled eggs jalapeno barbecue lollipop chicken and strawberry cheesecake egg rolls.

""I offer something different. It's upscale on the go"" Yancy said. ""I'm just trying to make my mark.""

Her newest specialty is deep-fried pound cake. The sweet treat is made by balling up pound cake tossing it in batter and deep frying for 2 minutes. Then it's topped with sweetened strawberries and whipped cream.

The recipe caught the attention of the General Mills food service judges and put her in the running for Top 20. She'll know the results in January.

If she makes it into the top 20 she'll get $5000. A photo of her recipe will be posted on the Neighborhood to Nation Facebook page for one week and fans will be encouraged to comment on their favorite National Winning Recipe photo and to follow the entrants' Facebook pages.

The photo that receives the most comments during that weeklong period will be awarded with the “People’s Choice” award and named Grand Prize Winner which includes an additional $5000 for a local food bank in their community and a VIP marketing package for their operation including a menu consult with the General Mills culinary team based in Minneapolis.

Yancy will keep fans updated on when and how to vote in the contest run by General Mills which has a plant in Murfreesboro.

After responding to the scene on Saturday the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement they found the house which was located just north of the Oakland/Southwest Airport “fully engulfed” in flames.

“We have confirmed there are three fatalities at the scene [are] believed to be the occupants and pilot of the plane” the police said in a statement while the local fire department noted that the ""occupants of the house made it out safely.""

Although the police have yet to share the names of the victims the Home Builders Association of Southeastern Michigan released a statement identifying the deceased.

“It is with the deepest sorrow that we let you know of the death of HBA's 2020 President David S. Compo his wife Michelle and their son Dawson this afternoon when their private plane crashed into a home in Lyon Township just a half a mile from the Oakland Southwest Airport which was their destination” the association wrote. “The family had flown to Canton Georgia on December 29 and was returning home today.”

The home impacted by the crash belonged to a family of five according to CNN affiliate WDIV. While the parents and their three children survived the crash their pet cat did not.

A GoFundMe has been set up to help cover the costs of repairing the home.

According to one neighbor after the crash there was “so much smoke” that “you couldn’t even see the house.”

“There was a huge cloud of smoke really tall flames and we thought the whole house was going to be gone” Chase Southwick told WDIV.

Another neighbor shared that a plane crash has “always been my biggest fear” about living in the area. “With the airport being there I knew one of these days one of those planes would have to go down for whatever reason"" they told WXYZ Detriot.

The crash is currently under investigation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJha2luZ2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy81Mjg2Ni1zbGlkZXNob3ctd2hhdHMtbmV3LWZyb20tbW9uZGVsZXota2VsbG9nZy1mcml0by1sYXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Slideshow: What's new from Mondelez Kellogg Frito-Lay,"KANSAS CITY — Food manufacturers are opting for familiarity adding new offerings under their mainstay brands.

Mondelez International Inc. is adding a new Oreo variety to the brand’s permanent lineup: Java Chip. The sandwich cookies feature coffee flavored crème with chocolate chips sandwiched between two chocolate wafers. Each two-cookie serving contains 140 calories less than 1 gram of protein and 13 grams of sugar.

Kellogg Co. expanded its Raisin Bran brand with new Kellogg’s Raisin Bran Toasted Oats and Honey. The cereal features bran flakes and raisins paired with whole grain toasted oats and a touch of honey. Each 1-cup serving contains 190 calories 5 grams of fiber 4 grams of protein and 13 grams of sugar.

“As a classic cereal staple we're always looking to innovate and deliver new experiences to our dedicated Kellogg's Raisin Bran fans” said Erin Storm senior marketing director of Kellogg All Family Cereal. “Just like the original cereal Kellogg's Raisin Bran Toasted Oats and Honey is a heart-healthy option and makes for an irresistible flavor combination — combining our signature bran flakes and juicy raisins with whole grain oats and a hint of honey.”

PepsiCo Inc.’s Frito-Lay business is debuting Cheetos Crunch Pop Mix which combines traditional Cheetos with Cheetos Popcorn. Each 1-cup serving contains 160 calories 1 grams of protein and 1 gram of sugar.

“2020 was a year unlike any other in that we saw the incredibly popular introduction of Cheetos Popcorn in January quickly followed by world-changing events that affected every industry differently” said Rachel Ferdinando senior vice president and chief marketing officer for Frito-Lay North America. “For our brands we saw trends like Cheetos recipe searches skyrocketing 190%. So now we’re thinking with that lens through everything we introduce to the world. Hopefully Cheetos Crunch Pop Mix can provide a small moment of joy and bring a few smiles this year.”

Burmeister Elizabeth ""Betty"" Jane When Betty celebrated her 99th birthday we talked about the bash we'd throw for her 100th. She laughed and said ""I just want to make it through one more Christmas."" She nearly did. Betty died at HCMC from injuries and trauma sustained during CPR after choking on Christmas dinner. Betty was born in Montevideo MN in 1921 to Leroy and Genevieve Wisner. Her father was an exec for the Milwaukee Road and Betty loved trains all of her life. Betty and her sister Marge lived near their first cousin Eleanor Burdick and the three girls grew into extremely formidable women. Marge was a pilot who knew Amelia Earhart. Dr. Eleanor Burdick was one of the first women to graduate from the U of M medical school in the 1930s. And Betty? Have you seen Mad Men? Betty was an executive who shaped national ad campaigns at Campbell Mithun from the 1950s on. She pioneered a system of talent contract negotiations that remain AFTRA and SAG industry standards to this day. She was in the three-martini-lunch where the legendary Hamm's Bear was first illustrated on a cocktail napkin. During those days Betty lived in an apartment across from where Orchestra Hall is today and walked to work on what was then Nicollet Avenue. She was an early ""Mary Tyler Moore"" gal living in Minneapolis. But she didn't start her career there. Before CM Betty worked at the first television station in Sacramento CA. Betty went there because of her daughter Sue who was born in 1945 with Down's Syndrome. During a time when most special needs people were institutionalized Betty wasn't having any of that. She moved to one of the only places in the country that had programs for Down's Syndrome children. Betty took care of Sue the light of her life for almost 70 years much of that as a single mom. Betty married Albert Burmeister in 1961. They settled into a house on Lake Harriet and welcomed son Steve. They brought caregivers for Sue into their lives all of whom became family including Kathleen Plummer whose son Jon became Steve and Sue's big brother; Karen Graham who became their big sister; and Jane Sinclair Duncan Penman aka Scottie the Scottish second matriarch to family and friends alike. Betty retired from CM after 35 years but was still in hot demand. General Mills came calling and later she went to Sound 80 where her biggest client was Target. Incredibly Betty worked well into her late 80s negotiating contracts with superstars like Elton John and Beyonce taking the bus downtown every day from her home on the Lakes. Betty lived at home feisty and sharp as ever because of the loving care of her son Steve. During her last moments Betty was awaiting reunion with those who preceded her in death including her parents Marge Eleanor Sue her beloved Al Scottie and the dogs she loved throughout the years. We know there was one helluva party to welcome her with Al mixing his famous Bloody Marys and grilling New York Strips. Betty is survived by her grieving family including Steve Wendy Webb Jack Webb Jon (Cindy) Plummer Kathleen Plummer Karen Graham best friend Lyda Jeurink and a vast multitude of friends dear neighbors and work comrades. Services will be held in Montevideo in the summer and a gathering in her honor on what would have been Betty's 100th birthday will take place in September.

The Chevrolet store on Plymouth Road that bore his surname was barely making ends meet. It sold about 120 new and used vehicles a month despite its desirable location that could easily deliver double or triple that amount.

So that year General Motors put it on the list of 2400 U.S. dealerships it would terminate under federal bankruptcy protection over the next year.

The showroom was stale the service area needed upgrades. The staff was downtrodden and defeatist recalled Jay Feldman owner of Feldman Automotive Group.

Yet Feldman saw potential in the store and its location. He would end up being the guy to team up with Tennyson to turn it around restoring the dealership's revenue and Kit Tennyson's reputation.

""The best part for me was Kit. In everybody’s eyes he was going out of business"" Feldman said. ""But when he retired he retired as one of the biggest Chevrolet dealers in the country and I thought that was pretty cool. That was cool for his family.”

A May-December friendship

Christopher ""Kit"" Tennyson who lived in Grosse Pointe Farms retired in 2017. He died this past October of ""a brief illness"" at age 73 his obituary said.

His dealership now called Feldman Chevrolet of Livonia is part of Feldman Automotive Group owned by Feldman. It has nine dealerships in Michigan and employs about 800 full-time and part-time employees. Jay Feldman's five Chevrolet stores sell the most Chevrolet vehicles in Michigan GM said.

Feldman Chevrolet of Livonia sells 400 to 500 total cars each month Feldman said. It is in the top 50 best-selling Chevrolet stores in the country a Chevrolet spokesman confirmed. There are about 3000 Chevrolet stores in the United States.

The store's success is a story of a young eager car dealer befriending an older veteran amid one of the most volatile times in the auto industry's history.

Tennyson and Feldman both grew up in the business; their fathers were car dealers. Kit took over the dealership from his father Harry in the 1980s Feldman said. At that time Feldman was still selling cars for his dad Marty and wouldn't become a dealer until the early 1990s. There was a 24-year age gap between Tennyson and Feldman who is just 49.

""But he and I knew each other for a long time being a fellow Chevy dealer since the early 1990s"" Feldman said. ""We were very friendly. We weren’t close friends or anything but we talked on the phone over the years and had been on dealer trips together.""

But their business friendship almost came to an end in 2009.

The unspoken wind down

Feldman is reluctant to talk about what he said was Tennyson getting ""caught up in the GM wind down in 2009. He was not receiving cars from the factory. I don’t know what he did to stay afloat; it probably was not easy.""

Part of Feldman's reticence is the fact that GM doesn't like its dealers to talk about that period when it went through a federally guided bankruptcy and government bailout.

But here's what happened. At the end of 2008 GM was in the red by $30.9 billion. GM's CEO at that time was Rick Wagoner. He led an auto delegation that included Chrysler Group and Ford Motor Co. to Washington seeking government funding to save the industry and keep GM out of bankruptcy.

But ultimately Chrysler and GM needed to restructure under federal bankruptcy protection. On June 1 2009 GM filed for bankruptcy protection and that sent a shiver down thousands of dealers' spines.

A month earlier it was widely reported that GM would cut 1100 of its dealerships in the first wave of the company's restructuring to reduce its dealership count. In total the company planned to eliminate about 2400 of its 5969 stores at that time.

In the end Chrysler terminated 789 dealerships in 2009 about a quarter of its pre-bankruptcy total. GM told about 2600 dealership owners that they would be closed in the fall of 2010 a 40% cut to total dealership count Automotive News reported in 2017.

Chrysler and GM eventually reinstated some dealerships but most of the terminations stuck.

Not ready to go

When GM sent termination letters out Tennyson Chevrolet got one. Livonia's mayor at the time Jack Kirksey lashed out at GM and Chrysler for closing three dealerships along Plymouth Road a strip that was a car dealership corridor.

Besides Tennyson John Rogin Buick and Livonia Chrysler-Jeep owned by the Holiday Automotive Group were to be closed down too.

But in a reversal of fortune in March 2010 GM sent letters to 661 dealers indicating they will be reinstated. One of those was Tennyson Chevrolet.

“This is a tremendous boost to the city we’re overjoyed” Kirksey told Crain's Detroit Business.

Livonia Chrysler-Jeep eventually got reinstated too. But nearby John Rogin Buick is now RightWay Auto Sales a used-car dealership.

Feldman said that Tennyson convinced GM “to give him another shot.”

“He wasn’t totally ready to get out of the business and it’s a great market” Feldman said noting Bill Brown Ford one of the largest in the nation is almost next door. “It is a great town to do business.”

Let's have lunch

In fact the store had caught Feldman’s eye years earlier.

“I knew it could be a lot more successful than it was"" he said. ""It was a good market with a lot of traffic and decent income in Livonia.""

Feldman has a knack for turning struggling stores into a success. In 1992 he became a finance manager at Jay Chevrolet and the store was struggling. His dad wanted to sell it. But Feldman was undeterred. He paid off Motors Holding as part of a year-long plan to get its debt off the books and boost its revenue.

In 1992 Jay Chevrolet's revenues were $25 million. Today Feldman Automotive Group's total revenues are $1.2 billion he said. That includes the dealerships in Ohio that he owns with movie actor Mark Wahlberg.

So in late 2011 Feldman called up Tennyson with a proposal: ""I’d like to talk to you about buying you out or partnering.""

Tennyson declined saying he was not ready to do a deal. Feldman invited him to lunch anyhow at the California Pizza Kitchen at 12 Oaks Mall in Novi.

""We just talked about the business family and what his long-term goals were"" Feldman recalled. ""His three daughters were not in the business so eventually he knew he had to do something ... build a new building and a lot of things he wasn’t really excited about.”

Tennyson assured Feldman he felt they would make a good team and if something changed he would let him know. So the two kept in touch a little here and there and Feldman trusted that ""Kit was that kind of guy to not do anything else without talking to me.""

He was right. In the spring of 2012 the two met for lunch again this time at the Cheesecake Factory in Novi to ""talk about what a deal would look like"" Feldman said.

By the third quarter that year the two signed a five-year partnership.

A brand new dealership

There was a lot to get done to turn things around at the dealership.

First it needed a whole new building because ""the old facility was really really old.""

To do that meant they could not store any cars on the lot while builders constructed a new service lane and showroom. So given that Livonia Chrysler Jeep down the street was still in its termination process and not open for business Feldman leased the parking lot there from the owners and stored the Chevrolet inventory there for a year.

Tennyson and Feldman started construction on the new facility in 2013 building an entirely new showroom and service lane. He declined to disclose the cost but said it was ""a significant amount.""

""We doubled the size of the service department put in new floors and paint"" Feldman said. ""We added 15000 square feet to the building repaved the entire lot put in new landscaping and new lighting.""

It took about 18 months to complete but by then Tennyson had ""the confidence to then see the way we operated our business and he trusted me a lot. I had the energy I was younger than him to push things along and he wasn’t ready to do that again.”

Merging company cultures

One of the more difficult things to do was make the cultural change that was needed to truly get the store's sales going. That means letting go of those employees who were downers.

""We just had to change the culture. We had a good number of people that worked there who had so many years of being the red-headed stepchild in the area and going through the whole wind-down process they didn’t see what I saw"" Feldman said. ""Some of them did — we maintained a lot of the staff — but manager wise there was a general manager who was pretty negative.”

He said some people left on their own when they realized it was not a fit there. The culture Feldman wants is one of ""winning"" and creating a fun work environment that will lead to long-term career-oriented employees mitigating turnover.

""We want to win and keep our staff informed of all the things we’re doing"" Feldman said. ""Before COVID we’d have quarterly lunches at every single store and give prizes recognize birthdays other employees would nominate employees for awards. … It’s a culture of having fun. We work hard we push hard but have a happy atmosphere.""

In 2014 Feldman changed the name on all his stores to Feldman to be consistent and created a brand so Tennyson became Feldman Chevrolet of Livonia.

A first partnership

After Tennyson retired at the end of 2017 Feldman bought out his half of the partnership. The two men stayed in touch.

""We would have dinner together the couples even meet up in Florida together and sometimes the Detroit Athletic Club"" Feldman said. ""Emily his widow I talk to and she is heartbroken because he died way too young. He got ill and it was fast.""

Feldman said he retains a soft spot for Tennyson his first business partner long before he met Wahlberg. Wahlberg and Feldman own a small empire together that includes three GM dealerships and a recreational vehicle store in Ohio five Wahlburgers restaurants in Michigan two in Ohio and two in Georgia and they are investors in F45 Training which specializes in high-intensity group workouts.

For Feldman his partnership with Tennyson remains special. He learned the value of consistent service to customers but the ability to always evolve too ""because the business is always changing.""

General Motors is on a roll and the North American powerhouse plans to supercharge its electrified ambitions by spending upwards of $27 billion to develop thirty new global EVs by 2025. One of these new debuts will be a Chevrolet-branded pickup truck similar in size to the recently-revealed GMC Hummer.

Whilst its name has yet to be confirmed it’s rumored to carry on the Silverado moniker. Our very own Michael Gauthier got the low-down from GM’s recent investor conference which displayed a glimpse of the unrevealed full-size truck behind GM chief EV officer Travis Hester. Keen to see what it looks like? Well let’s shed some light and investigate further before the truck’s official debut.

Aggressive Appearances

While some rivals have embraced a radical approach with their upcoming EV pickups Chevrolet has struck an eye-catching blend of traditional truck mixed with a hint of Corvette DNA. The front facia has body-coloured contouring in place of a conventional grille and a lattice-like lower section with black plastic cladding. A unique lighting arrangement features split-level headlamps: the main beams are positioned low whilst the LED daylight running lamps are mounted high up.

The profile reveals tense sheet metal sculpting with flared fenders and many subtle creases. The deep sills and angled rear pillars are reminiscent of those on the new Hummer EV and unlike the Silverado there is no separation between the bed and the cabin.

Under The Skin

For the interior expect utilitarian practicality quality materials and immersive digital displays for the instrument cluster and infotainment touchscreen. The latter will feature Google’s voice assistant navigation and app ecosystem ditching the current in-car setup found in many other GM vehicles. Super Cruise will help take the stress out of commuting with hands-free driving and automatic lane changing available on compatible roads.

GM’s BT1 800-volt electric vehicle architecture will provide a stiff platform with optimized weight distribution and a low center of gravity. It also forms the basis for future Chevrolet GMC-Hummer and Cadillac electric SUVs and trucks and like the new Hummer an SUV variant will debut at a later date.

‘Ultium’ Performance

GM’s ultra-flexible Ultium EV architecture will offer performance that will leave today’s trucks for dead. If GMC’s Hummer EV3X is anything to go by we could potentially see 800 horsepower/9500 lb-ft of torque three electric motors and all-wheel-drive for a 0 to 60 mph (96 km/h) time in as little as 4 seconds.

Of course those figures would be for a range-topping version; regular models will make do with a single motor/rear-wheel-drive setup or dual-motor/all-wheel-drive and an estimated driving range of 300 miles (~483 km) to a full charge. The high-density battery pack will have 350 DC kW fast-charging capability and future improvements will yield 450 miles (~724 km) of charge.

Electrified Rivals & Reveal

Rivals include the upcoming electric Ford F-150 Tesla Cybertruck Rivian R1T and Lordstown Endurance. Nikola’s Badger EV pickup was also to be a competitor; however General Motors have abandoned their original deal with Nikola and the Badger’s road to reality has evaporated.

GM’s Factory ZERO plant (formerly known as Detroit-Hamtramck) for dedicated EVs will handle production which has now been brought forward by 11 months as part of the company’s zero-emissions strategy. While GM avoided sharing details on the timeline we’re told that production has been moved up from 2025 with an unveiling possibly as early as 2022 so watch this space!

The automotive aftermarket industry is going through interesting times. People are fixing up their old cars to avoid public transport amid the coronavirus crisis resulting in an increased demand for car parts. Even though the car parts industry wasn't safe from uncertainty and losses in 2020 the new year could bring in huge opportunities for long-term investors. Click to skip ahead our discussion and see the 5 best auto-parts stocks to buy for 2021.

Like every industry the automotive aftermarket sector has experienced a bumpy ride in 2020 amid the coronavirus crisis. In the beginning the industry got hammered after vehicle miles traveled (VMT) dropped across the country resulting in a steep decline in auto parts demand. Restricted movement in all states also resulted in less usage of personal vehicles fewer collisions and limited customer spending on new auto parts. Vehicle sales in the U.S. which were already crashing worsened after the COVID-19 outbreak as consumers started to limit their spending. In November new car sales posted a 15% decline. All of this painted a bleak picture for the auto-parts industry.

An Antifragile Industry

But the auto-parts industry is known for its anti-fragility. In the period between 2007 to 2009 when the U.S. economy was in recession and auto sales for new cars plunged 42% the aftermarket experienced just a 1% decline. Analysts now believe that the auto-parts industry is set for a strong rebound and growth in 2021 on the back of several factors.

Firstly a decline in new car sales will buoy demand for auto parts as people drive their old cars and trade used cars. Secondly people are starting to shun public transport and prefer using personal cars to avoid contracting the coronavirus. Stephan Wöllenstein chief executive of Volkswagen Group China said earlier this year that the company is seeing a rise in sales mostly from young buyers who accounted for about 60% of the company’s sales in March. In a survey conducted by the Institute for Transport Research in June and July 50% of respondents said they are using public transport less often or much less often because of health risks. This trend will help the auto-parts industry grow in 2021 and beyond.

McKinsey & Company forecasts that the auto-parts industry will grow at a rate of 3% per annum through 2030. However the industry is expected to go through several key changes in consumer behavior including a shift to e-commerce direct distributions and partnerships. The aftermarket industry growth will touch new highs in Asia according to the report. McKinsey expects automotive aftermarket revenues of approximately €337 billion in North America and approximately €295 billion in Europe in 2030.

Times are changing rapidly. The hedge fund industry’s reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 88 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

Growth Catalysts for Car Parts Stocks in 2021

Several growth catalysts are on the horizon for the auto parts industry. One of them is emerging technologies and the upcoming demand for new injection systems and turbochargers. The rise of hybrid diesel and electric vehicles in the U.S. Europe China and Asia will push auto parts companies to invest in innovation for growth in 2021 and beyond. The auto-parts industry is also transitioning rapidly to ecommerce. According to an estimate ecommerce sales accounted for $16 billion of the total U.S. automotive aftermarket revenue crushing analysts’ forecasts.

Data shows that personal consumption of auto parts reached an all-time high of $50.509 billion in June 2020. With the availability of coronavirus vaccines and traffic coming back to pre-COVID levels globally auto-parts stocks are poised to grow in 2021. The Dow Jones U.S. Auto Parts Index is up over 16% in 2020.

GILD,Gilead Sciences,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2dpbGVhZC1zY2llbmNlcy1vci1iaW9nZW4td2hpY2gtYmlvdGVjaC1zdG9jay1pcy1hLWJldHRlci1waWNrLWZvci0yMDIx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gilead Sciences or Biogen: Which Biotech Stock is a Better Pick for 2021? - TipRanks.com,"An unprecedented pandemic did not stop the US stock market from finishing 2020 on a high note. The S&P 500 ended a highly volatile year at an all time high and overall was up 16.3%. Meanwhile several stocks in the healthcare sector fetched attractive returns for investors. However that list did not include Gilead Sciences and Biogen.

Does Wall Street expect these stocks to recover this year? We used TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool to find out whether analysts see upside potential in Gilead and Biogen and pick the stock offering a better investment opportunity.

Gilead Sciences (GILD)

Gilead Sciences grabbed headlines last year when its antiviral drug remdesivir (sold under the brand name Veklury) was granted emergency use authorization in May by the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for the treatment of COVID-19. In October 2020 remdesivir became the first FDA-approved treatment in the US for COVID-19 patients.

The company generated better-than-anticipated results in 3Q mainly due to remdesivir which generated $873 million in sales and drove a more than 17% rise in overall 3Q revenue to $6.6 billion. Gilead’s 3Q adjusted EPS increased 29% year-over-year to $2.11. (See GILD stock analysis on TipRanks)

However the company trimmed its 2020 revenue forecast to the range of $23 billion-$23.5 billion from the previous outlook of $23 billion-$25 billion and cautioned that remdesivir revenue is subject to significant volatility and uncertainty. Also its hepatitis C virus (HCV) business continues to be under pressure amid the pandemic.

Gilead has a strong HIV portfolio including its lead drug Biktarvy. Sales from HIV products grew 8% to $4.5 billion in 3Q and accounted for 70% of the company’s overall product sales. That said there are concerns about sales of HIV drug Truvada due to loss of exclusivity.

Meanwhile the company is strengthening its business through strategic acquisitions in key growth areas like oncology. Last year Gilead acquired Immunomedics for $21 billion. This acquisition added Trodelvy an FDA-approved metastatic triple-negative breast cancer treatment to Gilead’s portfolio. The company also acquired clinical-stage immuno-oncology company Forty Seven for $4.9 billion in 2020.

Most recently Gilead announced an agreement to acquire German biotech MYR GmbH which is focused on developing therapeutics for the treatment of chronic hepatitis delta virus.

Investors were disappointed when Gilead announced in December that it will not pursue the FDA’s approval for filgotinib as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the US following a meeting with the regulator. The company entered into a new agreement with partner Galapagos under which the latter will assume sole responsibility in Europe for filgotinib where 200 mg and 100 mg doses are approved for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis and in all future indications.

In reaction to this development Oppenheimer analyst Hartaj Singh lowered his price target to $100 from $105. However the analyst reiterated a Buy rating on Gilead as he continues to believe in his thesis of “(1) a dependable remdesivir/other medicines business against SARS-CoV flares (2) a base business (HIV/oncology/HCV) growing low-single digits over the next couple of years (3) operating leverage providing greater earnings growth and (4) a 3-4% dividend yield.”

Currently the rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic with a Moderate Buy analyst consensus based on 10 Buys 12 Holds and 1 Sell. The average price target of $74 suggests an upside potential of 27% from current levels. Shares declined 10.4% in 2020.

Biogen (BIIB)

2020 was a tough year for Biogen which specializes in treatments for neurological disorders. The company faced a setback in November when the FDA’s Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee voted against the effectiveness of aducanumab an investigational antibody for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.

The news led to a major sell-off in Biogen shares as investors saw aducanumab as a potential blockbuster drug for the company. The Advisory Committee’s recommendations are non-binding for consideration by the FDA and the company disclosed that the FDA will continue the review process with a decision on aducanumab’s approval to be made by March 7 2021. (See BIIB stock analysis on TipRanks)

To add to investors’ worries Biogen lost a patent dispute with Mylan in June 2020 for its top-selling multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera which exposes it to competition from Mylan’s generic version. Tecfidera’s revenue fell 15% in 3Q to $953 million reflecting the impact of multiple generic entrants in the US.

Moreover Biogen’s spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza is feeling the impact from Roche’s Evrysdi with sales of the drug declining 10% to $495 million in 3Q. Overall the company’s 3Q revenue fell 6.2% to $3.4 billion and adjusted EPS declined 3.6% to $8.84. Biogen lowered its full-year revenue outlook to $13.2 billion-$13.4 billion from $13.8 billion-$14.2 billion assuming “significant erosion of TECFIDERA” in 4Q.

Biogen has been entering into strategic collaborations to gain access to drugs with promising potential. Recently it announced a $1.5 billion (plus potential milestone payments) deal with Sage Therapeutics to co-develop and sell zuranolone (SAGE-217) for major depressive disorder (MDD) postpartum depression (PPD) and other psychiatric disorders and SAGE-324 for essential tremor and other neurological disorders.

Following the SAGE deal Oppenheimer analyst Jay Olson reiterated a Buy rating on Biogen with a $300 price target. Olson explained “Zuranolone is a potential first-in-class oral therapy for the treatment of MDD and PPD currently in multiple Ph3 studies. Given our view that zuranolone is an active drug and the considerable market opportunity in MDD/PPD we believe the deal provides BIIB some much-needed revenue growth in the mid-term and better positions BIIB regardless of the aducanumab outcome.”

Meanwhile the Street is sidelined on Biogen with a Hold analyst consensus based on 11 Buys 13 Holds and 5 Sells. The average price target stands at $293.74 implying a possible upside of 20% in the months ahead. Biogen shares fell 17.5% last year.

Conclusion

After a rocky 2020 the Street’s sentiment looks better for Gilead than Biogen backed by factors like the company’s HIV portfolio and prospects in oncology. Also unlike Biogen Gilead pays dividends and has a dividend yield of 4.67%.

Examples include Ayvakit (avapritinib Blueprint Medicines Corporation) for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) harboring a platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation (12); Koselugo (selumetinib AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals) the first treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) a genetic disorder of the nervous system causing tumors to grow on nerves (13); Pemazyre (pemigatinib Incyte Corporation) the first treatment approved for adults with certain types of previously treated advanced bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) (14); Tabrecta (capmatinib Novartis) for the treatment of adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread to other parts of the body and whose tumors have mutations that lead to MET exon 14 skipping (15); and Retevmo (selpercatinib Loxo Oncology Inc. a subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company) for the treatment of three types of tumors with alterations of the “rearranged during transfection” gene (16).

FDA also approved Zokinvy (lonafarnib Eiger Biopharmaceuticals) as the first treatment to reduce the risk of death due to Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and for the treatment of certain processing-deficient progeroid laminopathies in patients one year of age and older (11).

Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals both received approvals for first treatments for two metabolic disorders: Dojolvi (triheptanoin) a highly purified synthetic seven-carbon fatty acid triglyceride as a source of calories and fatty acids for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with molecularly confirmed long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (9) and Oxlumo (lumasiran) for the rare genetic disorder primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) (10) respectively. Effort to achieve the latter approval was coordinated by the Oxalosis & Hyperoxaluria Foundation and the Kidney Health Initiative.

Tepezza (teprotumumab-trbw) is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) from Horizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC for the treatment of thyroid eye disease that can potentially spare patients from multiple invasive surgeries (8). It was granted priority review fast track and breakthrough therapy designations and supported in part by the FDA Orphan Products Grants Program.

COVID-19 wasn’t the only disease for which first therapies were approved. In fact many of the drugs granted marketing authorization by FDA in 2020 are first treatments. In May FDA approved the first drug for treatment of severe malaria (7). Amivas’ artesunate for injection was previously only available to patients through FDA’s expanded access program. Artesunate received priority review and orphan drug designation.

One of the most exciting approvals went to Gilead Sciences for its new treatment for patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization (6). Veklury (remdesivir) originally was granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in May 2020. Unlike the EUA the approval does not include pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg. The drug received accelerated approval under FDA’s Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program. Remdesivir was also granted fast track and priority review designations and a material threat medical countermeasure priority review voucher.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic FDA’s approval rate in 2020 remained high. As of Dec. 17 2020 50 new drugs had been approved by the agency’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) (1) surpassing the 48 new drugs approved in all of 2019 (2). An additional 65 first-time generics were granted marketing authorization in 2020 (3). As the year wound to a close six small-molecule and two biologic drug applications had Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) decision dates scheduled before the end of 2020 (4) creating the potential for 58 approvals which would be comparable to 2018 (5).

A few first-in-class drugs too

Three drugs with notable mechanisms of action were approved by FDA in 2020. Rukobia (fostemsavir ViiV Healthcare) is a new type of anti-retroviral medication for adults living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who have tried multiple HIV medications and whose HIV infection cannot be successfully treated with other therapies because of resistance intolerance or safety considerations (17). Rukobia received fast track priority review and breakthrough therapy designations. Winlevi (clascoterone cream 1% Cassiopea) for the treatment of acne in patients 12 years and older is the first acne drug with a new mechanism of action to receive approval in nearly 40 years (18). It operates via a non-antibiotic approach targeting androgen receptors directly in the skin.

Blenrep (belantamab mafodotin-blmf) is a first-in-class anti-B-cell maturation antigen therapy for patients whose disease has progressed despite prior treatment with an immunomodulatory agent proteasome inhibitor and anti-CD38 antibody (19). It is one of five drugs from GlaxoSmithKline approved by FDA in 2020 and one of 10 ADCs receiving agency approval (1). Blenrep comprises a humanized B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugated to the cytotoxic agent auristatin F via a non-cleavable linker. The drug linker technology is licensed from Seattle Genetics; the mAb is produced using POTELLIGENT Technology licensed from BioWa.

Alzheimer’s advance

Tauvid (flortaucipir F18 Avid Radiopharmaceuticals) is the first drug designed to help image tau pathology (20). It is used with positron emission tomography of the brain to estimate the density and distribution of aggregated tau neurofibrillary tangles a primary marker of Alzheimer’s disease.

Another T-cell therapy

In July Kite part of Gilead became the first company with multiple chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy approvals (21). Tecartus (brexucabtagene autoleucel) is the first approved CAR T-cell therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The autologous anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy uses the XLP manufacturing process which includes T-cell enrichment a necessary step in certain B-cell malignancies in which circulating lymphoblasts are a common feature.

Patient-friendly treatments

Several new drugs approved by FDA in 2020 address both the disease in question and patient needs for ease and/or convenience. Vyepti (eptinezumab-jjmr Lundbeck) was approved as the first intravenous preventive treatment for migraine (22). The therapy allows many patients to experience relief within days and then over a period of several months. This ADC binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand and blocks its binding to the receptor. Biohaven Pharma’s Nurtec ODT (rimegepant) is another CGRP receptor antagonist for treatment of migraine but the only one available in a fast-acting orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) (23). According to the company a single oral dose of Nurtec ODT 75 mg can provide fast pain relief and return patients to normal function within one hour with many also experiencing sustained relief for up to 48 hours

Inqovi (decitabine and cedazuridine) tablets from Astex Pharmaceuticals a subsidiary of Otsuka Pharmaceutical is a treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia that can be taken at home (24). Previous intravenous therapies required a visit to a healthcare facility. Evrysdi (risdiplam Genentech) for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy is also an oral therapy and the first for this disease (25).

FDA takes new international approach

International collaboration was emphasized by FDA in 2020. Two drugs were approved as part of Project Orbis an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) that provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners (26). Collaboration among international regulators may allow patients with cancer to receive earlier access to products in other countries where there may be significant delays in regulatory submissions regardless of whether the product has received FDA approval according to the agency. With a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs Project Orbis also facilitates a collaborative review to identify any regulatory divergence across review teams.

The kinase inhibitor Tukysa (tucatinib Seattle Genetics) was approved in combination with chemotherapy (trastuzumab and capecitabine) for the treatment of adult patients with advanced forms of HER2-positive breast cancer that can’t be removed with surgery or has spread to other parts of the body (27). FDA collaborated with the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Health Canada Health Sciences Authority (HSA Singapore) and Swissmedic (SMC Switzerland) on the review—the first time the agency worked with HSA and Swissmedic. Tukysa was also reviewed using the real-time oncology review (RTOR) pilot program to streamline data submission and the assessment aid to facilitate discussions among the regulatory agencies and regulatory review. The drug received priority review breakthrough therapy fast track and orphan drug designations.

Qinlock (ripretinib Deciphera Pharmaceuticals) another kinase inhibitor is the first new drug specifically approved by FDA as a fourth-line treatment for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (28). FDA collaborated with TGA and Health Canada on the review of this application as part of Project Orbis. Qinlock received the same four designations as Tukysa and the RTOR and assessment aid were used for its review.

Finally FDA granted approval to the first treatment for Zaire ebolavirus (Ebola virus) infection in adult and pediatric patients to Inmazeb (atoltivimab maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) a combination of three mAbs from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (29). The data used to evaluate Inmazeb were collected from a clinical trial and through an expanded access program conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) during an Ebola virus outbreak in 2018–2019. FDA stated in its press release about the approval that international collaboration was key to achieving success in the fight against Ebola virus.

The pandemic has led to a surge in online spending speeding up the shift from physical stores by half a decade or so. Forget the chimney; Christmas gifts in 2020 came flying through the letterbox or were dumped on the doorstep. Workers at a handful of firms including Amazon and Walmart have made superhuman efforts to fulfil online orders and their investors have made supernormal profits as Wall Street has bid up their shares on euphoria that Western retailing is at the cutting edge.

Yet as we explain this week (see article) it is in China not the West where the future of e-commerce is being staked out. Its market is far bigger and more creative with tech firms blending e-commerce social media and razzmatazz to become online-shopping emporia for 850m digital consumers. And China is also at the frontier of regulation with the news on December 24th that trustbusters were investigating Alibaba co-founded by Jack Ma China’s most celebrated tycoon and until a few weeks ago its most valuable listed firm. For a century the world’s consumer businesses have looked to America to spot new trends from scannable barcodes on Wrigley’s gum in the 1970s to keeping up with the Kardashians’ consumption habits in the 2010s. Now they should be looking to the East.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL2J1c2luZXNzL3Byb3NwZXIvdWdhbmRhbnMtYXJlLWtpbGxpbmctdGhlLXNoaWxsaW5nLWJ5LWNvbnN1bWluZy10b28tbXVjaC1pbXBvcnRzLTE0OTg3MTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ugandans are killing the Shilling by consuming too much imports,"Why has the Shilling continued to depreciate against the dollar?

The genesis of the Shilling’s trouble is buried in the country’s balance of payments. We consume more imported goods than we export. Basically given that the bulk of the imports are paid for in foreign currency especially dollars the country’s demand for dollars by far exceeds its dollar inflows. Whereas this is situation has been in existence since we started cross border trade it has recently worsened owing to recent developments in the global market/environment.

Previously the country received considerable external donor flows; which flows increased foreign exchange supply into the country cushioning the local currency. With global recession in 2008 many donor nations and funds have cut their budgets to most developing countries consequently cutting off a critical supply of not only aid but foreign supply.

In addition Uganda’s economy had continued to grow extensively registering above 6 per cent annual growth over the recent past with the bulk of the world slowing down. With such growth the demand for imported goods and services (energy fuel) has also increased further widening the balance of payments.

How do you view the supply side of the US dollars visa vie the demand in this country?

The supply of foreign exchange is way below the demand to keep the Shilling from depreciating.

In your own view do you see the Shilling gaining against the US dollar in the near future?

For the Shilling to appreciate the equation has to revert with the supply of dollars growing to march or even exceed the demand for dollars. The country needs to quickly support the expansion of the export sector increasing the supply of dollars into the market in addition to managing the demand for dollars. Hastening the oil production is a sure way of not only internally meeting our petroleum need (which accounts for over 30 per cent of the import need for dollars) reducing on the demand for dollars but will also generate foreign exchange from the sales.

Getting the HEP plants up and running early will spread out the demand for foreign change (as the country still has to pay off the foreign exchange loans that are funding the dams - but this is spread out taking into grace periods) putting into consideration that a significant demand of diesel is to run generators.

Also in the short term the Central Bank has been tightening liquidity to remove any speculative drive that might be holding the dollar rate up. The above interventions will take a will to materialise into foreign exchange.

The strengthening of the Shilling in the short run will be largely as a result of a drop in corporate demand and that will happen at small intervals but given the general weak balance of payments; the Shilling will generally tend to weaken.

How healthy is the central bank’s intervention in the foreign exchange more so on the seal side of the US dollars?

The Central Bank’s role is not to supply US dollars into the foreign exchange market but to control the volatility of the rate. One of their key mandates is to ensure price stability which is a critical ingredient for the economy and business to prosper. Lately the interventions have been on the sell side because the local currency had been weakening very fast. Thus to cut the rate of depreciation the central bank had to intervene on the selling side.

That notwithstanding there is genuine concerns about the sustainability of the interventions on the selling side as this gradually erodes the foreign reserves putting more pressure on the country to improve the balance of payments.

The central bank says there will be no policy reversal meaning that the prices in Uganda’s foreign exchange will continue to be market determined depending on the forces of demand and supply. In your view do you think the central bank is right on this policy?

I agree as stated above the Central Bank policy mandate is to control the volatility but the rate is and should be market determined. It would be extremely difficult for the Central Bank to defend a price level against the market as the annual market demand far exceeds the foreign reserves; which the Central Bank would rely on to defend any level.

What lessons do we learn as a nation from this current crisis of the Shilling’s free fall?

As a nation its evident that being a consuming nation isn’t sustainable and emphasis should be put on transforming/growing into a producing nation. Lesson learnt: like any economic entity; to avoid collapse and bankruptcy (Uganda is far from either) it is important to produce more than one consumes (in economic terms).",,,,,,

Special to The Courier

South Terrebonne baseball player Cameron Trosclair has signed with Loyola of New Orleans after he participated in the Fifth Annual International Power Showcase at Globe Life Field in Arlington Texas home of the Texas Rangers on Nov. 5.

The 6-foot-3 240-pound Trosclair said he will likely play first or third base in college and might even pitch.

Loyola is a four-year NAIA school led by second-year coach Jeremy Kennedy who guided the Wolfpack to a 17-9 record last season.

“Not only is Loyola a very good academic school but the baseball program is moving up with Coach Kennedy” Trosclair said. “He had them going from .500 every year to being nationally ranked in NAIA. Just meeting with the coaches I knew then and there that it was the spot. It’s also in a great part of New Orleans. I am within walking distance of everything I need. It’s a great opportunity and gives kids around this are hope that they can make their name for themselves no matter if you are from Houma Thibodaux Chauvin or Montegut. Just keep playing.”

Trosclair said he enjoyed his time at the showcase in Texas which was held a few days following the World Series there between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Tampa Bay Rays. He placed sixth out of 38 competitors from the class of 2021 in the home run derby and had the third longest ball hit at 478 feet.

“They had pro scout day where they had scouts from 30 teams and they had the home run derby” Trosclair said. “I had a blast. It was a great experience. A couple weeks prior you had the Dodgers and the Rays playing in that same park. It was crazy. We were sitting in the first base dugout and guys like Cody Bellinger could have been sitting right where were the guys getting paid the big bucks.”

South Terrebonne coach Mike Barba said he was proud of Trosclair for picking Loyola.

“I am proud of him for not only reaching the next level in baseball but for the way he prioritized his academics by choosing an institution like Loyola” Barba said. “He has always had a high IQ for the game of baseball. We often talk through game situations allowing our team to think and perform at a higher level than our opponent. His intelligence will give him the opportunity to contribute right away at Loyola but his intelligence in the classroom will give him the opportunity to contribute to society for the rest of his life.”

Barba also said Trosclair signing with Loyola was also a big accomplishment for the Gators program.

“We will continue to grow into a state-wide respected program year in and year out because of the standard Cam and the rest of the seniors have set for the future” Barba said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sLzIwMjEvMDEvMDMvaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtZm9vdGJhbGwtdGV4YXMtc3RhdGV3aWRlLXBsYXlvZmYtc2NoZWR1bGUvNDExODcyOTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,High School Football: Texas Statewide Playoff Scores and Schedule,"Associated Press/Texas Football Magazine

Coach Samples of the Duncanville Panthers had his team focused as they played rival Desoto Eagles. It was more than just a playoff game. The winner has bragging rights in not just the area metroplex but the county as well. These two teams were scheduled to play November 27th but the game was canceled. That just added to the drama and anticipation of Saturday’s fireworks at Globe Life Park.

The defense of the Panthers led by UNLV commit Kevon Ivy and Alabama commit Kendrick Blackshire overpowered the Desoto Eagles. They were able to sack Desoto’s quarterback Samari Collier disrupt his timing of passes and shut down the running attack. The Eagles had seven possessions in the first half and Desoto was only able to score once. Those points happened on a 14-play drive that took just under 4 minutes. It was capped off with Chris Henley scoring on a one-yard run in the endzone. The Panthers were able to go into the half with a 28-7 lead.

SMU commit Roderick Daniels Jr. impressed fans

Duncanville wide out Roderick Daniels Jr. showed his skillset with his speed and power. Each time Daniels touched the ball the fans at Globe Life Field got on their feet to see what he was going to do next. On one play Daniels was able to fight off would be tackles and gain yards as he was finally corralled. Roderick’s final stat line was 8 catches 267 yards and one touchdown. Teammate Chris Hicks Jr. was also able to gain 100 receiving yards along with Lontell Tuner picking up 92 yards and a touchdown as well.

Quarterback Grayson James helps lead his team to victory

Duncanville’s quarterback Grayson James showed his leadership skills as he passed for over 400 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also insured Malachi Medlock was able to see the endzone on the ground twice.

What a run for the Desoto Eagles

It was a hard loss for the Eagles but there is no reason for them to be sad. The fight that the Eagles showed was incredible. Any team might have packed it up but not Coach Mathis and the Desoto Eagles. When the second half started the Eagles were able to outscore the Panthers 28-21. Now for some people they might not see the significance because they see the final score. But when your job is to mentor young men and showing them there are going to be challenges in life but you don’t quit.

Next week the Panthers will play the Southlake Carroll Dragons at Globe Life Park 3pm. The winner will have the opportunity to play in the 6A division 1 championship at AT&T Stadium"

2020 was a wild ride Tesla's stock. It opened on January 2 2020 at $84.90 (adjusted for the stock split) and will close 2020 above $700—that's a gain of over 740%. Here's where five analysts say Tesla shares are headed in 2021.

JPMorgan

JPMorgan analysts rate the stock ""underweight"" with a price target of $90 an 87% drop from current levels.

Tesla stock is ""in our view and by virtually every conventional metric not only overvalued but dramatically so"" a team of JPMorgan analysts led by Ryan Brinkman said earlier in December.

Goldman Sachs

Goldman Sachs has a ""neutral"" rating for Tesla and 12-month price target of $780. On December 2 analysts led by Mark Delaney raised the price target to $780 from $455 telling clients: ""We believe that the shift toward battery electric vehicle (EV) adoption is accelerating and will occur faster than our prior view.""

Wedbush Securities

Wedbush's Dan Ives rates the stock ""neutral"" with a 12-month price target of $715 and a bull case price of $1000.



""Heading into year-end and 2021 we are seeing a major inflection of EV demand globally with our expectations that EV vehicles ramp from ~3% of total auto sales today to 10% by 2025"" Ives said on Dec 29 in a note to clients. ""We believe this demand dynamic will disproportionately benefit the clear EV category leader Tesla over the next few years especially in the key China region which we believe could represent ~40% of its EV deliveries by 2022 given the current brisk pace of sales.""

CFRA Research

Garrett Nelson senior equity analyst at CFRA Research senior equity strategist has a ""hold"" rating on Tesla and a 12-month price target of $750.

""After a YTD run-up of over 700% we think future growth expectations are now appropriately bullish and after a multi-quarter run of positive news we struggle to identify the next catalyst in the story. In early January TSLA will report Q4 vehicle production/sales and we continue to forecast it will fall just shy of TSLA's full year sales goal of 500K units"" Nelson said. "" While TSLA has materially strengthened its balance sheet through recent equity offerings the company's longer-term growth plans will require significant capital and we anticipate TSLA will face some bona fide competition in the EV space from Lucid Rivian and others in 2021.""

RBC Capital Markets

RBC Capital Markets has a $339 price target for Tesla more than a 50% drop from current levels.

""Our $339 price target takes a look at EV/sales- and EV/EBITDA-based multiple approaches and probability weights them (65% base 17.5% each for upside/downside)"" analysts led by Joseph Spak said on Dec 22.

Photo: Rich Hundley III.

Mark Freda will be sworn in as the mayor of Princeton during a public meeting on Zoom Monday Jan. 4 at 5:30 p.m. Freda a lifelong Princeton resident served on the former Princeton Borough Council was the director of emergency services for the borough from 2009 to 2011 and was the chair of Princeton’s consolidation transition task force in 2012 and 2013. A Notre Dame High School graduate he earned his bachelor’s degree in political science and public administration from the College of New Jersey.

Freda 64 worked in corporate real estate and facilities management for more than 25 years. He has served as the global head of facilities and real estate for the Soros Fund Management in New York City worked for Pfizer as the director of New York City site operations and was the vice president for corporate services and real estate for Goldman Sachs. Currently he is the president of the Princeton First Aid and Rescue Squad a paid position and has served as a member of the squad and a volunteer firefighter for more than four decades.

The mayor of Princeton serves a four-year term. Freda takes over from Liz Lempert who did not run for reelection last year. Freda a Democrat ran unopposed for mayor in both the primary and the general election after developing a broad base of support early on last year.

Freda ran on a platform of working to fulfill more of the promises of consolidation make local government more open and transparent tapping into the expertise of staff members and volunteers in the community when it comes to decision making and addressing rising property taxes. He also cited town and gown relations community relations and economic development as top priorities.

We caught up with him in late December for a Q&A now that he is about to officially take office. Following are our questions in bold and his responses.

What is your favorite book? I love to read. My current books on hand to read include Walkable City Rules by Jeff Speck and The First 90 Days by Michael Watkins both great gifts from supporters. I’m also reading Madeline Albright’s book Hell and Other Destinations from the Princeton Public Library’s virtual event earlier this year Barak Obama’s A Promised Land and Revolutionary Princeton 1774-1783 by William Kidder.

What is your favorite movie? I am from the “I go to the movies for entertainment” mold so movies from the James Bond series to American Graffiti to Titanic plus many more.

Who has been the most inspirational person in your life? I like the expression it takes a village. But my inspirations in life are not just from people they are also from a number of defining moments — situations that show what you are made of and are truly learning moments in your life. When I was a child my mother and a great group of older relatives instilled a number of qualities in me that I am still proud of. I’ve worked since the 5th grade and over a number of different jobs I was inspired by a number of my coworkers especially those from my younger days who took the time to point out how actions and decisions can impact your life for years to come. Joining the Princeton Fire Department in 1974 and the Princeton First Aid and Rescue Squad in 1975 and taking on leadership positions in both organizations have been invaluable to my growth and success over the years. For the political part of my life there have been a number of past local area leaders who helped to mold me into what I am today. It has been and will continue to be an ongoing process.

Do you have a particular leader you try to emulate in your work and if so who? Again it takes a village. Being a fan of history I have read a number of works on past presidents generals and other types of leaders I’ve learned a lot from. I have worked with and learned from many former Princeton Borough and Princeton Township mayors and council/committee people as well as a number of former state assembly people and state senators. To me it is all pretty simple. Do the right thing and I think most people can tell when we are or are not doing that. Respect fairness honesty transparency and not playing games — these are all attributes I value and try to emulate. I set fairly high standards for myself; most times I can meet them. I also try to always be open to what I can learn from anyone and everyone I meet. The process continues still.

What do you see as the role of the mayor in Princeton which has a borough form of government? There is the role outlined by state statute. In the borough form of government the role is described as a “weak” mayor. But if I take to heart what I have heard from the council members and what I have heard from many of our residents they all want a mayor who is a leader. Different people provide different types of leadership. My goal is to be a leader who listens but also drives us to decisions. A leader who invites public input but knows when that has been achieved and knows it is time to move on. A leader who encourages and welcomes differing viewpoints and helps to see that all of those are considered before a decision is made. A leader who creates opportunities for cooperation but does not worry about personally getting the credit. A leader who can push for big picture thinking and not let us get too narrowly focused just because that is easier to do. The mayor also needs to be the backbone at times the one to explain why we may not be able to afford to do something or explain why the final decision on some topic was different from what some may have hoped for. The mayor needs to see that the governing body communicates well with residents and staff. The mayor is one of seven elected officials who together form a strong team to help guide Princeton into the future.

How have you been spending the past few months preparing for your new role? On December 15thof 2019 I announced I was running for mayor. From that day on I have been attending many many municipal meetings of all types. I have been putting myself out there for people to talk to and for people to get a sense of who I am through social media and individual meetings and calls. Council members and I have spoken regularly for the last seven months frequently on a weekly basis. Mayor Lempert and I have talked numerous times. In the last few months I have talked to many of the town staff members one on one. I have tried to keep track of all the suggestions and concerns expressed to me over the last year. But to be honest I have paid attention to what has been happening in and around our municipal government for longer than the last year. I do not take the responsibility of the mayor’s position lightly nor do I assume I know all the answers. But I do know I have put significant effort into being as prepared as possible from day one.

What is the most pressing issue you will work to address after you take office?

The most pressing issue I will work on after taking office is developing the working relationship between the council the staff and other entities in and around Princeton. I believe we need this strong foundational relationship between these interacting entities to effectively address a large number of issues facings us. I truly want to start to accomplish items on day one. However I realize that day two three or a little further out will be more realistic. I will take the time to listen observe and learn to better understand what is working well what can be improved and to not assume that my perceptions coming into the position are totally accurate.

What are your top three priorities as mayor for your first year in office? My top three priorities as mayor for my first year in office are to listen learn and act. Listen to the council our staff members and others involved in a large number of challenges and needs that we face in order to learn from the conversations with these parties what are the most pressing and highest impacts issues. We need to act to address these issues as a municipality that prioritizes high customer service active listening when it comes to our constituents public participation and making decisions in a timely manner.

What do you see as challenges in addressing those priorities? Mayor Lempert has been our mayor since we consolidated the borough and the township. As the second mayor since consolidation this will be our first change in this position. Change can cause stress and working through that as quickly as possible is important. There is also COVID-19 and all its many facets including the vaccine rollout the continued safety protocols we need to follow our municipal goals for 2020 that were not achieved due to the pandemic and the impacts of the pandemic on so many aspects of our community from our businesses to the economic security of individual residents. In addition we have a number of housing decisions related to the affordable housing lawsuit recently settled. We also need to complete the harmonizing of the former borough and township ordinances move forward on a new master plan for the town and fine-tune our relationship with Princeton University. I also want to consider how we can work with the school system and the county to best utilize our resident’s tax dollars and control the tax impacts of our budgets on our residents. Currently resident’s tax bills can be broken down as 25% for the town 50% for the school system and 25% for the county. The biggest priority is figuring out what our priorities for 2021 need to be.

What do you see as long-term challenges and opportunities for Princeton as a community?

In addition to what I have already mentioned housing — affordable and for middle-income people — are critical needs. But not just what is being looked at right now also what we need to provide over the next five to ten years. As with most of this list each item is both a challenge and an opportunity. And not just the types of housing; but how much? What is the right density of housing for our community? Where should density happen?

The vitality and growth of our businesses are both important for our community. How do we support them help them survive? How do we promote Princeton as a regional and statewide destination going forward? Why don’t we leverage the significance of our Revolutionary War history and the Battle of Princeton as a magnet?

Concerning civil rights and human services we need to have continued conversations and actions to ensure all our residents are respected and that we as a municipality offer ourselves or through others help to provide the resources that are most needed in our community.

For sustainability how we can increase sustainable practices and initiatives to increase wellbeing for all.

There are also many other items and issues to address. Our priority will be to balance what is needed with what the municipality can realistically achieve and afford. On some fronts we will need to be okay with incremental changes. Our resources are limited and while we will do our best to make advancements on all of these challenges and opportunities we cannot do everything we may be asked for and we cannot be everything to everyone.

Anything else you would want to add?

Our system works best when we all work together. If we all respect each other’s opinions and listen to each other. If we are all willing to be flexible and reasonable. If we all trust that robust public discussion and review of ideas are okay. If we all understand that all input is valuable no matter what is the final outcome of any topic. If we all understand that not agreeing with each other on a specific topic is not a personal affront or attack. If we achieve all of this we will achieve a lot together.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2I2Nzc1MTAwLWVmNDUtNDE3ZC1hMjNhLTg3M2FhMjg2MzkwYtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WFA? It's just the new lexicon of work,"Print this page

Even if you can’t yet move beyond 2020’s ‘‘sleeping at the office” lifestyle a new year at work demands at the very least fresh stationery a bit of optimism and a fancier pair of elasticated trousers (check sort of check check).

And while 2021 will I hope eventually offer the chance to meet colleagues in person in the short term it will just bring more change in the ways people are working often remotely.

Here then is the new lexicon of work words that sum up where we are heading in terms of workplace culture and practices this year. I hope you find it useful — and please tell us what I have missed.

Intentions: Young adults are apparently not making resolutions this year. It’s all about “intentionality” instead. While my daughter correctly guessed my personal intention — after getting to 5k in 2020 I want to run a 10k — the concept also applies to the workplace. After the year we’ve all had let’s be less prescriptive about what counts as success and failure. Resolutions only set us up to fail. In other words don’t worry about setting up that fancy Bullet Journal right now.

Fuzzier “intentions” — such as aiming to take a walk or run every workday at the same time — are often easier to turn into daily practice. James Clear author of Atomic Habits talks about “stacking” new habits on top of existing ones rather than making a big new resolution. So that’s lunchtimes taken care of as I train for the virtual 10k.

WFA: Working from home (WFH) or even “hybrid” work is . . . very 2020. Your new buzzword is WFA or “work from anywhere”. It’s even on the cover of the current Harvard Business Review. Beyond the home/work binary are all sorts of places where work can happen — and soon will.

This “anywhere” might be a café a co-working space or a “hub and spoke” offered by your employer where central office hubs are complemented by local “spokes” in (for example) suburbs where a critical mass of staff live. It even includes a temporary version of “colocation” (another buzzy word) where remote staff — often in the tech and start-up arena — gather together regularly sometimes staying in a big rented house and work together on projects for a few days or more.

Collab: short for collaboration again stolen from Gen Z who use collab to talk about brands and designers making products together. This is my prediction for the biggest workplace trend of 2021. As we continue to be apart from each other and those serendipitous meetings known in the Before Times as “water cooler moments” cannot happen idea generation and co-operation has to be formalised. The bedrock of this for many teams and companies is already in place using collaborative software. Slack has become indispensable to many in 2020: Salesforce just paid a whopping $27.7bn to buy it.

But in 2021 the human side of collaboration seems certain to reassert itself. The random brilliance of corporate life will be replicated in new and imaginative ways. Here’s one: I am in an FT pilot project linking managers in different parts of the business to talk about what we do how we do it and how we can collab better. Being out of our physical space might even help to break down departmental silos and look beyond the next bank of desks for friendship/inspiration/shortcuts to better work.

Asynchronous: This off-putting piece of workplace jargon is actually very useful meaning something that is done when it suits you and your work schedule rather than in real time. (Meetings are “synchronous”).

It’s a word that I first heard early in the pandemic when moderating “future of work” webinars and the best exponent I’ve come across is Jason Fried of Basecamp a longtime champion of remote work. Asynchronous working as a concept and practice looks set to hit the mainstream in 2021 as more managers realise that remote work that replicates the rhythms of the office is often timewasting and draining. So if you are making a new year bid for more freedom and fewer meetings this is the word to deploy.

My biggest hope for 2021 though is that at some point we can stop living in pandemic crisis mode. How will working life change in the After Times? That’s much harder to predict.

Staff Writer

This year marked the end of an era in Hartford as residents had to say a sad goodbye to two beloved friends and longtime community servants.

Dr. James “Jim” Algiers passed away May 28 at the age of 94 and his wife Dorothy joined him December 4. She was 93.

Although the couple had been living in the Milwaukee Catholic Home in Milwaukee since 2017 their spirits remained very much alive and well in Hartford. In just about every major city institution–from the Schauer Arts & Activities Center to the Jack Russell Memorial Library to various medical facilities–their handprints remain.

Married for nearly 69 years the couple leave a legacy that was just as much about family and friends as it was about civic betterment. With five children–Elizabeth (Dr. Jack) Manley Patricia Paul (Therese Roth) Timothy (Sue) and Abigail (Eric Fowler)–and grandchildrenDr. TJ (Rita) Algiers Olivia and Nick Algiers Paul Manley Matthew Manley Browne Hanna and Mitchell Fowler and Christopher and Damian Roth–they put home first.

However community was ultimately just another version of home for the vision-minded pair who constantly busied themselves with bettering their hometown.

“Jim and Dorothy were definitely fixtures here in Hartford” said Shari Purman a friend who served with Dorothy on the Library Board. “They were extremely wonderful people and they had the love of Hartford in their hearts.”

From Eagle Scout to neighborhood doctor…

Born and raised in Hartford Jim attended St. Kilian School and was a 1944 graduate of Hartford Union High School. From a young age Jim worked hard to excel in everything he did. An Eagle Scout track and field star and quarterback for the Orioles he made the adage “Every day is a bonus” his driving force.

Jim served in the Navy and worked at Libby’s Canning Factory before pursuing medicine at Marquette University and graduating in 1953. Jim and Dorothy were married in 1951 and as Jim embarked on his medical pursuits he felt confident in his wife’s ability to “gracefully and masterfully” raise the couple’s children as he often said.

This was especially true during Jim’s demanding residency years. After an internship at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Milwaukee he and Dorothy moved back to Hartford where he practiced general medicine for six years. While beginning his general medicine practice he sensed a change in medicine and undertook a three-year residency in General Internal Medicine at the Milwaukee County General Hospital.

In 1963 Jim finished his residency and returned to Hartford where he founded Parkview Medical Associates. In addition to building the clinic he made it a priority to keep up with emerging trends in medicine and recognized the need to build an emergency room in Hartford.

Hartford resident and former EMT John Spielman knew Jim in a variety of capacities including as his childhood doctor and through his work on the medical frontlines.

“In the 1960s and ‘70s Jim was a doctor to half the community and he was a very good doctor” Speilman said. “Even as time went on he always kept up with the latest research. He stayed sharp and continued to learn.”

Under Jim’s guidance the Hartford Lion’s Club sponsored the first and second Intensive Care Units in Washington County. He served on the Hartford Hospital Foundation the Valley Bank Board of Directors the Hartford Lions Club St. Kilian’s Board and the Hartford Christmas Committee.

He also started a medical lecture series in Hartford in the 1960’s and even as recently as earlier this year he gave an in-depth and insightful interview on the COVID-19 pandemic.

Daughter Abbey Algiers who conducted the interview called her father a “lifelong learner who always wanted to better understand the world around him and hear everyone’s story.”

As a doctor he was in the unique position to see individuals from the entire spectrum of life. From treating the nun who disciplined him during his days at St. Kilian’s to having his former football coach as a patient Jim saw the big picture and he used that to everyone’s advantage.

Daughter Beth Algiers Manley recalls accompanying her dad on house calls when she was in grade school noting that they would go to homes in town and in the countryside.

“He would mention the farms we’d pass and name the family who lived there who they were related to and what their great grandparents died from” she said.

Abbey said it was their father’s unique role in the community that took him from excellent to extraordinary as a doctor.

“My dad had such an interesting perspective having grown up in Hartford and then practicing medicine here” Abbey said. “He knew all the different parts of his patients’ lives and histories and then he put it all together. He also had a psychological effect on his patients a kind of ‘mind over matter’ approach that was very effective.”

Although he achieved what most people would arguably call greatness the small town boy inside Jim is who people best remember. With writing as one of his passions he penned regular “Letters to Louie” which were notes to his childhood friend that served more as reflections on the world around him. As he states on his website “I grew up in a small town where life lessons happened around every corner only we didn’t call them life lessons then we called them life.”

A mother leader and role model…

As she reflected on her life at the age of 90 in an interview with Abbey Dorothy was clear what she considered her biggest contribution to the world.

“My greatest accomplishment was raising five successful wonderful children” she said.

A lifelong Hartford resident like her husband Dorothy attended St. Kilian School and graduated second in her class at HUHS. She excelled in academics played saxophone in the band and was a member of the drill team. Dorothy was employed in a variety of capacities eventually working at Allen Bradley and Western Electric to help put Jim through medical school.

Though her family was her pride and joy Dorothy invested her time energy and generosity into Hartford as well. From volunteering for the Hospital Auxiliary and at church to serving as a founding Board of Trustees member of the Schauer Center she set an example of giving back.

“My mom was always very active and she taught us so many strong values about how to live and how to treat people” said Abbey. “Both of my parents taught us that everyone is important and we need to show respect. When someone was in need we should be there to help. My mom was always doing things for other people even as she got older.”

Perhaps the avid reader’s most notable community achievement is her efforts behind making the Jack Russell Memorial Library a reality.

“Dorothy was very instrumental in identifying the need and getting the ball rolling on the library doing her research and visiting other libraries in the area” said Purman. “She was very future-minded and more than just coming up with ideas she followed through and made them happen.”

All of her hard work and contributions brought Dorothy several recognitions. Even though she was not a Rotarian Dorothy earned the prestigious Paul Harris Award through the Rotary Club and this past October both she and Jim were jointly inducted into the Hartford Union High School Hall of Fame.

In a letter of recommendation for the HUHS honor former Schauer Center Executive Director Tom Robbins sang the praises of the woman he said was among “the first to welcome my family and I to the neighborhood.”

Robbins focused not only on her astounding fundraising efforts for the Center but for her kind spirit describing her as “among the most honest loyal and thoughtful individuals I’ve witnessed over the course of my professional career.”

“She always had a humility and selflessness in approaching her volunteer work quietly expecting the most from those surrounding her while pulling up her sleeves to maximize her own efforts to support the cause” he said. “In short she brought out the best in those surrounding her and fostered community pride and inspiration among her peers.”

Retired but never finished…

Even as Jim stopped practicing medicine and the children left home the Algiers never hit the pause button.

After retiring from his practice in Hartford Jim returned to the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1990 as an Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine a position he held for ten years and later led annual teaching sessions in Physical Diagnosis.

He remained active in Hartford in other ways namely starting the annual Goldbug Golf Outing now with “Algiers” to lead the name. He started this event to raise funds to build the 1022 Club an adult day care center through the Medical Center Foundation of Hartford.

“He was very smart in his design for patients with dementia” said Deb Holtan executive director of the center. “He also named it which is amazing. Think about it: Would you rather take your loved one to a place called ‘adult day care’ or ‘Club 1022’?”

Noting that Jim’s “guidance and leadership allowed us to stay independent” as an entity she said Jim’s enthusiasm for civic improvement was contagious.

“He would tell you about something and you wanted to be a part of it” Holtan said. “His smile warmed everyone’s heart and he had a way of connecting with the community and getting everyone involved.”

Jim also continued to participate actively in the Lions Club fundraising efforts. He also continued to educate the citizens of Hartford on topics in medicine in a series of televised lectures on the local cable channel.

His awards include: the Golden Circle Certificate from the Medical College of Wisconsin for 50 years in medicine the Distinguished Alumni Award by the Medical College of Wisconsin St. Kilian School Distinguished Graduate Award Medical Center Foundation of Hartford President’s Award and a number of Lions Club Awards. He was named a Walter Zeit fellow and he and Dorothy are members of the Campanile Society-Archdiocese of Milwaukee.

Gone but never forgotten…

While the loss of this prolific couple with a deep love of all things Hartford continues to set in their story goes on.

They worked hard but they also played hard enjoying golf fish fries bridge time with friends and family trips.

When asked if she could do anything differently or live anywhere in the world Dorothy said in her interview with Abbey “I don’t know if I’d do anything much different because my life was very happy and pleasant where I was. I thoroughly enjoyed living in Hartford.”

As for the family it’s been a tough year but they have so much to hold onto said Abbey.

“It’s been quite devastating and very difficult” she said of the loss of her parents. “But seeing the outpouring of love and support–from cards to Facebook messages to stories from people–is a testament to the legacy they created here. My parents genuinely loved living here and wanted to give back in any way they could. They made themselves part of the community their whole lives.”

Samuel D. Dobbs 22 is charged in Blackford Circuit Court with child molesting rape sexual misconduct with a minor and dissemination of matter harmful to minors.

He is being held in the Blackford County jail under a $50000 cash bond.

According to a report by Cody Crouse a Hartford City Police Department lieutenant Dobbs on Oct. 25 sexually assaulted a 13-year-old girl near a mulch pile in the 500 block of South Monroe Street.

The girl reported she was attacked after she either tripped or was pushed to the ground by Dobbs who allegedly told her ""You're not going to be able to get away from me.""

Another girl who is 15 years old told police she and Dobbs had sex in her home's garage. The incident is alleged to have taken place on the same evening the other girl was sexually assaulted an affidavit said.

Dobbs is also accused of sending his older accuser and another 15-year-old girl photographs of his genitals.

During a Dec. 12 interview Dobbs told Crouse the allegations against him were false.

""I can definitely tell you that nothing happened between me and those two girls"" the Hartford City man reportedly said.

The molesting count against Dobbs is a Level 1 felony carrying up to 40 years in prison while the rape charge is a Level 3 felony with a maximum 16-year sentence.

Sexual misconduct with a minor is a Level 4 felony which carries up to 12 years of incarceration.

Judge Brian Bade has scheduled Dobbs' trial for April 6.

In 2018 Dobbs — then listed at an address in Arcadia Ohio about 45 miles south of Toledo — was convicted of driving while suspended and possession of marijuana in Henry County.

Dobbs told authorities he moved to Hartford City after meeting his current girlfriend through a dating website.

Jones may have been part of Boston sports lore but he left his mark in Hartford too,"The first time John Gallagher met K.C. Jones Jones walked up to Gallagher then an assistant for the Hartford men’s basketball team and introduced himself.

“He said ‘Hey how you doing? I’m K.C. Jones'” Gallagher now the head coach at Hartford recalled Thursday.

He was still incredulous after all these years.

“First off — everybody knows K.C. Jones” Gallagher said. “If you’re a basketball fan and you grew up in the ’70s you know he’s the greatest winner — him and [Bill] Russell are the greatest winners of all time.

“I said to [then head coach] Dan Leibovitz I said ‘Dan. The guy introduced himself to me like he was the mailman.’ The humility. The grace. The dignity. What we need in our society today is more K.C. Joneses.”

Much has been written about Jones who died on Christmas Day at age 88 and his impact with the Celtics as a player and a coach his 12 NBA titles two NCAA titles and Olympic gold medal.

K.C. Jones has a little fun with Kevin “Opie” Farley left a waiter at Coaches restaurant during a lunch break with Steve Raczynski director of media relations of the New England Blizzard in 1997.

But Jones also spent many years in the Hartford area especially later in his life and had an impact on the sports community here. After he retired from playing with the Celtics he played for the Hartford Capitols a team in the Eastern Professional Basketball League. After his NBA coaching career he coached UConn stars Jen Rizzotti Kara Wolters and Carla Berube for the New England Blizzard of the American Basketball League until the league folded due to bankruptcy in 1998.

A few years later he worked in the University of Hartford athletic department assisting with fundraising and community events and serving as a color commentator for men’s basketball games.

He was a familiar congenial presence at many of Hartford’s athletic functions. People would see him around West Hartford and Bloomfield where he lived playing tennis at the Hartford Tennis Club or golf at Gillette Ridge or Wintonbury Hills in Bloomfield.

Jones’ interactions with Hartford stretch back to the late 1960s. When he was 12 years old Jeff Kagan remembered seeing Jones’ maroon Cadillac with the vanity plate “KCJ” in his neighbor’s driveway. Kagan’s family lived in West Hartford across the street from Robert Yellin one of the Hartford Capitols’ owners.

Kagan’s family had a pool table in their basement and sometimes the Capitols’ players would come over after their Sunday afternoon pre-game meetings.

“I got to meet several members of the team” said Kagan now a doctor who still lives in West Hartford. “K.C. Jones was quite memorable. I was very impressed by his Cadillac with the vanity plate.”

Jones who was on the Capitols’ roster for the 1967-68 season was coaching at Brandeis at the time. Jones’ Celtics teammate Gene Conley and Art Heyman (the first pick of the 1963 NBA draft who played for the Knicks) also played for the Capitols who played in Hartford between 1966-74.

Thirty years later after coaching the Celtics to two NBA titles and being inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame Jones returned to Hartford when the ABL made a play for the retired NBA coach to take over the Blizzard and boost the profile of the league.

He hired Boe Pearman from Maryland as an assistant. She kept in touch with K.C. and his wife Ellen long after their Blizzard days were over.

K.C. Jones coach of the Blizzard gives his assistant Boe Pearman some pointers during the long drive contest at the 1997 Greater Hartford Open golf tournament.

“To this day I credit so much to him all the things I learned from him when we were in the pros and traveling together” said Pearman now the associate athletic director for women’s basketball at Mississippi. “When I saw the ticker [on ESPN about his death] and I saw the 12 NBA championships — you would have never known that about him in talking with him. It was never about him.

“He would always talk about the players he coached whether it was Larry Bird or whoever he would tell stories about the guys. He was a very well-rounded man. He was very talented musically. One time we went to a restaurant and he just sat down at the piano and started playing and singing. He was a great singer.

“I would say ‘Kase is there anything you can’t do?’ and he would just laugh.”

Berube now the women’s basketball coach at Princeton played for the Blizzard for 1 1/2 seasons until the league’s demise.

“Being a die-hard Celtics fan I remember him coaching the Celtics the teams with Larry [Bird] and Kevin [McHale] and [Robert] Parish” Berube said. “Those years were awesome so it was pretty cool to be in his presence and have the honor of being coached by him.

“Everybody knew who K.C. Jones was. It was neat to have him as part of the ABL at that point. He definitely made an impact. We had to play at a high level.”

When the ABL folded Jones was out of a job. He worked with Pearman as an assistant at the University of Rhode Island for a year. The next year he was back working at the University of Hartford.

K.C. Jones worked as the radio color commentator for University of Hartford men’s basketball games in the early 2000s.

“I don’t know how to retire” said Jones then. He was 68.

Jeff Dooley the play-by-play announcer for the Hartford men’s basketball team remembered being on the bus heading to a game watching a Michael Jordan highlight video. Jones was sitting in the front with Leibovitz and Gallagher.

“We’re watching Michael Jordan absolutely torch the Celtics” Dooley said. “Jordan’s got this 60-point game. Dan and John are going ‘K.C what’s going on?’ They’re teasing him.

“They flip to another clip and it gets silent and K.C. goes ‘Hey guys how come they didn’t show the final score?’ and Dan and Gal are like ‘What do you mean? He had 60 points.’

“And K.C goes ‘Just so you know we won the game. We let him get his 60 points but we won.'”

Jordan had 63 points but the Celtics won that day in 1986 135-131 in double overtime clinching the playoff series 3-0 over the Chicago Bulls.

“We had a ton of fun on the air” Dooley said. “I would say ‘If you’re the coach what do you do in this situation?’ He’d say ‘Well I’m giving the ball to Larry Bird and telling everybody else to get out of the way.’

“I’d have to say ‘Unfortunately K.C. the Hawks don’t have Bird today. We’re going to have to go with Joe Zeglinski from deep range.'”

Arline Robbins a University of Hartford athletic academic advisor remembered going on the road with the team and walking around towns in Oklahoma and Arkansas and being amazed at how many people knew Jones and how he reacted to his celebrity.

“The person would engage him and ask him what he was doing and K.C. would always ask them a question about themselves” she said. “Can you imagine anyone doing that today?

“The group of us would go out we would be at a restaurant downtown Boston the Italian district whenever K.C. walked in it would be like ‘Oh my God.’ It was like the president coming in.

Beast Wars! 1995 McDonald’s Toy Document Gives Us a Previously Unseen Look at Early Franchise Development and Several Unused Toy Concepts!



Warm up your transwarp drive and grab some drive-through because we’re heading to the bygone era of 1995 to catch a glimpse at Transformers history! To a time before it was even called…BEAST WARS!



Thanks to Nathan at



In the earliest part of the document several sketches of what would become mainline toys are featured some with preliminary names such as Snapper being referred to as “Buzzsaw” and Scorponok being labeled as “Shockwave”. However the most interesting thing in this section is the design that would become Cheetor being referred to as “Prowl” while utilizing the color scheme reminiscent of the McDonald’s toy that would ultimately see release as “Panther”. It’s often been suspected that the decision to deco the deluxe toy that became Cheetor as a cheetah may have been a decision that occurred after the sculpting phase was complete; it seems it may have originally been intended to be a panther version of G1 Prowl which would explain Cheetor’s very Prowl-like head sculpt.



Also mentioned in the document is the pitch for “Auto-Rollers” as the potential auto-transformation gimmick (another carry-over from G2) including four vehicle mode ones which unfortunately were not included in the document; though Nathan managed to grab an image of the moon buggy Prowl from another auction listing.



Check out the images mirrored below which include concept sketches of toys that saw release some that didn’t like sea turtle and dragonfly versions of Megatron and some that were originally conceived as different characters—like the Predacon Manta Ray who was originally intended to be Optimus Prime! Oh and a concept sketch for a lion Optimus Prime that pre-dates Lio Convoy as well as the evolution of the Under-3 toy from a G1-themed Optimus to the lion head that ultimately saw release! Warm up your transwarp drive and grab some drive-through because we’re heading to the bygone era of 1995 to catch a glimpse at Transformers history! To a time before it was even called…BEAST WARS!Thanks to Nathan at RoboticPlanetToys on Instagram who acquired a McDonald’s Happy Meal toy presentation binder at auction and has given us scans of the Transformers content within. I say “Transformers” because not only do these concept pages use the Generation 2 logo the name “Beast Wars” was seemingly not decided upon yet as it appears nowhere in the document. While we know Hasbro/Kenner initially intended Optimus Primal and Megatron to be the original G1 characters before the show opted to make them new individuals this document reinforces that as this predates the change from “Prime” to “Primal” in the toyline proper. Also noteworthy is this was apparently before the faction name “Maximal” was decided upon as the document states Megatron leads the Predacons while Optimus Prime leads the “Cyberbeasts”.In the earliest part of the document several sketches of what would become mainline toys are featured some with preliminary names such as Snapper being referred to as “Buzzsaw” and Scorponok being labeled as “Shockwave”.

It's nearly the 25 year anniversary for Transformers Beast Wars the Kingdom line has brought the toys back to major retailer shelves the Masterpiece line slowly brings fantastically accurate robot and animal modes to collectors and the recent Japanese Beast Wars Generations book has provides wonderful background information about the development of the line. What better time to reveal previously unseen Beast Wars concepts courtesy of a McDonald's presentation binder! Did you know before they were Maximals lead by Optimus Primal they were known as the Cyberbeasts and Optimus Prime was their leader? Additionally two other alternative McDonald's promotions were being considered the Creature Autorollers and Vehicle Autorollers. Stay tuned for more posts showing off these unreleased concepts that will certainly contain surprises for even then biggest Beast Wars fans.

Also don't worry Littlest Pet Shop fans lots of reveals will be presented after this Beast Wars series.

Starting off this series from the McDonalds concept binder you'll be familiar with the alligator Megatron but might be surprised that no only is the bat Optimus known as Optimus Prime but there was a possible plan for a lion Optimus well before Lio Convoy from the Japanese Beast Wars II series existed. Also notice Scorponok was named Shockwave and Snapper was named Buzzsaw. Lastly the generically named ""Panther' toy at one time had a familiar Transformers name: Prowl.

Only Prowl/Panther' made it to Happy Meals in 1996 Scorponok in 1998 and Optimus & Megatron made appearances on the happy Meal boxes. The other concepts though give a peek at alternative ideas Hasbro/Kenner was considering strongly enough to relay to their licensees. Would ""Shockwave"" been fitting for Scorponok? Trukk not Liun???

The Beast Wars Creature Auto Rollers was an entire concept line that never made it off paper. Check out these cool illustrations of potential toys that would have completely changed the McDonald's Beast Wars Happy Meal promotion.

The last proposed Happy Meal Transformers were not the familiar Beast Wars animals and would have included Prowl Starscream Hound and Rumble as Vehicle Auto Rollers functionally similar to the Creature Auto Rollers. Sadly when I acquired the McDonald's concept binder it only included this description page. The moon buggy Prowl picture was eventually found online but I was unable to reach the owner to recover that page or find out if they have the others.

Here it is the last two pages of the McDonald's Transformers Beast Wars Happy Meal concept binder. The proposed but unreleased Under 3 toy was a very G1 looking Optimus Prime toy. Quite a bit different than the unnamed final product that better aligned with the Beast Wars theme.



... but wait there is more to come! I will have another series of posts from a subsequent iteration of concepts for the same Beast Wars promotion and it gets a lot more colorful too. Stay tuned!

In April 1996 one year after the previous Beast Wars Happy Meal concepts were presented Vehicle Auto Rollers were out and character decisions and toy colors were being refined. Take a look at these pictures of Megatron as a Sea Turtle and Optimus Prime as what would become Predacon Manta Ray. I have no information suggesting if these were original ideas by McDonald's or if Hasbro provided some input.

Who do you think would win in an aquatic robot battle?

Beast Wars Megatron concepts didn't stop with the Sea Turtle shown in my last post! A dragonfly Megatron was also being considered that had some interesting wasp-like coloring. Swipe to see the other pictures of a brilliantly colored Iguanus as well as Panther/Prowl in nearly final colors.

Next up I'll be posting what all these characters would have looked like as Creature Auto Rollers.

Next in this series of McDonald's Beast Wars concepts is the familiar characters from my last post but now as Creature Auto Rollers. Nothing too surprising except some color changes. Unfortunately this is the last that's seen of the Creature Auto Rollers as the fold out toy concept moved on into product. One more post remains in this series and it may be quite a surprise. Stay tuned!

Here it is the last post of the McDonald's Transformers Beast Wars concept series. If you remember way back to the second post of the series I showed line art of Optimus Prime/Primal as a fold out lion toy. Later I showed an alternate Under 3 toy concept of a G1 Optimus Head. Of course that means Under 3 was indeed supposed to Optimus Prime and here is the evidence of that. The robot head on the produced toy certainly resembles Optimus' masked face and crown but the lack an actual name for the toy and the early Optimus lion toy concept are two pieces of the production history that finally identity Under 3.

Instagram user Nathan of RoboticPlanetToys has posted scans of several never-before-seen documents from 1995 for the McDonalds Happy Meal toys of Beast Wars. User Vexwing of The Allspark has written a detailed article providing much information about these scans which reveal many early concepts from the Beast Wars toyline's initial development.I will let Vexwing's words speak for themselves since he has been planning this reveal with Nathan for quite some time:Here are the document scans complete with Nathan's own comments for each:To add my own two cents to all of this the Prowl/Panther concept brings new insight to this early Cheetor concept sketch:This artwork was scanned from the Beast Wars Reborn Golden Disk CD-ROM and when it recently appeared in the Beast Generations book the book's text accompanying it referred to its beast mode as a cougar.Evidently this Prowl concept is the origin of both the Cheetor toy and the McDonalds Panther toy explaining why they both have a very Prowl-like robot head.And now that we know that McDonalds Panther and Manta Ray were originally supposed to have been Prowl and Optimus Prime respectively it is likely that Beetle was supposed to have been Megatron and Rhino was Rhinox."

HSY,Hershey's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMDMvbm9ydGgtb2Frcy1uYXRpdmUtb24tcHJlbWllcmUtb2YtbmV3LWdhbWUtc2hvdy10aGUtaHVzdGxlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,North Oaks native on premiere of new game show 'The Hustler',"When the producers of a new game show asked Bri Hershey if she was good at lying or spotting a liar the North Oaks native had a certain reply: “I’m a high school teacher. I do that every day.”

Not the lying part of course but Hershey says she can tell when one when of her business students at Robbinsdale Cooper High School is being less than truthful.

Not good news for Hershey’s students but the folks at ABC must have liked that answer. Hershey appears in the first episode of “The Hustler” a new evening game show that premieres after “The Bachelor” on Monday Jan. 4. Hosted by Craig Ferguson (“The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson”) it’s a show with a twist. One of the five contestants collaborating to answer trivia questions worth $10000 each already knows the answers. The other contestants not only have to answer trivia they have to figure out which of them is “The Hustler.”

Hershey a Bethel University graduate can’t say how she did on the show which was taped in December 2019. She can’t reveal who “The Hustler” is on her episode — because it might even be her. Contestants don’t know until five minutes before the game starts which of them will have to hustle.

But the 28-year-old teacher can talk about how she got to the show. Part of the reason is that she’s no stranger to being a contestant on a game show. In 2017 Hershey and her cousin aunt brother and mom were on “Family Feud.” And that same cousin Steve Munson won $33000 on “The Price is Right” in 2006.

“We’re kind of a game show family” Hershey said by phone on Monday afternoon. The family always watched a lot of game shows — “Wheel of Fortune” “Price is Right” and — of course — “Family Feud” Hershey says.

According to an agreement Hershey signed after “Family Feud” she couldn’t be on another game show for two years. When that time elapsed she told her family she was going to start applying for other game shows. Nobody believed her when she said she was going to get the family on “Family Feud” she says but this time they didn’t doubt her. “As long as I do the work they’re good with it.”

For about nine months Hershey applied for shows and she had Skype interviews for seven of them including “The Match Game” and “Beat Shazam.” She joined a Facebook group for game show contestant wannabes.

Producers do multiple game shows Hershey says. She didn’t get a spot on “Match Game” but got a call from a producer who had seen her interview and asked whether she’d like to try out for a new game show. After two online auditions she got a call on a Monday in December 2019. On Tuesday Hershey and her mother Diane Hershey were on a plane for Hollywood. The show was taped on Wednesday and they were back home on Thursday. Bri calls it “very quick kind of crazy.”

None of the five contestants knew one another and they were kept isolated in separate rooms — for 4½ hours — before the taping Hershey says. She was told that even if she left for the bathroom to make sure the others couldn’t hear her heels clicking in the hallway. “It felt like a covert operation.”

The person named as “The Hustler” just before the taping “had to pretty much be ready to lie on the spot” Hershey says. During the flight her mother helped her come up with plausible untruths in case she was chosen.

Hershey says her teacher background helped again when the five were collaborating on answers to the trivia questions. She had the group rule out the wrong answers first and use deductive reasoning. Two of the five contestants are eliminated and the remaining three (one of whom is the Hustler) go for the money the team has accumulated in the trivia game. If the Hustler is able to trick the other two he or she gets all the prize money. If the Hustler is revealed the other two contestants split the money.

“The Hustler” set is sort of like a murder mystery room or host Ferguson’s library with bookshelves and big chairs Hershey says. “Nancy Drew mixed with ‘Clue’” adds Hershey who calls Ferguson “hilarious and sarcastic.”

Hershey didn’t sing with Ferguson as she did with “Family Feud” host Steve Harvey in 2017. Mom Diane Hershey sang with Minnesota Opera before she married Jeff Hershey who has an insurance agency in Fridley. Diane who teaches choir at Chippewa Middle School taught her daughter to sing in Italian which came in handy when Bri waitressed at Macaroni Grill and had an internship at Disney World. When “Feud’s” Harvey found out Bri sang at Disney World they did a duet on the game show.

To get the family on “Feud” Bri a 2010 Mounds View High School graduate emailed an audition video and the family was told they were chosen from 3000 emails to be among 600 who auditioned at the Minneapolis Convention Center she says. Thirty families were chosen from that group and a handful went to Hollywood flying out the day before for the taping.

Hershey plans to have a small COVID-safe gathering to watch “The Hustler” on Monday: Family and her boyfriend. She’s already had to warn her boyfriend there could be an awkward moment. Bri had just become engaged to someone else before the taping and — if it doesn’t get edited out — shows off her new ring. (The engagement ended this year Hershey says.)

She’s been asked for tips on getting a spot as a game show contestant and might do a YouTube video. In this case her students might benefit: “I teach marketing to students” Hershey says. “It’s all about marketing yourself.” Related Articles Movies & TV | How the Cat King in ‘Dead Boy Detectives’ captures a familiar queer dynamic

Anyone with a sweet tooth has their favorite candy bar. For some it might be the classic milk chocolate Hershey's. For others it might be the crunchy share-able Kit-Kat or the creamy indulgent Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. Or it could be the cult-favorite Butterfinger. Dubbed one of the top Halloween candies of 2020 according to a recent survey by Premise Butterfinger has long been a favorite among American adults and kids alike. Featuring a crispy peanut butter core covered in a milk chocolate coating it's the perfect balance of sweet yet salty and smooth yet crunchy.

But the Butterfinger you love indulging in today isn't how it's always been (or tasted) according to urban legend. While the recognizable yellow wrapper has been on grocery store shelves for decades the candy bar within has changed a few times over the years — especially during its earlier years.

According to CNN King — who suffers from diabetes and previously had lung cancer and several heart attacks — has been treated at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles for over a week.

The Peabody Award-winning broadcaster was among America’s most prominent interviewers of celebrities presidents and other newsmakers during a half-century career that included 25 years with a nightly show on CNN. King hosted his CNN show “Larry King Live” from 1985 to 2010. He now hosts “Larry King Now” on Ora TV.

King in August announced that two of his adult children had died within weeks of each other. Andy King died of a heart attack in late July at the age of 65. Chaia King 51 died of lung cancer shortly after it was diagnosed. Both children were from King’s marriage to Alene Atkins. They were married in 1961 divorced two years later but remarried in 1967 and divorced again in 1971. He adopted Andy Atkins’ son in 1962.

“Losing them feels so out of order. No parent should have to bury a child” King wrote at the time.

He has three other children from previous and subsequent marriages.

King’s diagnosis comes as the coronavirus spreads rapidly in California.

Los Angeles County the epicenter of the crisis in the state has surpassed 10000 COVID-19 deaths alone. Hospitals in the area are overwhelmed and are struggling to keep up with basics such as oxygen as they treat an unprecedented number of patients with respiratory issues. On Saturday US Army Corps of Engineers crews arrived to update some hospital’s oxygen delivery systems.

While many people spent the pandemic summer hunkered down — safe — watching Netflix and baking loaves of sourdough OU senior Jamelia Reed worked in the electrical department at The Home Depot in her hometown of Houston. She needed the money.

But she also dreamed of writing a book. A friend who had read her poetry encouraged her to pull it all together and publish it.

That's what she did when she wasn't waiting on customers at The Home Depot.

The past year and a half has been rough.

""Changed Mentality"" is a collection of her poetry prose and essays in which Reed a student activist reflects on her life at the University of Oklahoma during that time and how the experiences have forever changed her.

The book was published in November.

""I'm still stunned. Wow. That's my name on it. I actually did that in a pandemic"" she says.

And apparently she did it well.

She had focused on producing a paperback of the 55-page book but it posted No. 1 on Amazon's Kindle e-sales for new Black and African American poetry shortly after it was released on Nov. 20.

""I was deeply surprised. I didn't know that many people read Kindle"" she said.

Inspiration for the book came from Reed's experience as the co-director of BERT the Black Emergency Response Team which was formed in 2019 by students to investigate blackface incidents and other racist activity on the OU campus.

Her work is also inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement and the death of Trayvon Martin.

The book

Reed 21 says that the book's purpose is to encourage people to be better versions of themselves and to create a better environment for future Black students at OU.

""So many times in society we write people off just because of how they look rather than who they actually are as a person"" she said.

""I think there are so many better people (who are) custodians than there are CEOs. There are more people who care about people who are at the bottom of our society than at the top"" Reed said during our interview masked and socially distanced in the Think Tank at OU's student union.

In her book she often uses the everyday and mundane as when she writes about the beauty of black coal sitting patiently in the middle of the earth waiting to be pressed and changed ""into something more valuable.""

She wonders what it would be like to be white and avoids wearing hoodies so she won't appear suspicious to others. She plans her daily routine to avoid ""interference"" with those ""whose hate overruns them that day.""

And she's often angry.

Why should Black people celebrate the Fourth of July? They weren't free then ""when they signed that piece of paper"" and they're not free now she writes.

In one especially moving essay Reed writes about the decision — significant in Black culture — to ""chop"" off all her hair describing the hair she used to have as healthy thick and full with ""long beautiful curls and kinks that rose to the sky like tall harvest as if they were reaching toward the sun.""

Her mother and younger sister waited in the car outside the beautician's shop during her appointment.

When her father finally saw her she writes that according to her mother ""he lost his appetite.""

Journey to OU

Reed is the sort of student that universities dream of having on their campus and OU did recruit her.

She started her freshman year in fall 2017 after arriving from Houston one of the largest and most racially diverse cities in the country where more than 140 languages are spoken.

Houston is not perfect Reed says but people there the various races get along well together.

It was culture shock coming to Norman the size of her old neighborhood. Norman has a population that is more than 70% white and 13.4% Black according to the Census Bureau.

OU's undergraduate enrollment is about 60% white and 4.5% Black according to University Institutional Research and Reporting data from 2019.

Reed graduated from the prestigious and competitive Young Women's College Preparatory Academy a public all-girls magnet school that aims to interest girls from disadvantaged backgrounds in STEM. Her school was only 3% white and the rest divided nearly equally with Black and Hispanic students.

(In 2017 The Washington Post newspaper ranked the school No. 19 in an annual list of the country's 100 most challenging secondary schools.)

There she was active in ""everything"" she says including robotics club and the National Society of Black Engineers in particular. Describing herself as ""always outspoken"" she honed her speaking and critical thinking skills in public policy debate.

On a recruiting visit to the OU campus Reed a first-generation college student says she ""met a few students and really kind of fell in love with OU.""

""They sold us on the cafeteria"" says Reed who — with her gregarious personality — loves food and getting together with people to eat it. But she also was warned by Black alumni about the racism and oppression that still exists at OU.

""But I still felt like I could succeed"" she says and was so excited to get to the campus and begin her freshman year.

But the first semester in particular was difficult because of what she described as numerous ""micro-aggressions.""

In Norman she was stopped several times by police who asked her where she was going and what she was doing. Her white roommate stared at her head at night and was ""put off"" by the satin bonnet she wore while sleeping to protect her hair. One classmate said her brother couldn't come to OU because ""you're here"" blaming affirmative action for her admission and his rejection. Strangers asked her if she was a basketball player.

She missed the multicultural food trucks that were everywhere in Houston.

The trucks represent more than just something to eat; they represent cultural diversity and served as gathering places for Reed and her friends.

On campus she says too many students still sit segregated by race and gender while dining and in class especially in physics and engineering so few students looked like her.

But she never sat in her room feeling sorry for herself. She threw herself into student life joining a sorority (Zeta Phi Beta) and playing rugby.

""One of the things I try to do is to get people to get outside of their own community shells"" she said. Reed whose religious practices include ""dabbling"" in both Catholic and Methodist denominations would visit other cultural and religious events including those of the Hispanic and Muslim communities.

Too few students — and adults — are open to these experiences says Reed who naturally has a bold personality sense of humor and is eager to make new friends.

She switched her major from engineering to African and African American Studies which upset her parents. Telling them about the change of majors is one of the hardest things she's ever had to do she said. Like most parents they worry about her ability to make a living after graduation. An engineering degree seemed like a good way to do it especially for a Black woman.

""Both were disappointed .... but I think they're pretty proud now"" she said.

Activist leader

Until the pandemic canceled in-person events at OU Reed was a familiar face in news conferences discussing racial issues and challenging the status quo as co-director of BERT. Exchanges with university administrators could be tense; she helped lead demonstrations just as her grandfather did at his job in Jim Crow-era Louisiana.

Anyone can be an activist Reed says. And the true activists she believes are those who help those who stand up and give the speeches. Activists are those who make the flyers prepare the food check out the local ordinances so no one will get arrested ... they're as important as those who lead the marches she says.

""Every day you have the influence to do the right thing to be a better person to do what's right in the community. That's what makes me so happy doing what I'm doing"" she said.

But being passionate also can be exhausting and sometimes depressing. She was unprepared for the psychological toll it all took.

Writing has been her therapy a catharsis offering a relief of sorts from the highly charged events of her campus tenure.

Normally she doesn't share what she's written with anybody but during the pandemic summer she shared it with a friend who encouraged her to publish it.

She insisted on using a Black publisher and eventually found Crystell Publications in Edmond a company that helps clients self-publish their work online. If anyone was going to make any money off her book Reed wanted it to be a Black business and those associated with it. She wanted it published soon and didn't want to waste time looking for a traditional publisher so she self-published.

The book is available on Amazon in paperback ($10.99) or Kindle ($4.99).

Because of the pandemic no book signing events are scheduled; those might come later. She hopes to make enough money to help pay off her student loan tuition debt.

With fall graduation a year away there's still so much more to accomplish at OU she says.

If OU really wants to attract more Black students she says it's going to have change policies and practices.

On Dec. 20 Somerset Police Officer Matt Lima responded to a report of two women shoplifting at a Stop & Shop grocery store. The women who had two children with them were being held at the store until police arrived.

Store officials told Lima that the women did not scan all of their items at self-checkout and that numerous items on their receipt were missing according to a police report.

Upon arrival at the store Lima took one of the women aside to ask her about the incident while store employees kept the children occupied.

""The woman I talked to she explained she was working but the mother of the children was not working and had some other family issues going on and that what she had taken was Christmas dinner for the kids"" Lima told local news station WJAR.

After looking at the receipt Lima said it was clear the women were only trying to buy groceries.

""Obviously this family was in need and I can't imagine having to make the decision to go to Stop & Shop and just only pay for what I can afford — or do I go there and try to take things for Christmas dinner for the kids?"" he said.

Instead of charging the women with shoplifting Lima served them with Notice Not To Trespass forms and said he would not be pressing charges. ""The two children with the women reminded me of my kids so I had to help them out"" he said.

Lima proceeded to use his own money to purchase a $250 gift card to a local Stop & Shop location so that the women could buy groceries for their Christmas dinner.

""They were very thankful they were kind of shocked. I'm sure a lot of people in that same situation would be thinking that there was going to be a different outcome and maybe they would be arrested or have to go to court"" he told WJAR.

Somerset Police Chief George McNeil also praised Lima for his honorable actions.

""His actions exemplify what it means to protect and serve the members of our community"" McNeil said in a release. ""When faced with a difficult situation in which a family was trying to provide a meal for their kids he made the generous decision to not press charges and instead ensured that they would have a Christmas dinner they could enjoy.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpbGxhZ2VzLW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMDMvYmpzLXdob2xlc2FsZS1jbHViLXRvLWJyaW5nLW1lbWJlcnMtb25seS1zaG9wcGluZy10by10aGUtdmlsbGFnZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BJ's Wholesale Club to bring members only shopping to The Villages,"BJ’s Wholesale Club will bring members only shopping to The Villages.

Table for One is a column by Eric Kim who loves cooking for himself — and only himself — and seeks to celebrate the beauty of solitude in its many forms.

* * *

""Spam is the ultimate loner food"" said the chef Esther Choi who lives in a one-bedroom by herself in New York City. Working late hours to keep the lights on at all of her restaurants Ms. Yoo and two Mŏkbar locations (with one more on the way) Choi doesn't get to cook meals at home for herself very often. But when she does she turns to the simple things: fried Spam eggs and Hetbahn a single serving of Korean microwavable rice. ""Even though I'm a chef and I can make anything in the world"" she said ""when I'm by myself those are the things I want to eat.""

This is a common fugue for many Asian Americans: Spam eggs and rice. The nostalgic valances that stem from that salty pink block of luncheon meat go way back for some of us not least because it represents a very specific experience: what it was like growing up in America with immigrant parents. Choi remembers for instance only eating Spam when her mom and dad were out for the night usually at work. On such evenings she and her sister were in charge of feeding themselves and their younger brother. Spam was an obvious choice not least because it was so easy to heat: Just slice the block into thin rectangles and sear in a dry pan until crispy on both sides like bacon. (No oil needed. There's plenty of fat in the product itself.)

The thing is you don't need to cook Spam (though it's certainly the best way to eat it). The canned meat is completely shelf-stable thanks to salt sugar and one preservative sodium nitrite. As for the other ingredients contrary to popular belief there really aren't that many more. According to the ""Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America"" Jay Hormel invented Spam (an alleged portmanteau of ""spiced ham"") in 1937 ""as a way to peddle the then-unprofitable pork shoulder.""

Recipe: Spam & Egg Deopbap for One

So there's the pork of course which is ground plus ham and water. And in 2001 potato starch was added to bind the mixture and to prevent the characteristic layer of gelatin that sat on top of the can for decades until then. For years Hormel Foods Corporation has been fighting the maligned reputation that its star product is somehow ""mystery meat"" when really it's just six ingredients plus water. (Spam's latest campaign is ""Don't knock it 'til you've fried it."") As its entry in the ""Oxford Encyclopedia"" states in the very second sentence at that: ""Spam is popular in Hawaii and Guam and among many families in the American heartland but is viewed by many others as the symbol of everything that is wrong with American processed food.""

For Korean-American multidisciplinary artist Jaime Sunwoo whose play ""Specially Processed American Me"" (aka S.P.A.M.) is set to premiere in late 2021 to early 2022 there's a glaring reason why Spam is so synonymous with stigma. ""It's a food that many Americans associate with hardship poverty and army rations"" she said. ""So after the war they just got really sick of eating it. That's why you get sketches like ""Monty Python"" and the word for email you don't want.""

During World War II the United States Army received 150 million pounds of pork luncheon meat or what soldiers jokingly called ""ham that didn't pass its physical"" ""meat loaf without basic training"" and ""the real reason war was hell."" Even as Americans grew tired of eating it Spam sales increased after the war. ""The overwhelming success of Spam is what drove this collective intolerance to it"" Sunwoo said. It's no wonder that the Hormel product is now beloved in places where U.S. soldiers were stationed like Guam Hawaii Japan the Philippines and South Korea.

For Sunwoo ""Specially Processed"" is an opportunity to explore this disjuncture between American and Korean perceptions of Spam what she calls ""one of America's most misunderstood foods."" ""Through this project I learned about my relatives from North Korea for the first time"" she said. ""My dad was born in Pyongyang and my maternal grandmother in Kaesong. Spam kind of gave me permission to collect a more formal oral history. I asked my grandma about her experiences eating Spam during the Korean War. For her it was like mana from the heavens. She was so hungry and to have that was the most delicious thing."" But whenever Sunwoo's grandmother (now 93 years old and residing in Washington State) takes a bite of Spam there's something missing. It doesn't taste as great. ""There are so many other things to eat now"" Grandma Chongyol said. ""So why would I eat Spam?""

Why do people eat Spam? This query alone garners 177 million search results on Google. First of all a lot of easy cooking comes from it. The first dish Sunwoo ever learned to cook was her mother's Spam fried rice confettied with freezer-aisle peas carrots and corn and topped with a fried egg. Second of all it's delicious (if you know you know). When fried in a skillet Spam is a coalescence of salty sweet crispy and chewy. When braised such as in a seething budae jjigae it mellows out and becomes supple kimchi-stained. In musubi it's the ideal counterpoint both in flavor and in texture to the sticky rice and crunchy nori.

For many Asian Americans eating Spam in America — wonderful though it is — can sometimes feel like an othering experience bringing with it all of its complicated cultural associations. The greatest irony might be that the Minnesota-based Hormel product is an American foodstuff born and bred. But when you're 10 you don't have the words yet to explain to your classmates the social and historical nuances of why Spam has a completely different reputation in your parents' home country than it does in the States and that as an Asian American it has the ability to transport you home wherever you are in the world. As Sunwoo said ""The reason we gravitate toward Spam so strongly is because we only eat it at home."" Home food is inherently more intimate more private and thus has more potential to be intricately riddled with secrecy even shame.

When Bettina Makalintal a food and culture writer at VICE moved from the Philippines to Philadelphia at age 5 it took her a while to eat Spam publicly. But in the privacy of her home? ""It always felt like a treat"" she said. ""If my mom wanted to make something that was a little easier a little less labor-intensive it would be: rice eggs and canned meat. These were the times that we had Spam."" For Makalintal the combination made sense: breakfast for dinner. Who wouldn't want that? ""In retrospect I recognize that those were our bare-minimum meals"" she said ""something I ate at home and enjoyed. But in secret. I had a lot of white friends growing up in P.A. and none of them ate it. Or if they did they didn't talk about it. So it was something I privately enjoyed and didn't talk about until I was I don't know 19 or 20. That's when I realized Spam was tied not just to Filipino culture but also to other Asian cultures.""

This discovery of Spam's ubiquity in other Asian-American households including the shared stigma was a turning point for Makalintal. By embracing Spam fully she was able to reclaim not just one of her favorite childhood foods but also parts of her identity. ""I realized at that point in my life what Filipino-American food meant to me i.e. Spam is something I really like so why am I afraid to talk about that? Ever since then I was more publicly appreciative of my Spam eating.""

Similarly for the chef Jenny Dorsey founder of nonprofit think tank Studio ATAO Spam was for years something that made sense to cook and eat in the privacy of her home. ""It was the non-perishable staple in our house"" she said. Her parents would buy whole cartons of Spam on sale at Costco. ""Not only was it cheap and filling but it also had that salty porky flavor we loved. So whenever we weren't able to get fresh pork my mom would substitute it with Spam. She'd use it as the salt in her cooking like in a congee. It was a way to save money and be economical but not feel that you were hard up in any way.""

""Also"" she added ""it's just so good with rice."" The first things Dorsey stocked up on at the genesis of the COVID pandemic in March were Spam and rice. They're still in her pantry all different flavors. ""The regular one is best of course."" With her stash Dorsey makes a lot of rice dishes like Spam fried rice kimchi fried rice with Spam and Spam porridge. There's a reason that rice especially unadulterated steamed white rice is such an ideal partner with the spiced ham product: It's comfortingly bland offering moments of relief from the salty fatty pork. The two were meant for each other. If rice is a balm then Spam is a stalwart providing comfort for Dorsey during a time when she needs it most. ""It feels nourishing"" she said. ""Not just physically nourishing but mentally nourishing as well.""

Chef Lucas Sin who contributed a recipe to ""The Ultimate Spam Cookbook"" (a branded release from Hormel that came out this year) remembers developing a taste for spiced ham as a latchkey kid and realizing its potential as an ingredient to cook with. ""The more time you're left alone as a 12-year-old the more you start developing an awareness of how to prepare these items in a good way"" he said. ""Noodles al dente taken out at just the right moment. A crispy rendered side of Spam. I remember that being a pivotal moment for me when I engaged with food for the first time in a thoughtful way. When I realized that hey you can be thoughtful about how you're cooking for yourself.""

Sin suggests the same for adults: Cut those scallions on the bias. Garnish that plate for yourself. If anything it's even more important that you pay attention to these details when it's just you yourself and Spam. ""My ideal meal"" he said ""on the rare occasion before I started cooking seriously was Nissin Demae Iccho instant noodles from Hong Kong some scrambled eggs and a pan-seared slab of Spam."" The reason it works he said is the high gelatin content not unlike what happens when you smash a burger. While you're melting that gelatin getting as much Maillard as you can the pork crisps up and the salty-sweet flavor of the meat is brought out by that heat. ""It's the perfect product in that way"" he said.

A newfound sense of pride in Spam buoys this younger generation of cooks. For many in the Asian-American diaspora openly loving the canned meat product means openly loving one's culture history and skin as well. There's indelible comfort to be found in knowing that you're not alone in this shared journey toward self-acceptance.

One of the richest aspects of Sunwoo's ""Specially Processed"" workshops is the ""Submit a Story"" feature on her website where participants can hive-mind their own Spam thoughts and recipes and see their experiences live among a sea of others who have gone through similar things especially as children of immigrants. In many ways Spam is what the food critic Soleil Ho defines as assimilation food or ""food that's made to close the gap between homes: a critical need when one lives in exile.""

As Choi told me at the start of my reporting as we both headed into what would become the longest exile of our lives: Spam is the ultimate loner food.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Bethesda Maryland-based hotel real estate investment trust said in a news release that the price represents a 12.6-times earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or a capitalization rate of approximately 7.4% on the property's estimated 2024 results.

The sellers of the properties were Starwood Capital Group Crescent Real Estate and High Street Real Estate Partners.

Risoleo also cited the popularity of Nashville as a leisure destination and its No. 2 ranking as a convention destination in the U.S.

""With meaningful in-place cash flow multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements we expect the property will generate outsize growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders"" he said.

Together the two hotels have a combined key count of 721 rooms with average size of approximately 500 square feet with a 75% suite mix.

Updated 1:15 p.m. Eastern Standard Time 17 December 2013 with deal confirmation and comments from Sean Hennessey of Lodging Advisors.



NEW YORK—After leasing the hotel since it was constructed in 1982 Host Hotels & Resorts has purchased the New York Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square for $19.9 million.



Host had been leasing the property from Empire State Development until 10 December when it exercised its option to buy according to a spokesperson for Empire State Development who confirmed the sale but declined additional comment.



“I think it’s a great deal for everyone” said Michael H. Sonnabend managing member of the Hotel Finance Group at PMZ Realty Capital a New York-based real estate investment firm which was not part of the deal. “The seller got a great price for their asset and the buyer got one of the most visible and consistent assets in NYC.”



Sonnabend noted that Empire State Development sold the retail portion of the property earlier this year.



At the time of the building’s construction New York was attempting to redevelop Times Square considered a risky location to travel and invest. Therefore the government provided several tax breaks and other incentives to encourage development.



Empire State Development signed a 75-year lease with Marriott Corporation in 1982 that provided many of those incentives reports show one of which was the option to buy the land for “fair market value” after paying all deferred rent and repaying a low-interest federal loan.



Marriott later split its operations into two separate companies forming Host Marriott Corporation in 1993. This ownership arm later became Host Hotels & Resorts as it began diversifying its assets.



A Host spokesperson declined to comment on the Marriott Marquis transaction.



In 1998 Marriott and the city revised the terms of its lease so it could comply with requirements for forming a real estate investment trust which became Host Hotels & Resorts.



In February New York comptroller John C. Liu conducted an audit on the Marquis valuing it at $193 million. At the time he told The New York Daily News that the contract amendment including an option for Host to purchase the property for a fixed $19.9 million was “one of the worst deals since Manhattan was sold for $24.”



“From what I have been able to glean it appears the property was having difficulties at some point back then (in 1998)” said Sean Hennessey founder and CEO of Lodging Advisors a New York-based consulting firm. “There’s no reason to believe or indicate that it was anything other than an arm’s length deal at the time.”



John A. Fox senior VP at PKF Consulting USA said Host should be able to reap the benefits of what at the time was considered a highly risky investment.



“It’s great to sit here in hindsight and say ‘That was such a bargain deal that shouldn’t have been made’” Fox said. “But if you look back to where things were when that hotel was conceived a lot of people were questioning whether it should’ve been done. Let’s not forget (Marriott) put in the money to build the building.



“Even well after the hotel opened the area was still pretty seedy” Fox continued. “But (the Marquis) was the lynchpin to revitalization.”



Hennessey said the growth of New York’s east side can be attributed to the redevelopment of Times Square. Today the city government is mulling development incentives to build up certain parts of the east side.



“Not only were they (Marriott) taking a chance building a 1900-room hotel but they were building a property with a huge amount of meeting space” Hennessey said. “It was a major major commitment to the area. A 400-room Hilton or Hyatt wouldn’t have had the same impact.”



Fox acknowledged that a deal between the city and Host “could have been structured differently” to include a buyout option that centered more on fair market value but to cast judgment on that “is total hindsight.”



The Marquis has more than 1900 rooms a ballroom exhibition and meeting space shops and a theater.



“It’s an iconic hotel that should do well no matter the market conditions” Sonnabend said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9maW5hbmNlL25ld3MvaG9zdC1ob3RlbHMtaHN0LWFjcXVpcmVzLWFsaWRhLTE5MzUwNzkwNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Host Hotels (HST) Acquires The Alida Hotel for $103 Million,"Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. HST has acquired a fee simple interest in The Alida Savannah for approximately $103 million in cash. The 173-room boutique hotel was opened in October 2018 and continues to benefit from soft branding in Marriott’s Tribute Portfolio.

Host Hotels expects stabilization for The Alida in 2024-2025 with roughly 11-12x earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and expects it to deliver roughly $240 of revenue per available room (RevPAR). The stabilized EBITDA for the property is in line with Host Hotels’ estimate of normalized 2019 operations and adjusts for construction disruption to the surrounding Plant Riverside District and the initial ramp-up of the hotel operations.

The property is situated in Savannah’s historic district and is adjacent to a newly developed entertainment district which includes the Plant Riverside District. Savannah is a drive-to leisure destination for fast-growing markets in the Southeast and enjoys increasing number of travelers through the Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport. Hence with the resumption of travel and recovery in leisure demand the acquired hotel is likely to attract leisure travelers.

The hotel offers 11570 square feet of meeting space four F&B outlets with a rooftop bar an outdoor pool and a street-front retail space. Besides the property will provide a $271-million convention center expansion to be completed in 2024. This will enable the property to attract in-house and out-of-house group demand and offers scope for higher group and business bookings.

In addition Host Hotels is making efforts to enhance its portfolio quality through dispositions of non-strategic properties. It sold leasehold interest in the 305-room W Hollywood for a total sales price of roughly $197 million which includes $3 million for the furniture fixtures & equipment replacement funds. The sale price reflects a 25.0x EBITDA multiple on 2019 EBITDA consisting nearly $33 million of estimated foregone capital expenditures over the next five years.

Per management “We continue to be very active on the capital allocation front as we target new markets. Year to date we have invested $1.3 billion in early-cycle acquisitions. The blended EBITDA multiple on our six hotel acquisitions in 2021 is 12.9X which compares favorably to the nearly $750 million generated from our six hotel dispositions at a 16.0X EBITDA multiple including foregone capital expenditures.”

As it turned out nothing in 2020 was going to be easy. So for its tenth “World’s Greatest Drag Race” Motor Trend is changing the format a bit.

Instead of featuring 12 cars racing side-by-side this year there are only eight cars and they’ll be facing off one at a time in an elimination-style bracket.

The cars are the Ram 1500 TRX Porsche Cayenne Turbo Coupe Lamborghini Huracan EVO AWD Porsche 911 Turbo S Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Z51 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 Acura NSX and Ferrari F8 Tributo.

In the first heat the Motor Trend crew tries to keep like with like as much as possible. There are still a few surprises along the way though. We won’t spoil any results but horsepower figures don’t tell you as much about performance as you might think.

In fact one of the most evenly matched races horsepower-wise is the Porsche 911 Turbo S vs the Lamborghini Huracan EVO AWD. With just 10 hp separating the two cars you’d have expected this one to be one of the most hotly contested in the field.

It turns out to very much not be though with the drivers estimating a 10-car gap by the end of the race. All of which goes to show you that although power is good weight and more specifically how that weight is distributed matter a whole lot too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy8xMzAwLWhwLWRvZGdlLWNoYWxsZW5nZXItc3J0LWhlbGxjYXQtaXMtYS03MDAwMC1zdGVhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1300-HP Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Is A $70000 Steal,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy8xMzAwLWhwLWRvZGdlLWNoYWxsZW5nZXItc3J0LWhlbGxjYXQtaXMtYS03MDAwMC1zdGVhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

But typewriter repairman Steve Munoz says the typewriter is making a comeback.

“They’re finding them in the attic in their garage their grandmothers’ their grandfathers’ and they refurbish them. They like the sound” said Munoz as he punches keys on an old Remington manual typewriter.

Munoz is the owner of Duncan Munoz Office Machines in Austin. He was just 20 when he started as a typewriter “delivery boy” a job he got through his brother.

“Back in the day if a technician couldn’t fix a machine at the location they’d say 'we’re going to have somebody come pick it up'. That was me” recalled Munoz.

Forty-three years later Munoz is still repairing typewriters. He’s the only one left in the game in Central Texas after two other competitors got out of the business. One had health problems that forced him to retire and the other worked for a company that switched its focus solely to computers.

He’s also the only one who still carries typewriter ink and correction ribbons after big-box office supply stores stopped offering them. It’s brought an onslaught of business which he says is good but sometimes daunting.

“I’ve been able to manage but I could always use a hand” said Munoz. “But there’s nobody out there.”

There is nobody out there to learn the intricacies of each machine according to Munoz. He says he’s reached out to local high schools in the hopes of recruiting an apprentice but he admits there’s a lot involved. He holds several training certificates from companies like Brother IBM Adler and Royal.

Munoz specializes in the IBM Selectric an electric typewriter that was manufactured in Austin. The heavy piece of equipment was a mainstay in offices across the country.

“I think it was the ‘80s they informed us that the typewriters particularly these IBM Selectrics will be obsolete in 10 years” chuckled Munoz.

The typewriter never went away though. Many of Munoz’s customers are older regulars some who never transitioned to the computer. Even as many of the older customers retire those that have taken their place only know how to do their work on the typewriter.

Professionals like lawyers doctors certified public accountants make up a lot of Munoz’s clientele. Munoz says many have held onto the IBM Selectric and are starting to reinvest in the old technology in order to make sure their confidential documents stay confidential.

“You can’t hack anything that’s on a typewriter” said Munoz. “You type it make copies and then shred it and that’s it.”

Munoz has drawers full of hundreds of parts for the Selectric some of which he can still get from a supplier in Dallas. But Munoz says it’s the manual typewriter that’s truly gaining popularity as of recent especially with more creative types.

“The writer just loves the sound and the feel” said Munoz. “He gets more out of it than just on a computer.”

Never mind a typewriter can’t crash and lose your work; it also doesn’t have the distractions of the internet. But parts for manual typewriters are obsolete.

“You can’t get parts for them they may not even work” said Munoz.

Munoz says the ones that don’t work just end up as conversation pieces on display in a home or office.

He has a “graveyard” of junked typewriters he uses for common spare parts in an attempt to save the manual typewriters he can. At one point he had accumulated over 500 typewriters taking up the space next to his unassuming repair shop but Munoz said it wasn’t worth it to pay rent just for storage. He stripped the majority of them maintaining a collection of about 40-50 machines.

There was never a point where Munoz thought his business would end up in the “grave yard” though; Munoz diversified his services. He repairs cash registers printers and copying machines. He says up until a few years ago 75% of his business was focused on the printers and cash registers. Now Munoz says his focus is back on the typewriter making up nearly 65% of service calls and repairs he’s making today.

That’s a good case right here” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vaGFja2Vybm9vbi5jb20vYW4taW50cm9kdWN0b3J5LWd1aWRlLXRvLWhhY2tpbmctbmV0Ymlvcy1icTJ3MzRhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An Introductory Guide to Hacking NETBIOS,"Too Long; Didn't Read

Today the tiny transistors in your smartwatch are capable of more advanced computing than scientists of the 1930s could’ve ever dreamed. Now computational science is on the verge of another revolution: quantum computers.

Quantum computers have long been the holy grail of computer science — these machines in theory would be capable of outperforming any classical computer. While we won’t be popping down to the local Best Buy to purchase our own quantum computers anytime soon advances in this technology are becoming more realistic everyday. Companies like Google and IBM are muscling for quantum supremacy and startups in Silicon Valley are already pumping out quantum algorithms by the thousands.

Science of Quantum Computing

At the center of quantum computing is strange and counterintuitive quantum physics itself which was discovered in the 1930s.

Classical physics the kind that describes how apples fall from trees relies on exact measurable qualities to make calculations. For example the height of an apple tree branch and the weight of the apple. But quantum physics refuses to provide these kinds of qualities. Instead quantum physical properties are measured by probabilities and measurements of uncertainty. Usually this would be a pain. But when it comes to eking out more computing power it can actually come in handy.

Traditional computing measures information in bits that can either represent 0 or 1 and can be combined to create every display and click of your computer. But quantum computing even these binary bits of information aren’t so certain. A quantum bit known as a qubit can represent 0 1 or a state that exists between both. This is known in physics as a superposition.

Taking advantage of this quantum quirk a computation or software execution that would’ve taken several strings of binary bits can now be done using a single qubit. String multiple qubits together and the computational possibilities start to skyrocket.

Why It Matters

Once out of its awkward adolescence these machines will be particularly good at computations like factoring searching and modeling and be able to do so at speeds far faster than any classical computer.

These features won’t necessarily be used to speed up your Google search but they will help scientists make breakthroughs in fields like chemistry and pharmacology. Using quantum-speed chemical modeling it may be possible to develop vaccine candidates in a number of days instead of years.

Quantum information processing will also change how our world is run. Experts believe that quantum computers will be able to easily crack open existing cryptography systems exposing some of the world’s most sensitive encrypted information. To future proof these systems scientists are already looking to develop quantum encryption that will take advantage of quantum characteristics to be impenetrable. Just as a spy might pop a cyanide pill rather than tell you government secrets information encrypted by qubits will disappear as soon as someone attempts to tamper with it.

The Efforts

When it comes to actually designing a quantum computer increasing your number of qubits is the name of the game. In recent years IBM and Google have risen to the top of the pack with their supercooled superconducting qubits. These qubits experience no electrical resistance (which is a property of superconducting materials) and because they’re manufactured instead of naturally collected (such is the case for trapped ion qubits) they can be more easily controlled.

The secret weapons behind quantum computing are notoriously unstable.

IBM’s computer is currently capable of operating 65 qubits and Google’s of operating at 53 which makes them capable of solving thorny calculations in a matter of minutes that would take a classical computer 10000 years. This milestone which Google’s Sycamore computer reached in 2019 is called “quantum supremacy.”

Both companies have already announced plans to build 1000 qubit computers in the coming decades which could bring these already fast minutes-long calculations down to only fractions of a second. But even then you’re more likely to find these computers crunching large data at a server farm than juggling your internet tabs.

The Challenges

But part of what makes actually building a quantum computer like this difficult is that qubits the secret weapon behind these calculations are notoriously unstable. To make calculations researchers have to hold these qubits very precariously in certain energy states but vibration from highways or even ambient room temperature can be enough disturbance to send these qubits into a tizzy. Scientists call this “decoherence.”

One way to control for these disturbances is to keep these computers very close to absolute zero (-450 degrees Fahrenheit) in giant freezers. But this is incredibly costly. Developing so-called “warm” quantum computing — computers that could run at room temperature — could drastically save on costs and space for future computers.

Additionally quantum computers right now have to dedicate a handful of their limited qubits to keeping track of accumulating errors due to those disturbances. Developing more efficient ways to track or circumvent these errors can help return these side-lined qubits to the main game and in turn increasing computing power.

The goal posts may seem far away now but researchers are confident that this quantum computing will one day have a huge impact on our lives.

Lunedì 4 gennaio i lumi di alabastro portatori di luce passeranno simbolicamente di mano in mano tra tutti i sindaci dei comuni sostenitori in una staffetta virtuale che diverrà poi reale coinvolgendo tutta la comunità fino ad accendere il cuore della città

Volterra

(AGR) Condividere un simbolo per condividere un progetto. È questo il significato più profondo di Volterra Illumina l’iniziativa che segna una nuova tappa nel percorso di Volterra finalista toscana a Capitale italiana della cultura 2022. Volterra Illumina infatti è una staffetta di luce. Lunedì 4 gennaio il Sindaco Giacomo Santi accenderà un I Lumina lume di alabastro divenuto simbolo della candidatura e lo passerà virtualmente al Presidente della Regione Toscana Eugenio Giani al Presidente del Consiglio Regionale Antonio Mazzeo e ai Sindaci dei 53 Comuni sostenitori per giungere in piazza dei Priori il cuore di Volterra dove si trova la grande installazione di alabastro luminoso Arnioni in piazza. Qui sarà raccolto nuovamente dal Sindaco e Presidente del Consiglio Regionale Antonio Mazzeo per raggiungere tutti componenti della comunità dell’alabastro e poi i cittadini e – simbolicamente – tutti coloro che appoggiano il progetto di Rigenerazione umana di Volterra 2022. Si può partecipare all’appuntamento in due modi: dal vivo recandosi alle 18 in piazza dei Priori a Volterra con il proprio I Lumina nel rispetto delle normative sanitarie e seguendo le indicazioni di posizionamento fornite dagli organizzatori; oppure in streaming seguendo la diretta Facebook sulle pagine di Volterra 2022 Capitale della cultura Comune di Volterra e InToscana e postando sui canali social le immagini del proprio lume acceso a sostegno della candidatura con l’hashtag #volterra22.

Al momento in poco più di 20 giorni sono stati venduti oltre 1.000 I Lumina un dato record che segna il gradimento di questo progetto che abbina la sapienza dei Maestri artigiani alabastrai di Volterra al design contemporaneo di Luisa Bocchietto. I LUMINA è acquistabile (anche lunedì 4 gennaio) al Consorzio Turistico Volterra Valdicecina in Piazza dei Priori n. 19/20 tutti i giorni 930/13 e 14/18 (telefono 0588/87257; mail info@volterratur.it); prezzo 14 Euro si effettuano spedizioni.

Volterra 2022 vuole nuovamente mettere l'alabastro al centro della città per un ritorno alla materia prima con nuove forme di creatività che riaffermeranno la rilevanza dei progetti intorno alla pietra di luce in un percorso di conoscenza e partecipazione che coinvolge tutta la comunità verso Volterra 22.Per questo nel dossier di candidatura si trova 22 designer per 22 artigiani l’iniziativa curata dalla designer internazionale Luisa Bocchietto già Presidente e ora Senator di WDO (World Design Organization) con il patrocinio e il contributo della Regione Toscana da cui sono nati Arnioni in piazza e I Lumina.

Arnioni in piazza è la suggestiva installazione di pietre grezze d’alabastro collocata in Piazza dei Priori nel cuore della città (fino ad aprile 2021). Gli arnioni con le loro forme “pettinate” a una scala più grande possibile illuminati al loro interno mettono in evidenza la varietà dei colori e delle venature del materiale. L’opera valorizza la qualità dell’alabastro e la capacità delle imprese locali di lavorarlo per trarne prodotti eccellenti. Un materiale sempre diverso che rende unica ogni opera.Come unici ognuno con le proprie trasparenze sono i lumi portacandele in alabastro I Lumina ideati sempre da Luisa Bocchietto e primi oggetti di design della collezione 2020/2021. Gli eleganti lumi portacandela dialogano con l’opera pubblica e ne rappresentano il suo aspetto privato in una simbolica condivisione di valori e progetti tra città e partecipanti.Nell’ambito della iniziative dedicate alla pietra volterrana si trova anche la nuova collana culturale del Comune di Volterra Volaterrae Arte e cultura realizzata in collaborazione con Pacini Editore. Il primo volume curato da Ilario Luperini con la collaborazione di Renato Casini e Marco Ricciardi e le foto di Dante Ghilli è dedicato alla Torre Pendente in alabastro e s’intitola SOLIDE TRASPARENZE.

L’alabastro di Volterra pietra gessosa formatasi 6-7 milioni di anni fa è considerato il più pregiato d’Europa e cambia aspetto colorazione e consistenza al variare della composizione chimica del terreno mostrando diverse venature che rendono ogni oggetto unico e non replicabile. In epoca etrusca fu utilizzato per la produzione di urne cinerarie e Volterra divenne il centro di produzione di questo prezioso materiale. Poche testimonianze ne attestano l’uso nel Medioevo ma è alla metà del ‘500 che si afferma una vera rinascita della sua lavorazione. Oggi Volterra è un centro di manifattura esclusivo di questa pietra naturale dalle magnifiche trasparenze.

LA CANDIDATURA

Volterra è una delle dieci città finaliste al titolo di Capitale italiana della cultura 2022. Il progetto complessivo presentato nel dossier dal titolo Rigenerazione umana mette al centro la rigenerazione delle persone e delle comunità ponendosi come esempio di sperimentazione e punto di riferimento per la rinascita dell’Italia attraverso i centri di media dimensione e i loro territori. Temi di grande dibattito che alla luce della recente pandemia hanno assunto ulteriore centralità.Il dossier trova forza propulsiva nelle esperienze di rigenerazione umana che hanno modellato la città in particolare quella dell'ex Ospedale Psichiatrico dove si conserva parte del graffito di Nannetti capolavoro dell'art brut e quella della pluripremiata UBU Compagnia della Fortezza la più importante e longeva esperienza di teatro-carcere nel mondo condotta da Armando Punzo che ha creato un innovativo e unico modello di ricerca culturale in continua evoluzione.

This document and video will demonstrate CrowdStrike Falcon® Intelligence and the benefits of automating threat intelligence.

Video

﻿﻿

Automated File Submission

CrowdStrike Falcon® Intelligence is designed to automatically provide detailed malware analysis that is integrated as part of the alert to help analysts save time and make effective security decisions.

Below we see a Falcon prevention event that also resulted in a quarantined file.

As we scroll down in the details pane we see that the quarantined file was also sent to the sandbox for analysis. That happened automatically with no intervention from the administrator.

Malware Analysis

We immediately see useful context from the CrowdStrike Falcon® Intelligence analysis directly in the UI. In addition to the summary risk assessment you have the option to download both strict and broad Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). You can also open the complete sandbox report. It provides additional analysis details including the threat level and score. There are three options to drill further into the report: Report Summary Network Activity and Advanced Analysis.

Under “Report Summary” you can view the risk assessment and get information on related malware from the “Malquery” section. This information comes from CrowdStrike’s extensive malware database and can help organizations understand if this attack is part of a larger initiative or if they have been the target of similar attacks in the past. If not the information can be used to get proactive in protecting against the related files in the future.

Actionable Intelligence

From the sandbox report there is also an option to download IOC’s related to the analyzed malware. Those could include things like known bad domains or IP addresses. That information can be used with other security tools to block access to known bad sites via firewalls web content filters or IPS devices.

For malware with actor attribution there is a pivot to open the complete actor profile and better understand who is attacking your organization. The actor profile contains additional IOC’s for the actor including known Command and Control servers and IPs. In many cases you will also see a list of commonly exploited vulnerabilities. This information can help you ensure your environment is patched and protected from a targeted bad actor attack.

Conclusion

CrowdStrike Falcon® Intelligence fully automates the analysis process incorporates threat intelligence and yields actionable intelligence information. It provides greater context so that security analysts can be faster and more effective as they learn from attacks and strive to protect the larger organization.

Just because a processor is more expensive and with higher digits doesn't mean it will run faster than a cheaper version. As we've proven many times before Core i5 laptops can sometimes run better than Core i7 laptops even within the same generation.

Our latest example involves Intel's newest 11th gen Tiger Lake Core i5-1135G7 and Core i7-1165G7 CPUs. Though the latter is advertised to be faster and more expensive than the former we've come across at least one Core i5-1135G7 laptop that can consistently outperform its pricier Core i7-1165G7 configuration. Our Dell Inspiron 7506 2-in-1 Silver Edition outscores the Dell Inspiron 7506 2-in-1 Black Edition by a small yet consistent margin in almost all multi-threaded benchmarks.

When looking at each Dell system in more detail the Core i5 Inspiron is able to maintain slightly faster clock rates at around 3 GHz compared to ~2.8 GHz on the Core i7 Inspiron. It's worth noting that the latter includes a much faster discrete GPU but that's not an excuse for having an under-performing CPU.

Does this mean users should always go with the cheaper Core i5-1135G7 whenever possible? Not necessarily. The biggest difference between the Core i5-1135G7 and Core i7-1165G7 lies in graphics performance and not raw CPU performance. The Core i5 integrates an Iris Xe GPU with 80 EUs (Execution Units) compared to 96 EUs on the Core i7. 3DMark benchmarks show the Core i5 Iris Xe performing about 10 to 15 percent slower than the Core i7 Iris Xe and this deficit can drop to as much as 30 to 40 percent if the Core i5 system is on single-channel memory.

If you're a casual gamer or graphics editor then the Core i7-1165G7 option may be worth the investment for its faster integrated graphics. Otherwise users can just go with cheaper Core i5-1135G7 SKUs without sacrificing all that much CPU horsepower if any.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob3Jvbml4LmNvbS9uZXdzL0xpbnVzLVRvcnZhbGRzLUVDQ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Linus Torvalds On The Importance Of ECC RAM Calls Out Intel's ""Bad Policies"" Over ECC","Show Your Support: Have you heard of Phoronix Premium?

There's nothing quite like some fun holiday-weekend reading as a fiery mailing list post by Linus Torvalds. The Linux creator is out with one of his classical messages which this time is arguing over the importance of ECC memory and his opinion on how Intel's ""bad policies"" and market segmentation have made ECC memory less widespread.Linus argues that error-correcting code (ECC) memory ""absolutely matters"" but that ""Intel has been instrumental in killing the whole ECC industry with it's horribly bad market segmentation... Intel has been detrimental to the whole industry and to users because of their bad and misguided policies wrt ECC. Seriously...The arguments against ECC were always complete and utter garbage... Now even the memory manufacturers are starting do do ECC internally because they finally owned up to the fact that they absolutely have to. And the memory manufacturers claim it's because of economics and lower power. And they are lying bastards - let me once again point to row-hammer about how those problems have existed for several generations already but these f*ckers happily sold broken hardware to consumers and claimed it was an ""attack"" when it always was ""we're cutting corners"".""

Torvalds went on his lengthy post to say ""The ""modern DRAM is so reliable that it doesn't need ECC"" was always a bedtime story for children that had been dropped on their heads a bit too many times. Yes I'm pissed off about it. You can find me complaining about this literally for decades now. I don't want to say ""I was right"". I want this fixed and I want ECC. And AMD did it. Intel didn't.""His comments commended AMD for their more broadly supporting ECC RAM even on consumer desktop hardware while Intel's market segmentation stifled ECC RAM adoption.These statements come just months after Torvalds was also blasting Intel over AVX-512 . It was also in 2020 that Torvalds switched to a Threadripper workstation after 15+ years of using Intel CPUs on his primary system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbHBoYXN0cmVldC5jb20vaXMtaXQtdGltZS1mb3ItaW50ZWwtaW50Yy10by1yZXZpc2l0LWl0cy1idXNpbmVzcy1tb2RlbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is it time for Intel (INTC) to revisit its business model?,"Unlike some of its peers in the tech industry Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has not been able to withstand the challenge posed by coronavirus which came at a time when the chipmaker was going through a rough patch. Stiff competition and lack of innovation have taken the sheen off the once-hailed Intel model.

A Bad Year

Currently INTC is one of the worst-performing tech stocks that traded below the $50-mark quite often this year. The recent trend has left analysts skeptical about the stock’s future prospects and the majority of them recommend holding it though the average target price points to a modest uptick. The company has underperformed the industry and lost several billion dollars in market value. On Tuesday the stock got a respite and made handsome gains after Intel’s management expressed its resolve to address the issues facing the company in response to concerns raised by an activist investor.

The virus outbreak has derailed the company’s growth initiatives highlighting the need for more effective measures to stay relevant in the rapidly changing industry. Rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) which got a major boost earlier this year after Intel delayed its 7-nanometer chips and Asian counterpart Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company have been making steady inroads into the global semiconductor market. Also Intel’s top customers like Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) are drifting to suppliers who offer cheaper solutions.

Long-term Prospects

While its earlier efforts to build a competitive solution for 5G did not yield the desired results the largely-untapped market for the high-speed wireless technology offers opportunities the company can count on. The answer to Intel’s problems lies in shifting focus to cloud-based solutions rather than banking on its prowess in conventional microprocessor and data center technology. That said its fundamentals remain strong — with an impressive balance sheet and cash flow — making the stock a good long-term bet.

We are actively executing against a diversified growth strategy and now have several multi-billion dollar businesses fueled by data and the rise of artificial intelligence 5G network transformation and the intelligent autonomous edge. We built these businesses by positioning the Company to grow share in the largest market opportunity in our history in a world where everything increasingly looks like a computer. Our ambitions are much greater and to realize them we must play a larger role in our customers’ success. Robert Swan chief executive officer of Intel

Weak Q3

In the most recent quarter the company’s finances came under pressure from COVID-related headwinds reversing the uptrend seen in the first half. In what could be a major disappointment for investors earnings dropped in double-digits to $1.11 per share in the third quarter reflecting a 4% decrease in revenues to $18.3 billion. But the results came in above the market’s prediction. While the core Client Computing segment stayed largely unaffected the other divisions contracted.

Read management/analysts’ comments on Intel’s Q3 earnings

Initial estimates indicate that the downtrend continued in the final months of the fiscal year owing to the demand shifts and economic uncertainty. The management currently expects fourth-quarter earnings and revenues to be below the prior-year levels.

Stock Falls

Intel’s stock decreased by about 17% in 2020 going through several ups and downs. The shares traded lower during Wednesday’s regular trading after closing the previous session at $49.39.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzg4MTM4LWFtZC1wYXRlbnRzLWNoaXBsZXQtZ3B1LWRlc2lnbi11bmxpa2UtbnZpZGlhLWludGVsLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD patents a chiplet GPU design quite unlike Nvidia and Intel's,"Something to look forward to: AMD has published its first patent on chiplet GPU designs. In typical AMD fashion they're trying to not rock the boat. Chiplet GPUs are just beginning to emerge. Intel has been forthright about their development process and confirmed the employment of chiplets in their first-generation discrete GPUs. Nvidia while coy about specifics have published numerous research papers on the topic. AMD was the last holdout - which only adds to the intrigue.

Chiplets as the name suggests are smaller less complex chips that meant to work together into more powerful processors. They're arguably the inevitable future for all high-performance components and in some cases the successful present; AMD's use of chiplet CPU designs has been brilliant.

In the new patent dated December 31 AMD outlines a chiplet design fashioned to mimic a monolithic design as closely as possible. Their hypothetical model uses two chiplets connected by a high-speed inactive interposer called a crosslink.

A crosslink connection sits between the L2 cache and L3 cache on the memory hierarchy. Everything beneath it such as the cores and L1 cache and L2 cache are aware of their separation from the other chiplet. Everything above including the L3 cache and GDDR memory are shared between the chiplets.

This design is beneficial because it is conventional. AMD claims that compute units can access low-level cache on other chiplets almost as fast as they can access local low-level cache. Should that prove true software won't need updating.

The same cannot be said of Intel and Nvidia's designs. Intel intends on using two new technologies EMIB (embedded multi-die interconnect bridge) and Foveros. The latter is an active interposer that uses through-silicon-vias something AMD explicitly states they will not use. Intel's design lets the GPU house a system-accessible cache that powers a new memory fabric.

Nvidia has not disclosed everything but have indicated a few directions they might pursue. A research paper from 2017 describes a four-chiplet design and a NUMA (non-uniform memory access) aware and locality aware architecture. It also experiments with a new L1.5 cache which exclusively holds remote data accesses and is bypassed during local memory accesses.

AMD's approach might sound the least imaginative but it also sounds practical. And if history has proven anything it's that developer-friendliness is a huge advantage.

Below are additional diagrams from the patent.

Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view that descends from two chiplets to the circuit board. The two chiplets (106-1 and 106-2) are stacked vertically on the passive crosslink (118) and use dedicated conductor structures to access the crosslink's traces (206) and subsequently communicate with each other. Conductor structures not attached to the crosslink (204) connect to the circuit board for power and other signaling.

Figure 3 depicts the cache hierarchy. WGPs (work group processors) (302) which are collections of shader cores and GFXs (fixed function units) (304) which are dedicated processors for singular purposes connect directly to a channel's L1 cache (306). Each chiplet contains multiple L2 cache (308) banks that are individually addressable and also coherent within a single chiplet. Each chiplet also contains multiple L3 cache (310) cache banks that are coherent across the whole GPU.

The GDF (graphics data fabric) (314) connects the L1 cache banks to the L2 cache banks. The SDF (scalable data fabric) (316) combines the L2 cache banks and connects them to the crosslink (118). The crosslink connects to the SDFs on all the chiplets as well as the L3 cache banks on all the chiplets. The GDDR memory lanes (written as Memory PHY) (312) connect to L3 cache banks.

As an example if a WGP on one chiplet required data from a GDDR bank on another chiplet that data would be sent through to an L3 cache bank then over the crosslink to an SDF then to an L2 bank and finally through a GDF to an L1 bank.

Figure 4 is a bird's eye view of one chiplet. It shows more accurately the potential locations and scales of various components. The HBX Controller (404) manages the crosslink which the chiplet is connected to by HBX PHY (406) conductors. The small square in the bottom-left corner (408) is a potential additional connection to the crosslink to connect more chiplets."

Africa-focused e-commerce firm Jumia is struggling to dispel allegations that it “fudged the numbers” to paint a picture of a stable business prior to listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

Jumia which has operations in Uganda has taken a beating since listing on the NYSE last month after a report by Citron Research accused the company of fraud.

The accusations have been such severe that they have forced a nosedive in the company’s share price by more than 50 per cent.

The report came at a time when questions had been lingering on whether Jumia can be considered a truly African entity not only because of opting to list on the NYSE but also due to its ownership structure that includes incorporation in Germany headquarters in Dubai and a central tech team based in Portugal.

Riding on a tagline of “100 per cent African” and often seen as the “Amazon of Africa” Jumia has operations in 14 countries with its biggest markets being Nigeria Kenya Morocco and Egypt.

The claims

In its report Citron estimates that in order to raise money from investors Jumia inflated its active consumers and active merchants figures by 20 to 30 per cent and failed to make disclosures that 41 per cent of orders were returned not delivered or cancelled.

“Assuming 41 per cent of orders were returned not delivered or cancelled in 2018 this implies that almost 30 per cent of orders were cancelled in 2018. Since Jumia primarily sells consumer electronics which should not have this high cancellation rate it reeks of fraud” says the report.

The report also indicates that between 2015 and 2018 Jumia made little progress in its core business with revenues declining from $145m to $131m while adjusted earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) went from $161m to $150m.

Of importance to note though is that despite calling Jumia a “smoking gun” and igniting panic among investors Citron founder and report author Andrew Left has repeatedly been accused of causing alarm among ordinary investors.

In 2016 Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission accused Mr Left of spreading false information about a Chinese company Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc and went on to ban him from trading in the country for five years.

The revelations in the report have had adverse effects on the firm’s share price which debuted at $14.50 on the NYSE after it listed through an initial public offering.

While the stock peaked by more than 70 per cent to hit $46.99 it has since come crumbling trading at $25 by close of trading last week.

The claims by Citron have prompted US investments fraud investigators Holzer & Holzer to launch a probe into the operations of Jumia.

“Holzer & Holzer investigating whether certain statements made by Jumia complied with federal securities laws” said the investigators.

Jumia’s woes are mounting after New York-based law firm Bragar Eagel & Squire filed a case against the company over claims it made materially false and misleading statements.

“The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements about Jumia and its business” said the lawsuit filed on behalf of investors who bought the company’s shares. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has however remained silent on the issue.

Jumia through its investment banker Citigroup Global Market Inc is struggling to put out the fire ignited by Citron maintaining its business remains sound and has the ability to deliver its promises to investors.

“For investors we believe the most important factor remains the company’s ability to deliver on its guidance starting with Quarter One” said Citigroup.

The rider however was that Citigroup was maintaining its neutral/high risk rating on Jumia shares reflecting the significant growth prospects of the company balanced by the inherent volatility of operating in early stage e-commerce markets.

Innovation and talent across Africa

At the time of Jumia’s listing last month Mr Ron Kawamara the Jumia Uganda chief executive officer said the listing was a milestone for technology start-ups.

“The listing shows that there is innovation happening in Africa and a lot of talent on the continent” he said noting that through listing the company will be seeking to build trust and credibility with customers and potential partners such as top brands globally who might now take an interest in collaborating with Jumia.

Widening losses

According to Jumia’s Quarter One financial results released last week its gross merchandise value the total amount of goods sold over the period posted a 58 per cent increase to $269.3m from $170.5m over the same period last year.

Despite the increase in sales operating losses widened to $50.9m from $38.4m with negative Ebitda increasing to $44.3m from $33.8m.

“We believe that Jumia is increasingly relevant for consumers and sellers in Africa. We remain focused on our core operations driving consumer adoption and engagement on our marketplace” Mr Sacha Poignonnec the Jumia co-chief executive officer said.

In the prospectus presented prior to the listing Jumia admitted it has incurred significant losses since inception and there is no guarantee that it will achieve or sustain profitability.

Since inception in 2012 Jumia has accumulated more than $1b in losses.

However the company believes - that considering the e-commerce market in Africa is still nascent – it is well positioned to grow.

“We intend to benefit from the expected growth of e-commerce in Africa through the investments that we have made and the extensive local expertise that we have developed” said the firm.

Jumia projects the growth to be driven by the impressive economic growth on the continent forecast to average 5.9 per cent over the next five years massive investments in infrastructure development large fast-growing and young populations and increasing urbanisation.",,,

Check out our latest analysis for International Flavors & Fragrances

International Flavors & Fragrances' Payment Has Solid Earnings Coverage

While it is great to have a strong dividend yield we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. The company is paying out a large amount of its cash flows even though it isn't generating any profit. This is quite a strong warning sign that the dividend may not be sustainable.

According to analysts EPS should be several times higher next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends we think the payout ratio will be 13% which makes us pretty comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.

International Flavors & Fragrances Has A Solid Track Record

The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013 the annual payment back then was $1.36 compared to the most recent full-year payment of $3.24. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 9.1% per annum over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.

The Dividend Has Limited Growth Potential

Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Earnings per share has been sinking by 59% over the last five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. On the bright side earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable.

The Dividend Could Prove To Be Unreliable

Overall we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. We can't deny that the payments have been very stable but we are a little bit worried about the very high payout ratio. We don't think International Flavors & Fragrances is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.

It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still investors need to consider a host of other factors apart from dividend payments when analysing a company. For instance we've picked out 2 warning signs for International Flavors & Fragrances that investors should take into consideration.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

(NYSE:IFF),"With a median price-to-sales (or ""P/S"") ratio of close to 1.5x in the Chemicals industry in the United States you could be forgiven for feeling indifferent about International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.'s ( ) P/S ratio of 1.9x. However investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/S.

How International Flavors & Fragrances Has Been Performing

With revenue that's retreating more than the industry's average of late International Flavors & Fragrances has been very sluggish. It might be that many expect the dismal revenue performance to revert back to industry averages soon which has kept the P/S from falling. If you still like the company you'd want its revenue trajectory to turn around before making any decisions. Or at the very least you'd be hoping it doesn't keep underperforming if your plan is to pick up some stock while it's not in favour.

How Is International Flavors & Fragrances' Revenue Growth Trending?

Keen to find out how analysts think International Flavors & Fragrances' future stacks up against the industry? In that case our .

There's an inherent assumption that a company should be matching the industry for P/S ratios like International Flavors & Fragrances' to be considered reasonable.

Retrospectively the last year delivered a frustrating 7.7% decrease to the company's top line. Still the latest three year period has seen an excellent 126% overall rise in revenue in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance. Although it's been a bumpy ride it's still fair to say the revenue growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.

Turning to the outlook the next three years should bring diminished returns with revenue decreasing 0.07% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's not great when the rest of the industry is expected to grow by 8.2% per annum.

With this in consideration we think it doesn't make sense that International Flavors & Fragrances' P/S is closely matching its industry peers. Apparently many investors in the company reject the analyst cohort's pessimism and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. Only the boldest would assume these prices are sustainable as these declining revenues are likely to weigh on the share price eventually.

The Key Takeaway

Typically we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-sales ratios when settling on investment decisions though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.

While International Flavors & Fragrances' P/S isn't anything out of the ordinary for companies in the industry we didn't expect it given forecasts of revenue decline. With this in mind we don't feel the current P/S is justified as declining revenues are unlikely to support a more positive sentiment for long. If we consider the revenue outlook the P/S seems to indicate that potential investors may be paying a premium for the stock.

You should always think about risks. Case in point we've spotted you should be aware of and 1 of them is potentially serious.

Every year during the celebration of the Chinese New Year the dragon is also believed to cleanse the evil that would hurt people in the New Year. There are about nine dragons that are mentioned in Chinese folklore.

When the Chinese move overseas they move with this culture together with another characteristic the lamps. Global Paper a Chinese company that manufactures toilet paper has two sculptures of dragon heads at the entrance of its factory in Mbalala Mukono District. At the entrance of several other Chinese companies such as restaurants the occasional red lamps cannot be missed.

The sun is barely out and in a place called Mbalala on the Kampala – Jinja highway and a few kilometres from Mukono town hundreds of people are seen walking. Dominated by women the people are walking in both directions. They all end up in one gate. It is the home of the Tian Tang group a Chinese steel and mattress manufacturing company in Uganda. It is right next to Global Paper. The hive of activity in Mbalala is often visible early morning for the day shift and the evening for the night shift. The factory is operational 24 hours a day. At about 9pm as cars are slowed by the traffic one would not fail to catch a glimpse of several Chinese nationals buying roadside roasted maize from a vendor who has her charcoal stove near the factory entrance.

Company officials reveal that they employ about 1000 people and it has become a symbol of Chinese investment in Uganda.

The area has also been named “the Chinese Industrial Park” because of the presence of Chinese companies.

Surge in investment

The rise in China investments in Uganda is an attribute of its growing interest on the African continent. According to the Uganda Investment Authority (UIA) investment abstract for 2014/15 China remains a top origin of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Uganda. In 2014/15 FDI from China alone accounted for 56 per cent of the total investment.

UIA estimates that at least $528m (Shs1.8 trillion) of the total $1.4b (Shs4.7 trillion) in 2014/15 came from Chinese registered companies. This is up from $403m (Shs1.35 trillion) of the total $2b (Shs6.7 trillion) invested in 2013/14. China is not the top source of investment though.

The bulk of the investments come from the Cayman Islands. That is not the entire story however. Even the investments from the Cayman Islands originate from China.

“It suffices to note that Cayman Islands’ investment was of Chinese origin” the UIA report reads.

The trend is beyond industrial developments. In the last five years three Chinese hotels have opened in Uganda to cater for the large Chinese presence in Uganda. Kololo Courts Hotel is located in the high-end residential area of Kololo. It is not the exact luxurious hotel but is known for its rather affordable rates on their hall for wedding ceremonies. From the elevator to room numbers one cannot miss the occasional mandarin inscriptions for the Chinese community that doesn’t understand English.

Recently the Nanjing Hotel opened on the Lugogo Bypass. The Chinese Business Hotel will be opening in Industrial Area Namuwongo a Kampala surburb.

The location is rather strange because it is located in an area with warehouses and the absence of residential properties.

Supermarkets restaurants and banking are also some of the areas they have made investments in.

According to Prof Philip Kasaija an international relations lecturer at Makerere University the presence of China in Uganda can be traced to the long-term ambitions of China on the African continent. “China’s presence in Africa has always been there it has only just been scaled up” he says. He said this at a recent dialogue hosted by ACODE.

In 1955 during the Afro-China summit Prof Kasaija reveals China agreed to three terms.

“The terms were non-interference respect for sovereignty and equality for mutual benefit” he says. It is this outlook from China on the continent that makes it attractive for African governments to court China for financing.

“Chinese loans do not come with conditions attached. When we have aid that is condition free we must take it” he adds.

His concern however is Uganda’s relationship with China is not structured but ad-hoc.

This continues to be shown in the meager exports from Uganda to China at just $86m (Shs289b) whereas imports are estimated at $600m (Shs2 trillion).

Why Uganda?

In an email from the economics department at the Chinese Embassy in Uganda they revealed that the attraction to Uganda is based on political and economic reasons.

“The political and economic status in Uganda is stable; the investment environment is increasingly improved. The incumbent president and Ugandan government attach importance to the development of infrastructure which gives the Chinese companies many opportunities” the email reads.

Cumulatively according to Ambassador Zhao Yali in the last 15 years alone investments by Chinese companies in Uganda are worth about $2.2b (Shs7.4 trillion).

“This excludes our involvement in infrastructure projects in Uganda” he said at the ACODE.

“Currently the major infrastructure developments in the country are being done by Chinese companies” he adds.

Karuma Dam Isimba Dam the Entebbe – Kampala Expressway and the expansion of the Entebbe International Airport.

The total value of these infrastructure projects is about $2.5b (Shs8.4 trillion).

Ambassador Yali takes pride in China doing these projects.

“To attract investors into Uganda infrastructure is important. After completion of the airport and road project the image of Uganda will change as investors will be more confident about this country” he says.

Another $2b (Shs6.4 trillion) is expected to be approved as a loan from the Exim Bank of China for the construction of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR). The project will also bring on some Chinese expatriates.

In the oil sector CNOOC is the only company that holds an oil production licence. These projects come with a host of expatriates that require services including meals accommodation and festivals.

Non-interventionist

President Museveni has been praising China for its none-interventionist policy in Uganda’s political. This could not have been more emphasised in Museveni’s speech at the swearing ceremony back in May 2016.

“Those people are also our genuine friends. They have no arrogance. If a man has his own house and he goes in another man’s house … what type of fool are you?” he said.

Not so good

“There is the dumping of substandard and counterfeit goods from China. This undermines trade relations between Uganda and China” Ms Amelia Kyambadde the Trade minister said at the dialogue organised by Advocates Coalition for Development and Environment (ACODE). She also accuses some of the Chinese of doing businesses that are meant for Ugandans. “We have a problem with some of the Chinese nationals. When they come to Uganda they engage in petty trade yet they registered as investors. I have personally encountered such incidences” she adds.

William Street has a collection of small businesses selling products ranging from electronics mobile phones DVDs and other accessories. Most of these businesses are run by Ugandans. However some shops selling shoes are being operated by Chinese nationals.

According to the Chinese Embassy they are “not very clear” how many Chinese nationals are in the country.

Uganda’s investment relationship with China is one that will continue to expand according to the Uganda Investment Authority (UIA). Even with the concerns over substandard goods the trouble is that an ad-hoc relationship sometimes results into Ugandan traders opting to buy counterfeit goods from China on one hand. On the other hand Uganda is also failing to enforce the laws on immigration and standards.

Floyd Little the franchise’s star during years of struggles in the 1960s and ‘70s died Friday night following a battle with a rare form of cell cancer.

He was 78.

Universally beloved by his alma mater Syracuse by Broncos Country and by contemporaries in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Little’s passion for football energy for helping others and overall enthusiasm for life created unforgettable memories.

“Floyd Little was a true hero of the game” Pro Football Hall of Fame president David Baker said. “He was a man of great integrity passion and courage. His contributions off the field were even greater than his amazing accomplishments he did on it. Floyd’s smile heart and character epitomized what it meant to have a Hall of Fame life.”

Little who resided in the Las Vegas area began chemotherapy treatments last May and his former Syracuse teammate and long-time friend Pat Killorin started a GoFundMe to help cover the medical expenses. On Nov. 21 Killorin announced Little had been placed in hospice.

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement Little “was not only a Hall of Fame running back he was a Hall of Fame person. Faith family and football were the pillars of his life. I was so fortunate to know Floyd and witnessed first-hand the impact he had on others.”

Little is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame (1983) the Broncos’ inaugural Ring of Fame class (1984) and the Pro Football Hall of Fame (2010).

Little joined the Broncos in their eighth year of existence (1967) and was their bright light as the team struggled to become competitive. A five-time Pro Bowl selection and one-time All Pro Little played all of his 117 games for the Broncos retiring in 1975 with 6323 yards rushing and a combined 53 rushing/receiving/return touchdowns.

“Without question Floyd was one of the greatest Broncos of all-time and an unforgettable part of our history” Broncos president/CEO Joe Ellis said in a statement Saturday. “He rightfully earned the nickname ‘The Franchise’ for his profound impact on this organization helping put the Broncos on the pro football map in the early days.”

Little’s No. 44 is one of only three jerseys retired by the Broncos joining quarterback John Elway (No. 7) and quarterbacks Frank Tripucka/Peyton Manning (No. 18).

Little is survived by his wife DeBorah three children (Marc Christy and Kyra) and five grandchildren.

Connection with Ernie Davis

Floyd Little was born July 4 1942 in New Haven Conn. and attended Hillhouse High School in New Haven and Bordentown Military Institute in New Jersey. He was six when his father died of cancer.

Little was recruited by the United States Military Academy (led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur) Notre Dame and Syracuse. Little’s meeting with MacArthur was at the Waldorf Astoria in New York and included meeting baseball stars Roy Campanella and Elston Howard.

“General MacArthur pretty much guaranteed that I’d become the first African-American general” Little said in 2010. “When you think about that I could’ve been Colin Powell’s boss. I could’ve been General (Norman) Schwarzkopf’s boss. I could’ve been General (David) Petraeus’ boss. Just think about that.”

According to reports Little chose Syracuse on the advice of former Orange running back Ernie Davis who visited Little in Connecticut. At Syracuse Little continued the tradition of star running backs who wore No. 44 following Jim Brown and Davis.

A three-time All-America selection from 1964-66 (freshmen were ineligible to play) Little rushed for 2704 yards and 46 touchdowns. He finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy balloting in ’65 and ’66. Little played in the same Orange backfield as future Hall of Fame running back Larry Csonka and two-time Super Bowl-winning coach Tom Coughlin.

In 2010 decades after his college career Little returned to Syracuse to be a special assistant to the athletic director aiding with fundraising recruiting and mentoring.

“No one loves Syracuse University as Floyd Little loves Syracuse University — he truly is Mr. Syracuse University” Coughlin said.

As Little was starring for the football team Jim Boeheim was playing for the Syracuse basketball team and has been the program’s coach since 1976.

“Floyd was one of a kind on and off the field” Boeheim said in comments distributed by Syracuse on Saturday. “He could make anybody smile. He could get along with everybody. He had everybody feel good about themselves and everything else. … It’s hard to explain how great of a person Floyd Little was. There is nobody better than Floyd Little in any way shape or form on the field or off the field.

“It was a privilege just to know Floyd Little.”

Upon his return to Syracuse Little said Davis who died at age 24 in 1963 due to leukemia was the motivating factor.

“My life has been tied to Ernie’s life because I wanted to be the Ernie Davis that he couldn’t be” Little said. “That’s how I lived my life because of Ernie Davis not having a chance to live his.”

Little worked at Syracuse until 2016 when he and his wife relocated to Las Vegas.

“Floyd Little embodied what it means to be Orange” Syracuse Chancellor Kent Syverud said in a statement. “He was an all-American student-athlete. He set records in the NFL. He achieved success in the business world. Floyd mentored countless student-athletes and dedicated his time energy and resources to improving the lives of others. He was a great friend to me and to his beloved Syracuse University. … Floyd Little No. 44 will forever be our Orange MVP.”

President-elect Joe Biden was a Syracuse Law School student when Little played for the Orange and the two remained in contact for the ensuing decades.

“He was full of character decency and integrity” Biden said in a statement released Saturday night. “I remember our call when he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the joy in his voice. And I remember the more recent call when he shared his cancer diagnosis and how fearless he was in his conviction to fight it.

“As with everything else he did in life Floyd lived to the very end with grit and heart and love for his family and faith in God. I will miss my friend. He was a good man.”

Great player on bad team

Still looking for their first winning season the Broncos chose Little sixth overall in the 1967 AFL/NFL draft. Four players from the first round would become Hall of Fame members — Purdue quarterback Bob Griese (fourth to Miami) Notre Dame defensive tackle Alan Page (15th to Minnesota) and Texas A&M guard Gene Upshaw (17th to Oakland).

Griese and Upshaw became Super Bowl champions and Page played in four title games. Team success though eluded Little for his entire Broncos career.

Playing on struggling teams and with mix-and-match quarterbacks Little was long the Broncos’ shining light. He was the NFL rushing champion in 1971 (1133 yards) and currently ranks second in team history in rushing attempts (1641) yards (6323) and touchdowns (43) behind fellow Hall of Famer Terrell Davis in all three categories.

Little never appeared in a playoff game and was a part of only two winning teams (7-5-2 in ’73 and 7-6-1 in ’74) but his contributions to making pro football in this region a hit will never be forgotten.

Little led the Broncos in rushing seven times and the season-ticket base rose from 24650 to 49000 during his career.

“Without Floyd Little there would be no Denver Broncos” said Tom Mackie who co-authored Little’s 2006 autobiography in a 2010 interview with the Post’s Mark Kiszla. “Either they don’t get picked up by the NFL in the merger or they move to Alabama and become the Birmingham Broncos.”

Think about this: In the first 23 years of Broncos history Little was the only eventual Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee to play for the franchise. From 1983-2002 six eventual Hall of Famers starred for Denver.

Translation: For many years Little was It for the Broncos.

Little’s first six Broncos teams never won more than five games. The AFL West in those days was ruled by Kansas City and Oakland. But he led the AFL in 1969 in yards per rush (5.0) and yards per game (81.0) and earned All-Pro honors.

In Little’s final home game against Philadelphia in December 1975 he scored on a 66-yard catch and a two-yard rush.

At the time of his retirement he ranked seventh all-time in rushing and he had nearly 5000 more yards rushing than the next-closest Broncos player.

Little was universally beloved by fans and teammates and widely respected by opponents.

Two days after he played his 117th and final pro football game and one day after he announced his retirement Floyd Little was honored in a letter to the editor that appeared in the Dec. 22 1975 Miami Herald.

“I always dreaded seeing him come out of the backfield on a pass pattern or get the handoff from the quarterback always wondering how I would ever stop him. No matter how bruised and battered he was after the game he always managed to find me in the middle of the field to say hello and ask about my health. … He is a person which all children can look up to and the parents can honestly say ‘I hope my child grows up to be like him.’”

The letter was signed “Nicholas A. Buoniconti” Dolphins linebacker.

Long wait to enter Canton

Little’s wait for pro football immortality was frustrating. He had the support of his contemporaries like former Baltimore Colts tight end/NFL Players Association president John Mackey who wrote to the selection committee: “If there’s no room for Floyd Little in the Hall of Fame please take me out and put him in.”

Thirty-five years after his retirement Little was selected for induction. Shortly after he received a call from former Pittsburgh defensive lineman “Mean” Joe Greene.

“He said ‘Floyd you’re the best football player I’ve ever played against in my 16 years’” Little said in a February 2019 interview. “I said ‘Joe are you serious?’ And he said ‘You’re the best football player. Not running back. Best football player I played against.’”

What did Buoniconti and “Mean Joe” see? The first great Broncos player. Period.

“If I were a (New York) Jet and had the same career I had I would have been in a long time ago” Little said in 2010.

Maybe so but Little never let his long wait dampen his enthusiasm for having a bust in Canton Ohio.

In February 2019 the Hall of Famers gathered in a second-floor ballroom at the Atlanta Marriott Marquis for the annual Merlin Olsen Luncheon. Little walked over to the Denver media contingent on hand to cover the next night’s selection of owner Pat Bowlen and cornerback Champ Bailey.

If there is somebody who enjoyed being a Hall of Famer more than Floyd Little they need to step forward. He loved the jacket. He loved going back to Canton. He loved all of the events with his colleagues. He loved it all.

As the interview was breaking up Little was asked “What’s it really like to be a Hall of Famer?”

“I tell the guys if you’re not feeling well you’re sick you have a little cold just can’t get started — go to your closet and put this baby on” he said of his gold jacket. “You will feel so much better. Wearing one of these is one of the great experiences in my life.

“I love wearing it. It makes me feel different.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vZXRmZm9jdXMvbWFya2V0LWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS81LXN0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1zZWN0b3JzLXRvLXdhdGNoLTIwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Stock Market Sectors To Watch In 2021 - ETF Focus on TheStreet: ETF research and Trade Ideas,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/etffocus/market-intelligence/5-stock-market-sectors-to-watch-2021 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vZXRmZm9jdXMvbWFya2V0LWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS81LXN0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1zZWN0b3JzLXRvLXdhdGNoLTIwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

This company which is in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share delivering a surprise of 7.75%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

The company’s non-GAAP revenues were $477.4 million up 8% from the year-ago quarter.

Top Line in Detail

Services & Support: The company generated revenues of $279.7 million from the category (58% of revenues). Notably the figure rose 7% from the year-ago quarter owing to growth in cloud processing revenues.



However declining deconversion fees were negatives.



Processing: The category yielded revenues of $202.9 million (42% of revenues) in the reported quarter up 8% year over year. This can be attributed to 31.3% growth in Jack Henry's digital revenues and growing card-processing fee revenues.

At 31 years-old San Diego’s Sara Jacobs is the youngest California representative in Congress

The oath of office was administered by Speaker Nancy Pelosi as Congresswoman Jacobs’ father Gary Jacobs watched from the House gallery in keeping with coronavirus protocols.

Jacobs a U.S. State Department contractor under the Obama administration will replace veteran Democratic Rep. Susan Davis who was reelected to 10 terms before announcing her plan to retire.

Following her swearing-in Congresswoman Jacobs released the following statement:

“I am honored and humbled to be sworn in today as a Member of Congress representing my hometown and the community I love. I am ready to do the hard work of getting us out of this pandemic rebuilding the American people’s trust in our government and institutions and bringing a new approach to governing.

“Today I became the youngest member from California and the third youngest member in all of Congress. And I take that responsibility seriously — to ensure my and future generations have a world that is livable an economy that is equitable and that the United States rebuilds our institutions and our standing around the world.

“There is so much work to be done. I am honored to be entrusted with this responsibility and am looking forward to getting started.”

Jacobs is the granddaughter of Qualcomm founder and billionaire Irwin Jacobs. She said her priorities will be pandemic relief for small businesses and battling climate change according to the San Diego Union-Tribune.

On Tuesday the domestic abuse bill which includes the creation of her role will reach its final stages in the House of Lords. After a three-year delay caused by two general elections and the coronavirus pandemic can this new legislation tackle an epidemic of abuse?

“This is a window of opportunity” Jacobs says. “We have a postcode lottery for victims of domestic abuse. We’ve had refuges for over 50 yearsand greater awareness but the public is always surprised to learn that progress in a range of areas including health housing and policing isn’t where it should be. We have a lot to do.”

As soon as the first lockdown began in March Jacobs organised weekly online meetings now fortnightly with representatives of all the national helplines websites and organisations working in domestic abuse to chart what was happening behind closed doors conveying the information back to ministers and national and local government and police.

“For months use of helplines chatlines and websites has increased by hundreds of percentage points” Jacobs says. “They are the quiet ways to seek help when you can’t leave the home so easily. It’s been a horrendous year for victims of abuse.”

In response the government provided £30m in emergency funding and launched an awareness campaign #YouAreNotAlone but frontline work is still desperately overstretched and underfunded. So what happens when the bill becomes law?

For the first time it will create a statutory definition of domestic abuse that encompasses emotional coercive or controlling and economic abuse as well as physical violence. Other measures include a statutory duty on local authorities to provide safe accommodation to victims and their children an end to the defence of “rough sex” when a woman is killed and the recognition that children can be victims of abuse in their own right.

In addition the bill gives the commissioner appointed as designate in September 2019 duties to: map services (vital for pitching to the Treasury for funding); encourage good practice; raise public awareness; and hold statutory agencies and local and national government to account by publishing reports and making recommendations that require a response within 56 days.

Jacobs grew up in Alabama and came to Britain in 1998 and now has an English husband and two children. Southern charm married to steely determination have been honed by two decades’ working on the frontline of domestic abuse. In her final year at university studying politics she worked as an intern at a rape crisis centre and her first job was in the field of domestic abuse and that’s where she has stayed.

“I’ve never wanted to do anything else. My frustration is knowing there is good practice out there but it’s patchy and there’s no reason for that. It’s time to make good practice common practice. I’m hard-headed. I’m persistent and assertive in a typically nice southern way because I know these are the right things to do.”

People say this is a landmark piece of legislation. But without these improvements you can’t truly call it a landmark Nicole Jacobs

Jacobs intends to knock hard on doors rather than take a softer route that could lead to honours for her but little real change. “My view of the role is to advise government but never step back from applying pressure. My job is to bring things to light.”

A signal of her intent is her support for more than half-a-dozen amendments to the bill that she and an army of campaigners including MPs peers and organisations such as the Centre for Women’s Justice the Prison Reform Trust and Southall Black Sisters have been able to refine since the bill went to the Commons last year.

“People say this is a landmark piece of legislation and it’s been a long time coming” Jacob says. “But the fact is without these improvements you can’t truly call it a landmark.”

These include the extension to community-based services of the statutory duty on local authorities to provide secure accommodation to survivors and their children. “Without that these services will be exposed to further cuts” says Jacobs. “We’d go a long way to addressing the postcode lottery if we can secure their funding.”

Currently migrant women with no recourse to public funds are excluded from the bill. “Unless they are included their options are brutal” Jacobs says.Another amendment addresses the need to make non-fatal strangulation a separate offence as it is in New Zealand. At present if recognised at all it is treated as common assault. Yet strangulation occurs in a third of killings of women by men.

A recognition of the effect of sustained abuse on women who go on to kill or offend such as drug offences on behalf of an abuse perpetrator is in two other amendments. “Early in my career I volunteered at a women’s prison” Jacobs says. “A lot of offending was linked to domestic abuse. Those are the people who have stayed with me the wasted potential and the injustice.”

Another amendment addresses the need to make post-separation control an offence. A perpetrator for instance may continue for years to rack up debts in an ex-partner’s name. “The government’s reaction is that legislation on stalking or harassment covers this issue but it really doesn’t” Jacobs says. “That has to be remedied. These amendments are the just thing to do.”

Their first four possessions all ended poorly. Their first four drives went like this: three-and-out for a punt interception fumble lost and an interception.

This allowed the Broncos to catch up and then take a 24-17 lead. Then the Raiders finally got something going. Darren Waller needed one catch to tie Tim Brown for the franchise record for catches in a season and two catches to set a new record. He got both catches on consecutive plays.

Here’s the one that broke the record.

While Bella Swan was unequivocally

Any fan of the Twilight movies will recall that there was an infamous love triangle between the three main characters. While Bella Swan was unequivocally in love with vampire Edward Cullen she also had plenty of love in her heart for werewolf Jacob Black. And while Twilight fans placed bets on who was endgame nobody could’ve predicted that Jacob would ultimately end up with Edward and Bella’s half-human half-vampire child Renesmee Cullen.

Even though Jacob’s eventual love interest was a shock to fans Stephenie Meyer who authored the Twilight books actually started preparing fans it in Eclipse. Jacob explains to Bella that one of his best friends fellow werewolf Quil Ateara has imprinted on two-year-old Claire Young. Naturally Bella is taken aback by this knowledge but Jacob manages to explain to her that he’s seen inside Quil’s head and his feelings for the toddler and not at all romantic.

Taylor Lautner struggled with how to portray imprinting in the ‘Twilight’ movies

Though Bella gets an understanding of imprinting when she finds out that Jacob has imprinted on Renesmee she struggles with the concept. And she is hardly the only one. Many fans also weren’t keen on the concept and even the actors found Meyer’s solution to the love triangle she’d created a bit challenging to navigate. Taylor Lautner in particular was initally thrown off by his character’s attachment to the child.

In an interview with Collider Lautner revealed that he initially was concerned about how to portray Jacob’s relationship with Renesmee. He wanted to show that he cared about her without crossing over to the realm of creepy. “Yeah it’s a fine line and I was worried about it” Lautner admitted about filming the last of the Twilight movies with the knowledge that Jacob and Renesmee had this special bond. Ultimately the actor relied heavily on Meyer to truly understand the bond.

How Stephenie Meyer helped Latuner navigate Jacob’s relationship with Renesmee

“We were very lucky to have Stephenie Meyer the author on set with us for these last two movies and I definitely had quite a few conversations with her” the Twilight star shared. “There was nobody better to ask about it than her and she basically told me ‘Stop over-complicating it. Think here and now. That’s all you really have to focus on. It’s simple.’ She said that it’s a lifelong bond between two people and that’s it. At this point it’s more of a brother-sister protective thing. That’s really all it is.”

Once Lautner was able to focus on the present the concept of imprinting on someone so young became less challenging for him. Lautner also credits Bill Condon who directed the last two Twilight movies for also helping viewers navigate the strange relationship. “I couldn’t allow myself to think ahead and go beyond that so that’s the zone I had to stay in” Lautner added. “Bill our director did a tremendous job with it because it is delicate.”

Lautner is certainly right that the relationship between Jacob and Renesmee is delicate. While fans of the Twilight movies may not have been thrilled with the way things shook out for Jacob at least Lautner did everything in his power to not make the unorthodox situation creepier than it inherently was."

They signed safety Alex Johnson formerly of UCLA as an undrafted free agent. On a suddenly crowded depth chart can Johnson earn a roster spot?

The 33rd Team scouting report on Johnson is not an optimistic one:

Alex Johnson projects as a No. 4 safety who fits best in a 2-high scheme. He is undersized with a slight frame and has high-cut hips. He possesses solid straight-line speed and burst but can struggle in mirror-matching routes. He shows good instincts and he will flash quick reactive footwork. While his plant and drive ability is usually reliable lateral jab steps can flip his hips and create separation at the top of the route. Johnson is a one-year starter and his ball skills are a little untested but he showed promise when given a chance. He lacks the physicality and strength to be a major factor against the run currently. His tackling form needs improvement as he lets too many ballcarriers slip away. On 3rd downs he is versatile but is best in a deep zone where he can read the QB. He should be a contributing special teamer.

Johnson had five interceptions and three passes defensed for UCLA in 13 games last season. He did not have any interceptions in 16 games over his first three seasons with the Bruins.

The Giants did guarantee Johnson $115000. That doesn’t mean he will stick with the team on the main roster or practice squad. It does mean they were interested in him enough to make him a nice offer."

Sabbaticals are a new corporate perk

Citigroup is the latest big company to recognize that workers need an improvement in work-life balance said Elisa Martinuzzi at Bloomberg. The Wall Street bank announced last week it will begin offering three-month sabbaticals (at 25 percent pay) to staff with at least five years of service. Citigroup also promises ""a month of fully paid leave to anyone who wants to work pro bono for a charity."" So far sabbaticals are still not common. Many companies have feared that allowing workers extended time off would leave them with one foot out the door. But ""high performers are a flight risk with or without a sabbatical"" and their loyalty could ""strengthen after a company-endorsed three-month trek around the world.""

Illegal overdraft fees at Chase

Regulators have let banks get away with illegal overdraft fees with little publicity or penalty said Patrick Rucker at ProPublica​. Since 2017 the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has ""found at least six banks wrongly charged overdrafts and related fees"" but in each case the agency ""issued a quiet reprimand"" rather than penalization. The latest example was JPMorgan Chase which charged overdraft fees to roughly 170000 customers last year due to a software glitch. The customers had chosen to opt in to ""overdraft protection"" that promised ""they would get an alert before their accounts went negative."" But a ""coding hiccup"" meant those alerts didn't happen leaving customers in the dark. ""Chase charges $34 for an overdraft and allows three such charges a day on an account with insufficient funds."" Chase promised to repay its customers and the OCC's supervisory letter stayed largely out of public view.

Buying fractional shares in ETFs

More investors are buying fractional shares as a way to diversify risk said Julia Carpenter at The Wall Street Journal. Brokerages like Robinhood Charles Schwab and Fidelity advertised the option to purchase fractions of a stock ""as an easy way for small investors to buy a piece of Tesla or Apple."" But a growing number of investors are using the feature to ""slowly accumulate exchange-traded funds that give them a small piece of the broader market."" Online investment platform SoFi estimates ""about one-quarter of its clients' fractional buys are ETFs"" such as the Invesco QQQ Trust a fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100 index and costs about $300 per share.

The first decentralised cryptocurrency surpassed $30823.30 at 1313 GMT according to data compiled by the Bloomberg news agency having broken $20000 on December 16.

Analyst Timo Emden noted that “the appetite for risk” which is reflected in buying of bitcoin “remains unshakeable”.

“More historic highs could follow” the Germany-based analyst added.

Just 12 years old bitcoin has seen a meteoric rise since March when it stood at $5000 spurred by online payments giant PayPal saying it would enable account holders to use cryptocurrency.

After PayPal’s announcement in October analysts at investment banking giant JPMorgan Chase compared the cryptocurrency to gold.

“Bitcoin could compete more intensely with gold as an ‘alternative’ currency over the coming years given that millennials will become over time a more important component of investors’ universe” they said.

A number of central banks have meanwhile responded to the rise of cryptocurrencies and the dwindling global use of cash by announcing plans for bank-backed digital units.

Several central banks including those of China and Sweden — but also the US Federal Reserve — are also testing digital applications in response to Facebook’s recent moves to produce its own digital unit Libra.

Unregulated by any central bank bitcoin emerged as an attractive option for investors with an appetite for the exotic — although criminals have also picked up on its under-the-radar appeal.

Debate has meanwhile raged over the status of the digital asset launched in late 2008 as to whether it should be seen as a form of money an asset or a commodity.

After the unit surpassed $1000 for the first time in 2013 it increasingly began to attract the attention of financial institutions and has experienced wild price swings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyeXB0b3BvbGl0YW4uY29tL2pwLW1vcmdhbi1jaGFzZS1iZWxpZXZlcy1iaXRjb2luLWlzLW92ZXJib3VnL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JP Morgan Chase believes Bitcoin is overbought,"TL;DR Breakdown

JP Morgan Chase strategists say Bitcoin is overbought

The bank also says the crypto asset would make gold suffer

JP Morgan Chase strategists in a recent report by Bloomberg has been quoted to be describing Bitcoin as being “overbought.”

According to these bank analysts Bitcoin must continue to have a large scale inflow like it had seen in recent times in order for the coin not to have a price correction.

The strategists also noted that Grayscale who currently hold over $13 billion as assets under management have a monthly inflow of $1 billion. They further added that due to this size of their inflow they wouldn’t be welcoming to any new position that would lead to a sustained negative price.

The JP Morgan Strategists were also of the opinion that interest in the coin by institutional investors is also playing a pivotal role in the rise of the digital asset.

Cointelegraph also reported that institutional investors mostly got their crypto assets over the counter supply that sucks up all available supply.

However despite all of this Bitcoin is said to have been “overbought” around the $24k Mark.

Bitcoin would make Gold suffer – JP Morgan

JP Morgan Chase in a recent Bloomberg post has said that the current rise of crypto assets is coming at the expense of gold.

According to the bank’s quantitative strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou Bitcoin funds have grown massively while there has been a drop in the gold funds. This run can be expected to continue as more institutions would look to continue to invest in cryptocurrency.

The bank’s view is one of the minority who believes that the crypto industry is becoming a viable investment asset class.

Bitcoin Hits All-Time High Against Gold as Haven Battles Rage

Bitcoin price was high on Friday against gold which gives another confirmation that demand for digital assets is on the rise. Gold also posted impressive gains for the year when compared to Bitcoin’s meteoric rise. Bitcoin’s biggest proponents believe the digital currency is eating away at gold’s market cap as investors opt for the efficiency portability and proven scarcity of the asset. Surprisingly that view is also shared by JPMorgan Chase analysts who believe in Bitcoin’s digital gold narrative as a haven.

Nonetheless Bitcoin has risen to a new high of $33210. The Fibonacci tool has indicated a further upward of the coin. On January 2 uptrend; a retraced candle body has tested the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. The retracement indicates that Bitcoin will rise and reach level 2.0 Fibonacci extension or the high $37592.30 high."

About 3 million new US households became users of the Keurig coffee system in the year which marked an increase of about 10% and put the total number at 33 million households. Retail consumption of single-serve pods manufactured by Keurig Dr Pepper grew nearly 10% in channels tracked by Information Resources Inc. a Chicago-based market research firm.

“So if you take a look at the five years since Keurig was taken private and then merged with KDP — that's a good time frame — we've increased households from 21 million to 33 million” said Robert J. Gamgort chief executive officer in a Feb. 25 earnings call. “That's an increase of about 9% per year. It's a compound growth of 9% per year. It's 12 million new households.”

Net sales in coffee systems increased by 4.7% to $4.43 billion from $4.23 billion in the fiscal year ended Dec. 31 2020. Consumer purchases of Keurig-manufactured K-Cup pods registered double-digit growth while brewer shipments grew 21% Mr. Gamgort said. The hospitality business and away-from-home business suffered significant declines.

“In addition to the strong household penetration growth we saw a record number of upgrades” Mr. Gamgort said. “People were investing in their work-from-home situation. We've got all these great brewers that were just introduced in the past couple of years and so we saw people lean in and upgrade.”

He said Green Mountain Coffee Roasters brew over ice pods will launch in 2021 as will Original Donut Shop one-step cappuccinos.

Net income for Keurig Dr Pepper in the fiscal year increased 6% to $1.33 billion or 94¢ per share on the common stock from $1.25 billion or 89¢ per share in the previous fiscal year. Net sales increased 4.5% to $11.62 billion from $11.12 billion. Total operating costs related to COVID-19 were $150 million in 2020.

Keurig Dr Pepper in 2021 expects constant currency net sales growth in the range of 3% to 4% while adjusted diluted EPS is expected to grow by double-digit percentages.

In fiscal 2020 net sales in packaged beverages increased 9% to $5.36 billion from $4.95 billion. Dollar market share advanced in more than 90% of the Keurig Dr Pepper’s cold beverage retail base. Double-digit consumption growth came in Dr Pepper Canada Dry A&W 7Up Sunkist and Squirt.

Keurig Dr Pepper in 2021 will roll out zero-sugar varieties across its carbonated soft drink portfolio Mr. Gamgort said.

“For most brands the new zero offerings represent a rebranding of our existing diet SKUs to more clearly articulate the zero-sugar benefit to consumers” he said. “For Dr Pepper the introduction of a zero-sugar variety will be in addition to original Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper.”

He said other planned product launches are Bai Boost which will feature caffeine and Mott’s Mighty a line of juices and sauces fortified with vitamins and fiber.

In beverage concentrates net sales decreased 6% to $1.33 billion from $1.41 billion as COVID-19 negatively impacted the fountain foodservice business. In Latin America beverages net sales fell 6% to $497 million primarily reflecting the negative impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation.

Companywide in the fourth quarter net income increased 5% to $428 million or 30¢ per share on the common stock from $406 million or 29¢ per share in the previous year’s fourth quarter. Net sales in the quarter grew 6% to $3.12 billion from $2.93 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhdHJpb3RsZWRnZXIuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8wMS8wMi9taWx0b24tbmF0aXZlLWNyZWF0ZWQtaGlsbHNpZGUtaGFydmVzdC1ob3Qtc2F1Y2UtY29tcGFueS8zODUwODc2MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Milton native created Hillside Harvest hot sauce company,"MILTON — There are two distinct sides to Kamaal Jarrett.

First is his Jamaican side. His parents immigrated to America when he was 3 and his life has been full of Caribbean flavor and stories of his home country. But then comes his upbringing which was wholly American — Jarrett was raised in Milton attended University of Massachusetts at Amherst and worked in finance for most of his adult life.

It's when the two sides collide that you get Jarrett and his ""baby"" — a two-year-old hot sauce company called Hillside Harvest.

""The idea is that this product is the combination of my two influences – my Caribbean culture and my Milton experience"" he said. ""The overarching goal will always be to stay true to a multicultural view. We’re either providing a new twist on a Caribbean recipe or bringing a new and unique product to our American customers.""

Jarrett officially launched Hillside Harvest in January of 2019 and takes his mission of combining Caribbean flavors with American influence seriously. The company's logo — a purple mountain range — is symbolic of where he was born near the red hills outside of Kingston and where he was raised near the Blue Hills Reservation in Milton.

Growing up Jarrett said food was always a part of his life. His spent time in a bakery his aunt owned and his parents cooked nothing but Caribbean food at home. But he'd also watch cooking shows and eat American foods at friends' houses.

""I'd share family dishes and recipes with friends and I'd share the recipes my friends' parents made or I saw on TV with my own family"" he said. ""So throughout my life the option or potential of going to cooking school or doing an apprenticeship was always there. It's always been nagging at me.""

It was after years working in product development for the Keurig Dr. Pepper company that he realized he could make the jump to an artisan company of his own. Jarrett said it was hard to leave the job he loved but that he'd always wanted his own space in the food world.

""I enjoy cooking so much"" he said. ""You can really brighten someone’s day or change their perspective. It’s selfish in a way – I'm able to make myself happy by providing things to other people.""

When Jarrett started Hillside he launched the company with two signature hot sauces — Original Hot Pepper and Pineapple Fresno. The original came from more than a year of experimenting and working backwards from Jamaican jerk flavors he said and is made with traditional ingredients like ginger scotch bonnet peppers honey lemon and garlic.

""You get this unique flavor and only people who really love jerk would even be able to get that’s where it came from"" he said. ""It was a hit people loved it. It has that sweetness and the growing heat that is the trademark of a scotch bonnet. People reacted really well to it.""

Pineapple Fresno is a mild sweet sauce that Jarrett calls a ""light entry-level sauce."" Last year Hillside released its third hot sauce a savory option called Sun Kissed Tomato and will soon release its first marinade - a Jamaican jerk.

All of the sauces are made by Jarrett and his volunteer team of family and friends at a commercial kitchen in Boston. At the start Jarrett said they would churn out about 120 bottles per five or six-hour ""shift"" once per month. Now they're in the kitchen twice per month and make 600 or 700 bottles on each go.

The popularity of small batch hot sauces has been on the rise for years and Jarrett knows his company exists in a competitive space. He says it's the underlying flavor not heat for the sake of it that makes his sauces stand out.

""We build our brand on flavor before everything"" he said. ""I'm OK with not being the spiciest hot sauce on the market. I'm OK if someone tells me they eat ghost peppers and my sauce isn’t spicy enough. But I want them to tell me it tastes awesome. If the flavor is right we can add spice. and from there we want to make sure we are blending those Caribbean and American flavors and influences. We’re trying to provide something new.""

Hillside sauces are sold in specialty shops across New England as well as several Whole Foods grocery stores. Jarrett has dreams of his sauces ending up on tables in restaurants in hotels but says artisan shops and specialty stores are the backbone of his businesses.

On the South Shore Hillside Harvest sauces can be found in Whole Foods Market in Weymouth and Hingham Holmstead Harvest in East Bridgewater Holly Hill Farm in Cohasset and Good Health Natural Foods in Quincy and J Shields Fine Wine in Canton. Jarrett is also a regular at a number of South Shore farmers markets.

Each hot sauce costs $9 and a variety pack of all three is available at hillsidesauce.com.

Photo provided by Kwistunlwut Michelle Robinson.

The day before the Klahoose First Nation went into a COVID-related lockdown Kwistunlwut Michelle Robinson and her family went hunting at Toba River off the coast of B.C.

“We arrived at Toba and started setting up. When we went up on the little Toba River all of a sudden this herd of elk just stepped out” Robinson says. “They stepped out into a small clearing right on the river’s edge.”

Robinson says her parents and their six children were the last family to live in Toba Inlet before they were forced to relocate.

The original village for Klahoose whose main community is now on Cortes Island was located at Toba Inlet on the Toba River she explains.

It’s a special place.

“And so my dad moved us further up” Robinson says. “We cleared land we lived off the land. We had to pick out every rock it had to be immaculate. We hunted lived in tents and we had a little shelter we used for cooking under and for processing food.”

Eating off of the land has always been a part of her life and it’s a connection she has passed on to her own children.

It’s a connection that has become increasingly important to her during this year as the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the importance of her family’s traditions and teachings she says.

‘We know the heart of our territory’

When Robinson was growing up she heard stories from her dad who was raised by his grandmother and great grandmother about when they were told they weren’t allowed to fish or hunt “without a license” she says.

“My grandmothers said ‘Why should we have to pay for a license for a place that the Creator gave to us? We’ve been living here since time immemorial since before we can remember for thousands of years and all of a sudden somebody comes and says you’re not allowed to fish and you have to pay us a licensing fee to be able to feed your people.’”

Her great great grandmother Annie Hill was fined and had to row all the way to Vancouver to pay that fine and turn around and row back home Robinson says.

Robinson has had to make similar trips to Vancouver six hours by road as well to defend her community’s right to hunt and fish and to work with Canada’s conservation officers and government officials fighting for the right to do what her family and people have always known how to do.

“They were trying to dictate to us what we could and couldn’t do with our elk like we would go up there and wipe them out or something” she says.

“We understand what our territory lines are. We know we overlap with our sister tribes but we know the heart of our territory. We know there are animals on it and sea life. We never over fished or over hunted because we knew we had to keep providing for future generations.”

It has been a struggle working with outsiders but she says her and the Klahoose First Nation council continue to build their relationship with all levels of government.

When Robinson helped organize a firearms certification program in her community 15 members showed up including her son daughter and son-in-law.

‘It’s a huge honour’

Right before the Klahoose had to go into lockdown after news of the first positive COVID-19 case Robinson and her family were out hunting in their valley.

“We slept got up and hunted again” she says. “We were on a time limit we all had to squeak the hunt in as I had to get back as soon as possible to do my part.”

They had tags for two of the elk one for the community and a second for Robinson’s sister who was Emergency Manager for the COVID-19 cluster response and would be busy organizing the closure.

Robinson’s youngest son would hunt on behalf of his aunt.

“He had a coming of age and he’s had to learn how to hunt. He had to learn how to clean his own deer” she explains. “My kids have always known how to skin and process animals.”

Her oldest son Brion taught Royce who just turned 13 years-old how to respect his gun and how to use it she says. When they found out Royce’s aunt couldn’t go out on the hunt they knew it was “kind of an initiation for him” she says.

“We had only two days to get these two elk.”

And it was all they needed.

“The moment I see those elk step out” says Royce. “I just thought I’d definitely be grateful to have one of those elk and be able to get this animal to provide for my family and my community.”

“Just being in my traditional territory and being able to do all that it’s a gift” he says.

They weren’t just working within their own three-day window of opportunity but they were also well aware of nature’s limitations.

“There’s only so long before a grizzly a cougar or a wolf picks up on that scent because they have a great sense of smell” Royce says. “They could pick up the scent of blood I think around two miles. And a grizzly or even a black bear is a huge animal.”

Robinson’s older son Brion demonstrated how to skin cut and pack up the elk leaving just its spine and guts to compost into the earth. Moving quickly while field dressing is a lot of work Robinson says and hauling out hundreds of pounds of meat even harder.

“It was up on a huge hill 450 yards in and up a slope” she says. “We had to hike in do all the field dressing quarter it and pack it out.”

A hind quarter can weigh around 150 pounds and Royce carried one out on his own.

“It takes lots of work to do all that especially in these clear cuts there’s lots of stumps shrubs and roots that get caught on everything and that just makes it so much more work to get it all over those” Robinson explains.

The family helped in packing the meat out and while they were excited they also stayed focused.

“You’ve got to pay attention to the surroundings because cougars and bears and all the predator animals out there could stalk you super easy and you just got to be ready for that” Royce says. “You got to make sure you know what you’re doing or things can obviously go wrong if you don’t.”

Royce acknowledges the hard work it takes to provide for his community and says he has a deeper understanding beyond just the activity itself.

“It’s a huge honour to put your hands into doing all that stuff. Like one second you see this huge beautiful animal and then being able to take it home and feed your family it’s just a great honor” he says. “I’m glad I have my family to show me how to do all that.”

Land as flesh

Robinson shot her first deer during the same trip to give to her community. They brought home two elk and five deer.

There was good medicine on this trip says Robisnon. Returning to the valley she grew up in to hunt with her own family during this very particular moment in time.

“It was like walking over my own ghost because I’m walking in areas where I grew up. We used to walk those roads as kids and just to be so quiet and feel the ancestors and take steps I hadn’t taken since I was eight” she says.

In later years whenever Robinson missed the land and wanted to go home to Toba her grandmother Rose would tell her to pinch herself.

“Pinch yourself. You ate off the land and that land is now part of your flesh. Take of your own land and make it become the flesh of your child and that land will forever call to your child” Robinson remembers the teaching of her grandmother.

This hunting trip included a visit to the graveyard and to her father who asked for his ashes to be brought home to Toba when he passed 6 years ago.

“I was raised to burn for my ancestors and for the ones that have passed” says Robinson.

“I burned with a thankfulness for the strength that we are able to be alive today for everything they went through good and bad — that they survived that we could survive and that they shared those teachings with us and the ability to hunt.”

It was a powerful moment for Robinson.

“Not everything was robbed from us and know that if you teach with love and you’re able to carry those things forward our youth will do it” she says. “It was really healing just a really powerful moment for my whole family.”

She thanks the ancestors and the Creator and she gives thanks for the teachings that were carried on.

“I knew my ancestors were watching over us and making sure nothing went wrong” says Royce. “Bringing the animal to us and I think they were they were definitely happy too we were burning them a plate of food and that’s when the rainbow went over the cemetery.”

Beyoncé just shared never-before-seen footage of her family on Instagram.

Beyoncé's New Year's Day video includes her twins Rumi and Sir.

The New Year is already off to a great start thanks to Beyoncé. Queen Bey released a surprise drop on Jan 1. And no it wasn't music. She shared never-before-seen footage of her kids including twins Rumi and Sir. There may or may not be footage of Rumi singing ""Savage Remix"" and it may or may not have made my day life.

""Cheers to a New Year Beyhive!! 🎆🎊 2020 divided us and united us. Most could not see loved ones and we felt too many losses but we were united by our humanity"" she captioned the video. ""This year for me has been about celebrating joy chasing happiness and living in love.""

She continued ""As we all look forward and pray for new beginnings my wish for you is that you honor yourself and those you love. Celebrate that you are an important individual who contributes to our beautiful collective. Here’s to a better and brighter 2021! Love B.""

The video is exactly four minutes long because of course it is. Beyoncé and Jay-Z have a huge thing for the number four. See Jay's 4:44 album Blue's name (four letters) and Bey and Jay's birthdays on Sept. 4 and Dec. 4 respectively. Her fans have flocked to the video's Instagram comments to express their gratitude. One user wrote ""Thank you so soo much for what you've done this year to uplift our spirit during these horrible moments in human history. I'm very proud of you!! Wishing you a prosperous life and a wonderful new year honey B!! 💓💓💓🐝🐝."" Another added ""SAVAGE REMIX PERFORMANCE IS COMING.""

OK now that really would be the best way to start 2021!

Posted on: January 2 2021 10:46h.

Last updated on: January 2 2021 03:47h.

Billionaire casino tycoons Sheldon Adelson and James Packer were spotted together during a New Year’s Eve bash in the French Caribbean. And that’s prompted speculation that Packer could be in discussions to sell his more than 36 percent stake in Crown Resorts to the Las Vegas Sands founder and CEO.

Sheldon Adelson’s yacht (above) and James Packer’s (below) were seen together over the New Year’s holiday. (Image: Getty/Benetti)

The UK’s Daily Telegraph broke the news that Adelson 87 and Packer 53 were celebrating the end of the most difficult year for their gaming businesses. The media outlet says Packer’s $200 million superyacht was docked next to Adelson’s $70 million Queen Miri. Tender boats were seen going back and forth from the yachts.

According to Forbes Adelson and Packer are respectively worth $36.3 billion and $3.4 billion. Adelson’s Sands owns casinos in Las Vegas Singapore and Macau. Packer’s Crown operates in his native Australia as well as Crown London Aspinalls.

Adelson Acquisition?

Packer’s Crown Resorts is amid an investigation in Sydney officials in New South Wales determining if the casino group is suitable to hold a gaming license in the Australian state. Crown Sydney a AUD$2.4 billion (USD$1.8 billion) integrated resort opened last week but with its casino on hold.

The New South Wales Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) is set to issue its verdict on Crown’s suitability sometime this month. Lawyers assisting in the ILGA Inquiry suggested that Packer isn’t suitable to be a close associate of Crown Resorts.

Though Packer no longer sits on the Crown board nor has any executive role he maintains a 36.8 percent stake in the company. During his ILGA testimony Packer conceded that he would sell his position in the casino group if that would allow Crown Sydney to maintain its gaming license.

Adelson is bullish on casinos located outside the United States. Sands sold the company’s only US casino not in Las Vegas — Sands Bethlehem in Pennsylvania – in 2018 for $1.3 billion. It’s also been reported that Sands is looking to sell its Las Vegas Strip properties — The Venetian and Palazzo.

Adelson has at least for the moment called off his company’s interest in investing in Japan. Gaming analysts believe the casino tycoon prefers acquisitions more than new construction. A Crown purchase would fall in line with that thinking and give Adelson two casinos in Australia — Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth — and possibly a third with Crown Sydney.

Crown Affair

As it awaits the NSW Inquiry verdict Crown Resorts is doing all it can to help prop up its public image. The company which has been accused of failing to prevent its casinos from being used to launder money recently changed its deposit rules for gamblers.

Crown also announced in November that it would only work with VIP junket groups that are fully licensed in the jurisdiction where its casinos are located. Crown appointed its first financial crimes officer too.

Critics say Crown’s efforts come too late.

“Crown has acted with impunity and arrogance for years” opined Tim Costello a reverend and CEO of World Vision Australia a nonprofit that advocates for the poor. “Now they are desperate to prove that they are a fit and proper organization.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

1 Kevin o el calvario de un inocente

A Kevin lo pusieron entre varios hombres completamente diferentes a él. Y la ley dice que para un reconocimiento las personas deben tener características físicas parecidas. Kevin era el más alto de los hombres. Había gordos chaparros trigueños y poco faltó para que pusieran un león un águila un mono y hasta un esqueleto.

Así a pesar de ser investigador autodidacta Jaume Llabrés (Es Capdellà 1954) se ha convertido en una de las voces más importantes a la hora de denunciar la falta de cuidado y de sensibilidad por parte de las instituciones hacia el patrimonio mallorquín un terreno que conoce bien gracias a su pasión por los tesoros de nuestra tierra. Además Llabrés coordina junto a Aina Pascual el proyecto cultural de las Caputxines.

En este 2020 se celebra el 25 aniversario del proyecto de rehabilitación de Ses Caputxines pero algunas actividades han quedado truncadas.

— El martes se tendría que haber inaugurado la exposición dedicada al fotógrafo Donald G. Murray con una presentación a cargo de Miquel Rayó y Aina Pascual coordinadora del proyecto y esposa de Murray. Hace tiempo que queríamos llevar a cabo esta muestra y rendirle un merecido homenaje pero debido a las circunstancias lo hemos aplazado. Sabemos que vendría mucha gente a ver la exposición y no era sostenible hacerla con grupos reducidos de seis personas. Así que la hemos aplazado hasta que la situación mejore y puedan venir grupos de al menos 15 personas.

¿Y el belén de las Caputxines?

— Este año no lo hemos podido mostrar pero lo haremos cuando se pueda y lo mantendremos algún tiempo para que se pueda visitar. Curiosamente el belén quedó confinado pues se suele desmontar pasada la Candelaria que es el 2 de febrero pero se nos hizo tarde y llegó el confinamiento. Hay que decir que debido al consumismo que vivimos muchos no saben que el belén no se inaugura hasta la noche del 24 de diciembre y que se desmonta por la Candelaria. Cada uno puede hacerlo como quiera pero es verdad que hay un gran desconocimiento de la escenografía sacra. En el caso de las Caputxines no nos ceñimos tanto al protocolo porque ofrecemos un servicio cultural al público y cada año menos este claro nos visitan muchas escuelas con lo que lo tenemos preparado antes de las fiestas.

Sus artículos de Última Hora llaman la atención a muchos lectores.

— Los que tienen más éxito son los de denuncia. Por ejemplo el que escribí sobre Can Balaguer en el que decía que han hecho un pastiche y un montaje. Lo que pasa es que muchos no tienen ni idea de como es una casa señorial. También tuvieron mucho eco los que hice sobre el Castell de Bellver cuya museografía es una vergüenza. El Ajuntament de Palma es la institución que reúne más críticas.

Otra de sus grandes reclamos es la creación de un museo de artes decorativas.

— Sí porque en Mallorca tenemos un importantísimo patrimonio de muebles cerámicas y artes decorativas. Las casas señoriales se van vaciando algo que ya sucedía en el siglo XX pero que en los últimos años se ha radicalizado. O lo venden o salen a subasta en otras ciudades y ni nos enteramos. Y es una fuga constante de piezas muchas veces interesantísimas. Lo más triste es que las instituciones están insensibles frente a esto. Hablan mucho de patrimonio pero no realmente no creen en ello. Por otra parte tengo que decir que Kika Coll la directora insular de Patrimoni del Consell tiene conocimientos de la materia y mucha sensibilidad. Al menos se esfuerza por hacer las cosas bien. Pero esto tiene que empezar desde Francina Armengol Catalina Cladera y José Hila hasta los alcaldes de los municipios. Si no no sirve mucho.

¿Qué otros asuntos están pendientes?

— Además de Bellver y el museo de artes decorativas está el abandono del Casal Can Serra y quedan muchas restauraciones por llevar a cabo: la iglesia de Santa Creu las Torres del Temple o la sala capitular del convento de Santa Margalida.

Además está el asunto de declarar Palma como Patrimoni de la Humanitat que bien lo merece aunque si eso significa que se masifique todavía más prefiero que no. Palma se está convirtiendo en un decorado y no quiero que muera de éxito como ha sucedido con la Serra de Tramuntana que soporta una presión humana enorme. Y la lonja...

¿Qué sucede con la Lonja?

— Está abierta al público pero los paneles informativos que hay son muy pobres para la grandeza de este monumento. Además muchos no lo saben pero la Lonja que por cierto no tiene nada que ver con la venta de pescado forma parte de un conjunto junto al huerto y el Consolat. Tendrían que poder visitarse como un conjunto completo y no como partes independientes.",,,,,,,,,

One hundred ninety-one residential units will be produced all to be sold as affordable housing for older citizens. Lennar Corporation is responsible for the development.

Sixteen of the buildings are planned for residential use while one will be a 3350 square foot community building offering amenities and space for social gatherings. Permits also describe open space provided drive-aisles uncovered parking and other site improvements. The senior housing will take up a vacant 8-acre portion of the sprawling Northlake development.

The massive master-development was previously known as the Greenbriar site managed by Integral Communities. But both the project name and developers have changed with Lennar now responsible for much of the construction. Reporting from the Sacramento Business Journal’s Emily Hamann tells that the senior housing is being proposed by Sacramento-based St. Anton Capital in collaboration with the project developers. SFYIMBY is not able to confirm that information at the time of publication.

The area is north of the city center by the Sacramento International Airport. Construction will cost $18.6 million and an estimated completion date has not been announced.

The historic Sherwin warehouse along Horton was the only building persevered when the former Sherwin-Williams paint factory was demolished in 2006. The building once supported the iconic “Cover The Earth” neon sign whose history we spotlighted last year.

The 3-story building consisting of 72000 square feet and is part of a larger 7.9 acre FDP that will include 500 housing units over two acres of park space ground floor commercial space the continuation of the Greenway and the city-funded bike/ped bridge to Bay Street.

DES Architects presented their plans to renovate and modernize the building to attract Life Science startups and office tenants.

The most dramatic update for the building will be the creation of a pass through “Alley” at 45th street allowing bicycle & pedestrian thoroughfare and breaking up the super-block the long structure created. The feature was a concession to neighbors of the 45th Street Artists’ Cooperative giving them more convenient access to the forthcoming park space.

The pass through will also include recessed linear downlighting and illuminated bollards. Renovations will also include street and landscaping improvements accessibility updates and roof screens to obscure the unsightly ventilation and mechanical equipment.

Shortly after the plans were approved a sale of the building was announced between Lennar Multifamily and Chicago-based Walton Street Capital. The deal was facilitated by New York-based Commercial Real Estate broker the The Newmark Group.

“1450 Sherwin represents a rare opportunity for an investor to acquire a fully-entitled large block vacancy with the ideal foundation for life science repositioning in one of the region’s hottest life science markets” Newmark’s Head of Northern California Capital Markets Steven Golubchik stated in a press release.

According to Newmark Walton Street Capital is actively acquiring and seeking acquisition of other Life Science opportunities located within the primary bay area clusters.

Emeryville appears to be in a strong position to build on its place as a hub for the flourishing Life Sciences sector. In addition to this project the city has seen the recent completion of the EmeryStation West tower approved plans for the Public Market’s Parcel B as well as the sale of the nearby Novartis property to BioMed Realty with plans to build another 561K square feet of office space.

When completed these projects will extend the Berkeley-Emeryville Biotech Corridor that already contains more than 150 life science companies.

According to Newmark research the Northern East Bay life sciences “footprint” totals over four million square feet and represents 15% of the total Bay Area market. They collectively boast an availability rate of just 5.6% with a current tenant demand of 630000 square feet.

Despite these difficult times Andrea Bocelli has managed to continue giving a series of live-streamed concerts throughout the year. Most recently the Italian tenor performed on Christmas Day at Basilica di San Francesco in Assisi. Inside the beautiful building the 62-year-old sang Dolce è Sentire (Fratello Sole Sorella Luna) from his new album Believe.

Below the official video St Francis of Assisi’s poetry is quoted: “How sweet it is to know I’m no longer alone / but part of an immense life / that shines resplendent and generous around me / a gift from Him from His immense love.” An accompanying statement by Bocelli reads: “This sung prayer of Franciscan inspiration is a small masterpiece set to a tune by my dear departed friend Riz Ortolani. “A piece that is intense and moving in its melodic simplicity that speaks to the wonder of creation referencing the Canticle of the Sun created eight centuries ago by the Holy poet of Assisi. “And from Assisi to the notes of Dolce Sentire I hope that this music may be a balm for all your hearts as well as offering the revolutionary force of the Christian message.” READ MORE: Andrea Bocelli interview EXCLUSIVE about 'emotional' concert with daughter

Freddie Mercury died 30 years ago this year and just a few months later Queen members Brian May Roger Taylor and John Deacon put on a charity gig in his honour. The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for AIDS Awareness featured a whole host of rock stars performing with Queen from George Michael and David Bowie to Elton John and Robert Plant. The filmed version was on Sky Arts over Christmas and May was rewatching the memorable occasion.

May posted clips on Instagram commenting: “I‘m watching our Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert - so strange for so many reasons. “Already so long ago now - we look so young - and all those lovely performers with us…many of them now gone to the place where Freddie went before. “And of course we were only just beginning to get used to the fact that Freddie would no longer be able to do this wonderful thing with us any more. Of course it felt like he was with us on this amazing night.” But there was one particular performance that the 73-year-old said he would take to his grave.

Evans took a leave of absence that began Dec. 1 “to address health issues unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic” according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing by the company. She previously took medical leave in September 2019 due to a cancer diagnosis according to Reuters.

Greg Ulmer who leads the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program has filled in as head of Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics unit in the interim.

“Throughout her career Michele led some of the most important programs that ensure the security of our nation and its allies and help make our world a safer place” Lockheed CEO Jim Taiclet said. “She embodied our company’s values in spirit and action every day — to do what’s right respect others and perform with excellence. Her example was an inspiration to those of us fortunate enough to have worked with her closely and her leadership in the aerospace and defense industry will have a lasting impact for years to come.”

Michele A. Evans Lockheed Martin’s executive vice president for aeronautics died Jan. 1 the company announced Jan. 2. Evans went on medical leave Nov. 17 due to an unnamed illness which the company said was a “non-COVID related medical issue.” Gregory M. Ulmer Lockheed F-35 vice president and program manager had been adding Evans’ duties to his own since Dec. 1 and will continue in that capacity until a permanent successor is named.

Evans 54 succeeded Orlando P. Carvalho as VP of aeronautics in 2018 having been his deputy. The Aero business is a $20 billion enterprise with about 25000 employees and includes the C-5 C-130 F-16 F-22 F-35 and U-2 product lines as well as unmanned aerial systems and other intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance systems. She also oversaw the company’s Skunk Works advanced development company.

On her watch the company successfully transitioned its F-16 production work from Fort Worth Texas to Greenville S.C.; negotiated lower unit costs with the government for the F-35 fighter and oversaw additional F-35 foreign sales. She also presided over Lockheed’s offer of an F-35 performance-based logistics contract with the government—which so far has not been accepted—and led Aero to winning several hypersonics contracts. Evans also built stronger ties with Airbus to offer that company’s Multi-Role Tanker Transport for U.S Air Force service.

Evans had a 34-year career in the aerospace and defense industry. At Lockheed she was VP and general manager of integrated warfare systems and sensors as well as VP for C4ISR and undersea systems businesses and VP for business development in mission systems and training. She had been responsible for Lockheed’s A-10 business and for avionics on the C-130 and F-35 programs and the Littoral Combat Ship. The company said she was the executive manager “on multiple domestic and international campaign wins.” She also served as the Chairman of the Board of a Lockheed-Sikorsky joint venture providing logistics support for maritime H-60 helicopters.

Former Lockheed CEO Marillyn A. Hewson upon Evans’ appointment to the Aero job in 2018 noted Evans’ record of leadership and said her appointment “demonstrates the importance of our talent development and succession planning.”

Evans held a Bachelors of Science in mechanical engineering cum laude from Clarkson University and served on the board of the Smithsonian’s National Air & Space Museum. She was also “actively involved in Lockheed Martin’s diversity and inclusion initiatives serving as the executive sponsor for the Women’s Impact Network and Leadership Forum” the company said in a press release.

The two companies announced the deal on Dec. 20.



Bethesda Md.-based Lockheed Martin said the acquisition will enhance its expertise in propulsion technology.



The company said propulsion systems manufactured by Aerojet Rocketdyne are already a part of the Lockheed Martin supply chain.



“Each of our business areas works with Aerojet Rocketdyne products and we believe that integrating their capabilities across our Lockheed Martin offerings will improve manufacturing processes create cost savings for our customers and drive efficiency on behalf of shareholders” Chief Executive James Taiclet said in a Dec. 21 call with investors.



Aerojet Rocketdyne Chief Executive Eileen Drake said the acquisition “represents a natural next phase” for the company and a chance to “accelerate” the two companies’ efforts in the defense and space exploration spheres.



What remains to be seen is whether federal regulators will approve the deal which would give Lockheed Martin control over production of propulsion systems used by competitors.



Taiclet downplayed the possibility of antitrust issues with the merger pointing out that regulators allowed a similar merger between Northrop Grumman Corp. and rocket systems manufacturer Orbital ATK in 2018.



“Our overall expectation is that may be the same lens through which this transaction is viewed” Taiclet said.



Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. analyst Ken Herbert called the proposed merger “highly strategic” for Lockheed Martin in a note to investors following the announcement.



Herbert said the acquisition is an attempt by Lockheed Martin “to bolster its industrial supplier base” in light of the fact that Aerojet Rocketdyne “is currently one of Lockheed’s most crucial suppliers.”



Aerojet Rocketdyne formed through the 2013 merger of veteran aerospace firms Aerojet and Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (the latter a successor firm to Canoga Park-based Rocketdyne).



Both Rocketdyne and Aerojet were once among the nation’s largest Cold War-era rocket manufacturers and both firms worked on rocket engines and launch vehicles used by NASA for its lunar landing and space shuttle programs.



Business declined across the aerospace sector in the decades leading up to the merger of the two companies and Rocketdyne’s Canoga Park plant shut down in 2013.



Aerojet Rocketdyne’s current headquarters is located less than 2 miles from Lockheed Martin’s El Segundo office close to the Los Angeles Air Force Base. Lockheed Martin which formed in 1995 with the merger of Lockheed and Martin Marietta also has close ties to the Los Angeles area.



For most of the 20th century Lockheed based its operations in Burbank though its manufacturing facility there closed in the early 1990s.



Under terms of the acquisition deal Lockheed Martin will pay $56 per share which the company says will be reduced to $51 per share following payment of a special dividend to Aerojet Rocketdyne shareholders. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTAxLTAyL21pY2hlbGUtZXZhbnMtbG9ja2hlZWQtbWFydGluLWFlcm9uYXV0aWNzLW9mZmljaWFsLWRpZXMtYXQtNTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michele Evans Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Official Dies at 55,"Michele Evans  a top executive at Lockheed Martin Corp. who worked with major weapons systems died on Jan. 1 the aerospace company announced.

The company announced on Dec. 21 that it acquired the 215-room Miramonte Resort & Spa in Indian Wells for an undisclosed sum.



“Lowe’s acquisition of Miramonte demonstrates our confidence in the strength of the Coachella Valley hospitality market which has continued to be a popular destination throughout the pandemic for visitors seeking a relaxing getaway or a beautiful remote working environment” Lowe Executive Vice President Matt Walker said in a statement.



Across its 11 acres the Tuscany-themed resort has three pools multiple restaurants and a 12000-square-foot spa. The Miramonte’s low-rise buildings could put it at an advantage with travelers.



Experts predict low-slung buildings will be popular post-pandemic as some people will avoid high-rise buildings which traditionally have a single lobby that can get crowded with guests trickling in and out.

Lowe is aiming to reopen the Miramonte which has been closed since March in early 2021. Lowe’s wholly owned subsidiary CoralTree Hospitality will manage the resort.



“The Miramonte Resort & Spa is a stunning property that offers a sophisticated yet quintessential California casual resort experience for visitors to the greater Palm Springs area” Rob Lowe co-chief executive of Lowe said in a statement. “Lowe has several decades of experience in Coachella Valley including as operator of Miramonte Resort & Spa. We are thrilled to be involved with this property again and our history with the asset uniquely positions Lowe to successfully guide Miramonte’s reopening.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvamFuLzAzL0Zyb20tdGhlLVN0YWNrcy1Bbi1pbi1kZXB0aC1sb29rLWF0LXRoZS1saWZlLW9mLWFuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From the Stacks: An in-depth look at the life of an '80s heartthrob,"As a child of the 1980s I am quite familiar with all the teen idols of my day.

While grocery shopping with my mom as a young teenager I could easily be spotted trying to flip open the pages of Tiger Beat to catch a glimpse of the heartthrobs of the day: Rick Springfield Ralph Macchio Emilio Estevez and of course Rob Lowe.

S.E. Hinton's wildly popular coming of age novel ""The Outsiders"" (1967) was one of the most gripping books I had read at the tender age of 12. Imagine how enthralled I was when the movie was made in the same year I had actually read the book. Naturally the film was cast with many of the most handsome talented actors of the '80s. Rob Lowe's portrayal of Sodapop Curtis was impossible not to swoon over.

Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of ""The Outsiders"" launched the beginning of a long career for Lowe of mostly (if I'm honest) mediocre films: ""Hotel New Hampshire"" ""Oxford Blues"" ""St. Elmo's Fire"" ""About Last Night"" ""Wayne's World"" and the Austin Powers films. Lowe also starred in the critically acclaimed NBC political drama ""The West Wing"" as Deputy Communications Director Sam Seaborn. It was well done and a favorite show of mine in the early 2000s.

As a reader I was intrigued when Lowe wrote his autobiography ""Stories I Only Tell My Friends: An Autobiography"" in 2011. It received good press and favorable reviews. Recently while browsing the Missouri River Regional Library's hoopla app I noticed the book was available in audiobook and read by Lowe himself.

I decided to give it a listen.

I would never argue Lowe is a great actor and in fact I am embarrassed to admit I find him irresistibly handsome. After listening to Lowe's life story it's now clear to me he was often judged and dismissed as someone who had nothing to offer beyond his looks.

Don't underestimate him.

Lowe's writing is solid and interesting. His narration is great. The book is equal parts celebrity dish and personal revelation. Lowe has overcome his share of personal hardships ranging from a strange and troubled childhood to a battle with alcoholism in his 20s. Lowe is proud of his 30-year marriage and the two sons he and his wife have lovingly raised together.

The strength of character Lowe demonstrates as he navigates the life of a Hollywood star and his ongoing search for meaning made this nine-hour audiobook time well spent. This book's appeal is perhaps somewhat limited to those who remember the Brat Pack and for those who do there is plenty to ponder and enjoy.

One vacation in Palm Springs and Paul Lowe was hooked. “It can’t get any more exotic you know what I mean?” he says. “Palm trees and the desert and the colors and the cactus — it’s magical.”

So three years ago despite plans to be snowbirds Lowe and his husband moved here and became full-time residents.

Lowe discovered ceramics about five years ago in much the same fortuitous way.

Originally from Oslo Norway the food stylist turned independent magazine publisher had been living in New York for a decade. While developing a story for his magazine Sweet Paul he envisioned a plate with a particular shape that he wanted to use for the photo shoot. But he couldn’t find one. Committed to the idea he signed up for a ceramics course and decided to make it himself. “It was that moment when you’re like ‘Oh my God!

He will make a little more history as the first Trojan to wear No. 0 next season. The NCAA committee approved in spring the ability for players to wear No. 0 moving forward to cut down on numerous players with single digit numbers.

“The Football Rules Committee recommended this adjustment to reduce the confusion caused by multiple players wearing the same number” the announcement read. “Allowing more than two players with the same number has created confusion for the game officials and has made scouting opponents difficult. To respond to the popularity of single-digit numbers players can wear '0’ as a legal number.”

Per the USC media guide it does not appear that any Trojan has ever donned the number. USC teased the future jersey number for Foreman with Saturday's edits:

The 6-foot-4 256-pound Foreman is rated the No. 1 overall prospect the No. 1 strong-side defensive end and the No. 1 recruit in California according to the 247Sports Composite. He is the No. 2 overall prospect in the 247Sports rankings. He is the first No. 1 overall prospect to sign with USC since 2009 (QB Matt Barkley).

After missing the past two-plus seasons with a knee injury Chicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball has exercised the $21.4 million option on his contract for the 2024-25 season sources told ESPN on Saturday.

Ball has undergone three surgeries on his left knee the most recent a cartilage transplant in 2023. There remains some guarded hope that he could return next season but there are no assurances that the damaged knee will allow for him to play again.

Ball 26 signed an original four-year $80 million deal as part of a sign-and-trade with New Orleans in the summer of 2021. After a fantastic start that had the Bulls leading the Eastern Conference in 2021-22 Ball averaged 13.0 points 5.4 rebounds 5.1 assists and 1.8 steals before a knee injury 35 games into the season.

His inactivity has caused his contract to become a blight on the Bulls' salary cap.

For one night only this weekend it also had Madonna.

More than a million people thronged Copacabana beach on Saturday night turning its vast stretch of sand into a massive dancefloor for a free concert by the pop star as she completed her world tour.

“Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world” Madonna 65 told the tightly packed crowd. Pointing out the ocean view and the mountains she added: “This place is magic.”

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

It’s safe to say I sprinted to checkout when I saw this Maidenform bralette is marked down to just $16 from its usual $34 cost. The style features flattering wirefree cups and a longline silhouette for added smoothing and security. When it comes to its lift and support the bra delivers “an instant breast lift” according to one reviewer who added that it’s “so comfortable” and “not too bulky” plus that it “looks good enough to wear on its own.” If you’re still not sold take it from a second shopper who deemed it the “best bra ever.”

Head to Amazon to snag these comfy bras while they’re still available for as little as $14.

Biden has yet to announce his April numbers.

During their presentation details of which were first reported by The New York Times the Trump campaign officials argued that Trump is in a strong position heading into the final six months of the race. They maintained that he is solidly ahead in three states that will play a major role in determining the outcome of the election — Georgia Nevada and Arizona. The most competitive battlegrounds they contended are Michigan Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. They also said they would aim to expand the map into Minnesota and Virginia Democratic-leaning states where they said private polling showed Trump running competitively with Biden.

The retreat which is being held at the Four Seasons hotel in Palm Beach Florida comes as Trump is in the middle of his hush-money trial in New York. The case has complicated Trump’s campaign plans forcing him to be in court four days per week. The Trump aides however contended that Trump was still managing to maintain an aggressive schedule. The former president they said will in the coming weeks hold fundraisers in Kentucky New York Nevada Houston and Dallas. He is also planning an upcoming rally in New Jersey and a speech in Washington D.C.

The Trump campaign also addressed a private meeting it had with a group of outside Trump-aligned organizations on Friday. The campaign is looking to collaborate with pro-Trump outfits such as Turning Point USA on voter canvassing efforts. The Federal Election Commission recently relaxed rules on how campaigns and allied groups can coordinate on door-knocking and voter turnout initiatives."

Those that have been able to operate have had to deal with social distancing and enhanced cleaning measures alongside customer demand at a fraction of normal levels.

New openings have been pushed back and some properties that were brave enough to start trading found themselves having to close their doors shortly afterwards as was the case with the Nobu Portman Square.

But as we enter 2021 there is optimism with the pending rollout of vaccines and there is likely to be a spurt of new openings in the spring as delayed projects finally come online. Here we take a look at some of the new hotels which did manage to open in 2020 and those set to be unveiled in 2021 and beyond.

Given the current situation details listed below are subject to change.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9hZnRlci1jb3ZpZC13ZS1tYXktbmV2ZXItdGhpbmstYWJvdXQtaG90ZWxzLWluLXRoZS1zYW1lLXdheS1hZ2Fpbi0xNTEzNzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After COVID we may never think about hotels in the same way again,"In Australia New Zealand and around the world COVID has turned luxury and semi-luxury hotels into quarantine facilities.

Among the four and five-star hotels reported as having been used for temporary detention are Sydney’s Intercontinental Marriott Hyatt Regency Sheraton Grand Sofitel Wentworth and Novotel Darling Harbour; Auckland’s Rydges Crowne Plaza Grand Millennium Four Points by Sheraton and Ramada; and Melbourne’s Stamford Plaza Mercure Park Royal and Rydges on Swanston.

Each has had a valuable brand name.

Governments prefer four and five-star hotels to small ones because they are large (200 rooms or more) and easier to run as quarantine facilities.

It’s hard to blame the big international hotels for taking part. Without income from international tourists they’ve needed the money.

But by taking the money and becoming known as places where people are locked up at times cross-infected and fed food ranging from “nice” to “atrocious” they run the risk of destroying brands that took decades to build.

‘Associative interference’

It would happen through a process known as associative interference where it becomes difficult to focus on old and relevant information about something because new and less-relevant information gets attached to it and gets in the way.

A recent memory of something much less glamorous can contaminate a lifetime of memories associating a brand or an experience with luxury.

This can happen both at the general level (“hotels are no longer a place I am particularly keen to spend time in even five-star ones”) and at a specific level (“this particular brand that I always associated with quality I now associate with something less savoury”).

JAMES ROSS/AAP

In New Zealand the names of hotels designated as COVID-19 facilities are announced in press conferences published on an official website and reported in the media.

In Australia it’s more hit and miss. Word spreads about the hotels being used especially when things go wrong even though some seem reluctant to confirm their status.

How damaging could it be?

Brands such as Intercontinental Sheraton Hyatt Rydges and Ramada might be tempted to take comfort from the experience of Corona the brand of beer.

It ended the year with its sales intact despite initial concerns. But its only association with coronavirus was a name.

Hotels have been linked to COVID and detention in real life.

Some have been likened to prisons.

Read more: Another day another hotel quarantine fail. So what can Australia learn from other countries?

One way for COVID hotels to lessen the COVID taint would be to flood people’s memories with something else – their original positioning as places of luxury.

A massive advertising and public relations campaign reinforcing the earlier themes of opulence and quality might in time overwhelm the association with quarantine and restore the image the brands once had.

If all else fails change the name

If the new taint still sticks there’s an alternative. It’s to abandon the name.

It’s a manoeuvre with an impressive history.

After years of trying to live down Britain’s worst nuclear disaster the Windscale power plant and reprocessing facility changed its name to Sellafield in 1981.

The tobacco giant Philip Morris became Altria Group in 2003 and this year Adani Mining became Bravus Mining in a victory of sorts for opponents of its Queensland coal mine. Australia’s much-criticised Newstart unemployment benefit became JobSeeker.

A new name with no lineage might be better than a familiar one that calls forth memories of 2020.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vaG9zcGl0YWxpdHkuZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hvdGVscy93ZS1oYXZlLXNlZW4tYS1zdXJnZS1pbi1ib29raW5ncy1yb2hpdC1iYWpwYWkvODAwNzEwODTSAXdodHRwczovL2hvc3BpdGFsaXR5LmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvaG90ZWxzL3dlLWhhdmUtc2Vlbi1hLXN1cmdlLWluLWJvb2tpbmdzLXJvaGl0LWJhanBhaS84MDA3MTA4NA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We have seen a surge in bookings: Rohit Bajpai,"The 115 key Sheraton Grand Palace Indore is set on 8.62 acres of gardens in the city of Indore and as one would expect from its scale has sprawling facilities for events and meetings—adding up to almost 125000 square feet.



ETHospitalityWorld spoke with Rohit Bajpai General Manager of the hotel to find out a little about his market and the general outlook in 2021.



Indore which is sometimes called mini Mumbai is the business capital of Madhya Pradesh Bajpai said adding that his hotel was perfectly placed for the multicultural canvas of the city and its people.





“Looking at the recent trend of our sales the next few months look optimistic for Sheraton Grand Hotel. After reopening in October 2020 the first few days were fairly slow. However the hotel picked up its pace after the wedding season arrived. Since then the hotel has seen a surge in bookings. Even though the number of guests arriving at each wedding have drastically reduced due to government guidelines and safety purposes Sheraton Grand Hotel has majorly been experiencing busy days” Bajpai said.

Weddings celebrations were also observed during off seasons and odd dates. This was mainly because many had to be rescheduled due to the pandemic to the last quarter of this year he added.“Apart from weddings a number of locals are opting for staycations. However the number of out of towners have significantly reduced. Domestic and international travel rules and regulations have significantly changed and this has without a doubt left an impact on our hotel. Nevertheless as noticed in the past few weeks we have been seeing an increase in out of towners visiting the hotel and are expecting this number to rise steadily in the upcoming months” he added.From an operational point of view the hotel follows the ‘Commitment to clean’ programme which is a branded initiative of Marriott Hotels  that focuses on 5 key points in order to adhere with the WHO guidelines for the new normal.“We ensure ‘Contactless Service’ in all areas. From check-in/check-out to valet/dining. Sheraton Grand Palace Indore is sanitised every day. We especially prioritize high touch points like telephones switches handles car handles etc. Our cars are also sanitised after pick-up/drop of each guest” Bajpai elaborated.The hotel maintains top-notch associate hygiene in all departments. All staff along with wearing masks and gloves undergo a strenuous hygiene personal training program. Service is highly planned and managed beforehand in order to ensure social distancing he said adding that every guest entering the hotel is provided with a fresh mask and has to compulsorily get their temperature checked. All handbags and suitcases are carefully sanitised as well.“This process is ended with a job specifically designed to maintain these protocols.

The announcement to acquire more African operations came after the company completed the acquisition of AF’s brokerage business including the company’s South African brokerage business risk services and related ancillary operations in Botswana and Namibia recently.

Efforts to get a comment from Alexander Forbes managing director proved futile as he was reportedly held up in meetings.

But it's spent the past few decades working on becoming much more than a card-payment processor.

To that end it's just joined its engineering and product teams under the leadership of a new chief product officer Craig Vosburg. He'll oversee thousands of employees who work on user-focused design and will be tasked with driving growth in new areas for Mastercard including non-card payments open banking initiatives and Mastercard Labs the company's R&D arm.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""If you think about the company from its earliest beginnings more than 50 years ago we appeared on the scene as effectively a card company that was enabling consumer credit transactions"" Vosburg told Insider.

But the company has added new use cases including business and commercial payments. And it's also expanded the payment types it supports to include real-time payments peer-to-peer and blockchain-enabled transactions.

On top of these various payments ""rails"" Mastercard has added things like data-sharing services and fraud monitoring leveraging the wealth of data it already has from its business and consumer end users.

""We've evolved who we think of as our customer to be not just the bank and their consumer but merchants governments digital players fintechs and companies large and small"" Vosburg said.

It's all a part of Mastercard's strategy to be involved in any and every payment flow globally which has meant a full evolution of its bread-and-butter business. Rival processor Visa too is vocal about its ambitions beyond cards looking to become what it calls a ""network of networks.""

Mastercard's goals in combining engineering and product are twofold. One is to get closer to its customers and understand where it should invest in its platform. The second is to help Mastercard meet evolving customer needs more nimbly and more efficiently Vosburg said.

""The closer we bring the technology and the product capabilities to the market and to our partners and customers the more effectively we think we'll be able to serve them with the kinds of speed and adaptability that the market today requires"" Vosburg said.

Vosburg formerly head of North America at Mastercard is CPO effective January. He'll be succeeded by Linda Kirkpatrick a long-time exec at Mastercard who currently oversees Mastercard's US issuer business.

Vosburg is laser-focused on uniting Mastercard's entire payments stack

In a year where consumers and merchants by necessity moved online the long-standing trend toward digital payments and cash displacement accelerated. Shifts that experts expected to happen over the next several years have happened in a matter of months. And keeping up with the growth in new digital payments has informed much of Mastercard and other payments players' product strategies.

""The events of 2020 have served to both validate the path we were on as far as our strategic priorities and accelerate the need for us to execute against that path"" Vosburg said.

As consumers increasingly pay using more than just cards and cash players like Mastercard have no choice but to build out their processing capabilities to support things like account-to-account payments and buy now pay later transactions.

To be sure many consumer use cases still default to card-based payments which includes contactless options like digital wallets. But Mastercard sees a big opportunity to use its non-card payment capabilities to grow its business customer base especially when it comes to companies paying each other quickly and keeping tabs on their accounts.

""A lot of the early opportunities that we're targeting with those capabilities focus on the B2B space which is one we're particularly excited about"" Vosburg said. ""Non-card rails we think bring a lot of value to B2B payments particularly accounts payables for corporates.""

For businesses speed and accuracy of money movement through automation is crucial to keeping costs low. To that end Mastercard is building out more tools for businesses in addition to processing payments.

""These are all things where real-time payments fast ACH blockchain and account-to-account can all play a role"" Vosburg said. ""That's an area that we're targeting for development of applications to go after those use cases.""

And Vosburg envisions growth in this area over a period of decades.

""It'll be a decades-long journey as the consumer cards journey has been a decades-long one starting more than 50 years ago"" Vosburg said.

With its Finicity deal closed data is now a big focus for Mastercard

As consumers' financial lives are increasingly fragmented across various banks and apps financial data has become top-of-mind for all players. Fintechs need access to financial data which is usually stored in banks. Sitting between fintechs and banks are data aggregators like Finicity Plaid and Yodlee which provide the data pipes.

With the proliferation of digital finance open banking and open finance have become top-of-mind for all players in the market Mastercard included. Open banking refers to access to bank data like account numbers and balances. Open finance is broader including more pieces of consumers' financial lives such as payroll insurance credit cards and investments.

In November Mastercard closed its $825 million acquisition Finicity. Visa announced plans to acquire Plaid in January but the deal has since been halted by the DOJ which says Visa's deal was an attempt to squash a competitor.

""I see open banking as something that is certainly taking on greater importance"" Vosburg said.

In Europe it's largely been regulators driving open banking standards whereas in the US data sharing standards are being set more so in the private sector.

""Interestingly because I think it's been driven by market dynamics you see a variation in approaches"" Vosburg said. ""It's early stage. It's a very competitive and dynamic field.""

Currently aggregators like Plaid and Yodlee are standing up separate data-sharing agreements with the country's largest banks and the terms of each agreement vary. Then there's Akoya a newer aggregator in the space backed by the banks themselves that's looking to offer a single data connection across the banks it signs on to its platform. US Bank was the first to sign on to Akoya's platform in November.

Industry-wide groups like FDX for example are setting technical standards for data management via APIs. The CFPB announced plans to issue rules on data sharing agreements requesting input from all players in the industry through the beginning of next year.

Now with Finicity Mastercard will have a larger part to play in those discussions.

""We see great promise and value for Mastercard in playing a role in that space in part because it's a space that would benefit from having a trusted intermediary in helping to facilitate flows of data in the right way"" Vosburg said.

Fintechs also need partnerships with processors like Mastercard if they want to offer card products. And Mastercard has doubled down on its fintech outreach creating a new team earlier this year to manage the relationships with up-and-coming digital players. In 2020 Mastercard won over fintechs like Brex Dave and SoFi from Visa.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vd2VtYS1iYW5rLWludHJvZHVjZXMtbmV3LWRvbGxhci1kZWJpdC1jYXJkL9IBQ2h0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vd2VtYS1iYW5rLWludHJvZHVjZXMtbmV3LWRvbGxhci1kZWJpdC1jYXJkLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wema Bank introduces new dollar debit card,"Joseph Olaoluwa

The chip cards are compatible with EMV standards as well as the standards of international card organisations such as Visa MasterCard JCB and UnionPay.International card-issuing organisations have asked Vietnamese banks to switch to chip cards that meet EMV standards to increase safety amidst a growing number of information thefts. Security experts have also warned Vietnam’s delayed transition to chip technology could put the country at risk of becoming a haven for card criminals from around the world as it is among the dwindling number of countries where magnetic swipe cards are still prevalent.Commercial banks are in the process of switching over to the new cards because of their stronger security features. However some banks say the switch faces multiple barriers. They will have to upgrade their technology and replace ATMs and POS terminals with newer ones compatible with chip cards.Another major challenge is that many users have been reluctant to have their cards replaced by chip-based ones though many notices have been issued by the bank regarding this issue.As of the end of the third quarter of 2020 Vietnam had about 93.78 million bank cards in circulation with the majority magnetic strip cards with weak security features and easily hacked.According to the SBV’s roadmap 100 percent of bank cards will be chip-based and 100 percent of ATMs and POS terminals will be altered to accept chip cards by the end of 2021.Besides ensuring greater payment security the replacement is also among the central bank’s plans to promote non-cash payment methods. Under the Government’s strategy by the end of 2025 at least 80 percent of adults in Vietnam are hoped to have bank accounts and the number of non-cash transactions will expand by 20-25 percent annually./.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZpbmFuY2UvYnJhYy1ib3NzLXRvLWNvbW1pc3Npb24tbXVsdGktYmlsbGlvbi1lZHVjYXRpb24tc2NoZW1lLTE1NDE3NjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brac boss to commission multi-billion education scheme,"A visiting World Brac Microfinance President Sir Fazle Hasan Abed will commission a US$47million (about Shs122billion) education scheme for vulnerable children in Uganda.

The scheme is funded by MasterCard foundation an independent private foundation based in Canada.

In Uganda it is being implemented by Brac an international micro finance institution.

The scheme aims at enabling 5000 students get free education.

“We want to assist young people because they constitute the biggest assets Uganda has today and are the future” Sir Abed said upon arriving at Entebbe Airport.

He said: “We want to scale innovative microfinance programmes in Africa to improve the lives of people living in poverty.”

He said they have been looking for under-privileged but bright students to enable them get quality education. Those who have been identified according to Sir Abed have enrolled in different schools around the country.

Sir Abed says the scheme will emerge as the face of a changing Uganda – a new generation of mentors role models policy makers entrepreneurs civil servants and leaders who can combine their intellect with empathy and humility to build the country’s future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzb3V0aGFmcmljYW4uY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS91cy1hZHVsdC1tb3ZpZS1pbmR1c3RyeS13b3JyaWVkLXN0aWZmLW92ZXItdnAtZWxlY3QtaGFycmlzLWFudGktcG9ybi1jcnVzYWRlLXNheWluZy1sb2Fkcy10by1jb21lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US adult movie industry worried stiff over VP-elect Harris' anti-porn crusade saying loads to come,"An American porn star is raising fears over vice-president-elect Kamala Harris’ history of pounding the industry saying they are “terrified” of what’s to come.

In a crunching opinion piece published by the Daily Beast adult film star Cherie DeVille laid bare why many in the adult industry are worried stiff about the election of Harris saying she will bring a “lifetime of animosity toward sex workers” to the White House.

The veteran adult actress says porn stars have been raising concerns about Harris since her time as San Francisco district attorney from 2004 to 2011.

DeVille blasted Harris for opposing a San Francisco ballot initiative to legalize prostitution and for trying to prosecute the owners of a classified ad website.

She says the US Vice-President-elect continued her crusade when elected to the Senate resulting in legislation that anyone who posts an online sex work ad can now be jailed.

“In the name of protecting women Harris has pushed sex workers back onto dangerous street corners.”

‘Visa and Mastercard dictate what porn they want‘

DeVille explained that porn performers’ fears are compounded by the fact that credit card companies have poured massive funding into Biden’s presidential bid.

The adult actress fingered Visa and Mastercard saying the twosome is one of the sector’s “biggest adversaries” effectively deciding what porn is allowed to be released.

“Few Americans realize Visa and Mastercard dictate what porn they want. For instance I refer to myself in precise language when I market my legal adult videos because the credit card companies enforce strict rules. Even though I only produce legal videos up to code credit card companies decide their regulations.”

The situation is compounded by Facebook policies that censor legal content DeVille says.

The Silicon Valley behemoth has a near-monopoly in the realm and the incoming Biden administration has deep connections with the Mark Zuckerberg-owned company including hiring many of its former lobbyists and executives.

“It’s disheartening because Facebook is worse than cable companies. They control what we see and they’re a monopoly. That’s frightening. Nobody knows this better than the sex workers that Facebook censors.”"

The two organizations have now teamed up to open a new and much bigger location.

It is located at 501 W International Airport Road Unit 28 right across the parking lot from their old location. They are set to start classes and training on Monday.

South High School wrestling head coach and Avalanche Wrestling coach Randy Hanson said “It’s kind of up in the air what our wrestling season is going to look like both for high school and for the club we are doing our best to provide an outlet for these youth and some of these adult classes who do adult classes at legacy we are trying to follow the city mandates but provide something for everyone to come.”

When you walk into the gym it is shocking just how much space they have; there is a room that is full of mats where social distancing can be easily done. There is also another smaller “blue mat” room that will be used for smaller classes or individual training. Normally the AvalancheWwrestling Club has well over 100 kids who participate but with the pandemic it has dwindled the numbers making it an even more ideal time to combine with Legacy Jiu-Jitsu to try and bring more people into the world of wrestling.

Jordan Kontra owner of Legacy Jiu-Jitsu says “The goal has always been to teach martial arts which is super cool but the part we focus on the most is building a community here and we are part of a larger community and the opportunities to give back have been substantial and we have taken every opportunity we have been able to give back to the larger community as well.”

Kontra added that it isn’t exactly easy to make friends as an adult so why not come to a place where you can not only stay in shape but become apart of a community where everyone has at least one thing in common. Legacy Jiu-Jitsu and The Avalanche Wrestling Club offer a plethora of classes that nearly every age group can participate in and they are excited to open their doors and kick off 2021 on a high note.

Newbee is one of China’s better-known esports organizations particularly when it comes to Dota 2. Established in 2014 the team has accumulated over $13000000 in total earnings – mostly in part thanks to Dota2’s TI.

Back in May Newbee was plunged into one of the biggest controversies in Chinese esports history after their entire roster was implicated in a match-fixing scandal.

The team consisting of Xu ‘Moogy’ Han Yin ‘AQ’ Rui Wen ‘Wizard’ Lipeng Yan ‘Waixi’ Chao and Zeng ‘Faith’ Hongda was found to have been match-fixing in a number of competitions including the China Dota 2 Pro League Season 2 and DPL-CDA Professional League Season 1.

StarLadder Moogy is one of the Newbee roster implicated in the match-fixing scandal.

After the scandal came to light back in May 2020 the team was promptly banned from all events organized by ImbaTV Mars Media and CDA. They were also immediately disqualified from the aforementioned leagues in which the fixed matches took place.

Following the revelations and tournament bans many fans were waiting for further bans particularly from Valve sanctioned event as well as Perfect World. Both came in early 2021 with the news being confirmed that the organization and all 5 players implicated have been permanently banned from Valve events. That includes The International which Newbee won back in 2014.

Dota2 confirmed the bans on their official Weibo account. The following screenshot is a translation.

Dota 2 insider ‘Wykrhm Reddy’ also confirmed the news on January 3 stating that the reason is match-fixing.

The news did not come as a major surprise but many fans were disappointed with the confirmation given the stardom of some players particularly Faith and Moogy.

Following on from the controversy Newbee parted company with AQ Wizard and Waixi in August of 2020. None of them have officially found a new roster.

For the time being Faith and Moogy remain on Newbee’s roster but with indefinite bans pretty much across the board now it looks like their time competing in Dota 2 is nigh on over.

The America's Cup design warfare is in full swing with Luna Rossa altering its boat to match a Team New Zealand innovation.



The Italian sailing website Fare Vela reported it had spotted the changes around the cockpit area of their AC75 boat over the weekend.

""Luna Rossa has created the fairings to optimise the aerodynamics of the deck and reduce the drag of the crew"" it reported.

""The new measure was hypothesised by several observers after seeing the best fairing on Te Rehutai.""

There are also claims the Italians have altered their setup to give the grinders more leverage.

Luna Rossa was also sporting a new mainsail logo ahead of the Prada Cup challengers' contest which starts on January 15th.

The design grab is all part of the America's Cup deal.

American Magic CEO/skipper Terry Hutchinson has already said his team will ""grab on to a couple of (ideas) that we can implement into our own sails or techniques"".

Meanwhile despite a recent report saying no further practice racing involving Team New Zealand would take place Hutchinson has indicated he would be open to the team being included in any pre-Prada Cup practice races.

The Prada Cup will not only decide who gets to challenge TNZ for the America's Cup but give that challenger invaluable racing time advantage over TNZ.

Hutchinson said it was not in the challengers' interests to allow TNZ to take part in any practice racing before the Prada Cup but ""if the decision was made that it's all or nothing that everyone has to be included we would consider any reasonable offer"".

Team New Zealand will be desperate to take part in any practice events and allowing them to be involved might smooth the way for the sessions to happen.

Race director Iain Murray had penciled in Thursday and Friday plus two days next week as potential practice dates. This would also help the race committee fine tune its operation.

If trial racing did take place before the Prada Cup it would reveal whether the struggling British team had come up with any design miracles to save their campaign.

Team INEOS had a disastrous pre-Christmas regatta with an embarrassing performance in light winds.

But Hutchinson refused to rule them out pointing to the Olympic gold medal class of its principals Sir Ben Ainslie and Giles Scott.

""It's a three horse race without question"" he told NZME.

""It would be an absolute mistake to think otherwise. Of the three teams they have the highest gain rate potential.

""That makes a good group of people incredibly dangerous.""

Mobile apps have revolutionised the way people meet around the world and are quickly becoming the main way couples form in many countries.

Unlike traditional dating sites which require detailed user profiles smartphone apps like Tinder and Grindr are largely based on rating photos with a swipe review system.

This has raised fears about the impact on the ways we interact fall in love and create lasting connections.

But a study conducted at the University of Geneva (UNIG) and published in the PLOS ONE journal indicates that app-formed couples actually have stronger ""cohabition intentions"" than couples who meet offline.

""Large parts of the media claim they have a negative impact on the quality of relationships since they render people incapable of investing in an exclusive or long-term relationship"" report author Gina Potarca a researcher at UNIG's the Institute of Demography and Socioeconomics said in a statement.

""Up to now though there has been no evidence to prove this is the case.""

Potarca used a 2018 family survey by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office analysing responses from over 3000 people who were in a relationship and had met their partner in the past decade.

Her analysis showed that couples who met through an app were more motivated by the idea of living together than others.

""The study doesn’t say whether their final intention was to live together for the long- or short-term"" she said adding though that since expressed desire to marry remained high across the board ""some of these couples likely see cohabitation as a trial period prior to marriage.""

The study also found that couples formed via dating apps expressed stronger desires and intentions to have children than others.

What Is Staphylococcus Aureus?

The FDA explains that Staph is a bacteria that can cause severe food poisoning. Food contaminated with Staph may not smell or taste bad or look spoiled. Though the bacteria can be killed by cooking the toxins may still be able to cause illness.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) symptoms develop within 30 minutes to eight hours after consuming the contaminated food. Though severe illness is rare Staph food poisoning may cause nausea vomiting and stomach cramps.

What To Do If You Have the Recalled Products at Home

Check your pantry for the recalled products many of which have a long shelf-life. Do not eat any of the recalled products. You should discard them.

Graeme McCormick a well-known party activist who stood to become SNP president in 2023 claimed he would gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

His supporters argue it would be undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. If one does take place Swinney will not be appointed as first minister until late May.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson posted on X on Sunday that he had already obtained the 100 signatures required and was planning to hand them in to the SNP “in person”.

Lawson also attacked Swinney for criticising the move and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was challenging him.

“So Graeme McCormick has succeeded in getting the nominations he needed. Disappointed that JS [Swinney] has already had a dig at him before nominations even close for daring to challenge him. He is to give ordinary members the chance to question the new leader. New idea?”

McCormick some of whose allies want the Scottish government to mount a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

Nominations to succeed Humza Yousaf as SNP leader close at noon on Monday. If another candidate crosses the nominations threshold and forces a contest Yousaf is expected to remain in post and as Scotland’s first minister until a winner is declared.

McCormick was very confident he would gather the signatures before the deadline after canvassing for support at an independence rally in Glasgow organised by All Under One Banner the Sunday Herald newspaper reported.

Swinney who has been expecting to be confirmed as the new SNP leader on Monday afternoon and be voted in as first minister this week warned on Sunday that a contest would delay his efforts to rebuild the party and put its deep divisions on public display.

“I think it would be better if we just got on with things that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength” he told BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show. “We had a lot of strains around a couple of issues in parliament and I think we’ve just had a rough couple of years.

“[The] SNP has not looked cohesive; the SNP has not looked together. The central point of my message is we’ve got to get ourselves together.”

An unopposed coronation would not be the SNP’s first: Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond in November 2014 without a contest.

Swinney’s call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDI0LzA1LzA1L3NucC1hY3RpdmlzdC1qb2huLXN3aW5uZXktZmlyc3QtbWluaXN0ZXItc2NvdGxhbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SNP activist aims to thwart John Swinney's bid to be first minister with own leadership run,"An SNP activist is planning to ruin John Swinney’s coronation as first minister by running against him to become party leader.

Graeme McCormick a party member who has been actively critical of the Scottish Government was seen at an independence march on Saturday attempting to secure enough support to make the ballot.

Senior SNP sources admitted it was feasible that Mr McCormick could be successful in forcing a contest given the low bar set by the party.

To stand for SNP leader a party member needs just 100 signatures indicating support from fellow members coming from a minimum of 20 separate branches.

Asked whether he would welcome another leadership contest given reports about Mr McCormick Mr Swinney said: “I think it would be better if we just got on with things that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength.”

Mr McCormick a retired lawyer has declined requests to speak to the media.

However he has indicated to journalists that he is confident of winning the required support by the deadline of noon on Monday.

Should he succeed Mr Swinney would be all but certain to still win the contest but it would mean he would not become SNP leader until May 27.

These marketing ploys help fast-food chains harness the power of celebrity and excitement over a new menu item without the costs or complications associated with adding something to the menu.

McDonald's struck gold when the fast-food giant teamed up with Travis Scott earlier this year.

The ""Travis Scott Meal"" was so successful that some locations ran out of Quarter Pounder ingredients something that had not happened when meatpacking plants shuttered earlier in the pandemic. Scott's line of merchandise swiftly sold out. Analysts applauded the deal which helped McDonald's reach Gen Z customers.

Perhaps the most impressive part of the plan was that it didn't require McDonald's to add a single item to the menu. The so-called ""Travis Scott Meal"" was a Quarter Pounder with cheese bacon and lettuce medium fries with BBQ Sauce and a Sprite — all well-known existing menu items. Yet Scott's name was enough to make the chain start running out of burgers.

""His ability to kind of see where culture is going and have a hand in where culture is going is really unique"" McDonald's Chief Marketing Officer Morgan Flatley told Business Insider in September. ""Then you couple that with his huge followership and his fans social-media footprint and ... 3 billion streams. He just has an incredible audience.""

McDonald's partnership with Scott paved the way for a new type of celebrity-inspired menu item both at McDonald's and other chains including Chipotle and Dunkin'.

Many restaurants pared down their menus in 2020 with McDonald's among the chains that cut less popular items like salads and grilled chicken from the menu. During the pandemic chains' drive-thru business was more important than ever. Having fewer menu items available helps speed up service and makes operations easier for workers.

At the same time new and limited-time offerings create buzz and a sense of urgency among potential customers. When a new item hits menus it helps make the chain feel more relevant. And if the menu item is only going to be there for a few months it helps convince people that now is the time to visit.

The new era of celebrity menu items such as the Travis Scott Meal allows chains to harness the buzz of a new menu item without actually adding anything to menu.

McDonald's followed up its partnership with Scott with a collaboration with reggaeton star J Balvin. According to Flatley McDonald's wanted to work with stars like Scott to win over younger customers. According to Flatley people under the age of 34 are ""becoming more and more challenging for brands to reach.""

""How they engage with media is different"" Flatley said. ""They look to recommendations much more than any other generation has. They're very reliant on social media. They're very reliant on their friends.""

McDonald's isn't alone in rolling out celebrity menu items in 2020.

In December Chipotle rolled out its own celebrity menu item inspired by singer Miley Cyrus. The dish was called the ""Guac is extra but so is Miley burrito"" — and of course only used ingredients already found at Chipotle. Chipotle previously launched a challenge on TikTok in November in which three winners had their orders added to the app as official menu items.

Dunkin' debuted The Charli named after TikTok star Charli D'Amelio in September. The cold brew beverage only used ingredients that were already available at the chain. However it still drove a 57% increase in app downloads compared to the previous 90 days and significantly boosted cold brew sales according to UBS.

""Certainly the drink had a lot of popularity with Gen Z which obviously is super important"" Drayton Martin Dunkin's vice president of brand stewardship recently told Business Insider. ""You need to continue to bring younger people into the brand family if you want to stay healthy.""

""Also the younger generations are actually bellwethers that then cascade to the loser Gen Xers who are still desperately clinging onto coolness — not that I'm describing myself or anything"" Martin added.

Martin said that Dunkin' is always scheming and playing around with different options as it considers future partnerships. Like Flatley at McDonald's she said that Dunkin' only wants to team up with celebrities that are genuinely fans of the brand — though that is only the first of many considerations.

""Will this help with that aspiration of: 'Wow I didn't expect this from Dunkin'?"" Martin said. ""Obviously [we consider if we] can we punch above our weight in terms of earned media? Is it interesting? Is there a story here? All of those are factors that go into it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZWliZXJ0cm9uLmNvbS90cmFuc2Zvcm1lcnMvbmV3cy8xOTk1LW1jZG9uYWxkcy10b3ktZG9jdW1lbnRzLXJldmVhbC1lYXJseS1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1jb25jZXB0cy1mb3ItYmVhc3Qtd2Fycy80NTU1NS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1995 McDonalds Toy Documents Reveal Early Development Concepts for Beast Wars,"Saturday January 2nd 2021 1:54AM CST

Beast Wars! 1995 McDonald’s Toy Document Gives Us a Previously Unseen Look at Early Franchise Development and Several Unused Toy Concepts!



Warm up your transwarp drive and grab some drive-through because we’re heading to the bygone era of 1995 to catch a glimpse at Transformers history! To a time before it was even called…BEAST WARS!



Thanks to Nathan at



In the earliest part of the document several sketches of what would become mainline toys are featured some with preliminary names such as Snapper being referred to as “Buzzsaw” and Scorponok being labeled as “Shockwave”. However the most interesting thing in this section is the design that would become Cheetor being referred to as “Prowl” while utilizing the color scheme reminiscent of the McDonald’s toy that would ultimately see release as “Panther”. It’s often been suspected that the decision to deco the deluxe toy that became Cheetor as a cheetah may have been a decision that occurred after the sculpting phase was complete; it seems it may have originally been intended to be a panther version of G1 Prowl which would explain Cheetor’s very Prowl-like head sculpt.



Also mentioned in the document is the pitch for “Auto-Rollers” as the potential auto-transformation gimmick (another carry-over from G2) including four vehicle mode ones which unfortunately were not included in the document; though Nathan managed to grab an image of the moon buggy Prowl from another auction listing.



Check out the images mirrored below which include concept sketches of toys that saw release some that didn’t like sea turtle and dragonfly versions of Megatron and some that were originally conceived as different characters—like the Predacon Manta Ray who was originally intended to be Optimus Prime! Oh and a concept sketch for a lion Optimus Prime that pre-dates Lio Convoy as well as the evolution of the Under-3 toy from a G1-themed Optimus to the lion head that ultimately saw release!

I say “Transformers” because not only do these concept pages use the Generation 2 logo the name “Beast Wars” was seemingly not decided upon yet as it appears nowhere in the document. While we know Hasbro/Kenner initially intended Optimus Primal and Megatron to be the original G1 characters before the show opted to make them new individuals this document reinforces that as this predates the change from “Prime” to “Primal” in the toyline proper. Also noteworthy is this was apparently before the faction name “Maximal” was decided upon as the document states Megatron leads the Predacons while Optimus Prime leads the “Cyberbeasts”.In the earliest part of the document several sketches of what would become mainline toys are featured some with preliminary names such as Snapper being referred to as “Buzzsaw” and Scorponok being labeled as “Shockwave”.

It's nearly the 25 year anniversary for Transformers Beast Wars the Kingdom line has brought the toys back to major retailer shelves the Masterpiece line slowly brings fantastically accurate robot and animal modes to collectors and the recent Japanese Beast Wars Generations book has provides wonderful background information about the development of the line. What better time to reveal previously unseen Beast Wars concepts courtesy of a McDonald's presentation binder! Did you know before they were Maximals lead by Optimus Primal they were known as the Cyberbeasts and Optimus Prime was their leader? Additionally two other alternative McDonald's promotions were being considered the Creature Autorollers and Vehicle Autorollers. Stay tuned for more posts showing off these unreleased concepts that will certainly contain surprises for even then biggest Beast Wars fans.

Also don't worry Littlest Pet Shop fans lots of reveals will be presented after this Beast Wars series.

Starting off this series from the McDonalds concept binder you'll be familiar with the alligator Megatron but might be surprised that no only is the bat Optimus known as Optimus Prime but there was a possible plan for a lion Optimus well before Lio Convoy from the Japanese Beast Wars II series existed. Also notice Scorponok was named Shockwave and Snapper was named Buzzsaw. Lastly the generically named ""Panther' toy at one time had a familiar Transformers name: Prowl.

Only Prowl/Panther' made it to Happy Meals in 1996 Scorponok in 1998 and Optimus & Megatron made appearances on the happy Meal boxes. The other concepts though give a peek at alternative ideas Hasbro/Kenner was considering strongly enough to relay to their licensees. Would ""Shockwave"" been fitting for Scorponok? Trukk not Liun???

The Beast Wars Creature Auto Rollers was an entire concept line that never made it off paper. Check out these cool illustrations of potential toys that would have completely changed the McDonald's Beast Wars Happy Meal promotion.

The last proposed Happy Meal Transformers were not the familiar Beast Wars animals and would have included Prowl Starscream Hound and Rumble as Vehicle Auto Rollers functionally similar to the Creature Auto Rollers. Sadly when I acquired the McDonald's concept binder it only included this description page. The moon buggy Prowl picture was eventually found online but I was unable to reach the owner to recover that page or find out if they have the others.

Here it is the last two pages of the McDonald's Transformers Beast Wars Happy Meal concept binder. The proposed but unreleased Under 3 toy was a very G1 looking Optimus Prime toy. Quite a bit different than the unnamed final product that better aligned with the Beast Wars theme.



... but wait there is more to come! I will have another series of posts from a subsequent iteration of concepts for the same Beast Wars promotion and it gets a lot more colorful too. Stay tuned!

In April 1996 one year after the previous Beast Wars Happy Meal concepts were presented Vehicle Auto Rollers were out and character decisions and toy colors were being refined. Take a look at these pictures of Megatron as a Sea Turtle and Optimus Prime as what would become Predacon Manta Ray. I have no information suggesting if these were original ideas by McDonald's or if Hasbro provided some input.

Who do you think would win in an aquatic robot battle?

Beast Wars Megatron concepts didn't stop with the Sea Turtle shown in my last post! A dragonfly Megatron was also being considered that had some interesting wasp-like coloring. Swipe to see the other pictures of a brilliantly colored Iguanus as well as Panther/Prowl in nearly final colors.

Next up I'll be posting what all these characters would have looked like as Creature Auto Rollers.

Next in this series of McDonald's Beast Wars concepts is the familiar characters from my last post but now as Creature Auto Rollers. Nothing too surprising except some color changes. Unfortunately this is the last that's seen of the Creature Auto Rollers as the fold out toy concept moved on into product. One more post remains in this series and it may be quite a surprise. Stay tuned!

Here it is the last post of the McDonald's Transformers Beast Wars concept series. If you remember way back to the second post of the series I showed line art of Optimus Prime/Primal as a fold out lion toy. Later I showed an alternate Under 3 toy concept of a G1 Optimus Head. Of course that means Under 3 was indeed supposed to Optimus Prime and here is the evidence of that. The robot head on the produced toy certainly resembles Optimus' masked face and crown but the lack an actual name for the toy and the early Optimus lion toy concept are two pieces of the production history that finally identity Under 3.

Instagram user Nathan of RoboticPlanetToys has posted scans of several never-before-seen documents from 1995 for the McDonalds Happy Meal toys of Beast Wars. User Vexwing of The Allspark has written a detailed article providing much information about these scans which reveal many early concepts from the Beast Wars toyline's initial development.I will let Vexwing's words speak for themselves since he has been planning this reveal with Nathan for quite some time:Here are the document scans complete with Nathan's own comments for each:To add my own two cents to all of this the Prowl/Panther concept brings new insight to this early Cheetor concept sketch:This artwork was scanned from the Beast Wars Reborn Golden Disk CD-ROM and when it recently appeared in the Beast Generations book the book's text accompanying it referred to its beast mode as a cougar.Evidently this Prowl concept is the origin of both the Cheetor toy and the McDonalds Panther toy explaining why they both have a very Prowl-like robot head.And now that we know that McDonalds Panther and Manta Ray were originally supposed to have been Prowl and Optimus Prime respectively it is likely that Beetle was supposed to have been Megatron and Rhino was Rhinox.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vYWxjYWxkZS50ZXhhc2V4ZXMub3JnLzIwMjEvMDEvaW5zaWRlLXRoZS1tY2RvbmFsZC1vYnNlcnZhdG9yeXMtbWlzc2lvbi10by1wcmVzZXJ2ZS10aGUtZGFya2VzdC1za2llcy1pbi13ZXN0LXRleGFzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside the McDonald Observatory's Mission to Preserve the Darkest Skies in West Texas,"By Catherine Arnold in 40 Acres Jan | Feb 2021 on |

Bill Wren remembers the night sky rising like wallpaper above him when he was a child in rural Missouri. But after a move to Houston in 1970 when he was 15 lights from the city’s sprawl obscured all but a few stars. It wasn’t until he was 21 years old on a camping trip to West Texas’ Davis Mountains State Park that he flashed back to the Missouri skies of his childhood. Staring at a starry mass running to the horizon he realized constellations he commonly saw near cities were hard to discern in truly dark skies.

“Once you see them you never forget them” says Wren who now spends his days trying to assure dark skies for campers and researchers in the area. As the Dark Skies Initiative coordinator he stresses how good lighting results in business savings and worker safety at the 500-acre McDonald Observatory located at 6800 feet elevation 111 miles north of Big Bend National Park. He also helps measure sky darkness in the area using precise measurements of sky brightness and glare across the entire celestial hemisphere identification of light pollution sources separation of natural and human-caused sky brightness and other National Park Service methods.

A research unit of The University of Texas at Austin the observatory owns one of the world’s largest optical telescopes the Hobby-Eberly and works to maintain the Milky Way and other sky views for research and education. While views above “remain pristine” Wren points out that these days astronomers are finding the need to build observatories in places far from city lights such as Hawaii and Argentina’s Atacama Desert.

Since the 1970s the McDonald Observatory has coordinated with seven surrounding counties to decrease glare educating municipalities on lights that point down or are shielded and have amber hues instead of sharp whites. In 1978 the state legislature passed a bill giving nearby counties the option to adopt lighting ordinances. In 2011 Gov. Rick Perry signed House Bill 2857 to instruct nearby counties to adopt the ordinance. At this point those counties make up 28000 square miles (18 million acres) of lighting ordinances and dark skies. “It’s the largest area of the planet that I know of where night skies are protected” Wren says.

Few places on Earth are as dark these days as when Wren was a child. As urban populations grow 80 percent of people around the world cannot see the Milky Way from home and live under light-polluted skies according to the 2016 scientific publication the New World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness.

Even surrounded by the West Texas desert the McDonald Observatory now sees more illumination on its horizon. Since 2008 an increase in oil and gas operations in the Midland area has led to McDonald Observatory measuring more light emitted by that city’s growing population businesses and energy activity 172 miles to the northeast. While stars wink in pristine skies overhead brightness gathers in trees on the observatory’s hills. “We’re shining wasted light into the night skies and it has the potential to ruin our view” Wren says.

It’s affecting our health too. Light pollution affects human and animal circadian rhythms and creates more carbon emissions according to 2007 and 2010 studies. In 2012 research showed too much artificial light can also influence animals’ behavioral changes in mating movement migration communications and mortality. Light pollution is increasing worldwide at a rate of 2 percent according to a 2017 analysis of satellite images. “If Van Gogh were alive today would he be inspired to paint ‘Starry Night’ if he couldn’t see the sky?” Wren asks.

Good lighting practices make a difference. “This is about creating dark skies not dark ground” Wren says and that the key to making conservation work is showing businesses how they benefit. In 2010 he and his team began reaching out to oil and gas companies and municipalities to demonstrate improved worker safety without glare and an average of 80 percent less power consumption when light is focused downward allowing for lower wattage bulb use. “The kind of light that’s good for the business’ visibility at night also helps the night skies” Wren says.

The Dark Sky Initiative’s work sped up in 2013 when Wren was introduced to Pioneer Energy Services which provides land contract drilling. He visited drilling sites to assess light use noticing at one rig that a worker’s operation console faced a bright white light. He had stuffed a rag on the casing to lower its glare. Wren learned the light manufacturer offered optional shields and Pioneer incorporated them in all its rig designs. McDonald Observatory also worked with Apache Corporation to include good lighting practices in rigs near Balmorhea.

The McDonald Observatory’s recommended lighting practices guide is endorsed by the Permian Basin Petroleum Association Texas Oil & Gas Association and American Petroleum Institute. In February 2016 the Texas Railroad Commission the state agency with primary regulatory jurisdiction over the oil and natural gas industry first sent a notice to operations with the observatory’s guidelines writing that “the solutions can be simple and cost effective and can actually improve nighttime visibility and increase worker safety.”

For its work the McDonald Observatory received a Texan by Nature 2018 award and in 2019 the Apache Corporation awarded it $257000 to hire additional staff and fund dark skies educational materials outreach events and a permanent exhibit on dark sky preservation at the visitor center. “Their work is a win for natural resources economy health and the safety of our workers in that area” says Joni Carswell CEO and president of Texan by Nature an organization founded in 2011 by Laura Bush MLS ’73 Distinguished Alumna to unite conservation and business leaders.

The work has long-term effects. “We’ve managed to show good lighting benefits the oil industry McDonald and tourism” says Wren who in July 2020 began an application to the International Dark-Sky Association to establish a Greater Big Bend International Dark Sky Reserve in far West Texas and northern Mexico. The detailed application they’ll submit in a couple of years will require collaboration among protected areas of Mexico and Texas and private landowners. If approved the reserve would be larger than the 16 existing Dark Sky Reserves in the world combined. Wren will also work with area organization the Big Bend Conservation Alliance to help formulate a strategy that shows business benefits for conserving water and land.

Conserving dark skies helps in less obvious ways too. For instance a 2017 study showed migrating birds are confused by light demonstrated by birds drawn to New York’s 9/11 tribute. “As a form of pollution light overuse is a fairly easy problem to fix” says Cooper Farr director of conservation at the bird research nonprofit Tracy Aviary and Botanical Gardens in Salt Lake City. “If you shield the lights the problem is gone. Light conservation is a nice project to work on because the fix is straightforward and immediate.”

Better lighting brings visibility safety and cost-efficiency. “There’s every reason in the world not to use more lighting in the sky” Wren says. “When 80 percent of the people live where they can‘t see the Milky Way it’s not just affecting professional astronomers and observatories. Light pollution is having an impact on our culture our civilization.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlzcmFlbGhheW9tLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzAxL21jZG9uYWxkcy1icmF6aWwtZ29lcy1ncmVlbmVyLXdpdGgtaXNyYWVsaS1jbGVhbnRlY2gtc3RhcnR1cC11YnEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's Brazil goes greener with Israeli cleantech startup UBQ,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.israelhayom.com/2021/02/01/mcdonalds-brazil-goes-greener-with-israeli-cleantech-startup-ubq/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlzcmFlbGhheW9tLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzAxL21jZG9uYWxkcy1icmF6aWwtZ29lcy1ncmVlbmVyLXdpdGgtaXNyYWVsaS1jbGVhbnRlY2gtc3RhcnR1cC11YnEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ic2VydmVybG9jYWxuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvamFuLzAzL3N0YW5kaW5nLW8tcmFuZHktbWNkb25hbGQtaXMtd2lyZWQtdG8tdm9sdW50ZWVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Standing O: Randy McDonald is wired to volunteer,"Randy Mcdonald's work at the Jewish Federation Jerry Doliner Food Bank always starts bright and early.

The food bank feeds 24000 people a year and on the days when the volunteers are preparing to distribute groceries McDonald and another volunteer drive to the Second Harvest Food Bank where they go through boxes upon boxes of produce. They pick out the best ones for the families pack them up in the van and return to the Jewish Federation of Volusia and Flagler Counties where volunteers are waiting to sort.

It's all-day operation McDonald said.

“It takes everybody here to do what we do"" he said. ""You’ve got to be a caring person to volunteer here.”

About five ago McDonald received a call for help from a friend. He told him that the Jerry Doliner Food Bank was short of people and that they desperately needed helping hands. McDonald agreed to help and after that day he just kept coming back.

Why? The people.

Beyond the numerous volunteers like him that dedicate their time and efforts to feeding the community he meets people from all walks of life — ones you'd never expect to be in need he said. Many times the people will thank them individually for their help telling them that if it wasn't for the food bank they wouldn't have anything to eat the next day.

Helping them feels good McDonald said. It's also sad.

“I don’t believe anybody should be hungry in a country like ours"" he said.

Gloria Max the Jewish Federation's executive director receives letters from people they help. Sometimes McDonald said you can see the tear stains in the stationery.

""He is a tremendous help to our pantry... He's just invaluable as a volunteer. He's there for anything that we need and gives very much of himself and very much of his time."" Marta Weisberg fellow Jewish Federation volunteer

McDonald is a longtime Ormond resident. Born in Memphis Tennessee he moved to Ormond with his parents when he was a child. He later moved away for 35 years but has spent the last two decades in his Ormond Beach home.

Prior to volunteering with the Jewish Federation McDonald owned a business where he manufactured shipping containers for caskets.

He's also a fifth-degree black belt in taekwondo.

He remembers the day that journey began. A martial arts studio had opened in town and McDonald who had always wanted to practice martial arts as a child called the studio for information. The instructor Il Un Chung asked him how old he was.

McDonald was 37.

“He goes ‘Oh 37. Hurry come now'"" McDonald recalled.

The two are still friends to this day even after McDonald quit five years ago after 35 years of practicing martial arts. In fact he and his nephew a Holly Hill Police officer used to run a martial arts program for the department's police athletic league.

Another passion of his is music. He and his wife form a local music duo called ""Memphis and Me!!"" McDonald has written several songs in his lifetime and said a couple have been published.

He even wrote a jingle for the Jewish Federation. Local radio host Big John plays it on WELE 1380 from time to time.

All three of his interests — volunteering martial arts and music — meet when it comes to making others smile. And no matter what he's doing he always feels like he can do better.

Two of the people he looks up to are Max and her husband Ray whose influence with the Jewish Federation have a made a massive impact in the community.

“These guys are an inspiration"" McDonald said. ""I’m a senior citizen and I want to be like them when I grow up.”"

Problem is there is an ongoing global shortage of BCG.

Now the California biotech has partnered with the Serum Institute of India in an exclusive deal to manufacture BCG globally.

The arrangement aims to create “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and produce BCG “at large scale” for use in combination with Anktiva in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) ImmunityBio said Thursday.

BCG originally developed as a tuberculosis vaccine is also a standard treatment for NMIBC which accounts for about 80% of around 80000 new bladder cancer diagnoses each year in the U.S.

The FDA has cleared Anktiva and BCG to treat patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with carcinoma in situ. And ImmunityBio is evaluating the combo in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with papillary tumors and perhaps more importantly in BCG-naïve NMIBC.

In the current indication ImmunityBio will go toe to toe with Merck & Co.’s PD-1 megablockbuster Keytruda and Ferring Pharmaceuticals’ gene therapy Adstiladrin both of which are administered by themselves without BCG. Ironically Merck is currently the sole supplier of BCG in the U.S.

Merck’s TICE BCG has been the lone BCG product in the U.S. since 2012 coming after Sanofi and another drugmaker ran into manufacturing problems. Sanofi officially pulled out of the market in 2016. Merck which had before then not been the major supplier globally for BCG was forced to pick up the slack.

In October 2020 Merck announced a plan to construct a new TICE BCG manufacturing facility in North Carolina. But that project was anticipated to be completed by late 2025 to late 2026 according to a Merck update in January this year. Once operational Merck expects to triple its current BCG capacity and believes believes it will be able to meet demand “for the foreseeable future.”

Merck has been rationing BCG supply since 2019. The New Jersey Big Pharma allocates its limited supply to distributors and wholesalers based on historical purchasing and it doesn’t directly determine the supply to individual healthcare providers.

SII is the largest manufacturer of BCG vaccine globally according to ImmunityBio. The Indian company has two BCG products for oncology use one traditional BCG called Onco-BCG is already commercialized outside the U.S. The new deal will see SII immediately supply that standard BCG for ImmunityBio’s clinical trials once the FDA signs off on the trial protocols which ImmunityBio plans to submit to global regulatory authorities within 30 days.

The second product a recombinant BCG is undergoing midstage testing in Europe. This version includes two gene modifications to improve its profile and according to ImmunityBio it has shown “potent immunogenicity with CD8+ and CD4+ stimulation and improved safety compared to standard BCG.” The two partners are now working to speed up the phase 2 program.

However in both cases the timeline for commercial supplies remains unclear. ImmunityBio will have more clarity on the timeline once it submits the trial protocols to the FDA a media aide to the company told Fierce Pharma.

The good news for ImmunityBio? Anktiva’s current U.S. label doesn’t specify or limit the type of BCG the drug can be used with. This allows the company to explore other alternatives to Merck’s TICE BCG ImmunityBio’s executive chairman Patrick Soon-Shiong M.D. said during an investor call last week.

“We are pleased to partner with the Serum Institute of India so that the power of its large-scale world-class GMP manufacturing capacity can be used to address the issue of BCG shortage which affects thousands of bladder cancer patients annually” Soon-Shiong said in a statement Thursday.

A&T” said Sanat Chattopadhyay executive vice president and president Merck Manufacturing Division. “The Learning Center is not just a building; it's an incubator for innovation a path to discovery and a beacon guiding the next generation of thinkers problem-solvers and leaders who will drive our industry forward.”

The opening was marked with a joint celebration that included senior leaders from both Merck and A&T current and former A&T students and local government officials including North Carolina Commerce Secretary Machelle Baker Sanders. Attendees participated in tours of the lab and classroom facilities to see firsthand the immersive learning opportunities.

Merck and A&T America’s premier historically Black doctoral research university developed this collaboration based on mutual values of innovation community engagement and a commitment to diversity and inclusion. The joint effort between Merck and A&T supports the increasing need for biotech training and education in North Carolina and highlights the importance of business and historically Black college and university (HBCU) cooperation in growing diverse talent in the biotech sector.

“The Merck Biotechnology Learning Center will provide opportunities for N.C. A&T students to understand what a career in biotech looks like” said Amanda Taylor vice president and plant manager at the Merck Manufacturing Division site in Durham North Carolina. “We have several wonderful N.C. A&T graduates working at our Durham site already and there is so much growth in manufacturing across North Carolina. Through our collaboration with N.C. A&T we’re developing new and innovative ways to build a pipeline of talent in the Triad and beyond.”

The opening of the Merck Biotechnology Learning Center is the launch of a long-term collaboration between Merck and A&T. The two organizations will partner on several initiatives to support student enrichment including curricula development a speaker series and STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) community outreach.

“I am thrilled to announce our groundbreaking collaboration with Merck which heralds a new era of innovation in biotechnology education"" said Tonya Smith-Jackson Ph.D. provost and executive vice chancellor of Academic Affairs. “This partnership signifies a union between academia and industry and a commitment to excellence innovation and the advancement of scientific knowledge as it not only provides our students with unparalleled access to state-of-the-art labs but also invaluable mentorship from Merck professionals ensuring they emerge as industry-ready leaders poised to shape the future of biotechnology. The Merck Biotechnology Learning Center will serve as a hub of learning and discovery and it is also the start of a collaboration where we are going to jointly advance the mission of both Merck and N.C.

After topping expectations with first quarter revenue and adjusted earnings last week Merck & Co Inc (NYSE: MRK) just reported encouraging data from its Phase III gastric cancer treatment trial after ending 2023 with good news from its combined treatment with Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA) in fighting melanoma.

Merck reported improvement in cancer patients receiving its Keytruda regimen.

Enrolling 698 subjects the trial evaluated the effect of a treatment that combines Merck’s immunotherapy blockbuster Keytruda along with trastuzumab and chemotherapy on patients suffering from gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. The final also confirmed that Merck’s Keytruda combination regimen led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement meeting the dual primary endpoint of overall survival.

Merck reported strong first quarter results.

With strong sales of its blockbuster immune-based cancer drug Keytruda along with vaccine products Merck reported revenue rose 9% YoY to $15.78 billion surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $15.20 billion. Net income for the first three months of the year amounted to $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share. Excluding acquisitions and restructuring costs adjusted earnings amounted to $2.07 per share surpassing $1.88 per share that LSEG expected.

The pharmaceutical unit reported revenue grew 10% YoY to $14.01 billion with Keytruda alone bringing in $6.95 billion of those sales as its revenue grew as much as 20% YoY surpassing even FactSet’s estimate of $6.71 billion. The rise is owed to increased uptake from cancer patients at earliest stages of cancer along with continued demand for treating metastatic cancers. HPV prevention vaccine Gardasil also reported a 14% YoY rise in sales as it brought $2.25 billion to the revenue table. Pneumococcal disease prevention vaccine Vaxneuvance also posted remarkable growth of 106% YoY as sales amounted to $219 million.

On the other hand Covid antiviral pill Lagevrio and Type 2 diabetes treatment Januvia reported sales dropped. Lagevrio reported sales dropped 11% to $350 million joining the same trend posted by Pfizer and Moderna as COVID-19 now seems to be history. Januvia posted a 24% YoY drop in sales as revenue amounted to $670 million due to falling demand in the U.S. lower prices and generic competition.

New deals and drug launches to offset Keytruda’s patent expiration.

Story continues

All in all Merck showed it is making substantial progress in preparing for 2028’s patent expiration of its blockbuster drug which will likely dent sales. Besides Winrevair that has been approved in the U.S. last month for treating progressive and life-threatening lung condition. In December Merck and Moderna presented positive results from the combination of Keytruda and their experimential mRNA vaccine for melanoma halving relapse risk. Although it was mid-term data from the 3-year follow-up Merck and Moderna provided hope that mRNA could revolutionize cancer treatment. Moderna director Stéphane Bancel hinted that the mRNA vaccine for melanoma could be available as early as 2025. Moreover after these promising results Moderna and Merck expanded their research scope to evaluate the effect of the treatment against non-small lung cancer.

mRNA already saved the world during the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis and now it promises to do the same with what seems to be pharma’s never-ending health-battle. Keytruda’s patent will expire but Merck did all it can to make sure it continues to contribute to a healthier society. Along with cutting costs under a restructuring program it kicked off in February Merck is securing its financial existance and future with new deals and promising drug launches.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results."

RELATED: A look at how Cigna's newly launched Evernorth is approaching innovation

Rumors that Cigna was considering a sale began in earnest in August 2019.

Cigna has put a large focus on growing its health benefits and services arms since it acquired Express Scripts in December 2018. The nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager provided a significant boost to the insurer's financials over the past several quarters.

To continue an expansion of the health services businesses the insurer recently consolidated them under new subsidiary Evernorth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMDMvYnJvbmNvcy1vZmZzZWFzb24tcGxhbi0yMDIxLW5mbC_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZW52ZXJwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzAzL2Jyb25jb3Mtb2Zmc2Vhc29uLXBsYW4tMjAyMS1uZmwvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Another year looking up at NFL’s best means another busy offseason for Broncos,"Out of the playoffs for the fifth consecutive year tied for the longest streak in more than four decades.

A third double-digit loss season in four years something that hasn’t happened around these parts since the late 1960s.

And potentially only the third last-place AFC West finish in 21 years.

So what happened to the Broncos this year? Why are they 5-10 entering Sunday’s finale against Las Vegas at an empty Mile High? Why are they essentially in NFL’s No-Man’s Land — unwilling to tear it down and unable to compete with the league’s elite?

“We had an inordinate amount of injuries which I think hurt our progress some” coach Vic Fangio said. “We turned it over too much (32 times) which hurt our progress. We didn’t get takeaways (only 12) which hurt our progress.”

But …

“I think individually there’s been a lot of progress” Fangio said. “We’ve gotten a lot of young players a lot of playing time that they’re going to grow from and learn from and I think that’s where the progress has been made.”

Entering Week 17 according to Sport Radar the Broncos’ 5902 snaps by first- and second-year players leads the NFL nearly 1000 more than Cincinnati (4955). Against the Raiders the Broncos could start as many as four rookies and five second-year players equal parts by design and necessity.

The Broncos’ hope is that individual growth/acquired knowledge while absorbing body blows from some of the NFL’s best (eight games against the 14 teams currently in playoff position — 1-7 record) translates into 2021 team success.

Are the Broncos equipped to make a jump of 4-5 wins to challenge for the playoffs next year? Here is a position-by-position look:

Quarterback

Player Age How acquired 2021 cap hit Drew Lock 24 D2-19 $1912042 Brett Rypien 25 CFA-19 $850000 Jeff Driskel 28 UFA-20 $3250000

Analysis: Offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur wasn’t subtle in his criticism of Lock throughout December but his tune changed 180 degrees Thursday as he pointed out Lock’s youth (17 career starts) and potential. The inference is the Broncos are entering the offseason with Lock as their projected 2021 No. 1. … Lock’s 15 interceptions are tied for the NFL lead and he’s tied for 24th in touchdowns (14). … Lock has 53 explosive passes (at least 16-yard gain); his 18 turnovers have led to 55 points by the opponent. … Adding a more-experienced No. 2 is critical. Driskel didn’t pan out and the Broncos can create $1.75 million in space by cutting him.

Running back

Player Age How acquired 2021 cap hit Melvin Gordon 28 UFA-20 $9000000 Phillip Lindsay 27 CFA-18 Restricted FA Royce Freeman 25 D3-18 $1219255 LeVante Bellamy 24 CFA-20 $780000

Also: Jeremy Cox (FB) and Damarea Crockett.

Analysis: So much for that plan of Nos. 1-1A tailbacks with Gordon/Lindsay or Lindsay/Gordon. … Lindsay’s season never got out of the blocks (one 100-yard game) because of injuries and ineffectiveness. … Do the Broncos want Lindsay back? Does he want to be back? One of the top offseason subplots — we think Lindsay has played his last game in Denver. … Gordon is knocking on 1000 yards (needs 107) has played 576 snaps has eight of the Broncos’ 12 rushing touchdowns and caught 28 passes. … Maybe Bellamy can be to 2021 what the Broncos wanted Lindsay to be this past year capable of rushing catching and protecting.

Tight end

Player Age How acquired 2021 cap hit Noah Fant 23 D1-19 $3433834 Nick Vannett 28 UFA-20 $3575000 Albert Okwuegbunam 23 D4-20 $967261 Troy Fumagalli 26 FA-20 Restricted free agent Andrew Beck 25 W-19 $850000 Jake Butt 26 D5-17 Free agent Austin Fort 26 CFA-19 $781168

Also: Jordan Leggett.

Analysis: Fant has 12 explosive catches among his 58 receptions and has played 660 snaps. … Vannett (330 snaps) started slowly and was a healthy scratch in Week 3 but found a role during the season’s second half as the in-line blocker/protector. … Okwuegbunam should generate excitement — and maybe take targets away from Fant — if he returns to top form from a torn ACL. … The Broncos should enter the offseason confident this position doesn’t need to be addressed.

Receiver

Player Age How acquired 2021 cap hit Courtland Sutton 25 D2-18 $2176978 Jerry Jeudy 22 D1-20 $3452945 Tim Patrick 27 FA-17 Restricted FA KJ Hamler 22 D2-20 $1622076 DaeSean Hamilton 26 D4-18 $1090660 Diontae Spencer 29 W-19 ERFA Tyrie Cleveland 23 D7-20 $798873

Also: Kendall Hinton Trinity Benson and Fred Brown.

Analysis: The Broncos should feel comfortable with Sutton Jeudy Patrick and Hamler as their top four entering camp. … Sutton was going to be a 100-catch candidate before his Week 2 torn ACL. … Jeudy has 47 catches and two touchdowns but also 10 drops and he’ll be the biggest beneficiary from Sutton’s return. … Patrick (team-high six TD catches) deserves a second-round tender (projected $3.442 million). … Hamler won’t get as many touches as Jeudy but could have a bigger impact next year.

Offensive line

Player Age How acquired 2021 cap hit Garett Bolles (LT) 29 D1-17 $5000000 Graham Glasgow (RG) 29 UFA-20 $12000000 Dalton Risner (LG) 26 D2-19 $1947895 Lloyd Cushenberry (C) 23 D3-20 $1058180 Ja’Wuan James (RT) 29 UFA-19 $13000000 Elijah Wilkinson (RT) 26 CFA-17 Free agent Calvin Anderson (LT) 25 FA-19 ERFA Demar Dotson (RT) 35 UFA-20 Free agent Netane Muti (G) 22 D6-20 $831448 Austin Schlottmann (G/C) 25 CFA-18 ERFA Patrick Morris (C) 26 W-19 ERFA

Also: Darrin Paulo (OT) Quinn Bailey (OT) and Jon Halapio (G/C).

Analysis: The Broncos should enter the offseason knowing they have four starters locked in — Bolles Risner Cushenberry and Glasgow. … Bolles’ four-year contract kicks in and he’s had his best season (1/2 sack allowed four penalties) Risner has played better in the second half (one pass protection disruption allowed) Cushenberry has played all 995 snaps (one penalty) and Glasgow (744 snaps) fought an early-season ankle injury and mid-season COVID-19 positive test. … The Broncos are essentially stuck with James who opted out of 2020. They should re-sign Wilkinson to be a swing tackle. … The depth is solid with Anderson (backup LT) and Muti (backup G).

Defensive line

Player Age How acquired 2021 cap hit Shelby Harris (DE) 30 FA-17 Free agent Dre’Mont Jones (DE) 24 D3-19 $1142400 Mike Purcell (NT) 30 FA-19 $3687500 Jurrell Casey (DE) 31 T-20 $11874750 McTelvin Agim (NT) 23 D3-20 $1030396 DeMarcus Walker (DE) 26 D2-17 Free agent DeShawn Williams (DL) 28 FA-20 $850000 Sylvester Williams (DL) 32 FA-20 Free agent Kyle Peko (DL) 28 FA-19 $990000

Also: Darius Kilgo (DL) and Deyon Sizer (DT).

Analysis: It could be (should be?) an offseason of change up front. … Harris is a free agent and this being his only kick at the high-money can could simply sign with the highest bidder. … Walker hasn’t panned out and needs a fresh start. … The Broncos can create $11874750 in cap space by cutting Casey who was limited to three games because of a triceps injury. … Purcell will be returning from a foot injury and backed up by Agim. … Jones has played 503 snaps and has 11 pass rush disruptions in the last six games.

Outside linebacker

Player Age How acquired 2021 cap hit Von Miller 32 D1-11 $22125000 Bradley Chubb 25 D1-18 $8847213 Jeremiah Attaochu 28 FA-19 Free agent Malik Reed 25 CFA-19 $855000 Anthony Chickillo 28 FA-20 Free agent Derrek Tuszka 25 D7-20 $780000

Analysis: The Broncos can create $13.875 million in cap space by cutting Miller who missed all of 2020 (ankle) but don’t count on that. Would they consider extending his contract to lower his cap number and ensure he’ll be a one-franchise player? Perhaps. … If Miller returns the Broncos should still be in the draft market for an edge rusher to join him Chubb Reed and challenge Tuszka for the fourth spot in the rotation. … Reed and Chubb lead the team with 7 1/2 sacks.

Inside linebacker

Player Age How acquired 2021 cap hit Josey Jewell 26 D4-18 $1098496 Alexander Johnson 29 CFA-18 Restricted FA Austin Calitro 27 T-20 Restricted FA Joe Jones 27 FA-17 Free agent Justin Strnad 25 D5-20 $839444 Josh Watson 25 CFA-19 ERFA

Analysis: Johnson leads the Broncos with 117 tackles but does Fangio still envision him as an every-down player? Johnson’s coverage ability leaves much to be desired. In 1004 snaps he has 14 1/2 run “stuffs” and nine missed tackles. … Strnad was penciled in as a sub-package coverage linebacker until his training camp wrist injury. … Jewell emerged as a solid player with 102 tackles (12 run “stuffs”) and only four missed tackles in 922 snaps. … Fangio’s search for a version of Roquan Smith whom he had in Chicago will continue.

Cornerback

Player Age How acquired 2021 cap hit Bryce Callahan 29 UFA-19 $8333334 A.J. Bouye 30 T-20 $13375000 Michael Ojemudia 23 D3-20 $1079863 Essang Bassey 23 CFA-20 $786666 Nate Hairston 27 FA-20 $990000 Parnell Motley 23 FA-20 $780000 Duke Dawson 25 T-19 $1127028 Kevin Toliver 25 FA-20 Restricted FA

Analysis: Eight cornerbacks played at least 54 snaps this year. … The biggest offseason need is cornerback — a no-doubt shut-down player who allows Fangio to deploy Callahan inside/outside. … Broncos corners this year have combined for three interceptions and 24 pass break-ups. Not good enough. … Releasing Bouye who will start 2021 on suspension will create $13.375 million in cap space. A no brainer. … Ojemudia’s 14 tackles lead the team and his five penalties are tied for first. … Bassey has solidified the nickel spot until his torn ACL at Kansas City.

Safety

Player Age How acquired 2021 cap hit Justin Simmons 27 D3-16 Free agent Kareem Jackson 33 UFA-19 $12882353 Trey Marshall 25 CFA-18 ERFA Alijah Holder 25 CFA-19 $780000 P.J. Locke 24 FA-19 $780000 Will Parks (S/CB) 27 FA-20 Free agent

Also: Chris Cooper.

Analysis: Simmons has played all 1019 snaps is third with 93 tackles and first with four interceptions. The assumption is he’ll remain with the Broncos via a long-term deal or a second consecutive franchise tag which would be around $12.8 million (120% of this year’s tag). … The Broncos aren’t in a cap crunch so they can keep Jackson at his scheduled number; he has 87 tackles in 1015 snaps. … If Fangio and Co. don’t think Holder or Marshall is a dependable third safety add it to the list of draft needs particularly when the Broncos play dime (six defensive backs).

Special teams

Player Age How acquired 2021 cap hit Brandon McManus (K) 30 FA-14 $4500000 Sam Martin (P) 31 UFA-20 $2783333 Jacob Bobenmoyer (LS) 24 FA-20 $780000

Also: Taylor Russolino (K).

Analysis: McManus signed a contract extension in September and followed by making 25-of-28 field goals and 22-of-25 point-after attempts in 14 games. … Martin was a solid signing in free agency able to land punts inside the 15-yard line and directional kick when needed. Overall he has a 41.7-yard average. … Spencer has return averages of 18.9 (kickoffs) and 15.8 (punts) yards. … The coverage units which have allowed multiple big plays need to be addressed.

(Notes: Ages as of Sept. 1 2021. UFA — unrestricted free agent. RFA — restricted free agent. ERFA — exclusive rights free agent.)

OFFSEASON PRIMER

Key free agents

Unrestricted: S Justin Simmons DE Shelby Harris and RT Elijah Wilkinson.

Restricted: RB Phillip Lindsay WR Tim Patrick and ILB Alexander Johnson.

Positional needs

1. Cornerback. Only three of the Broncos’ eight interceptions were by cornerbacks. They need to draft one in the first round to join Bryce Callahan Essang Bassey and Michael Ojemudia.

2. Defensive end. If Shelby Harris Jurrell Casey and DeMarcus Walker aren’t brought back the Broncos need to add two ends.

3. Backup quarterback. If the Broncos are committed to Drew Lock being the starter entering camp adding an experienced No. 2 to provide guidance/push Lock is a priority.

All the Giants could do Sunday afternoon was all they could do which was finding a way to win their final regular-season game and then hope for the best. They did their part beating the rival Cowboys 23-19 at rainy MetLife Stadium. As they left the field the Giants did not know if the victory was a fond goodbye or a springboard.

“However it shakes out I’m proud of this team’’ said receiver Sterling Shepard the longest-tenured Giants player.

It did not shake out the way the Giants needed it to as later in the evening Washington defeated the Eagles 20-14 securing the NFC East title for Washington (7-9) and leaving the Giants (6-10) in second place the first season for head coach Joe Judge over and done with.

Leaving the job to others is always risky business and so it was for the Giants. The three-game losing streak in December cost them control of their playoff destiny and that turned out to be their undoing.

Giants players watched with great interest and then intense horror as Eagles head coach Doug Pederson trailing 17-14 early in the fourth quarter pulled quarterback Jalen Hurts for seldom-used Nate Sudfeld a move that showed how uninterested Pederson was in actually winning the game.

“This is sickening’’ receiver Darius Slayton posted on Twitter.

The Eagles owed the Giants nothing but you can be sure Judge and the Giants will remember how Pederson navigated his way into a loss and cost them a shot at the playoffs.

If Washington had lost the Giants would have become the first team in NFL history to go 6-10 and make it to the postseason. Instead Washington plays host to the Buccaneers (11-5) in an NFC wild-card game and the Giants pack up and go home missing out on the playoffs for the fourth consecutive year.

Judge after the Giants won said he was headed back to his office to begin preparing for the Bucs. Whatever he and his staff got done will not be needed.

“My words for the team at the end of the day was how proud I was that they kept playing’’ Judge said before knowing his playoff fate. “We came in it was a meaningful game put us in position to have a chance our guys went out and took care of business.’’

To stay alive the Giants went ahead 13-3 and 20-6. They nearly unraveled and early in the fourth quarter they were clinging to a 20-19 lead and every scintilla of momentum was with the Cowboys. At the finish the Giants got a monstrously big end-zone interception from rookie Xavier McKinney with 1:15 remaining and exulted over a Wayne Gallman run for a first down to clinch the game until Gallman actually dropped the ball. He fell on it for the recovery and only after a scrum of bodies and an official replay confirmed this the Giants could exhale.

“I’m sorry I caused drama’’ Gallman said.

All the drama surrounding the Giants would have been put to rest had they not ended a three-game losing streak and their seven-game losing streak to the Cowboys with a victory that eliminated the Cowboys (6-10) from postseason contention.

So when the Giants showered and took leave of the stadium they did not know if the next time they assembled would be to clean out their lockers or to begin preparation for a playoff game at MetLife Stadium. The Giants for one night were Eagles fans.

“I won’t be caught dead in an Eagles hat but I will be rooting for ’em’’ Shepard said.

To stay alive the Giants had to survive. They dropped would-be interceptions by Julian Love and James Bradberry and had what was an interception by McKinney nullified by a penalty on Darnay Holmes. Daniel Jones tossed first-half touchdown passes to Shepard and Dante Pettis and Shepard started the scoring with a 23-yard touchdown run on a reverse.

The second half was a slog as the rain started to pick up. Jones early in the third quarter was intercepted by safety Donovan Wilson on a pass that went through and deflected off the hands of tight end Evan Engram. The Cowboys cashed in with an Ezekiel Elliott touchdown and the Giants lead was trimmed to 20-16. A Greg Zuerlein field goal made it 20-19 early in the fourth quarter.

Jones and Shepard got cooking and a 50-yard field goal by Graham Gano pushed the Giants’ lead to 23-19 with 6:27 remaining. The Cowboys marched from their 25-yard line to the Giants’ 6-yard line. Leonard Williams’ sack of Andy Dalton made it third-and-goal on the 17-yard line and McKinney came up with his first NFL interception when Williams pressured Dalton into a desperate throw.

“I feel like we’re the best team in the division’’ safety Logan Ryan said. “We definitely deserve to represent the NFC East.’’

That will not happen. It is wait until next year for the Giants"

Posted on: January 3 2021 04:06h.

Last updated on: January 3 2021 05:12h.

MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) is reportedly looking to acquire Entain Plc (OTC:GMHY) the UK-based company formerly known as GVC Holdings that’s the casino operator’s partner in the BetMGM online gaming and sports wagering business.

The Wall Street Journal reported the rumor earlier today citing unidentified sources and claiming the Bellagio operator recently made a $10 billion offer for the UK-based company that was rejected. It’s not immediately clear what MGM’s new offer for the prospective target is but it is believed the proposal comes with financial support from Barry Diller’s IAC/InterActiveCorp (NASDAQ:IAC).

In August IAC revealed a $1 billion stake in the Las Vegas-based company equivalent to 12 percent of shares outstanding. Entain has a market capitalization of $9 billion. It’s believed MGM’s latest offer is a mixture of cash and equity and above the $17.56 a share that was pitched last year. Entain’s US-listed shares closed at $15.70 last Friday.

Following the recent sale of $700 million worth of units in gaming real estate investment trust (REIT) MGM Growth Properties (NYSE:MGP) the second such move made by MGM last year the Mandalay Bay operator has $5.9 billion in liquidity.

Precedent Set

Under the current terms of the BetMGM arrangement the casino operator and Entain split the economics. But with the US iGaming and sports wagering industries taking off brick-and-mortar gaming companies are looking for higher margin less cost-intensive businesses and can potentially find willing sellers among partners.

That door was opened in a big way last year when Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) said it’s acquiring its online casinos/sports betting partner William Hill (OTC:WIMHY) for $3.69 billion in cash in a transaction that’s expected to close in the first quarter.

MGM may have taken a cue from that deal because Wall Street is voicing preference for companies that have full control of their internet gaming and sports wagering operations over those that are constructed as partnerships as is the case with BetMGM.

Ladbrokes owner GVC and the casino company formed BetMGM in 2018 allocating $200 million to get the business going. The partners boosted that total to $450 million last July.

Good Time for a Deal

Entain shares jumped 25 percent last year and if that rally continues MGM or any other prospective buyer would be forced to pay up for the British company.

For now it’s not immediately clear if Entain will accept any takeover proposal or what MGM’s plans would be for the seller’s European retail business assuming an offer is accepted. Caesars will almost certainly shed William Hill’s international operations when that transaction is completed.

For MGM it makes sense to acquire Entain because in the BetMGM agreement the latter provides technology services. But the unit derives benefit from the gaming company’s well-known brand and land-based operations in select states positioning it capture iGaming licenses in those locations.

The offer which would have a substantial stock component comes after an earlier roughly US$10 billion all-cash overture was rebuffed.

By Tanishaa Nadkar

(Reuters) - Ladbrokes owner Entain said on Monday an $11 billion takeover approach from U.S. casino operator MGM Resorts significantly undervalued its business as companies move to capitalise on an expected boom in U.S. sports betting.

The United States is widely viewed as the next big growth market following a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that lifted a ban on sports betting. U.S. companies have sought partnerships to tap European expertise including Caesars Entertainment's 2.9 billion pound deal for Britain's William Hill in September.

Online betting has also enjoyed a further boost as COVID-19 restrictions encouraged locked-down customers to play more from home when casinos and betting shops were off limits.

A deal would make a global gaming company with presence in both online and retail channels and end-to-end technology stack MGM said adding it aimed to engage with Entain.

MGM and Britain's Entain formerly known as GVC have had a joint venture since 2018 when they set up an online betting platform in the United States.

MGM's proposed offer of 1383 pence per Entain share implies a deal value of 8.09 billion pounds ($11.08 billion) according to Reuters calculations representing a 22% premium to Entain's last close.

Entain shares jumped as much as 28% to an all-time high of 1455 pence leading gainers on the UK blue-chip index.

A deal would raise questions over the future of Entain's UK high street betting shops after Caesars said it could sell off William Hill's non-U.S. operations.

However an Entain spokesman told Reuters there was no detail on that yet.

""Entain is a far more global and more integrated operation – operating online gaming sites around the world as well as a high street estate. That makes folding the non-US operations into MGM or spinning them off separately a far greater challenge"" Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett said.

U.S. PROSPECTS

DraftKings whose backers include basketball great Michael Jordan and Flutter Entertainment's FanDuel are among the other businesses fighting for supremacy in the growing U.S. gambling market.

Entain said it received multiple proposals from MGM with the latest one being MGM's offer of 0.6 of its shares for each Entain share. Under the proposal Entain shareholders will own about 41.5% of the enlarged MGM.

MGM's proposal is backed by billionaire mogul Barry Diller's IAC group according to the Wall Street Journal which first reported the proposal on Sunday. It follows an earlier all-cash proposal worth about $10 billion that was also rejected it said.

Davy Research analysts also said the proposal undervalued Entain's operations including its prospects in the United States adding that MGM's flexibility and ability to improve its offer will be key.

Entain has itself expanded rapidly through a series of acquisitions and owns the bwin Coral and Eurobet brands. It has asked MGM for more information on the strategic rationale for a combination.

""It would be no surprise if the predator were to put a bigger wad down on the table"" AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.

Las Vegas-based MGM has indicated that a limited partial cash alternative would also be made available to Entain shareholders Entain said.

A consortium of vendors including Intel Samsung SanDisk Dell and Seagate developed Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) as a communication interface/protocol specifically for solid-state drives (SSDs). The specification defines a register interface command set and features for PCI Express (PCIe)-based SSDs to facilitate high performance and interoperability across all conforming NVM subsystems.

The NVMe specification provides an alternative to the Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) and Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) standards for interfacing between a host system and a peripheral storage device. The SCSI and ATA standards were developed at a time when hard disk drives (HDDs) and tape were the primary storage media. NVMe was designed for use with much faster media such as SSDs.

Other standards such as Serial-Attached SCSI (SAS) and Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) have been adapted to SSDs. However these standards do not convey the main benefits of NVMe-based PCIe SSDs:

Reduced host software stack latency

Higher input/output operations per second (IOPS)

Potential lower power consumption

The NVMe specification supports SSDs that use different types of non-volatile memory including NAND flash and the 3D XPoint technology developed by Intel and Micron Technology. Supported form factors include add-in PCIe cards M.2 SSDs and U.2 2.5-inch SSDs. Figure 1 shows the history of NAND evolvement.

Smaller devices look to M.2

M.2 a form factor specification formerly known as the Next Generation Form Factor (NGFF) is primarily for internally mounted computer expansion cards and associated connectors. Its flexible physical specification allows different module widths and lengths. Together with the availability of more advanced interfacing features this makes the M.2 ideal for solid-state storage applications in general and for use in small devices such as ultrabooks and tablets. Computer bus interfaces compatible to the M.2 connector are PCIe 3.0 Serial ATA 3.0 and USB 3.0. The M.2 connector has different keying notches that denote various purposes and capabilities of M.2 devices preventing inadvertent connection of incompatible devices. In addition to the legacy Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) at the logical interface level the M.2 specification also supports NVMe as the logical device interface for M.2 PCIe SSDs. While the support for AHCI ensures backward compatibility with SATA devices and legacy operating systems (OSs) NVMe is designed to fully utilize the capability of high-speed PCIe storage devices to perform multiple parallel I/O operations.

NVMe SSD applications

The SSD market has been running into some significant hurdles namely legacy storage buses. Serial ATA and SAS offer plenty of bandwidth for hard drives but the increasingly higher performance of SSDs is pushing them beyond their capabilities. For example almost any top-flight SATA SSD will run right up against SATA’s 600Gbps ceiling. Even 12 GBps SAS SSD performance is held back at around 1.5 GBps. SSD technology is capable of much more. Not incidentally a high-bandwidth bus technology was already in place—PCIe. PCIe is the specification for the underlying data transport layer for graphics and other add-in cards as well as Thunderbolt a hardware interface standard developed by Intel (in collaboration with Apple) that allows the connection of external peripherals to a computer. PCIe Gen 2 supports approximately 500 MBps per lane and version 3.x (Gen 3) supports around 985 MBps per lane. Putting a card in an x4 (four-lane) slot will give you 2 GBps of bandwidth with Gen 2 and nearly 4 GBps with Gen 3. That’s a vast improvement. PCIe 3.x provides a wide enough pipe for today’s fastest SSDs.

Intel partnered with Micron to develop a new form of memory technology called 3D XPoint to achieve high reliability. The Intel Optane SSD 905P half-height half-length M.2 format which supports PCIe 3.0×4 and NVMe is able to achieve a high 1.6 million hours of mean time between failure (MTBF) life expectancy. Its memory capacity is up to 1.5 TB (Figure 2).

In February Western Digital announced Ultrastar DC SN630 NVMe SSD a 2.5-inch small form factor (SFF) enterprise-grade NVMe SSD optimized for cloud storage. The Ultrastar DC SN630 SSD can be configured to deliver a capacity up to 7.68 TB. Additionally the company’s CL SN720 NVMe SSD is an NVMe M.2 form factor SSD supporting up to 2 TB. The 1 TB version has a read/write speed of 3400 MBps and 2800 MBps accordingly comparable with the Samsung’s offering with a slightly faster write time (Figure 3).

M.2 adapter selection criteria

Here are some things to consider when choosing M.2 adapters:

Capacity: How many SSDs can the adapter host? A full-height half-length card can host four NVMe SSDs and have a power dissipation limit of 25 W for a PCIe x16 slot. A half-height card can host two SSDs and lower power dissipation.

Support for PCIe x16 or PCIe x8: Say a GPU takes up 16 lanes but you still want to use four SSDs. You can overcome the lane shortage if the adapter you choose includes an onboard switch to provide an x8 connection.

Cooling the SSDs: Can the onboard cooling devices e.g. heat sinks adequately dissipate the heat generated by the SSDs for your application? You may want to consider a cooling fan if your application involves sustained prolonged sequential write operations. But if the write operation is in short bursts lasting seconds or a few minutes then a good heat sink with reliable air flow may suffice.

Signal integrity: The challenge here is that PCIe using high-speed 8-Gbps serial links can suffer from a multitude of physical phenomena such as crosstalk impedance discontinuities resulting in reflections that cause jitter Intersymbol Interference (ISI) and mode conversion due to unbalanced transmission lines—all of which can lead to excessive electromagnetic interference (EMI) emissions in large systems. Manufacturing processes ensuring the high signal integrity of PCIe Gen 3 serial channels are critical if high-speed serial interfaces are to deliver on their promise of greater performance. Signal integrity analysis and compliance testing must be rigorously implemented in production and QA processes to accomplish that goal.

Availability of standard drivers/tools

High-end SSDs had been made using the PCIe bus before NVMe but the interfaces were non-standard. Standardizing the interface of SSDs to the NVMe specification makes it possible for operating systems to use one driver to work with all conforming SSDs. For example Windows 10 has its own driver for NVMe SSDs. Drivers are hardware dependent and operating-system-specific. They usually provide the interrupt handling required for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interface.

One of the best things about NVMe is that you don’t have to worry about driver availability. Linux has had NVMe support since kernel 3.1; Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 R2 both include a native driver and there’s a FreeBSD driver in the works. When Apple decides to support NVMe the latter should make it easy to port. However BIOS support is largely lacking. Without an NVMe-aware BIOS you can’t boot from an NVMe drive although anyone with an x4 PCIe slot or M.2 connector can benefit from employing an NVMe drive as secondary storage. An NVMe BIOS is not a big deal but it does require effort and resources. More abundant and prevalent support has to be there. If you intend to make an SSD boot device you would need:

A recent system such as the Xeon D-1540 or Skylake chipsets (2015 or later).

Modern OSs that have the NVMe driver built in like Windows 8.1/10 or Windows Server 2016. If the OS-provided driver is slow replace it with a vendor-provided driver once OS is installed.

An M.2 PCIe x4 (or higher) slot (as in four lanes key to obtaining the maximum speeds).

BIOS in UEFI boot mode (A nice bonus here is that it allows your bootable device to be larger than 2 TB since Windows will use the GUID Partition Table (GPT) rather than the legacy Master Boot Record (MBR) mode.

Compatibility Support Mode (CSM) to be turned on (as required by some motherboards).

BIOS upgrades and/or BIOS configuration changes (as required by motherboard manufacturer).

Optional M.2 NVMe SSD PCIe adapter card for multiple SSDs.

Newer high-end motherboards will get firmware upgrades to support NVMe so one can boot from the drive.

Samsung offers two models with built-in controllers that support PCIe Gen 3.0 x4 and NVMe 1.3 in a M.2 format. They support storage capacity up to 1 TB (970PRO) and 2 TB (970VRO). The read speed is 3500 MBps for both models while the sequential write speed is 2500 MBps and 2700 MBps accordingly (Figure 4).

Note that NVMe SSDs are nearly seven times faster than SATA SSDs. A single NVMe M.2 SSD can provide read speeds as high as 3500 MBps. To maximize the SSD performance one may want to select a M.2 adapter separately. For example one of Aplicata’s expansion adapters the Quattro 400 PCIe x8 model provides a read speed of 7.2 GBps when combined with four 1 TB Samsung 970PRO NVMe SSDs. At this speed it is close to the PCIe Gen 3 x8. These inexpensive adapter cards will fit in the PCIe slots if the motherboard lacks a M.2 connector (Figure 5).

Conclusion

NVMe is a communication interface/protocol developed specifically for SSDs by a consortium while M.2 is primarily for internally mounted computer expansion cards and associated connectors. SSDs come in pre-configured controllers. To achieve higher read/write performance one may consider the option of integrating SSDs using separate M.2 adapters. In selecting an adapter consider the supported storage capacity whether it supports PCIe x16 or x8 the cooling of the SSDs signal integrity and finally the availability of standard drivers and tools.",,,,,,,,,

""Obviously PlayStation 5 is in very tight supply. When you look at the graphics cards from AMD and Nvidia I mean there’s just a lot of interest in gaming right now and console sales are just a sign of that. Game sales are a sign of that.

""I'm incredibly proud of how the teams did"" Spencer added reflecting on the challenges of releasing new consoles in 2020. ""We got the consoles launched and wish we had more of them. It's selling out too quickly. But all in all really proud of what the teams have been able to do.""

Now however a video game editor has acknowledged the rumour ""has a strong chance of being true based on stuff [they'd] heard"" which reportedly states Ubisoft will join the service in late 2021.

If true it follows in line with EA Play which joined the console version of Xbox Game Pass in time for the launch of Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.

The American legal system runs on deadlines. As one practicing attorney wrote in an official publication for the American Bar Association ""[M]issing any filing deadline is a lawyer's worst nightmare.""

That's especially true if you're representing the plaintiffs in an ""Emergency Complaint For Expedited Declaratory And Emergency Injunctive Relief"" involving the United States Presidential election before a Federal District Court. For those keeping score at home that's two Emergencies and one Expedited in a single motion.

All of which makes this weekend's filing from the plaintiffs' legal team in Gohmert v. Pence particularly eye-catching:

Plaintiffs' Unopposed Motion to File Responsive Brief Late Come now the Plaintiffs U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert (TX-1) Tyler Bowyer Nancy Cottle Jake Hoffman Anthony Kern James R. Lamon Sam Moorhead Robert Montgomery Loraine Pellegrino Greg Safsten Kelli Ward and Michael Ward by and through their undersigned counsel and request that this Court allow Plaintiffs to file their responsive brief one hour late. In support thereof Plaintiffs state: Plaintiffs have employed a team of lawyers to prepare their responsive brief. During the course of preparation Plaintiffs' counsel have encountered numerous technical incompatibilities in the software versions between Google Docs and Microsoft Word resulting in editing difficulties and text problems. WHEREFORE Plaintiffs request an extension of one hour of the deadline for filing their responsive brief. [emphasis added]

I read that and had to rub my eyes and reread it about five more times to make sure I was really seeing a Federal court filing in which the attorneys for a sitting member of the United States Congress suing the Vice President of the United States told a Federal District Court that they needed a one-hour extension because they were having trouble getting Google Docs and Microsoft Word to play nicely together.

The most startling thing was finding a lawyer who even acknowledged using Google Docs. For those in the legal community Microsoft Word is not just a de facto standard; in many cases it's the de jure standard as well. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California for example notes on its Attorney Info page that it is ""a Microsoft Word only court."" (The page helpfully includes Word document templates in different fonts none of which is Comic Sans as well as instructions for saving WordPerfect documents in Word format.)

On Twitter I conducted an informal survey of lawyers and the results were decisive. Out of 69 responses 57 (83%) said they and their law firms use Word exclusively. This comment from a New Jersey-based lawyer was representative: ""I have never used Google Docs in law school or as an attorney. We always use Word. No court or firm for which I've worked uses Google Docs.""

A Pennsylvania-based attorney added: ""I find Google Docs unusable for legal work it's too difficult to get the final formatting to work especially if you're working with other lawyers. Maybe I could fix this by investing hours understanding it but well I'm not going to. So Word it is.""

Another five respondents said they use the previous legal standard WordPerfect. Five lawyers said they use both Microsoft Word and Google Docs. This comment was typical of the both-platforms contingent: ""Google Docs 95% of the time (G Suite is what we run our office with). We use Word for documents like appellate briefs that need more sophisticated formatting.""

Anyway in the current case it sounds like the problem is that the document file was being corrupted during multiple conversions from Google Docs to Word and back again as it passed from hand to hand probably as a series of email attachments. The conversion process can handle most basic document formatting but you're likely to run into problems when you add complicated formatting like footnotes endnotes and a table of authorities.

So where did the learned counsel for the plaintiffs go wrong and how can you avoid making similar mistakes the next time your widely scattered team is collaborating on a Very Important Project with a Very Tight Deadline?

I have three recommendations:

Choose one editing platform for the project. Period. Full stop. If you start editing in Google Docs stay in Google Docs. If you start in Microsoft Word stay in Word. Any time you convert a document to another format you run the risk of munging your document in subtle ways that you might not notice until it's too late. Doing multiple roundtrip conversions is a recipe for mayhem.

Use cloud-based storage for real-time collaboration. We're well into the 21st Century and anyone who's trying to manage a group editing project with email attachments needs to catch up. If you're using Microsoft Word you can share your documents using OneDrive for Business or Dropbox or Box all of which have add-ins that allow you to open and save files directly from Word. (Hint: Google has detailed instructions on how to store Office documents in Google Drive and use Word to edit them.)

Don't cross the streams. If one team member (or an outside contributor) insists on using their preferred platform rather than the standard you've settled on quarantine their contributions. Make them turn on Track Changes mode and then designate another team member to transfer their changes to the master document.

In the case of Gohmert v. Pence the plaintiffs' legal team got their one-hour extension but it did them little good as the court denied their motion in less time than it takes to convert a Google Doc to Word format.

Maybe they should have also turned on spell-check. It probably didn't help their cause that the header in BOLD CAPS at the top of the first page misspelled the name of the District Court.

We thought the Disney-Fox Deal was the deal of the century. But what came as a surprise twist a few days ago blew us all away. A recent leak from a Spanish portal claimed that Microsoft has bought Sony’s PlayStation division for a record sum of $130 Billion. Gaming enthusiasts worldwide were left gasping for air. This was particularly too hard a pill for hardcore PlayStation Loyalists to swallow. Rumors of the deal started surfacing all over the internet pretty soon after that. Like a Chinese Whisper the rumors started claiming Microsoft did not just buy out Sony’s PlayStation division. There was more.

Apparently the $130 Billion deal was for Microsoft taking over entire Sony – the giant multinational conglomerate.

Some said it was a hoax. Some said the news could be true. Many were claiming past precedents to describe the authenticity of this ‘leak’. Microsoft has been on a buying spree as of late. They had earlier bought ZeniMax Media for a whopping $7.5 Billion. ZeniMax Media is the parent company of Bethesda Softworks the Game Publisher of popular games like Elder Scrolls Wolfenstein and the Fallout series.

Microsoft’s Xbox console has always been lagging behind the Sony PlayStation. The latter has had a very formidable exclusive games library something that had always given Sony’s console the edge in sales ever since the inception of modern console gaming. The takeover of Bethesda was supposed to add a few Xbox Exclusives to the Microsoft library. So maybe Microsoft did the unthinkable and bought the Sony PlayStation division? That seems pretty plausible considering Microsoft has better coffers and deeper pockets than Sony.

Hoax Or Legit?

Before we give you the answer let’s just take a deep breath. The Sony PlayStation owners would be absolutely on edge at the prospects of losing out to Xbox owners the greatest console rivalry in the world. A closer inspection of the news will show us a clearer image.

Did Microsoft really buy out Sony? The answer is…..

HELL FREAKING NO! Internet is a weird and strange place. Don’t believe everything it feeds you. The leak first came into notice at a certain Spanish portal and then was picked up by a site called the “Microsofters”. The news eventually made it to primetime EN24 News on social media. It was then that it all began. The original source made very convincing arguments. Many intricate and clever details like the company trying to take advantage of Sony’s core strengths – mainly its camera and gaming technology.

Japan had always been a tough market for Microsoft. This was supposed to be the company’s first inroad into the Land of the Rising Sun.

It doesn’t take too much brains to figure this out. Many would never believe this news in the first place. But gaming fanatics cane be a very erratic crowd at times. a deal like this must be all over the internet. It’s not. The ‘leak’ was ironic in the sense that it came on December 28. In Hispanic Culture the day is called “The Day Of Holy Innocents”. In other words it was the Spanish April Fool’s Day.

This was all just an evil little prank.

One of the world’s leading manufacturers of COVID-19 vaccines has disclosed that it doesn’t plan to distribute its vaccine in South Africa the most badly hit country on the African continent.

The decision by Moderna Inc. whose vaccine is currently being distributed in Canada and the United States is another indication of the severe difficulties African countries face as they seek fairness in the distribution of vaccines. Some have complained of “vaccine apartheid” by wealthier countries hoarding the supply.

South Africa has recorded more than 1.1 million cases of the virus – about 39 per cent of all cases in Africa – and nearly 30000 deaths. Its government is under heavy pressure to acquire a vaccine as soon as possible but it says it was unable to persuade Moderna to submit its vaccine to the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) the agency that approves vaccines.

“We reached out to them” said Anban Pillay deputy director-general of South Africa’s Health Department at a briefing on Sunday.

“We tried to persuade them around supply” he said. “It’s clear that they have no intention of filing a dossier any time soon with SAHPRA.”

A spokesperson for Moderna did not respond to queries from The Globe and Mail on Sunday. The U.S.-based company has agreed to sell 40 million doses of its vaccine to Canada 100 million doses to the United States and 160 million doses to the European Union.

More than 12 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been distributed so far in 33 countries worldwide but none of those countries are in Africa according to statistics compiled by Our World In Data a research group based at the University of Oxford.

John Nkengasong director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned last week that the world could face a “moral catastrophe” if vaccines are hoarded by wealthy countries preventing Africa from getting a fair supply.

“We cannot delay we need those vaccines and need them now” Dr. Nkengasong said.

One company Pfizer Inc. has reportedly offered to supply 50 million vaccine doses to African countries by the end of 2021 but this is expected to cover only a limited number of people primarily health care workers since it is a two-shot vaccine. Its cost could also be prohibitive for many African countries.

Donna Patterson a scholar at Delaware State University who studies African health and pharmaceutical issues said the decisions by companies such as Moderna and Pfizer are troubling.

“The West does not exist in a silo and people anywhere in the world should not be denied access to vaccine because of where they were born” Dr. Patterson told The Globe. “Access to new and extant pharmaceuticals should be distributed equitably.”

She noted that some companies including Pfizer have tested their vaccines in trials in South Africa. “Given the use of South African bodies for R&D of the drug Pfizer should consider making a larger amount of the vaccine available to the wider South African citizenry.”

Some African countries are negotiating access to vaccines from China or Russia but neither country has submitted the required full data for regulatory approval in South Africa Dr. Pillay told the briefing on Sunday.

This leaves only a few potential vaccines for South Africa. The most likely candidate in the near term is the AstraZeneca vaccine; it originated in Britain and is already being produced by the Serum Institute of India which has made nearly 50 million doses so far. It has an agreement to provide vaccines to COVAX a global initiative that provides affordable vaccines to low-income and middle-income countries.

The Serum Institute however is planning to concentrate on supplying India for the next two months before it begins any exports according to a Reuters report on Sunday.

South Africa has said it expects to begin receiving vaccines through the apa program in the second quarter of this year with the goal of receiving enough doses for 10 per cent of its population by the end of 2021. But on Sunday officials said they are hoping to begin receiving vaccines from COVAX as early as March.

They are also hoping to receive vaccines from other sources as early as February but they did not disclose those potential sources citing non-disclosure agreements that South Africa was required to sign with pharmaceutical companies.

Mondelez International Inc. is adding a new Oreo variety to the brand’s permanent lineup: Java Chip. The sandwich cookies feature coffee flavored crème with chocolate chips sandwiched between two chocolate wafers. Each two-cookie serving contains 140 calories less than 1 gram of protein and 13 grams of sugar.

Kellogg Co. expanded its Raisin Bran brand with new Kellogg’s Raisin Bran Toasted Oats and Honey. The cereal features bran flakes and raisins paired with whole grain toasted oats and a touch of honey. Each 1-cup serving contains 190 calories 5 grams of fiber 4 grams of protein and 13 grams of sugar.

“As a classic cereal staple we're always looking to innovate and deliver new experiences to our dedicated Kellogg's Raisin Bran fans” said Erin Storm senior marketing director of Kellogg All Family Cereal. “Just like the original cereal Kellogg's Raisin Bran Toasted Oats and Honey is a heart-healthy option and makes for an irresistible flavor combination — combining our signature bran flakes and juicy raisins with whole grain oats and a hint of honey.”

PepsiCo Inc.’s Frito-Lay business is debuting Cheetos Crunch Pop Mix which combines traditional Cheetos with Cheetos Popcorn. Each 1-cup serving contains 160 calories 1 grams of protein and 1 gram of sugar.

“2020 was a year unlike any other in that we saw the incredibly popular introduction of Cheetos Popcorn in January quickly followed by world-changing events that affected every industry differently” said Rachel Ferdinando senior vice president and chief marketing officer for Frito-Lay North America. “For our brands we saw trends like Cheetos recipe searches skyrocketing 190%. So now we’re thinking with that lens through everything we introduce to the world. Hopefully Cheetos Crunch Pop Mix can provide a small moment of joy and bring a few smiles this year.”

Volatility itself went on a wild ride in 2020 veering from near-perfect calm at the beginning of the year to full-blown panic in March before central bank stimulus knocked stock market turbulence back to near the long-term average by December. Analysts expect 2021 to be more tranquil setting investors up to tiptoe back into the risky yet lucrative “short-vol” trade.

The Vix volatility index — popularly nicknamed the “fear gauge” as it reflects the ebb and flow of Wall Street’s anxiety levels — entered last year around the 12 to 13 points level close to record lows as investors anticipated a continuation of the longest bull run in history.

The calm began to fade in February and shattered decisively in March when the pandemic forced the shutdown of swaths of the global economy. The Vix index which measures the short-term expected volatility of the S&P 500 index from derivatives prices soared to a peak of over 85 points in mid-March.

However the extraordinarily aggressive measures taken by central banks and governments to buttress financial markets sent the Vix index sliding back again.

Unnerving but ultimately fleeting stock market reversals in June and September caused brief rises in the Cboe’s volatility index and nervousness over the looming US presidential election caused the “fear gauge” to climb higher at the end of October. But the stock market rally stayed on track and the Vix finished the year at just shy of 23 points.

That has reopened the door to investors that aim to profit from “shorting” volatility in practice selling insurance against stock market squalls and pocketing the premiums that other investors pay.

Many volatility-sellers took a beating in March and have withdrawn from the market which analysts say has made the attractiveness and payout of short-vol trades more attractive. “The backdrop remains supportive for vol sellers” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a recent note.

Marko Kolanovic global head of quantitative strategy at JPMorgan argues that the Vix has historically in the long run been driven by monetary policy with an 18-month lag. In light of the stimulus unleashed since March — globally central banks have bought $7.5tn of bonds this year according to the IMF — Mr Kolanovic expects the Vix index to remain somnolent.

“Given the significant increase of monetary accommodation nine months ago we expect it to pressure volatility for most of 2021” he wrote in a recent note to clients. JPMorgan expects the Vix to average just 17 points this year compared with its long run average of about 20 as more return-hungry investors begin to sell insurance against renewed turbulence.

“Given that volatility selling suffered large losses in March most volatility sellers reduced exposure or entirely stepped out of the market in 2020” Mr Kolanovic said. “In 2021 we expect these sellers to gradually step back in attracted by wide risk premia declining volatility-of-volatility and significant opportunities to generate returns in an otherwise low yield environment.”

There are already indications that the short-vol trade is coming back in vogue. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission collects data on the positioning of various types of traders and its data indicate that “non-commercial” actors — a proxy for hedge funds — are now net short over 90000 Vix futures contracts.

MOS,Mosaic Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vc2lmdGVkLmV1L2FydGljbGVzL2JlbmVkaWN0LWV2YW5zLW1vc2FpY9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Benedict Evans: “Everyone can now create”,"Anyone needing a shot of positivity following this dispiriting Covid-plagued year should jump on a Zoom call with Benedict Evans. The fast-talking tech analyst who last year returned to the UK after five years with Andreessen Horowitz on the West Coast is fizzing with the conviction that tech is going to change pretty much everything in our world as smartphones have become ubiquitous.

“I am optimistic about tech and I’m optimistic about European tech” he says in a video interview.

After joining London-based Mosaic as a venture partner in January Evans has just produced his latest 60-slide presentation entitled Europe Unicorns and Global Tech Diffusion in which he calls the end of the American internet the globalisation of the Silicon Valley startup model and the rise of the rest of the world. “Tech is now part of everybody’s life and every business” he says.

In his view the internet software and consumer technology have reached the same point as the car industry did when it became a commonplace means of transport. “There is a saying that the first 50 years in the car industry were about creating car companies. The second 50 years were what happened when everybody had cars. You create McDonald's and Walmart and everything else.”

“We have finally got to the point when everyone has a computer. So what now? And the answer is: everything else. There is a huge amount of creation that happens in Europe. You don’t have to be in that Silicon Valley cluster any more.”

Here are five of the main insights from his report:

1) It’s not all about Silicon Valley

There was a time when the computer industry was overwhelmingly concentrated in Silicon Valley. When Apple launched the Mac in 1984 global PC unit sales were about 6.5m units. Now there are an estimated 3.5bn smartphones across the world.

Startup companies have sprung in every continent and the venture capital industry has gone global. “A Silicon Valley company is an invention in its own right just as the limited company was. And that invention has spread globally in the past 10 years” he says.

That has meant that the gravitational pull of Silicon Valley has diminished just as rocketing house prices have forced many ambitious startup entrepreneurs out of the Bay Area. “You don’t have to physically be there anymore” he says. That diffusion trend may only accelerate as people become accustomed to remote working thanks to the pandemic.

2) There are a lot of smart entrepreneurs in Europe

One of the things that struck Evans after returning from California was how far it had become normalised to launch a startup in Europe which was certainly not the case when he graduated in 1998.

“There used to be a joke that there were only three American books: Moby Dick The Great Gatsby and Catcher in the Rye. Similarly there were only ever three startups in Europe: Skype Spotify and TransferWise” he says.

“There is both a sense of Silicon Valley being incredibly overheated as we see in the valuations but also a sense that there are a lot of interesting good tech companies coming out of Europe now.”

As his report notes there is a higher proportion of STEM graduates in Europe than in the US and Europe accounts for seven of the top 20 computer science departments in the world — Oxford ETH Zurich Cambridge Imperial TU Munich UCL and EPFL. Company creation is also similar to the US. More than 120 unicorns collectively worth in excess of $600bn have emerged in Europe over the past decade.

3) The VC industry has grown up in Europe

Europe may have lagged well behind the US and China in terms of VC funding over the past decade but it is closing the gap. Early stage funding in Europe has increased four times since 2010 spreading into many more areas beyond fintech and biotech. Growing US VC interest in Europe has been highlighted by Sequoia’s decision to open a European office.

But it will take time for this early-stage investment to turn into world-beating tech companies. “The paradox of venture is that you’re dealing with this incredibly fast transformation and it’s a get-rich-slowly business when the average IPO is eight years” Evans says.

4) Regulation may be a source of competitive advantage for Europe

US tech titans may argue that excessive European regulation only protects incumbents and stifles innovation. But Evans says that in some respects Europe has a more flexible regulatory regime than the US (eg. the use of drones) that could be more welcoming for tech startups. “There is a class of regulatory questions where it is very difficult to change things in the US. It can be easier to change things in Europe” he says.

“I remember a conversation we had at Andreessen Horowitz with a British cabinet minister and one of our general partners said it would be good if you could change that law but of course you can’t. And the cabinet minister said: ‘What do you mean we can’t change the law? We’re the fucking government. It is the only thing we can do.’”

How Brexit will change this equation is as yet unclear. Evans says the disappearance of the British counterweight within the EU may result in Brussels turning more protectionist. But it is also possible that any regulatory divergence by Britain could lead to a more competitive dynamic within Europe leading to the reform of outdated tax and option laws.

5) It’s all to play for

The US and China may have dominated the consumer internet market leading to the creation of tech giants such as Apple Amazon Google Alibaba and Tencent. But the next stage of the tech revolution will impact every industry creating massive new opportunities to transform existing businesses and build new companies.

“Nobody is going to start a Silicon Valley company to make marine engines. But the way they cast that metal will be transformed by software the way they design the system will be transformed by software all the telemetry and the way they manage it will be transformed by software” says Evans.

“There was a point in time when all software companies were made in Silicon Valley and that’s ending because everyone can now create this stuff.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd2hhdGNvbS1uZXdzLmNvbS9uZXctZmVybmRhbGUtbW9kdWxhci1idWlsZGluZ3MtYnVzaW5lc3MtZ2V0cy1ncmVlbi1saWdodC10by1iZWdpbi1wcm9kdWN0aW9uXzExMTUxMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Ferndale modular buildings business gets green light to begin production,"New Ferndale modular buildings business gets green light to begin production

FERNDALE Wash. — A meeting with the City of Ferndale Hearing Examiner Michael Bobbink last week December 30th resulted in the announcement that a conditional use permit would be approved for a new business located at the former Sawarne Lumber planning mill site 5530 Nordic Place.

The new business 360 Modular Building Systems plans to hire up to 80 staff company Vice-president Robert Dale said during the meeting. The company constructs modular building components at their facility and then ships them to customers’ sites where they will be assembled into buildings.

The City required a conditional use permit since manufacturing is not explicitly allowed in a General Business zone but staff recommended approval since this is a low-impact operation like what is occurring on adjacent properties. City of Ferndale Planning Director Haylie Miller said the new use is expected to be “less intrusive in nature than the previous use on the site.”

Dale said modular construction lends itself to multifamily residential construction and is expected to benefit the community by providing low-cost high-efficiency buildings. He added the company’s core business will be large structures rather than single-family residential units.

Sawarne Lumber is a partner in the business according to Dale.

General Manager Amanda Zender told My Ferndale News that Whatcom County recently contracted with 360 Modular Building Systems to provide 50 8-foot-square modular “individual shelter structures” to serve as temporary emergency weather shelters.

Zender said more typical projects are composed of boxes built at the facility that are then stacked “like Legos” to be assembled into a structure. Electrical and plumbing are already completed and ready to be connected she said.

Box dimensions can be up to 80-feet long and width is limited only by transportation constraints according to Zender.

If not you’ll find her partying by the cycle path near Warriston Cemetery along with her noisy set.

Her creator Helen Miles began making graffiti mosaics back in 2017 not long after arriving in Edinburgh. For the previous 14 years she had been honing her skills in Greece and had other spells in the US and in the Middle East.

Helen explained: “I get up ludicrously early to install my graffiti mosaics and take Farook (my dog) with me. He sits in the grass looking serious while I get on with preparing the surface spreading the adhesive and installing the mosaic. The first few times I did it I was petrified. Every siren was a speeding police car sending a squad to arrest me.

“When I was installing ‘Why Me?’ on Calton Hill I heard the sound of heavy footsteps pounding towards me and thought my time was up. I turned heart racing as the steps neared me and sensing the discomfiture of the young man – an off-duty police officer perhaps – who stood before me.”

Miles is careful about where she installs her mosaics — she favours areas where there is already graffiti. An epiphany came when she realised that the council was actually sending someone to clean the graffiti off her mosaic. Here was recognition indeed!

It took a long time for Helen to find a studio large enough for all her materials and tools. In the meantime she had an urge to create — she wanted to make her presence felt. What’s more she had ‘a deep and almost desperate need to introduce the world to mosaics.’

“Mosaics aren’t talked about in the History of Art canon because they were made collectively; there was no one named creator. People just don’t get them. Perhaps because they don’t come across mosaics very often. They think you can just knock one up with a broken plate.”

Helen spent a year with a master craftsman in Thessaloniki Greece before continuing her training in Athens. She said: “I became obsessed with Roman mosaics which have extraordinary designs. I used to think one didn’t really need to do more than that; now I’m much more adventurous.”

Known for her more traditional classical technique Helen explained: ‘If you look at the crow the way the tiles are laid is very classical. There are rules about how the tesserae are arranged: the spaces are just as important as the tesserae themselves. You don’t want to create rivers or lines in the gaps. If you do the eye will fall on them. It’s easy for a mosaic to get fussy and distracting.’

The automotive aftermarket industry is going through interesting times. People are fixing up their old cars to avoid public transport amid the coronavirus crisis resulting in an increased demand for car parts. Even though the car parts industry wasn't safe from uncertainty and losses in 2020 the new year could bring in huge opportunities for long-term investors. Click to skip ahead our discussion and see the 5 best auto-parts stocks to buy for 2021.

Like every industry the automotive aftermarket sector has experienced a bumpy ride in 2020 amid the coronavirus crisis. In the beginning the industry got hammered after vehicle miles traveled (VMT) dropped across the country resulting in a steep decline in auto parts demand. Restricted movement in all states also resulted in less usage of personal vehicles fewer collisions and limited customer spending on new auto parts. Vehicle sales in the U.S. which were already crashing worsened after the COVID-19 outbreak as consumers started to limit their spending. In November new car sales posted a 15% decline. All of this painted a bleak picture for the auto-parts industry.

An Antifragile Industry

But the auto-parts industry is known for its anti-fragility. In the period between 2007 to 2009 when the U.S. economy was in recession and auto sales for new cars plunged 42% the aftermarket experienced just a 1% decline. Analysts now believe that the auto-parts industry is set for a strong rebound and growth in 2021 on the back of several factors.

Firstly a decline in new car sales will buoy demand for auto parts as people drive their old cars and trade used cars. Secondly people are starting to shun public transport and prefer using personal cars to avoid contracting the coronavirus. Stephan Wöllenstein chief executive of Volkswagen Group China said earlier this year that the company is seeing a rise in sales mostly from young buyers who accounted for about 60% of the company’s sales in March. In a survey conducted by the Institute for Transport Research in June and July 50% of respondents said they are using public transport less often or much less often because of health risks. This trend will help the auto-parts industry grow in 2021 and beyond.

McKinsey & Company forecasts that the auto-parts industry will grow at a rate of 3% per annum through 2030. However the industry is expected to go through several key changes in consumer behavior including a shift to e-commerce direct distributions and partnerships. The aftermarket industry growth will touch new highs in Asia according to the report. McKinsey expects automotive aftermarket revenues of approximately €337 billion in North America and approximately €295 billion in Europe in 2030.

Times are changing rapidly. The hedge fund industry’s reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 88 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16.

Growth Catalysts for Car Parts Stocks in 2021

Several growth catalysts are on the horizon for the auto parts industry. One of them is emerging technologies and the upcoming demand for new injection systems and turbochargers. The rise of hybrid diesel and electric vehicles in the U.S. Europe China and Asia will push auto parts companies to invest in innovation for growth in 2021 and beyond. The auto-parts industry is also transitioning rapidly to ecommerce. According to an estimate ecommerce sales accounted for $16 billion of the total U.S. automotive aftermarket revenue crushing analysts’ forecasts.

Data shows that personal consumption of auto parts reached an all-time high of $50.509 billion in June 2020. With the availability of coronavirus vaccines and traffic coming back to pre-COVID levels globally auto-parts stocks are poised to grow in 2021. The Dow Jones U.S. Auto Parts Index is up over 16% in 2020.

Netflix started as a DVD rental company… | by Erima Goyal,"Datafication and personalization

Netflix started as a DVD rental company more than 20 years back. With personalization at its core Netflix recommended and mailed DVDs to its customers. Back then its personalization algorithms had very few data points — the past rental history length of the time a DVD was held and maybe some additional demographics information.

Fast-forwarding to the time when Netflix launched a streaming service it plunged into datafication of user behavior capturing the customer browsing history the points where a customer pressed forward rewind or pause the titles added to wish list and so on. Netflix has divided its customers into a few thousand micro clusters that are essentially taste communities and each individual might be part of multiple taste communities. This datafication in the modern streaming and internet world helped Netflix better understand its customers to provide a more personalized experience - a customized homepage for each customer and a hyper-personalized “Recommended for you” and “Because you watched the ABC title”.

La Casa de Papel aka Money Heist

Image from Unsplash

La Casa de Papel a crime thriller was created and telecasted in Spain back in 2017 placing it for a strong start with a prime time slot. However the viewership declined consistently over its first two-season run with the show being summarized as a flop in Spain.

In Dec 2017 Netflix bought international streaming rights for La Casa de Papel dubbed it into English renamed it to Money Heist and placed it into its catalog of numerous other foreign-language shows. Money Heist was launched on Netflix without any promotion simply subject to the mercy of algorithms possibly with the right tags and classification. This is where folks like myself with an affinity for crime thrillers had Money Heist added to the Netflix recommendation list.

In parallel in early 2018 the show's actors started observing an unusual phenomenon on their Instagram profiles — their followers were just climbing and the actors were not anonymous anymore. Within four months of its global launch the show became the most-watched foreign-language series on Netflix and the show was renewed for another two seasons in April 2018 with a significantly higher budget. Needless to say the next two seasons were received with immense pleasure by fans with 34M watching it in the first week of its launch.

How it happened — the science of recommendation systems

What happened here is pure data science and machine learning. Netflix published this show with tags such as “TV thriller Suspense Exciting.” Some other shows with similar tags include Prison Break Narcos Breaking Bad. In its microclusters Netflix would have identified customers who like TV thrillers and Money Heist started showing up on their recommendation list. With more people watching the show and providing great reviews the show jumped up the recommendations. With all the datafication classification and clustering that Netflix had done on its customers the show was recommended to the right cluster of customers. I will be writing a detailed article on recommendation systems later.

The future — data integration across companies

If in a hypothetical situation Netflix and Instagram were to come together and leverage each other’s datafication outcomes both could create extra value for their respective customers. Instagram with the knowledge of Netflix’s clusters could propose new connections show similar advertisements to the customers in one cluster and so on.

Netflix can identify who are the actors its customers have liked/followed on Instagram and then use the pictures of these popular actors as thumbnails on different titles a customized picture for each customer to gain quick attention. If on my Instagram I have followed Álvaro Morte (the Professor in Money Heist) then his picture would show up on Mirage as a thumbnail in my Netflix recommendations.

Now if Netflix were to create a new thriller as it is creating its own content these days it would identify through Instagram the popular thriller genre actors amongst its targeted viewer base. Bingo! Netflix has the cast for its next production.

Summary

Data is the new oil! More data better algorithms and better products leading to more data creation — the flywheel continues to support business model innovation and value creation for the customers. Companies have to venture on a datafication journey which is systematically extracting data from activities and transactions that are naturally ongoing in the business establishing data pipelines that enable large volumes of data with high velocity while capturing enough variety. Companies like Google and Amazon have gotten to their current status not only through world-class products but through in-depth knowledge of their customers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVpbmZvcm1lci5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8wMy9ydW1vci10aGUtZWxkZXItc2Nyb2xscy1uZXRmbGl4LXNlcmllcy1pcy10aGUtbGF0ZXN0LXR2LWFkYXB0YXRpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rumor: The Elder Scrolls Netflix Series Is The Latest TV Adaptation,"While The Witcher wasn't a game adaptation (it was based on the novels that inspired the games) Netflix knocked bringing Geralt's life to fans in a whole new way out of the park. With several other gaming adaptations in the works it looks like a new TV series based on The Elder Scrolls is also coming down the pipeline at least according to the most recent rumors.

Industry insider Daniel Richtman reported that Netflix is currently pursuing adapting Bethesda's Elder Scrolls universe alongside the already-confirmed plans to bring the world of Fallout 4 into a series format over on Amazon. Neither Netflix nor Bethesda has confirmed these rumors nor has an Elder Scrolls TV series been marketed in any way at this time. That being said the TV streaming company has been transparent about looking to explore gaming worlds more closely which would lend to the beloved franchise of Elder Scrolls being a no-brainer.

While I can't confirm Elder Scrolls series news I can confirm that there are five more gaming adaptations in the works over at Netflix that have yet to be officially confirmed. Earlier this year I spoke with a representative of the company who confided that there are more projects in the works including one that I would ""really really like."" With five yet to be revealed (and this number could easily change some series ideas never make pilot) an Elder Scrolls adaptation makes perfect sense for those gaming-aligned goals for the streaming giant.

With The Elder Scrolls VI on the distant horizon and Fallout 76 finally getting its chance to shine through a complete overhaul of that online universe an adaptation of both franchises would invigorate those already-active communities while offering an appealing way to dive right in for newcomers.

If you could design your own Elder Scrolls TV series what storyline would you craft? Any favorite characters in particular that you would like to see front and center? Do you want to see an exact game adaptation or simply something within that universe? Sound off with your thoughts in the comment section below and tell us what you think!

This represents hundreds of hours of content potentially due to leave but all is potentially not lost as we’ll explore below.

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of the licensing rights let’s first take stock of the titles that are currently showing removal dates (it’s not every Power Rangers title as of the time of publishing).

List of Power Rangers Titles Leaving Netflix on February 1st 2021

This list covers Netflix USA and the UK. Other regions may vary but this seems like it’s the global rights coming up for removal.

Mighty Morphon Alien Rangers (1996 – 10 episodes)

Power Rangers Zeo (1996 – 50 episodes)

Beetle Borgs (1997 – 88 episodes)

Power Rangers Turbo (1997 – 45 episodes)

Power Rangers In Space (1998 – 43 episodes)

Power Rangers Lost Galaxy (1999 – 45 episodes)

Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue (2000 – 40 episodes)

Power Rangers Time Force (2001 – 40 episodes)

Power Rangers Wild Force (2002 – 40 episodes)

Power Rangers Ninja Storm (2003 – 38 episodes)

Power Ranger Dino Thunder (2004 – 38 episodes)

Power Rangers S.P.D. (2005 – 38 episodes)

Power Rangers Mystic Force (2006 – 32 episodes)

Power Rangers Operation Overdrive (2007 – 32 episodes)

Power Rangers Jungle Fury (2008 – 32 episodes)

Power Rangers RPM (2009 – 32 episodes)

Power Rangers Samurai (2011 – 20 episodes)

Power Rangers Super Samurai (2012 – 20 episodes)

Power Rangers Megaforce (2013 – 20 episodes)

Power Rangers Super Megaforce (2014 – 20 episodes)

Power Rangers Dino Charge (2015 – 22 episodes)

Power Rangers Dino Super Charge (2016 – 22 episodes)

That means by our count 722 episodes of Power Rangers are set to leave Netflix. With each episode being around 21 minutes that makes the total hours of content leaving to be around 10 and a half days.

Although it may be a bit of a task the above makes a perfect watch order or if you want a bit more background check out our beginners guide to Power Rangers on Netflix.

Netflix customer service has also confirmed the removal dates.

Hi Christopher. Thanks for reaching out. Indeed it is true that the majority of the Power Rangers series will be leaving Netflix UK on February 2nd sadly. This is because our license to show them is set to expire. ^PW — Netflix CS (@Netflixhelps) January 5 2021

Power Rangers Titles Not Currently Being Removed From Netflix

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (4 seasons)

Power Rangers Ninja Steel

Power Rangers Super Megaforce Legendary Battle Extended Edition

Power Rangers Samurai Christmas Together Friends Forever (2011)

Power Rangers Samurai Clash of the Red Rangers (2011)

Power Rangers Super Samurai Trickster Treat (2012)

Power Rangers Super Samurai Stuck on Christmas (2012)

Power Rangers Beast Morphers the most recent in the franchise has been getting regular updates on Netflix. Season 1 hit Netflix in October 2019 and season 2 followed in October 2020.

So what’s happening here? Officially Netflix did not include the Power Rangers library in its leaving soon list for the end of January (which includes February 1st removals) and the dates only began appearing as of January 2nd. No announcement has come from Hasbro Saban Entertainment or Netflix on the removals although we have reached out.

While the licensing rights for Power Rangers are pretty muddy we believe that Hasbro (who acquired Saban Entertainment in 2018) is who distributes the show despite the fact that Fox ABC and Nickelodeon have all aired the series in the past.

As of right now no new streaming home has been announced for Power Rangers but we’ll keep this post updated over time as and when we learn of new information. Some have speculated that Paramount+ could be the recipient but frankly it’s anyone’s guess right now.

It’s also worth noting the next Power Rangers series Dino Fury has Netflix listed as one of the distributors although Entertainment One is believed to be distributing it.

Cowboys star’s incredible turnaround after routine surgery took horror turn

Paulo had told The Daily Telegraph: “I am two weeks into a seven-week fight camp and I am hoping to continue the boxing training full-time.

“I have been training six days a week and I am hoping I will be able to continue instead of returning to the Eels pre-season. I haven’t heard back yet but I am hoping he (Brad) will be okay with it. I think he knows that the preparation I am doing for this fight will have me coming back at my best for the season.”

But the Eels responded with a public statement on Twitter writing: “The Eels and Junior Paulo have always maintained that his first priority is to be ready for our trial against the Panthers in February.

“All of his training is being monitored and overseen by the Eels high performance department to make sure his [sic] ready for the 2021 season.

“Junior will be returning to pre-season training in January as agreed.”

Paulo had claimed that boxing training would have him fitter than ever for the new NRL season.

“I am training harder than ever and it will be the best preparation I can have for the 2021 season” he said.

“The fittest I have ever been is before my fight in 2016 and I respond well to the different style training. I think Brad knows that this type of training will have me at my best for the start of the season.”

It will be just the 27-year-old’s second fight – the first was a loss to Paul Gallen in 2016 – but Paulo has signalled his intent to become a full-time boxer once his NRL career concludes.

“I have given it a bit of thought and I would like to take it up full time one day. League is all I have ever known and boxing is something I definitely want to pursue once I finish football.”

In what would be another juicy all-NRL clash Paulo also said he’d like to face off with Maroons star Jai Arrow in the ring.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC9jcmlja2V0L2F1c3NpZS1jcmlja2V0LXN0YXItc3RldmUtc21pdGhzLXRyaXAtdG8tY2hyaXMtaGVtc3dvcnRocy1ob3VzZS1vZi1wYWluL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvYzgyNmFjNTdlMTNiZmZlMzY0MzRmY2Y3YjU1YzAyYjXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cricket news: Steve Smith with Chris Hemsworth trainer ahead of Australia vs India Test series SCG | news.com.au ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/aussie-cricket-star-steve-smiths-trip-to-chris-hemsworths-house-of-pain/news-story/c826ac57e13bffe36434fcf7b55c02b5 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC9jcmlja2V0L2F1c3NpZS1jcmlja2V0LXN0YXItc3RldmUtc21pdGhzLXRyaXAtdG8tY2hyaXMtaGVtc3dvcnRocy1ob3VzZS1vZi1wYWluL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvYzgyNmFjNTdlMTNiZmZlMzY0MzRmY2Y3YjU1YzAyYjXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

A lot can change in a decade. For example ten years ago it cost between $140 to $150 per megawatt-hour (MWh) for solar energy and that's with the benefit of investment tax credits. However by 2020 that cost was down to $25 to $35 per MWh making solar cheaper than fossil fuels. That downward trend in solar energy costs should continue over the next decade as it's on track to be the lowest cost form of bulk energy even after adding battery storage.

Solar energy capacity additions are also on track to accelerate over the coming years. The industry expects to install an average of 10 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity per year through 2022 which should rise to an average of 18 to 20 GW annually in the 2023 to 2030 timeframe.

This appears as if it will be a golden decade for solar energy. Three stocks poised to benefit from this mega-trend are Brookfield Renewable (BEP 4.54%) (BEPC 4.96%) First Solar (FSLR 6.12%) and NextEra Energy (NEE 1.87%). They're great stocks to buy and hold until at least 2030.

A solar-powered growth plan

Brookfield Renewable is currently one of the global leaders in hydroelectric power. However it sees the brightest future in solar thanks to the dramatic decline in costs which has significantly improved the economics of developing new solar energy projects. Brookfield wrote in a recent shareholder letter: ""We believe it is possible that in ten years from now the majority of the production capacity of Brookfield Renewable will be solar capacity. It is not that we do not believe in wind or hydro but the growth in solar and the ability for us to develop and earn strong risk-adjusted returns should enable us to grow our solar operations at a far greater pace.""

The company spent much of the past couple of years bulking up its solar energy platform. It bought the rest of TerraForm Power it didn't own acquired a 50% stake in solar energy project developer X-Elio purchased several solar energy development projects in Brazil and most recently agreed to acquire Exelon's solar energy business. As a result Brookfield now a pipeline of more than 10 GW of solar energy projects in development. To put that into perspective Brookfield's current operating renewable energy portfolio is 19.4 GW. Those solar energy development projects are a key source of power driving the company's forecast that it can grow its cash flow at a double-digit annual pace through at least 2025.

A bright future lies ahead

First Solar is a leading developer of thin-film solar panels which are ideal for utility-scale projects. The company currently has a backlog of contracts totaling 12.2 GW of system sales and 8.3 GW of additional mid-to-late stage opportunities in the pipeline. For perspective the company's current manufacturing capacity is 5.5 GW meaning it has years of future sales lined up.

Meanwhile First Solar has one of the best balance sheets in the sector boasting a $1.4 billion net cash position at the end of the third quarter. It has unparalleled financial flexibility to continue expanding its manufacturing capacity to meet accelerating demand while investing in developing even better panels. That should enable it to stay one step ahead of its rivals and capture a significant share of the solar panel market in the coming decade.

This renewable energy behemoth is only going to get bigger

NextEra Energy is already the global leader in producing power from the wind and sun. However it currently has 15 GW of renewable projects in its backlog which is larger than its existing portfolio. A significant portion of those new additions are solar energy projects due to the falling costs of panels and energy storage.

That extensive backlog leads NextEra Energy to believe it can grow its earnings per year at a 6% to 8% annual pace through at least 2023. Meanwhile given its expertise and financial strength it should be able to continue capturing opportunities to grow at an above-average rate over the next decade. That could give it the power to continue outperforming the market. That has been the case over the past decade as NextEra has generated a more than 500% total return more than double that of the S&P 500.

Well-positioned for the solar energy mega-trend

Solar energy is starting to shine. It's on track to become the lowest cost form of near-firm bulk power thanks to the dramatic decline in costs for panels and battery storage. Companies focused on the industry appear poised to grow at a brisk pace over the coming decade led by Brookfield Renewable First Solar and NextEra Energy. That makes them great stocks to buy and hold through at least 2030.",,,,,,,,,

Model: Air Force 1 Air Raid Blazer Mid and Kyrie 7 “Rayguns”

Release Date: January 15

Price: Ranging from $110 to $145

Buy: Nike

Editor’s Notes: Nike’s fictional basketball team the Roswell Rayguns are the subject of a four-sneaker pack that is set to be released on January 15 via Nike SNKRS. The pack comprises a similarly color-blocked Air Force 1 Air Raid Blazer Mid and Kyrie 7.

The Roswell Rayguns were a fictional team that was the focus of a Nike ad campaign during the 2002 NBA Playoffs. The team shared the same color scheme as the sneakers above which was originally used on a pair of Nike SB Dunks in 2005. Sandy Bodecker the veteran Nike employee and godfather of Nike SB who passed away last year was a big fan of the Rayguns opting to bring the colorway to Nike SB’s premier skate shoe.

This year saw the Rayguns colorway come back on two pairs of tie-dyed Nike Dunk Lows. This pack of four sneakers features the same ’70s flair with a throwback color palette embroidered accents and — as Nike puts it — “other hip details.”

Lord Coe said he was “pretty calm” about the game-changing spikes and did not want to “stifle innovation” despite Joshua Cheptegei and Letesenbet Gidey breaking the men’s 10000m and the women’s 5000m records within an hour of each other in October. Both were wearing Nike ZoomX Dragonfly spikes billed as the “fastest shoes ever”.

With Mo Farah and Sifan Hassan also breaking the men’s and women’s one-hour records wearing new Nike shoes in Brussels in September there have been suggestions that the company could enjoy a similar dominance on the track as it did in the marathon between 2016 and 2019 with other brands potentially taking years to catch up.

However Coe said he was confident that history would not repeat itself. “I’m not sitting in fear of that” he added stressing that it was a good thing for shoe manufacturers to try to outdo each other.

“I remember a period in the mid-2000s where Adidas were the kings of the podium particularly in distance” he said. “So these things come in cycles. And there is a built-in dynamic where shoe companies mercifully are still investing a lot of money into the research and development of shoes. And I’m pleased they’re doing that.”

Last year World Athletics introduced new rules for track spikes limiting the use of plates and restricting the sole to be no thicker 30mm. However Coe said the organisation also had a system that could “permanently review these spikes” if they were proved to be unfair. Coe also denied that the succession of world records on the road in recent years – including most recently four men running inside the half-marathon best in November – was undermining the sport.

“I don’t think we’ve reached that point where world records are being handed out like confetti” he insisted. “And if I go back to the 1930s I still marvel at Rudolf Harbig who ran 1:46 and bits for 800m on a cinder track. And I still marvel at Peter Snell who ran world records and some significantly sub-1:45s on grass tracks. Meanwhile Derek Clayton ran a world marathon record [2:09:36] in shoes that you wouldn’t have gone for a stroll with in your local park.

“At the moment I’m pretty calm about this. And the balance of judgment here is always – and I guess this is a personal instinct of mine as well – that we shouldn’t be in the business of trying to suffocate innovation.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL25pa2UtYWlyLW1vcmUtdXB0ZW1wby1kaDQ5NjgtMTAwLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Air More Uptempo Sunset DH4968-100 Release Date - SBD,"Perfect for the Spring 2021 season Nike Sportswear will be releasing a “Sunset” colorway of the Air More Uptempo for the warmer months.

Already more than a million people (mostly over-80s) have had a first dose of the Pfizer jab – with some receiving their second. With the Oxford vaccine being rolled out next week it’s expected that at least a million jabs a week will be done this month with the inoculation programme hitting full throttle in February at double that rate. The great hope is that in mid-March we will reach the 15 million jabs target the point when it has been predicted that Britain can escape the crippling cycle of restrictions. So tomorrow’s roll- out of the ‘game-changing’ Oxford jab sets us on a happy optimistic path.

December 8: V-Day. Margaret Keenan 90 is the first person in the world to be given a post-trial Pfizer vaccination. It is injected into her left arm just after 6.30am by a matron at University Hospital Coventry. The Government says it has ordered 40 million doses – enough to vaccinate 20 million people.

December 9: One million-plus extra doses of the Pfizer jab to be in Britain within days - a total of four million before Christmas.

December 10: Veteran rocker Marty Wilde 81 is the first celebrity to get a jab at Lister Hospital Stevenage Hertfordshire after calling the NHS.

December 13: Prof Sarah Gilbert says her Oxford team’s chances of rolling out its vaccine by the year end are ‘pretty high’.

December 14: West Midlands couple Maureen and Gerry Hughes are the first to receive the vaccine in a local surgery as 100 GP clinics begin programme of inoculations.

December 15: 100000 jabs now done. Teams will work on Christmas Day as 100000 more jabs have already been booked with GPs and in hospitals.

December 18: Reported that the Oxford vaccine is expected to be approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency just days after Christmas.

December 20: 500000. The number of people in the UK that Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he believes have now had a jab.

December 23: Chelsea Pensioners get the vaccine with D-Day veteran Bob Sullivan 98 saying: ‘It’s the best early Christmas gift and gives us a spring in our step.’

December 25: 800000. Boris Johnson reveals that almost this number in the UK have been vaccinated (up from the total of 616933 five days before when 521594 English had been jabbed 56676 Scots 22595 Welsh and 16068 in N Ireland).

December 26: Widely reported that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is ready to green-light the Oxford vaccine.

December 27: ‘15m JABS TO FREEDOM’ says Mail on Sunday headline. 944539 jabs done so far: 786000 in England 92188 in Scotland 35335 in Wales and 31016 in N Ireland.

December 29: Margaret Keenan (the first person in the UK to get the jab) has her second ‘booster’ dose.

December 30: Milestone announcement as 0xford vaccine is approved with first jabs to be given on January 4. The 100 million doses ordered will cover the whole nation when added to the supplies available of the earlier Pfizer vaccine.

December 31: Welsh told they’ll get 22000 more doses within days. Already 35335 people in the Principality have had jabs.

January 1: Oxford team says two million of its doses are due to supplied by the middle of the month.

Boris Johnson inspects the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine in Wrexham Wales

January 31 projection: 6 million – the number anticipated to have been inoculated including one million vaccinated to date the 2.5m remaining over-80s and care home residents plus the remaining 2.5m frontline health and social care workers.

February 28 projection: 14 million people in total expected to have got the jab (assuming a rate of 2m vaccinations a week). This should include everyone aged over 70 and most of the 3.4m aged 65-69.

Mid-March projection: 15 million people in UK in total expected to have had first dose – and ought to include all aged over 65 and younger people with serious health conditions.

April 30 projection: 30 million predicted across Britain to have had vaccine - including nine million people aged 50 to 59. Second-round vaccinations continue.

Who is getting it first?

The nine-point priority list from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation is central to Phase One:

1. Residents in care homes for older adults (estimated total 425000 people) and their carers (up to 1.5 million)

2. All aged 80 and over (3.3million) and frontline health and social care workers (1.5million)

3. Everyone aged 75 and over (2.2million)

4. All aged 70 and over (3.3million) and those considered to be clinically extremely vulnerable

5. All people aged 65 and over (3.4million)

6. All individuals aged 16 to 64 with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality

7. Everyone aged 60 and over (3.7million)

8. Anybody aged 55 years and over (4.3million)

9. All aged 50 years and over (4.7million)

Why is this so vital?

Britain’s 15 million oldest account for less than a quarter of the 66 million population. But vaccinating them has a disproportionately positive effect on Covid-related hospitalisations and deaths as they are by far the most vulnerable. In Israel giving the jab to all over-70s was hoped to cut Covid-related mortality by 75 per cent – despite them being only 7.5 per cent of the population.

Where is the Oxford vaccine made?

In two English factories - at the ‘OxBox’ Biomedica centre in Oxford and another in Keele Staffordshire. The liquid is bottled by an Indian firm Wockhardt in Wrexham North Wales with 0.5ml doses put in glass phials in a process called ‘fill and finish’. The plant can produce at least 150000 doses a day. Initially extra supplies of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine are coming from Leiden in The Netherlands and from Germany. The Pfizer vaccine is imported from Puurs in Belgium.

GP clinics – and even CHURCH HALL

More than 800 GP clinics across England – and scores more in Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland – will be vaccinating by the end of the week. Pharmacies will also join the campaign while special neighbourhood vaccination clinics are being set up in church halls. This localised approach is being enabled by the Oxford vaccine which doesn’t need specialised freezers and can be stored in normal fridges instead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL3Nwb3J0L2NyaWNrZXQvYXJ0aWNsZS9wZXJmZWN0aW9uLWFsbC10b28tZmxlZXRpbmctZm9yLWJlYXRlbi1qYW1lcy13YWRlLTM2eGhtY3pzdtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Perfection all too fleeting for beaten James Wade,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://www.thetimes.co.uk/sport/cricket/article/perfection-all-too-fleeting-for-beaten-james-wade-36xhmczsv on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL3Nwb3J0L2NyaWNrZXQvYXJ0aWNsZS9wZXJmZWN0aW9uLWFsbC10b28tZmxlZXRpbmctZm9yLWJlYXRlbi1qYW1lcy13YWRlLTM2eGhtY3pzdtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cnVzdC5jb20vc2hheWktc3BvdHMtd2hlcmUtc3RyYW5nZXJzLWJvbmQtb3Zlci1zaXp6bGluZy10ZWEtbm9vZGxlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shayi spots: Where strangers bond over sizzling tea noodles,"Tea selling stands popularly known as ‘mai shayi’ in local parlance are more than just tea hubs in northern Nigeria but a sort of parliament…

Tea selling stands popularly known as ‘mai shayi’ in local parlance are more than just tea hubs in northern Nigeria but a sort of parliament where men converge to discuss a variety of issues ranging from current affairs to politics and security in between sips of tea Daily Trust reports.

In most parts of northern Nigeria people patronize mai shayi spots mostly for their breakfast and dinner.

Tea spots could easily be found in strategic locations where residents could be served tea bread fried eggs and noodles.

But besides serving as fast food spots mai shayi joints in Northern Nigeria have become melting pots for people of different backgrounds to connect and discuss wide ranging issues.

Kaduna: It’s avenue to discuss politics national issues

In the Mogadishu area of Kaduna Tanja who makes tea and noodles is known to attract residents who squeeze themselves into his tiny shack to get refreshed mostly in the mornings and evenings.

Tanja who joined the business a little over two years ago said: “I feel happy when I see people converge here even though things are hard now because of coronavirus. We don’t make as much sales now.”

He said discussions at the tea shack range from current affairs to security issues and matters concerning COVID-19.

“Issues of poverty in the country are equally discussed and sometimes people come here to vent their problems which could be domestic issues” he said.

Adamu Hassan who frequents Tanja’s shayi shack says there are times one gets to drink tea on credit or get someone to buy him tea in the course of discussions.

“Sometime we make friends here based on the nature of discussion; we could meet as strangers but the nature of discussion could determine whether you will leave the tea shack as friends or not” he said.

On his part Salis Mohammed who also frequents a tea shack at Kurmin Mashi said the people who usually patronize mai shayi are usually very current on international happenings and national issues.

“You may take them for granted because they are members of the lower class in society but these are people who are always on their radio sets; they listen to BBC in the mornings as well as VOA and other stations then they analyse the issues with others.

“The mai shayi himself usually has a radio set which he uses to attract people to come together and listen.

“In the midst of listening to news you could order tea or noodles and so you sip eat listen to news and have good conversation” he said.

Mohammed explained that regulars at the shayi spot have nicknames adding that: “someone could be called chairman because he is a regular or because he is outspoken and has some knowledge about issues being discussed.”

Bauchi: It helps youths keep off social vices

In Bauchi mai shayi spots have become one of the platforms that bind people together to discuss socioeconomic and political issues on regular basis.

At one of the popular joints UK Green Tea along Adamu Jumba road in Bauchi metropolis the owner of spot Ukasha Mohammed told Daily Trust that people that usually meet to drink tea drive a lot of joy and fulfillment from doing so.

“The major benefits they drive from the tea joint include the bond of unity and strong fellowship.

“They engaged in in-depth discussions on pressing national issues.

“The tea joint has become a meeting point for interactions among the youth which is now restricting them from engaging in social vices and drugs spots as well as reducing their urge of flirting with young ladies.”

He said his observation from the discussions that usually go on amongst those that patronize the tea spot is that they also brainstorm on issues that affect their personal and collective development.

“The first issue of discussion affects their individual development especially their social wellbeing academic economic and political issues but every one of them focuses on what he is directly involved.

He said one exceptional thing about the shayi joints is the fact that people who just meet for the first time could become intimate friends in no time after their discussions at the joint.

“They become like a single family and if something happens to a member of a group they would meet to assist and help the person.

“In my tea shop I have three different groups of majalisa (assembly) who setup their meetings here and become a team of friends in my joint.

“When a member has an occasion like marriage or naming ceremony members of the group would contribute money to sponsor the event. If a member wants to do a business they would assist him with capital” he said.

He said some of them who work in public or private sectors sometimes secure job opportunities for other members of the group.

He however lamented some challenges and problems facing the shayi joints including unnecessary arguments especially when it has to do with football matches and politics.

“Some people visit the tea spots with ulterior motives either to spy on individuals or track down persons to rob but we are working with security agents to address the problems.

“Another challenge has to do with closing time; we usually close between 12 midnight and 1am but some of the customers especially members of a group would insist on staying beyond our closing time.

“In the same vein some heavyweight politicians use to come to the joint after 1am due to their privacy and other security concerns and we cannot ignore their services” he said.

A resident of Bauchi metropolis Alhaji Manasa Muhammed said that he is not a member of any of the groups at shayi joints but derive a lot of joy from the tea spot.

“For many years I have developed the habit of visiting the mai shayi spot to get rid of personal problems and stress because I get relief when I listen to strange or jovial stories from tea spots.

“Although some of the stories are not factual some are even fabricated but there are true life stories too.

“I have continued to patronize the tea spot because it’s a platform for peaceful debate on national issues.”

Another resident Garba Umar told Daily Trust that the tea spots serve as a unifying factor that brings people from diverse background together.

“I used to visit mai shayi joints both in the morning for breakfast and evening for my dinner for many years before I married.

“But despite having a family I still attend the tea spot in the evening to discuss with friends and know what’s happening in town.

“If not because of the insecurity in the country today we used to stay at tea joints until dawn” he said.

Borno: It fosters friendship sense of belonging

A tea vendor in Low Cost Bolori Maiduguri Simon Caleb said the joint promotes unity friendship and a sense of belonging among residents and visitors.

He said people especially youths usually frequent tea shops to drink tea with someone or eat cooked noodles and fried eggs.

“A lot of people have made new friends and learnt current affairs as well as listened to conversations about government and security issues” he said."
NOC,Northrop Grumman,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzZGF5LmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2VkaXRvcmlhbHMvYmV0aHBhZ2UtcGx1bWUtZ3J1bW1hbi1uYXZ5LWNsZWFudXAtcG9sbHV0aW9uLXdhdGVyLWxvbmctaXNsYW5kLWNhbHZlcnRvbi1wb2xsdXRpb24taTgxNDAz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A tale of two Long Island plumes,"It was dismaying enough to learn that a plume of groundwater contamination from an old Northrop Grumman-U.S. Navy testing facility in Calverton has spread farther than previously understood. But new revelations that Grumman knew at least 35 years ago that its hazardous waste could leak and form a toxic plume with a path straight to the Peconic River provokes real anger and a sense of foreboding:

Here we go again.

The echoes of Bethpage where a larger Grumman-Navy manufacturing facility was the source of a horrendous plume that’s been expanding for decades are unmistakable. In that debacle decades of denying downplaying stonewalling and deceit chronicled by Newsday allowed the plume to expand to its current size of 4.3 miles long and 2.1 miles wide and imperil local water supplies.

In Calverton it’s déjà vu. Newsday reporters discovered that a judge in a 2013 case found that Grumman knew in 1986 that its hazardous waste disposal sites could leak solvents and jet fuel into groundwater and referred to Grumman’s hear-no-evil see-no-evil response as an ""Ostrich defense."" Now the Navy which is handling cleanup at the site Grumman left in 1996 is refusing to test beyond a 1-mile radius despite flow calculations showing the contamination likely has spread beyond that to some of the 60 to 125 homes in the area with private wells. Already Navy testing at the property’s perimeter found high concentrations of possible carcinogenic chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Suffolk County testing of private wells found at least one with a concentration nearly 10 times the state limit.

The Navy’s recalcitrance is distressing given the recent Grumman-Navy agreement to execute and nearly fully fund a $406 million plan to contain and clean up the plume in Bethpage. The long-overdue deal reached after pressure from federal state and local officials overcame institutional intransigence is worth celebrating. The 30-year plan largely the same as one proposed by the state Department of Environmental Conservation will install a series of containment wells to extract contaminants within and along the edges of the plume. The DEC must make sure Grumman and the Navy follow through on their commitment especially if more containment wells are needed to stop the plume’s one-foot-a-day march toward the Great South Bay. Grumman’s pledge to pay $104 million in environmental damages was a significant concession from a company that has fought requests to compensate water suppliers for their cleanup costs.

But it’s also worth noting the cautionary-tale element here: Everyone is finally on the same page and working toward the same goal only after endless delaying made the plume much more difficult and costly to treat.

The Navy needs to take that lesson to heart. It should expand its testing in Calverton use the state’s tough limits on pollutants as its baseline start the cleanup and pay to connect private-well owners to public water. It took decades before anyone could expect that the threat in Bethpage would begin to diminish. Long Island can’t wait that long for the same result in Calverton.

The two companies announced the deal on Dec. 20.



Bethesda Md.-based Lockheed Martin said the acquisition will enhance its expertise in propulsion technology.



The company said propulsion systems manufactured by Aerojet Rocketdyne are already a part of the Lockheed Martin supply chain.



“Each of our business areas works with Aerojet Rocketdyne products and we believe that integrating their capabilities across our Lockheed Martin offerings will improve manufacturing processes create cost savings for our customers and drive efficiency on behalf of shareholders” Chief Executive James Taiclet said in a Dec. 21 call with investors.



Aerojet Rocketdyne Chief Executive Eileen Drake said the acquisition “represents a natural next phase” for the company and a chance to “accelerate” the two companies’ efforts in the defense and space exploration spheres.



What remains to be seen is whether federal regulators will approve the deal which would give Lockheed Martin control over production of propulsion systems used by competitors.



Taiclet downplayed the possibility of antitrust issues with the merger pointing out that regulators allowed a similar merger between Northrop Grumman Corp. and rocket systems manufacturer Orbital ATK in 2018.



“Our overall expectation is that may be the same lens through which this transaction is viewed” Taiclet said.



Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. analyst Ken Herbert called the proposed merger “highly strategic” for Lockheed Martin in a note to investors following the announcement.



Herbert said the acquisition is an attempt by Lockheed Martin “to bolster its industrial supplier base” in light of the fact that Aerojet Rocketdyne “is currently one of Lockheed’s most crucial suppliers.”



Aerojet Rocketdyne formed through the 2013 merger of veteran aerospace firms Aerojet and Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (the latter a successor firm to Canoga Park-based Rocketdyne).



Both Rocketdyne and Aerojet were once among the nation’s largest Cold War-era rocket manufacturers and both firms worked on rocket engines and launch vehicles used by NASA for its lunar landing and space shuttle programs.



Business declined across the aerospace sector in the decades leading up to the merger of the two companies and Rocketdyne’s Canoga Park plant shut down in 2013.



Aerojet Rocketdyne’s current headquarters is located less than 2 miles from Lockheed Martin’s El Segundo office close to the Los Angeles Air Force Base. Lockheed Martin which formed in 1995 with the merger of Lockheed and Martin Marietta also has close ties to the Los Angeles area.



For most of the 20th century Lockheed based its operations in Burbank though its manufacturing facility there closed in the early 1990s.



Under terms of the acquisition deal Lockheed Martin will pay $56 per share which the company says will be reduced to $51 per share following payment of a special dividend to Aerojet Rocketdyne shareholders. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8wMy93b3JsZC9zcGFjZS1taXNzaW9ucy0yMDIxLXNjbi10cm5kL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUVodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzAxLzAzL3dvcmxkL3NwYWNlLW1pc3Npb25zLTIwMjEtc2NuLXRybmQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 missions prepare to explore Mars and other space news to expect in 2021,"CNN —

It’s time to go deeper into space.

While 2020 may have derailed and delayed some scientific plans due to the pandemic 2021 still promises to be a year of science “the likes of which we’ve rarely seen” according to Thomas Zurbuchen associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.

Multiple missions will explore Mars new telescopes will begin observations and plans are underway to return humans to the moon by 2024.

The Parker Solar Probe will make its next close approach of the sun in January. The OSIRIS-REx mission will begin its two-year return journey to Earth after successfully collecting a sample of the near-Earth asteroid Bennu. The ongoing NASA Juno mission continues to rewrite what we know about Jupiter and its moons. And scientists will explore and study samples returned from the asteroid Ryugu by Japan’s Hayabusa2 mission.

While the pandemic will likely delay the launch and progress of some missions others remain on track especially those already in space. Here’s what else we can expect in 2021.

Exploring Mars in new ways

It’s true that 2020 was the year of multiple missions launching to Mars – China’s Tianwen-1 the United Arab Emirates’ Hope Probe and NASA’s Perseverance rover – and 2021 will likely be the year of new discoveries on Mars.

The three missions took advantage of an alignment between Mars and Earth that occurs every 26 months allowing for quicker and more efficient trips when the two planets are on the same side of the sun.

All three should arrive at Mars in February.

The Hope Probe will go into orbit around Mars marking the first time the UAE has orbited the red planet. The probe will stay in orbit for a Martian year – equivalent to 687 days on Earth – to gather data about Mars’ atmosphere.

Tianwen-1 whose name means “Quest for Heavenly Truth” is China’s first mission to Mars. The probe will orbit the planet before landing a rover on the surface with the hope that it can gather important information about the Martian soil geological structure environment atmosphere and signs of water.

Tianwen-1 includes an orbiter deployable camera lander and a rover. Once the lander touches down on Mars it will extend a ramp that allows the rover to roll down to the surface. The orbiter can be used to relay signals from the rover to Earth and the rover can send messages to Earth on its own.

Perseverance will land on Mars on February 18. The rover is equipped with multiple cameras including video as well as microphones that will hear and record the landing live. NASA expects to have the sound images and video back on Earth within a few weeks of the landing.

Tucked up beneath the rover is Ingenuity the first helicopter to fly – if it succeeds – on another planet.

Once the rover has landed Perseverance’s two-year mission will begin.

The rover will also find a nice flat surface to drop the Ingenuity helicopter so it has a place to use as a helipad for its potential five test flights during a 30-day period. This will occur within the first 50 to 90 sols or Martian days of the mission.

Once Ingenuity is settled on the surface Perseverance will drive to a safe spot at a distance and use its cameras to watch and record Ingenuity’s flight.

After those flights Perseverance will begin searching for evidence of ancient life study Mars’ climate and geology and collect samples that will eventually be returned to Earth via planned future missions.

Exploring exoplanets

The much-anticipated James Webb Space Telescope slated for launch in October will be NASA’s next great space observatory.

However the telescope’s launch has been delayed and pushed several times over the years and it could face more delays due to the pandemic.

The new target launch date is October 31 2021. The telescope will launch from French Guiana. Previously scheduled to launch in March 2021 it was delayed by the pandemic and technical challenges according to the agency.

The telescope will answer questions about our solar system study exoplanets in new ways and peer deeper into the universe than we’ve ever been able to before.

It comes equipped with a mirror that can extend 21 feet and 4 inches – a massive length that will allow the mirror to collect more light from the objects it observes once the telescope is in space. The more light the mirror can collect the more details the telescope can observe.

It’s the largest mirror NASA has ever built the agency said but its size created a unique problem. The mirror was so large that it couldn’t fit inside a rocket. So they designed the telescope as a series of moving parts that can fold origami-style and fit inside a 16-foot space for launch.

“Webb is designed to build upon the incredible legacies of the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes by observing the infrared universe and exploring every phase of cosmic history” said Eric Smith NASA Webb’s program scientist at the agency’s headquarters in a statement.

“The observatory will detect light from the first generation of galaxies that formed in the early universe after the big bang and study the atmospheres of nearby exoplanets for possible signs of habitability.”

Vera Rubin’s ‘first light’

When the Vera C. Rubin Observatory begins observations in 2023 from its base in Chile its SUV-size camera will be able to capture complete panoramas of the southern sky every few nights. That requires a new type of camera never seen before.

It’s the world’s largest digital camera able to spot a golf ball from 15 miles away while capturing stunning 3200-megapixel images.

The “first light” of the observatory is expected in 2021. First light is the first astronomical image captured by a telescope after it is completed.

The observatory’s capabilities will enable it to spot faint objects 100 million times dimmer than what we can see with the naked eye. It’s designed to map the Milky Way explore dark energy and dark matter and survey the solar system.

During the 10-year survey the camera is expected to image 20 billion galaxies.

Rubin who died in 2016 once mentored fellow aspiring female astronomers and advocated for women in science. Considered to be one of the world’s most influential astronomers Rubin provided some of the first evidence that dark matter – which comprises much of the universe but can’t be seen – existed.

The camera is currently being assembled and the team estimated that the camera will be ready for testing by mid-2021 before it’s sent off to Chile to be installed.

Artemis: A new space generation

The NASA Artemis program which seeks to land the first woman and the next man on the moon in 2024 made great strides last year despite the pandemic. And 2021 will likely see more advances and milestones for the program.

The milestones achieved for the Artemis program thus far include the introduction of the Artemis Accords and signing by other nations; the completion of the core stage of the SLS rocket and Orion crew capsule that will carry Artemis astronauts to space; and progress on the Gateway lunar outpost that will help astronauts land on the moon.

The first team of 18 Artemis astronauts was also announced and it’s a diverse group that includes some new to NASA as well as veterans of spaceflight.

The astronauts will explore the moon’s south pole with a focus on conducting experimental science and learning more about the origin of water on the moon among other science goals.

While the first Artemis mission in November 2021 will be an uncrewed flight test Artemis II will be a crewed flyby of the moon in August 2023.

Those missions will pave the way for Artemis III – when astronauts return to the surface of the moon.

NASA’s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover or VIPER will create the first water resource maps of the moon for future human space exploration once it lands on the lunar surface in 2022.

An Artemis Base Camp could be established at the lunar south pole by the end of the decade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS8yMDIxLzAxLzAyL2xvY2toZWVkLWFlcm9uYXV0aWNzLWNoaWVmLW1pY2hlbGUtZXZhbnMtaGFzLWRpZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockheed aeronautics chief Michele Evans has died,"WASHINGTON — Michele Evans who led Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics business since 2018 died on Jan. 1 the company announced Saturday.

Evans took a leave of absence that began Dec. 1 “to address health issues unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic” according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing by the company. She previously took medical leave in September 2019 due to a cancer diagnosis according to Reuters.

Greg Ulmer who leads the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program has filled in as head of Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics unit in the interim.

“Throughout her career Michele led some of the most important programs that ensure the security of our nation and its allies and help make our world a safer place” Lockheed CEO Jim Taiclet said. “She embodied our company’s values in spirit and action every day — to do what’s right respect others and perform with excellence. Her example was an inspiration to those of us fortunate enough to have worked with her closely and her leadership in the aerospace and defense industry will have a lasting impact for years to come.”

Evans spent 34 years working at Lockheed and before her medical issues was seen as a top contender to replace Marillyn Hewson as the company’s chief executive.

Before becoming vice president of the Aeronautics division Evans held multiple executive positions in the company’s Rotary and Mission Systems business area serving as vice president and general manager of integrated warfare systems and sensors as well as vice president for C4ISR (command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance).

Earlier in her career she managed avionics programs for the C-130 and F-35 aircraft.

Cruise line executives staff and shipboard crew have been working to develop and implement new health and safety protocols that will be in place when sailings resume again. And while some of these measures may only be in place for the duration of the global health pandemic others are likely here to stay.

Here is what Royal Caribbean is doing to keep its passengers safe when sailings resume:

The Healthy Sail Panel

Over the summer Royal Caribbean Group together with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings created its Healthy Sail Panel. The resulting document outlines 74 different best practices for the safe resumption of cruise from temporary amendments to services and amenities as a result of COVID-19 to long-term solutions that are here to stay.

The Healthy Sail Panel forms the basis of not only Royal Caribbean and Norwegian brands but for the broader industry as a whole. Many lines have adapted the Healthy Sail Panel's recommendations as well as recommendations set forth by the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA).

Mandatory Pre-Boarding COVID-19 Testing

CLIA has mandated that all member lines including Royal Caribbean perform COVID-19 PCR testing before allowing passengers and crew onboard. CLIA's directive applies to all vessels with a capacity over 250 passengers.

Mask Wearing Throughout the Vessel

If you're outside your cabin expect to wear your mask at all times unless seated eating or drinking. Royal Caribbean has put its masking rule in place in order to prevent transmission of viruses in places where physical distancing cannot occur.

Physical Distancing Measures

Physical distancing will have to be practiced throughout the ship. On early December sailings aboard Quantum of the Seas in Singapore decals were applied to floors and select seating roped off to ensure that minimum distancing requirements were met.

Digital Check-in And Electronic Muster Drill

Royal Caribbean will increase its reliance on technology including its own app to facilitate contactless check-in procedures at the terminal.

Another innovation is the new ""E-Muster"" lifeboat drill that no longer requires the ship's company to assemble all at once.

Instead passengers will watch a safety briefing on their smart device or stateroom television then visit their dedicated muster station at their leisure (but before sailing) to check-in with staff on-hand there.

Contact Tracing Bracelets

Passengers will be provided with a wearable bracelet (similar to the technology Royal Caribbean introduced aboard its Quantum class ships several years ago) that will enable contact tracing throughout the ship should a case of COVID-19 or any other communicable disease occur.

Reduced Self-Serve Options

While Royal Caribbean is not getting rid of the buffet it will be doing away with all self-serve options -- at least for now.

That means passengers will place their orders with staff members in the casual Windjammer Buffet and foot will be served to them. The same goes for coffee tea and water -- drinks that were formerly available under self-serve options.

Reservations Will Be Key

Reservations for dining and select entertainment venues will now be standard in order to limit crowd control and ensure physical distancing requirements are met.

In many ways this could be an improvement over cruising in the past: no longer will people spend half an hour sitting in an empty theatre each evening in order to be assured a seat for the nightly stage production.

Reserving time slots for shows and select entertainment venues also eliminates queuing which has for many been one of the primary stressors of big-ship cruising.

Ventilation Will Be Improved

Onboard ventilation will be improved across the Royal Caribbean fleet to ensure fresh air circulation at all times. Air will no longer be recycled inside the vessel and will instead be changed out as often as possible. Air will also be double-filtered to keep out smaller particles (like coronavirus) and will be changed out between 15 to 20 times per hour in larger public venues and 12 times per hour in staterooms.

For comparison the average large grocery store or retail outlet cycles air out only three to four times per hour.

Upgraded Medical Facilities

Onboard medical facilities will be upgraded both in terms of staffing and amenities. Medical centers will have at least two doctors with training in acute and intensive medical care along with four registered nurses. Royal Caribbean will upgrade all medical equipment onboard including hospital-grade ventilators a cardiac monitor a central oxygen system nebulizers defibrillators and external pacemakers and EKGs.

Ships will also carry COVID-19 PCR test kits onboard.

An Ongoing Situation

These are just a few of the major changes Royal Caribbean has implemented for its safe and healthy return to service both for the assurance of its passengers and crew.

As the industry inches closer to a full restart of cruise operations it is entirely likely that more health and safety measures will be rolled out. Some lines like Cunard have even taken the step of prohibiting those with certain acute medical conditions from travelling -- at least for now.

The overriding message from Royal Caribbean as with all other cruise lines is this: When they return to service it will be in a safe comfortable and healthy environment for all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vQ3J1aXNlLVRyYXZlbC9DcnVpc2luZy1uZXQtemVyby1jb21taXRtZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruising's net zero commitment,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelweekly.com/Cruise-Travel/Cruising-net-zero-commitment on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vQ3J1aXNlLVRyYXZlbC9DcnVpc2luZy1uZXQtemVyby1jb21taXRtZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kZXV0c2NoZS1iYW5rLXBsYXktbGVhZGluZy1yb2xlLTAxMDA0ODQxMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deutsche Bank should play leading role in banking consolidation - CEO,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank is gaining in financial strength putting Germany's largest lender in a position to play a leading role in European banking consolidation CEO Christian Sewing was quoted on Sunday as saying.

""We continue to do better and therefore meet the criteria to sit at the table when it comes to a possible consolidation of the European banks - and not just as a junior partner"" Sewing told Welt am Sonntag in an interview.

Sewing who is pursuing a long-term drive to boost earnings power at Deutsche after years of underperformance has consistently said that his priority was to complete a turnaround by 2022.

Talks on an all-German banking merger with Commerzbank failed in 2019 and with a stock market value of just 18 billion euros ($21.9 billion) Deutsche would be an affordable target for a more richly valued potential acquirer.

Sewing played up the bank's strategic importance for Europe's largest economy and top exporting nation however and said his restructuring drive was bearing fruit.

""It would be a mistake to rely on imports of financial services"" said Sewing. ""Every quarter in which we are successful makes us stronger.""

Earnings and costs in its private and corporate business were absolutely on track he added and Deutsche's investment bank has outperformed expectations. ($1 = 0.8239 euros)

It looks like NVIDIA is still deciding on what to do next with its Ampere lineup and as such there are new rumors emerging from Kopite7kimi (via Videocardz) according to who NVIDIA is preparing two brand new SKUs which might possibly by the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER Reportedly Under Consideration Could These Feature 16 GB GDDR6(X) VRAM?

For starters the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER are not going to affect the upcoming card lineup which would include the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti & the GeForce RTX 3060. The GeForce RTX 3070 Ti could be a whole different story since we have heard about this SKU for a while now but nothing has been formulated aside from some rumored specifications. The RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti have also been canceled and relaunched with different specs a couple of times now.

The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is even going to be introduced earlier than the RTX 3070 Ti so the status of this particular SKU is not confirmed yet. At the same time one thing to note about the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3060 is how both of them feature much higher memory capacities than their predecessors. The RTX 3080 Ti replaces the RTX 2080 Ti with 9 GB higher VRAM (11 GB vs 20 GB) and the RTX 3060 replaces the RTX 2060 with twice the memory buffer (6 GB vs 12 GB). The same might just be the case with the SUPER series that NVIDIA has planned.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & RTX 3070 SUPER

We don't have any concrete specifications of these two chips but if we go back to earlier rumors then we can tell that NVIDIA had initially planned higher VRAM variants of both RTX 3080 & RTX 3070 graphics cards. The RTX 3080 was expected to feature 12-16 GB VRAM while the RTX 3070 also had been expected to feature similar VRAM amounts. However that plan was scrapped in favor of NVIDIA going literally bonkers with its RTX 3090 design and keeping the rest of the lineup capped to 10 GB VRAM due to limited availability of GDDR6(X) modules.

I know there are some new SKUs recently but I don't know their names yet maybe 3070 Super and 3080 Super. — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) December 31 2020

By the time the RTX 3080 Ti launches the memory supply will be far better. NVIDIA themselves have also confirmed that supply would get better by the end of the first quarter of 2021 so that is probably when NVIDIA can devise a better plan to re-release their GeForce RTX lineup in a SUPER fashion.

For this purpose the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER and GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER could be the first entrants in the lineup. Similar to the previous generation NVIDIA wouldn't want to touch the high-end models since they will be positioned right against the competition. It's the RTX 3080 and below lineups such as the RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti which would require a SUPER refresh to tackle AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and RX 6700 series.

GA102 and GA103S — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) December 31 2020

For that purpose alone NVIDIA could end up featuring 16 GB of GDDR6(X) memory on both the RTX 3080 SUPER (GDDR6X) & the GeForce 3070 SUPER (GDDR6). As for core configurations they might also change with the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER expected to utilize the GA103S GPU while the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER would retain its GA102 GPU.

However one critical thing to consider here would be the prices. Whether NVIDIA offers a price cut on existing variants and ends their production to make room for the new cards which is similar to what they did in the last generation or keep the existing cards and offer the SUPER variants with a slight premium that remains to be seen. Lastly don't expect the SUPER cards anytime soon as the green team has yet to be done with the original lineup. We can probably expect an announcement around Computex or during Summer which was also the case with the GeForce RTX 20 SUPER line.

NVIDIA is expected to launch two new high-end graphics cards sometime this year with the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and now the newly-rumored GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER graphics card.

But joining the new rumor of the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER is the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER but why? Well the RTX 3080 has 10GB of VRAM and the RTX 3070 has 8GB of VRAM. Both of their competitors in the Radeon RX 6800 XT and Radeon RX 6800 have 16GB of VRAM and I'm sure NVIDIA wants to something about that.

The new rumors are coming from kopite7kimi on Twitter who says that there are ""some new SKUs"" coming and they might be the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER and GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER graphics cards. We could expect the RTX 3080 SUPER to be a tweaked RTX 3080 with 16GB of VRAM -- while the higher-end RTX 3080 Ti would pack 20GB of VRAM.

As for the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER Kopite ponders if it'll feature a new GA103 GPU that hasn't been used yet -- both the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti and GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER could use this new GA103 -- slotting right between GA104 and GA102.

We'll know more as the weeks and months flip by.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzg4MTM4LWFtZC1wYXRlbnRzLWNoaXBsZXQtZ3B1LWRlc2lnbi11bmxpa2UtbnZpZGlhLWludGVsLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD patents a chiplet GPU design quite unlike Nvidia and Intel's,"Something to look forward to: AMD has published its first patent on chiplet GPU designs. In typical AMD fashion they're trying to not rock the boat. Chiplet GPUs are just beginning to emerge. Intel has been forthright about their development process and confirmed the employment of chiplets in their first-generation discrete GPUs. Nvidia while coy about specifics have published numerous research papers on the topic. AMD was the last holdout - which only adds to the intrigue.

Chiplets as the name suggests are smaller less complex chips that meant to work together into more powerful processors. They're arguably the inevitable future for all high-performance components and in some cases the successful present; AMD's use of chiplet CPU designs has been brilliant.

In the new patent dated December 31 AMD outlines a chiplet design fashioned to mimic a monolithic design as closely as possible. Their hypothetical model uses two chiplets connected by a high-speed inactive interposer called a crosslink.

A crosslink connection sits between the L2 cache and L3 cache on the memory hierarchy. Everything beneath it such as the cores and L1 cache and L2 cache are aware of their separation from the other chiplet. Everything above including the L3 cache and GDDR memory are shared between the chiplets.

This design is beneficial because it is conventional. AMD claims that compute units can access low-level cache on other chiplets almost as fast as they can access local low-level cache. Should that prove true software won't need updating.

The same cannot be said of Intel and Nvidia's designs. Intel intends on using two new technologies EMIB (embedded multi-die interconnect bridge) and Foveros. The latter is an active interposer that uses through-silicon-vias something AMD explicitly states they will not use. Intel's design lets the GPU house a system-accessible cache that powers a new memory fabric.

Nvidia has not disclosed everything but have indicated a few directions they might pursue. A research paper from 2017 describes a four-chiplet design and a NUMA (non-uniform memory access) aware and locality aware architecture. It also experiments with a new L1.5 cache which exclusively holds remote data accesses and is bypassed during local memory accesses.

AMD's approach might sound the least imaginative but it also sounds practical. And if history has proven anything it's that developer-friendliness is a huge advantage.

Below are additional diagrams from the patent.

Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view that descends from two chiplets to the circuit board. The two chiplets (106-1 and 106-2) are stacked vertically on the passive crosslink (118) and use dedicated conductor structures to access the crosslink's traces (206) and subsequently communicate with each other. Conductor structures not attached to the crosslink (204) connect to the circuit board for power and other signaling.

Figure 3 depicts the cache hierarchy. WGPs (work group processors) (302) which are collections of shader cores and GFXs (fixed function units) (304) which are dedicated processors for singular purposes connect directly to a channel's L1 cache (306). Each chiplet contains multiple L2 cache (308) banks that are individually addressable and also coherent within a single chiplet. Each chiplet also contains multiple L3 cache (310) cache banks that are coherent across the whole GPU.

The GDF (graphics data fabric) (314) connects the L1 cache banks to the L2 cache banks. The SDF (scalable data fabric) (316) combines the L2 cache banks and connects them to the crosslink (118). The crosslink connects to the SDFs on all the chiplets as well as the L3 cache banks on all the chiplets. The GDDR memory lanes (written as Memory PHY) (312) connect to L3 cache banks.

As an example if a WGP on one chiplet required data from a GDDR bank on another chiplet that data would be sent through to an L3 cache bank then over the crosslink to an SDF then to an L2 bank and finally through a GDF to an L1 bank.

Figure 4 is a bird's eye view of one chiplet. It shows more accurately the potential locations and scales of various components. The HBX Controller (404) manages the crosslink which the chiplet is connected to by HBX PHY (406) conductors. The small square in the bottom-left corner (408) is a potential additional connection to the crosslink to connect more chiplets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiygFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9QYXRlbnQtc2hvd3MtZnV0dXJlLUFNRC1SRE5BLWJhc2VkLUdQVXMtY291bGQtbGV2ZXJhZ2UtbXVsdGktY2hpcC1tb2R1bGVzLWEtbGEtSW50ZWwtWGUtSFAtQXJjdGljLVNvdW5kLWFuZC1OVklESUEtSG9wcGVyLWJ1dC1SRE5BLTMtd2lsbC1saWtlbHktYmUtbW9ub2xpdGhpYy41MTI4NDUuMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Patent shows future AMD RDNA-based GPUs could leverage multi-chip modules a la Intel Xe HP Arctic Sound and ...,"AMD could be offering multi-chip module (MCM) designs in GPUs in the near future. A patent filed in 2019 details how an MCM design can help lower costs and improve yields. Since most GPU-bound programs work best with monolithic cores AMD's patent describes how the MCM design can be made oblivious to the CPU thereby alleviating the need to rewrite code to take advantage of this design.

4 Reviews

After having successfully demonstrated the efficacy of a multi-chip module design (MCM) on the CPU side AMD may very well look forward to repeat the success on the GPU side of the equation as well. A patent titled ""GPU Chiplets using High Bandwidth Crosslinks"" filed in 2019 and now available on the Free Patents Online (FPO) website indicates that AMD does have some tricks up its sleeve to effectively transition from the conventional monolithic design.

The patent's abstract reads

A chiplet system includes a central processing unit (CPU) communicably coupled to a first GPU chiplet of a GPU chiplet array. The GPU chiplet array includes the first GPU chiplet communicably coupled to the CPU via a bus and a second GPU chiplet communicably coupled to the first GPU chiplet via a passive crosslink. The passive crosslink is a passive interposer die dedicated for inter-chiplet communications and partitions systems-on-a-chip (SoC) functionality into smaller functional chiplet groupings.""

In the patent application AMD notes that monolithic dies are becoming expensive to manufacture. It also notes that parallel workloads in GPUs are difficult to properly distribute across multiple chiplets and keep memory across them in sync. Adding to this onerous task is that most applications are written keeping a single GPU in mind. Therefore the challenge is to preserve the current programming model as much as possible while still offering a chiplet design to reduce manufacturing costs and improve yields.

To overcome these concerns AMD's patent envisages using the first GPU in the series of chiplets to directly couple to the CPU. The other GPU chiplets in the array would then be coupled to the primary GPU via a high-bandwidth passive crosslink (HBPC). The HBPC is essentially a passive interposer die dedicated for inter-chip communication across the SoC.

With regards to memory sync the patent notes that though each GPU chiplet would feature its own last-level cache (LLC) all such LLCs are coupled in a way that enables coherency across all GPU chiplets. Since only the primary GPU chiplet receives requests from the CPU the entire complex still appears monolithic to the CPU and consequently to the OS.

At the moment AMD already offers multi-GPU designs on a single board. Previously we have seen the AMD Radeon R9 295X2 and the Radeon Pro Duo. The newer Radeon Pro Vega II Duo is exclusive to the Apple Mac Pro and features two Radeon VIIs with 64 compute units (CUs) each connected by an Infinity Fabric link.

Back in 2018 AMD's SVP of Radeon Technologies Group (RTG) David Wang opined that unless a multi-GPU package is made invisible ISVs may show some reluctance. However he also expressed optimism that ""anything's possible"".

Now it is not clear when we would see such a design in flesh. Official CDNA and RDNA roadmaps only point to an ""Advanced Node"" for 2022 so it is likely that we may not see CDNA 2 or RDNA 3 sporting multi-chip module (MCM) designs.

That being said the competition is already showing similar trends with both Intel and NVIDIA looking to offer MCM parts with Xe HP Arctic Sound and Hopper respectively.

The listing was spotted by TUM_APISAK and shows the next-gen RTX 30 series mobility GPU running in the OpenCL test suite.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Mobility GPU To Feature GA104 GPU With 6144 Cores 16 GB Memory & 1540 MHz Clock in Max-P Variant On Par With An RTX 2080 Ti

Just a few days ago we got to see the benchmarks & specifications for the GeForce RTX 3070 GPU for laptops along with the first listings for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series mobility lineup along with some preliminary specifications. Also based on the clock speeds alone we can tell that this is the Max-P variant of the GeForce RTX 3080 instead of the Max-Q variant which offers conservative clock speeds to deliver higher efficiency and battery times.

So coming to the specifications the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Mobility will feature 48 SMs on the GA104 GPU SKU (presumably the GA104-775). This chip would feature a total of 6144 cores and a maximum clock speed of around 1540 MHz. The graphics card also features 16 GB VRAM which runs across a 256-bit wide bus interface but it remains to be seen if NVIDIA is utilizing 12 or 14 Gbps DRAM modules for its mobility lineup. In the case of 14 Gbps the GPU will be able to offer a maximum bandwidth of 448 GB/s.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Mobility GPU Lineup:

Preliminary specifications also seem to indicate that the Max-Q variant will feature a TGP between 80-90W while the faster Max-P variant will feature a TGP of 115-150W. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Mobility was tested on an ASUS ROG Zephyrus GX551QS next-generation laptop which comes with the AMD Ryzen 9 5900H CPU with 8 Zen 3 cores 16 threads a base clock of 3.30 GHz and a boost clock of up to 4.55 GHz. You can see benchmarks of the CPU in this previously reported article.

2 of 9

In terms of performance the GPU scored 139181 points in the OpenCL test. The score puts the GeForce RTX 3080 mobility on par with the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti & GeForce RTX 3070 Desktop variants. But at the same time it is slower than the desktop GeForce RTX 3080 desktop by 30% which should be expected since the variant does not only offer lower cores but also comes with much lower clocks even though it's a Max-P variant. The score also puts the GeForce RTX 3080 mobility around 25% faster than the GeForce RTX 3070 mobility results we saw before.

So essentially you will be getting RTX 2080 Ti levels of performance in a GPU which was pretty much not the case in the previous generation.

Nancy Lieberman had a house divided this week with a pair of Thunder-Magic games on Tuesday and Saturday.

Oklahoma City and Orlando are far from NBA rivals but things can get heated when your two dogs are named Thunder and Magic.

“They’re just the sweetest little guys” Lieberman said of her two Havanese. “That’s my team tonight. Thunder and Magic.”

Both dogs were bred in Oklahoma City and that’s where Lieberman has returned to in a sense. She lives in and works out of Dallas but Lieberman is back in the homes of Thunder fans as an analyst on the Thunder Live pregame and postgame shows. It’s the same role Lieberman held from 2012-15.

“When somebody says ‘Hey we’re happy you’re back’ that’s a good thing” Lieberman said. “It beats the alternative. I’m really proud to be a part of this group.”

Now in her second stint Lieberman has replaced former analyst Greg Buckner who was hired by the Cavaliers in November as an assistant coach. Lieberman works alongside host John Rhadigan on Thunder Live which airs on Fox Sports Oklahoma every game night.

Fox Sports recently approached the Thunder about bringing Lieberman back to the broadcast.

“Absolutely” said Dan Mahoney the Thunder’s vice president of broadcasting and corporate communications.

“If you can have a hall of famer be part of your TV broadcast you jump at that chance” Mahoney said. “She did a great job for us before. Obviously she knows the game she’s played the game she’s coached the game. She has a real feel for the players for the coaches and for the fans too.”

Lieberman left the Thunder broadcast in 2015 when she was hired by the Kings as an assistant coach. Lieberman elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1996 followed Spurs assistant Becky Hammon in becoming the second woman to join an NBA coaching staff.

Lieberman’s basketball career has been filled with historic milestones.

She was an Olympian in 1976 the first year a women’s basketball tournament was held as part of the games.

Lieberman played college basketball at Old Dominion from 1976-80. She led the Monarchs to back-to-back national championships in 1979 and 1980. Lieberman was named national player of the year in both championship seasons.

Mahoney was a high schooler in Richmond Virginia when Lieberman was a college star 100 miles southeast in Norfolk.

“She was one of our basketball heroes in Virginia” Mahoney said. “To now work with her at this level it’s a thrill.”

Lieberman went on to play professionally and in 1998 she was named head coach of the WNBA’s Detroit Shock. She ran a basketball camp in Detroit and one of her campers was Thunder center Al Horford.

In 2008 at the age of 50 Lieberman signed a seven-day contract to play with the Shock. She appeared in one game becoming the oldest player in league history.

Lieberman again made history in 2009 when she was named head coach of the D League (now G League) Texas Legends. She moved to the front office after one season as coach.

“The G League is no joke” Lieberman said. “I know this. It’s demanding and you learn exponentially. You learn what you do well. You learn what you have to do better. But it’s all about improvement — from players to coaches to front office to broadcasters.”

Lieberman returned to broadcasting after leaving the Kings staff in 2017. She’s been an analyst on the Pelicans’ studio shows and she’ll continue to work with the Pelicans on days when she doesn’t have Thunder duties. If there’s a conflict Lieberman will stick with the Thunder.

“I love the game and I feel like I know Oklahoma City” Lieberman said. “As long as I’m doing my homework and watching film and trying to make sure that I deliver the right amount of information that’s pleasing to Thunder fans and to the organization I don’t look at it as hard.

“Actually I look at it as a blessing. I have a lot of gratitude to be around this game.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2thbnNhcy1mb290YmFsbC1kYi1jb3Jpb25lLWhhcnJpcy1lbnRlcnMtdHJhbnNmZXItcG9ydGFsLTE1ODQ2MjI5Ni_SAWVodHRwczovLzI0N3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9rYW5zYXMtZm9vdGJhbGwtZGItY29yaW9uZS1oYXJyaXMtZW50ZXJzLXRyYW5zZmVyLXBvcnRhbC0xNTg0NjIyOTYvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kansas football DB Corione Harris enters transfer portal,"Kansas defensive back Corione Harris a former four-star prospect has decided to depart the Jayahwks' program. On Sunday a source told 247Sports Harris had appeared in the transfer portal.

Harris who started at cornerback with KU and then moved to safety had a tumultuous tenure with the Jayhawks that included multiple off-field incidents.

Harris was arrested in January of 2020 and according to the Kansas City Star charged with “unlawful use of weapon and delivery of controlled substance.” He was also arrested in 2019 for driving with a suspended license after he received a speeding ticket with a court date — and never appeared for that court date per the Kansas City Star.

For the second of those two incidents Harris was given a one-game suspension by KU coach Les Miles. Harris reportedly reached a plea agreement for five years supervised probation.

“Corione Harris has been reinstated to the football team with the expectation that he continues on a positive path” Miles said in a statement to Phog.net back before the 2020 season. “Corione has taken the appropriate steps in his personal life to work his way back on to our team. It has been made very clear to Corione what is required of him to remain a member of our program moving forward and he assured us of his full cooperation.”

Harris joined the Jayhawks in David Beaty's 2018 recruiting class. He was a Year 1 starter at cornerback. Harris appeared in all 12 games as a freshman making 44 tackles picking off one pass and forcing one fumble.

However when he returned from his suspension in 2020 the staff decided to try him elsewhere. (Harris played in six games with 11 tackles and one forced fumble in 2020.)

“I think safety becomes the easier place to enter” Miles said of Harris in September. “I think we are better at corner than when Corione left. So I think it's likely that he’ll start in there at safety and give us another coverage hand at that spot.”

At the time teammates felt he had handled the move well.

“[Harris] is just an athlete” said linebacker Denzel Feaster who is also in the transfer portal. “He can play a multitude of positions. He’s doing great at safety and if we needed him at [cornerback] I’m sure he’d do great there as well. Like I said he’s just a great overall athlete that can adjust to any position.”

“I feel like the transition was smooth for him” added defensive back Kyle Mayberry who is in the transfer portal too. “He’s a natural football player so it wasn’t much of a strange transition for him. He’s looked good.”

Kansas cornerback Elijah Jones also announced he was entering the transfer portal on Sunday and Phog.net confirmed his name had appeared in it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3RvbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8wMy9ub3J0aGVhc3Rlcm4tbWVuLWNvbXBsZXRlLXdlZWtlbmQtYmFza2V0YmFsbC1zd2VlcC1vZi1lbG9uLXRvLW9wZW4tY2FhLXNsYXRlL9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3RvbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8wMy9ub3J0aGVhc3Rlcm4tbWVuLWNvbXBsZXRlLXdlZWtlbmQtYmFza2V0YmFsbC1zd2VlcC1vZi1lbG9uLXRvLW9wZW4tY2FhLXNsYXRlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Northeastern men complete weekend basketball sweep of Elon to open CAA slate,"The Northeastern Huskies deliberately scheduled tough competition before conference play began in hopes of enhancing their chances in the CAA.

So far so good. NU completed a weekend sweep of Elon on Sunday at Solomon Court with a 66-58 victory in the opening CAA series for both schools. The Huskies prevailed 75-52 on Saturday and head into Thursday night’s encounter at Hofstra at 3-5 overall and 2-0 in the league.

The Huskies segued into their conference calendar with a tough but limited non-league dance card that included a home-and-home with UMass and road stops at Syracuse Old Dominion Georgia and West Virginia which was in the top 10.

“There are a lot of different philosophies in terms of nonconference scheduling and it’s always been our philosophy to go out and play against the very best that we can find” said NU coach Bill Coen.

“In each of those contests we were able establish our own identity and gain a little confidence at an individual level and a team level. Based on the strength of that schedule we are able to come in and be prepared for opening weekend.”

NU shot 44.6% and logged 33 rebounds and 10 assists. Forward Jason Strong and guard Tyson Walker led the way with 17 points apiece while Shaquille Walters and Jahmyl Telfort combined for 25.

The Huskies’ plan for the second half was to attack the rim on offense and disrupt Elon’s rotation with pressure defense and rebounding. Neither camp seized the initiative in the early going an NU went into the second media timeout leading 47-38.

Walker got NU trending with a pair of hard drives. Strong added a fadeaway in the paint to put NU up 51-38 with 10:11 remaining. NU then cooled off and Elon launched a 12-2 run. A 3-pointer by guard Kris Wooten cut NU’s lead to 53-50 with 4:16 to play.

“The second half kind of settled down into a slugfest but I thought our defense held ground for us when we struggled offensively” said Coen.

Walker responded with a 3-ball from the left of the key that set the Huskies into end-game mode. Elon refused to wilt and cut the lead to 62-58 with a pair from the line by guard Hunter McIntosh (17 points) with 56.9 seconds to play. Walker scored eight of NU’s final 13 points to close out the game.

“Coach called some good plays for us five on the court and Tyson made some big shots” said Strong.

The Huskies opened the game with a 19-4 run an impressive offensive explosion fueled by perimeter defense and rebounding in the home end. Forward Coleman Stucke swished a pair of treys and Walker added another to put NU up 11-2 prompting Elon coach Scott Schrage to call timeout at 17:28. Strong scored six points on the backend of the run and put NU up 15 with a pull-up jumper in the lane with 14:53 to play.

The Phoenix absorbed all the abuse they could handle and struck back with a 17-4 surge. Elon began forcing turnovers and beating the Huskies up the floor in transition. Federico Poser a junior forward from Italy scored consecutive layups to cut the score to 23-17 with 9:20 to play.

“Early on we were making shots and the offense was flowing but you knew they were going to have a run in them” said Coen.

The Huskies defused the meltdown with a 12-0 spurt over a four-minute span to go back up 35-17. Telfort scored six with an improbable scoop shot on the baseline two from the stripe and a dunk. Elon countered with an 8-0 run of its own to close out the first half with the Huskies in front 35-25 at the break.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbWluaW9ucG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8wMy9hbi11bmV4cGVjdGVkLXR3aXN0LWluLXRoZS1zdG9yeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An unexpected twist in the story,"A search for biological parents turns up surprising results

by Olivia Murray

OMurray@DominionPost.com

A private investigator a letter fallen into unintended hands and a phone call. These things when combined drastically altered the trajectory of Sarah Culberson’s — or rather Princess Sarah Culberson’s — life in 2004.

Adopted shortly after her first birthday by Jim and Judy Culberson of Morgantown Culberson was raised in Appalachia. She attended Cheat Lake elementary and junior high schools before attending University High School. During her adolescence Culberson was involved in extracurricular activities including basketball and track.

The multi-talented Culberson however did not confine her interests or passion to sports. She attended West Virginia University for which her adoptive father worked where she studied theater and received a bachelor’s degree in fine arts.

“[I] love WVU. I had so much fun always going to the Mountaineer football games and the basketball games” Culberson said.

After her time at WVU Culberson relocated to the West Coast to further her education. She attended a graduate program at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco Calif. before moving to Los Angeles to pursue a career in television and film.

“It was a big change to be in a city with a lot of hustle and bustle” Culberson said of her move across the country. However she found comfort in the mountains and greenery in California parts that she enjoyed most about her home in West Virginia.

In 2003 when Culberson decided she wanted to find her birth parents she was disappointed to learn that journey came too late to meet her birth mother.

“She passed away of cancer so I never got the chance to meet her but I got to hear stories and see pictures of her and meet some family which was really really special” Culberson said.

Interacting with her birth mother’s family led Culberson to begin the search for her biological father. Culberson hired a private investigator — a “friend of a friend” — who assisted her in the search as a favor.

“Within three hours I had all the information I needed for $25 instead of thousands of dollars which is what I thought was going to happen” Culberson said.

Culberson opted to avoid calling her biological father fearing the emotionally charged reason behind the call might result in a less positive experience. Instead she chose to write him a letter.

What Culberson hadn’t anticipated was that her father and his brother share the same first name and last name — Joseph Kposowa — though their middle names differ. Her letter ended going to her uncle.

Four days after sending the letter Culberson received a phone call from her aunt Evelyn who was happy to hear from her biological niece and recalled babysitting Culberson when her mother would shop for groceries.

During the call her aunt and uncle explained the mystery that was Culberson’s biological background. Her uncle had come to West Virginia from Sierra Leone West Africa and attended WVU later encouraging and assisting his brother Culberson’s birth father to attend college in the state as well. Later in the conversation Culberson’s uncle revealed a rather shocking and unexpected piece of Culberson’s biological heritage.

“My uncle was the one who said ‘You know Sarah you are from a royal family. Your great-grandfather was a [Paramount] Chief [and] your grandfather … you can be chief someday. You’re a princess in this country.’ ”

Culberson’s uncle said her grandfather had been knighted Justice of the Peace in England and her biological family had been doing philanthropic work in Sierra Leone for years.

“I was completely overwhelmed and thinking ‘What in the world is going on? This is amazing’ ” Culberson said.

That information influenced the path Culberson chose to take she said. She visited Sierra Leone for the first time in 2004 just two years after the conclusion of the 11-year-long Sierra Leone Civil War.

“It was a huge reality check and an eye-opener to see what happens after a war. It was very confronting and also really important to see” Culberson said.

Culberson recalled seeing destroyed buildings including a school that her grandfather had helped build and people struggling to survive with amputations in the aftermath of the war. Culberson said witnessing how people were living in a place where her family also lived forced her to adopt a different perspective on life and fostered her sense of responsibility as a princess of Sierra Leone.

“I came back and I said ‘I can’t just go back to acting and act like I didn’t see any of this’ ” she said.

From that trip to Sierra Leone was born Sierra Leone Rising a nonprofit organization co-founded by Culberson. The focus of the nonprofit is public health in Sierra Leone with a focus on education female empowerment and supporting the communities there.

Since the founding of the organization Culberson has taken students to Sierra Leone to provide aid to its residents. She intended to take a group of students from Johns Hopkins University on a trip but was thwarted by the 2014 Ebola outbreak.

“One of the main things we’re focused on is trying to get clean drinking water [there]” Culberson said.

She said eight wells were dug through the nonprofit with the help of Rotary International one Leonean (Bo) Rotary and two United States Rotary clubs one of which is in Morgantown. Culberson said while the wells are still functional she learned of the severity of the continued need for drinking water in Sierra Leone when she visited the country in December 2019.

She said her boyfriend George was approached by a woman while drinking from a water bottle.

“There was only like an inch and a half of water left in his bottle and this woman came up and asked ‘Can I have the rest of your water?’ And in that moment it was this wake-up call for the need of clean drinking water in the region and in the provinces.”

Subsequently Culberson contacted World Hope — an organization that had provided assistance in digging the previous wells in Sierra Leone — and reiterated her desire to solve the problem of undrinkable water in Sierra Leone.

Culberson said the wells cost approximately $11000 each to dig due to the necessary depth to avoid the risk of contamination. These wells are preferable though as they last considerably longer than hand-dug wells which easily run dry or become contaminated.

Sierra Leone Rising is also in the process of constructing a prosthetic center for amputees in Sierra Leone.

“There’s a little girl … she’s six years old and we have gotten to know her and her family and she got an infection in her leg and she had to have it amputated. So she’s crawling in the dirt all the time she can’t run and play she doesn’t have a leg.”

An organization in Ghana recently helped Sierra Leone Rising raise funds via a Zoom fundraiser to transport the girl to Ghana in January to help her adjust her hip and be fitted for a prosthetic leg.

“Our goal is also to get funds for two to three students with a college degree to actually go to Ghana to be trained at this center to come back to Sierra Leone to start our own prosthetic and physical therapy center” Culberson said.

She said this project would cost about $10000 a year per student and the organization is working to raising those funds.

Additionally Sierra Leone Rising has partnered with Days for Girls to supply young women in Sierra Leone with sanitary napkins and other menstrual products. Culberson specified that the organization originally partnered with the Morgantown faction of Days for Girls where local women sewed washable reusable sanitary napkins and sent them to Bumpe. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic fabric from the project was used for a mask initiative sponsored by Sierra Leone Rising.

Culberson is also a diversity and inclusion speaker and has spoken at several universities and organizations such as Captial One Prudential and Danaher. Furthermore she co-wrote a memoir that tells her story “A Princess Found” which is being turned into a film produced by Stephanie Allain the first African American to produce the Academy Awards.

Coretec Group is looking to exploit an unusual compound called cyclohexasilane as the basis for new batteries that would allow for quick recharging of electric vehicles (EVs). If Coretec’s exploration of nanotech is successful that would make EVs instantly more practical.

Automotive manufactures are striving to create a more sustainable future with EVs but the market for EVs still lacks sufficient infrastructure for refueling and benefits from improved battery technology. A robust fast-charging network and silicon anode batteries could be keys to making the EV market more rapidly viable. In an interview with Michael Kraft CEO of the Coretec group he highlighted the properties of these new solutions and analyzed which materials could contribute to the development of e-mobility.

“Our focus is on advanced materials that enable next-generation technologies in the global challenge area. Semiconductors solar panels LEDs and silicon anode next-generation batteries for high power and fast charging. We’re always looking for additional materials that enable these next-generation technologies materials companies to partner with or acquire. Currently we are putting a majority of our resources into the commercialization of cyclohexasilane” said Kraft.

The company based in New York City but with roots in the Midwest believes this and a few other new materials will be applicable to several markets including energy storage solar solid state lighting printable electronics and 3D displays. Kraft pointed out that the company’s product portfolio is based on the production of silicon products starting with cyclohexasilane (Si 6 H 12 or simply CHS) a liquid that converts to pure silicon when exposed to heat or UV radiation; it is amorphous silicon but becomes crystalline silicon as exposure increases.

CHS is the key element for advanced energy storage applications.

Through a partnership with Evonik (a specialty chemicals company in Germany) the Coretec Group is providing customers with CHS samples for evaluation. For production scale Evonik can easily supply large-scale quantities. CHS can be varied in purity to meet specific application needs with pricing correlated to level of purity.

“Coretec Cyclohexasilane is ideal for applications where purity safety fast deposition rate and low-temperature deposition of silicon and/or doped silicon (C Ge B Co and P) are important” commented Kraft.

Electric vehicles (EVs)

Electric vehicles are an environmentally friendly alternative to their common petrol-powered counterparts but they lack one crucial quality: convenience. The EV infrastructure and battery capacities are not comparable with current vehicles. While there seems to be a petrol station every meter electric vehicle charging stations are not yet common which means that drivers have to make detailed charging plans well in advance of their journey. An efficient infrastructure with fast charging and a long-range battery should contribute to the success of EVs.

Many manufacturers are looking for new solutions (materials) to overcome the limitations of graphite anodes in lithium-ion batteries. New silicon anode battery technology promises to charge batteries quickly to over 80% of their capacity in 5-10 minutes without physically damaging the battery while also increasing the energy density by 2-3×.

Upcoming Gen 2.0 lithium-ion batteries will see new materials incorporated to increase energy density and solve swelling problems. Kraft highlighted how many companies are working with materials engineers to add nanotechnology into the manufacturing process including incorporating silicon precursors such as cyclohexasilane.

Kraft explained how CHS offers a much faster rate of device fabrication than traditional precursors and more importantly generates amorphous nanostructures which means batteries can be charged quickly without swelling. Such material also helps to withstand many charges and discharge cycles an important consideration for e-mobility.

“Coretec Cyclohexasilane makes it possible to increase energy density by replacing the graphite anode commonly used in lithium-ion batteries with silicon-carbon nanostructures and alloys. These materials store more lithium ions increasing energy density while reducing eventual destruction” said Kraft.

Cyclohexasilane is a liquid silicon precursor for lithium-ion battery anode applications. Its liquid state offers advantages for processing low-cost carbon-silicon nanostructures as a direct replacement for graphite in high-energy lithium ions. A key advantage is the high charge/discharge life cycle and higher energy density.

Kraft pointed out that Tesla stated it is moving towards the silicon anode solution representing a significant milestone for EV batteries. Consumers demand a battery that can charge faster travel farther and last longer and today’s materials do not adequately address this challenge.

New features for SiC manufacturing

Power electronics is evolving at an impressive pace through wide bandgap material needs. Power electronics for EVs can effectively be enhanced with Silicon Carbide solutions that meet design parameters and make an essential contribution to system performance and long-term reliability.

Silicon carbide (SiC) devices are increasingly used in high-voltage power converters with strict requirements regarding size weight and efficiency because they offer a number of attractive characteristics when compared with commonly used silicon (Si) devices. The on-state resistance and switching losses are considerably lower and SiC provides about 3× more thermal conductivity than silicon allowing faster heat dissipation from components. This is important because when Si-based devices become smaller in terms of area it becomes more difficult to extract the heat generated by electrical conversion processes and SiC dissipates the heat better.

SiC wafers are very complex compared to traditional silicon wafers and as the market demands them a number of barriers need to be resolved when it comes to mass commercialization and total replacement of more traditional forms of silicon. Silicon precursors known as cyclohexasilane (CHS) can help.

High-performance SiC devices have been limited by the inability to grow SiC films on semiconductor wafers with low defect density as well as the additional difficulties of adhering the SiC layer to the substrate: α-SiC (e.g. 4H-SiC 6H-SiC) and β-SiC (3C-SiC) are well-known examples.

The wide adoption of β-SiC as an alternative material for power electronics presents several challenges. One in particular is the need for a silicon precursor that is not only economical but chemically viable to develop advanced films and strutures of SiC devices.

CHS can create β-SiC thin films on a variety of substrates under normal conditions. In addition CHS allows easy p-doping of materials into β-SiC films. This precursor can help the development of power electronics by simplifying the process from transport to storage and silicon deposition. Kraft pointed out that CHS offers the potential to overcome the historical limitations of SiC semiconductor production in a cost-effective way.

The autonomy of an electric car directly reflects the efficiency of its powertrain and energy management system. In addition to the necessary infrastructures such as powerful fast-charging systems available everywhere the EV must have improved SiC power electronics and a silicon-based anode battery with higher energy density and improved charging times. Electric Vehicles with these improvements will not only be adopted at a large scale and replace today’s petrol vehicle but they will create the sustainable e-mobility future the world needs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vY3BpLXBvc3RzL3NvdXRoLWtvcmVhLXRvLWNvbXBsZXRlLXJldmlldy1vZi1kYWV3b28tc2hpcGJ1aWxkaW5nLWtzb2UtbWVyZ2VyLXNvb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,South Korea To Complete Review Of Daewoo Shipbuilding-KSOE Merger Soon,"South Korea’s antitrust watchdog is likely to complete the review of the merger between two South Korean shipbuilding giants during the first quarter of the year industry sources said Sunday January 3 possibly paving the way for the creation of the world’s largest shipyard.

In March 2019 Hyundai Heavy Industries signed a deal to purchase a 55.72% stake in Daewoo Shipbuilding. The deal would lead to the creation of the world’s biggest shipbuilder with a global market share of around 20%.

KSOE currently has under its wing the group’s three shipbuilding units — Hyundai Heavy Industries Hyundai Mipo Dockyard and Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries.

GraphAudio's technology enables electrostatic micro transducers that use CVD graphene sheets.

GraphAudio's CEO is Ramesh G. Ramchandani that previously held executive leadership positions at International Rectifier Semicoa nPlay Technologies ZiLOG and ON Semiconductor and was a senior advisor for consumer and commercial AI at Google X. Following is an interview with Ramesh to discuss GraphAudio's technology business and roadmap.

Q: Thank you for your time Ramesh. Can you detail GraphAudio's technology and how graphene is used to create the sound driver?

We use electrostatic technology which is not a new invention... quite the contrary in that electrostatic technology was invented about the same time as the conventional widely used dynamic speaker (about the turn of the 20th century) but it was never adopted into wide use primarily because the diaphragm materials were not environmentally stable - gold flashed animal gut was the original diaphragm.

With the advent of polymer technology it was used to replace the animal intestine many high end audiophile speakers have been sold to that niche market; since this technology eliminates the voicecoil weight of conventional dynamic speakers it has the reputation of exceptional clarity and imaging. Unfortunately these products are not very common Martin Logan is a conventional speaker using electrostatic technology; and Sennheiser with its flagship ship ""Orpheus"" headphone ($59K) STAX and most recently Shure having more reasonably priced products. Our goal is to leverage our graphene technology and drive into mainstream usage.

Q: What kind of graphene is being used by GraphAudio?

We use multilayer graphene. By definition graphene is a single layer film but in real world use scenarios this film has tremendous issues to overcome. By utilizing a process where the graphene is formed in layers it creates a film which is analogous to chipped plywood but our binders are mechanical and the film is pure graphene. We don't see mechanical strengths of Terra Pascals tested by an Atomic Force Microscope in the lab (20 micron diameter) but we do see real world large dimensional strengths (10 mm diameter) in the Giga Pascal ranges which are plenty strong for audio applications.

Q: We understand you are producing your own CVD graphene in-house. Can you share some details on your production setup?

We use conventional semiconductor process equipment to make our graphene films. The process is highly proprietary.

Q: What is your current production capacity?

We are working in a research facility and because of COVID issues we are further constrained but our team believes that it's critical to run a baseline of material in order to do proper development. We have a standard process flow which yields us approximately 100 transducers a month. This may not seem like much but it's easily scalable and adequate for our current development needs. We are in conversations with several foundries to scale our technology into mainstream production environments.

Q: What kind of performance can we expect from your drivers?

We expect and have documented best-in-class audiophile performance. We measure this with 7/11 audio couplers and compare them to results of other high end audio products. Typically measure Sound Pressure Levels (SPL) throughout the audio spectrum as well as distortion.

Q: We also understand the drivers are extremely power efficient as 95% of the energy is converted into sound. How is that achieved?

Because the graphene is a strong but compliant film it matched well with air and thus can reproduce sound efficiently through the entire audio spectrum and beyond into the Ultrasonic when electrostatic forces are used to drive the diaphragm. This differs from the traditional speaker which has a much thicker diaphragm because it needs to be mechanically attached to a voicecoils to make the speaker move. The traditional device is a current driven device which leads to its significant inefficiencies (

The electrostatic design does require higher voltages so nothing is for free; but on the net when the chipset is developed to power our transducer we expect the savings to be energy savings to be significant and to alleviate the traditional speaker heating issue.

Q: We also understand that you expect the first products on the market by 2022 - and these will be earphones/headphones. Can you share more details?

We're in discussions about earbuds and headphones now. We will be working with major audio product OEMs closely on commercializing our technology.

Q: GraphAudio says that the speakers even though they use high-quality CVD graphene will be very cost effective due to their simple design. Can you share your cost estimate and how it compares to competing devices?

We plan on being cost competitive and a very cost competitive game. Our design is simple but we hope to sell the driver and transducer at pricing that supports high volume products in the long run; but we will start small and build to that. Our technology simplifies the manufacturing process as well as reduce the components required to create sound in today's solutions. The overall cost of our technology will be cheaper than what is available now.

Thank you Ramesh! I wish you and GraphAudio good luck!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzAzL3JlcG9ydC1odWF3ZWktcGxhbm5pbmctd29ybGRzLWZpcnN0LTNubS1tb2JpbGUtY2hpcHNldC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Report: Huawei planning world's first 3-nanometer mobile chipset,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://siliconangle.com/2021/01/03/report-huawei-planning-worlds-first-3nm-mobile-chipset/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzAzL3JlcG9ydC1odWF3ZWktcGxhbm5pbmctd29ybGRzLWZpcnN0LTNubS1tb2JpbGUtY2hpcHNldC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vY3BpLXBvc3RzL3RpY2tldG1hc3Rlci1maW5lZC0xMG0tZmluZS1mb3ItaGFja2luZy1yaXZhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ticketmaster Fined $10M For Hacking Rival,"Live Nation’s Ticketmaster has agreed to pay a US$10 million criminal fine in order to sidestep prosecution on charges that it hacked a competitor’s computer system to steal confidential information according to the US Department of Justice.

“Ticketmaster employees repeatedly accessed a competitor’s computers without authorization using stolen passwords to unlawfully collect business intelligence” Acting US Attorney Seth DuCharme said in a press release on Wednesday December 30.

“Further Ticketmaster’s employees brazenly held a division-wide ‘summit’ at which the stolen passwords were used to access the victim company’s computers as if that were an appropriate business tactic” DuCharme added.

Ticketmaster employees are accused of repeatedly using stolen passwords to hack computers belonging to its competitor Songkick. Headquartered in Brooklyn New York Songkick is a concert discovery service owned by Warner Music Group.

The US Department of Justice reached a deal with Ticketmaster before US District Judge Margo Brodie at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn. Terms also include a three-year deferred prosecution agreement according to the release. The deal resolves the five criminal counts including wire fraud conspiracy and computer intrusion.

Another provision of the deal requires that the Los Angeles California company keep updated compliance and ethics procedures to stop cybercrime. Further Ticketmaster will have to report to the US Attorney’s Office annually during the three-year term of the agreement.

If the agreement is breached Ticketmaster will be subject to prosecution for the original charges — one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusions; one count of computer intrusion for commercial advantage; one count of computer intrusion in furtherance of fraud; one count of wire fraud conspiracy; and one count of wire fraud the Department of Justice stated.

ORCL,Oracle Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRleGFzbW9udGhseS5jb20vbmV3cy1wb2xpdGljcy9hdXN0aW4tdGVjaC1pbmR1c3RyeS1zaWxpY29uLXZhbGxleS1zYW4tZnJhbmNpc2NvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No Austin Won't Become Silicon Valley 2.0,"On the heels of last month’s remarkable migration of tech industry capital from California’s Bay Area to Austin including an official relocation by $180 billion software company Oracle Corporation and a more-than-likely move by $140 billion man and Tesla CEO Elon Musk two popular narratives have taken shape. Both got Austinites of all sorts worked up whether jolly or jittery over the holiday season. The two stories however share the same flaw: a facile comparison of two sharply different contexts and cities.

The first emerging narrative favored by champions of Austin’s growth and fans of the state’s dominant low-tax anti-regulatory economic philosophy holds that California’s business environment has declined as a result of liberal mismanagement and intellectual conformism. Texas is swooping in to offer a new home for the global technology industry for the coming decades—a back-to-its-libertarian-roots Silicon Valley 2.0 with a bright future. A partial version of this argument was made by recent California-to-Austin transplant Joe Lonsdale of venture capital firm 8VC in the Wall Street Journal: “Our job as entrepreneurs and investors is to build the future and I know of no better place to do so than Texas.”

The other tale told by those appalled by the sky-high rents and wealth inequality of today’s San Francisco region is that the tech industry itself is the real villain having eaten the Bay Area alive and now in the process of spitting out the bones of a once-dynamic city. The same rapacious billionaires are moving on to fresh prey in still-groovy Central Texas which is destined to turn into another smoking cultural wasteland this story goes. As an op-ed by a California writer in the Houston Chronicle put it “Thank you Texas for taking Elon Musk off our hands.”

Both stories have their truthful elements but both fail to credit the vast differences between Austin and the Bay Area: in history in industrial and social capital in physical landscape and in cultural horizons. There’s no question that the pandemic-era “Texodus” from the Bay Area is big news and that Austin’s post-Oracle trajectory should make residents excited—or worried depending on one’s level of economic security and nostalgia for the city’s laid-back low-rent mystique. But it’s lazy chimerical thinking to graft global giant Silicon Valley’s recent history onto upstart Austin’s near future. Austin has its own unique story as a tech-industry town and crucial chapters remain to be written.

For years the Austin metro region has been trying to earn the self-anointed moniker “Silicon Hills” with varying degrees of success. Like Silicon Valley’s Hewlett-Packard garage the 1939 spiritual birthplace of the U.S. tech industry Austin’s tech sector has a mythical origin point in Michael Dell’s UT dorm room circa 1984. There are other similarities too in the role of large universities as incubators and in the cross-pollination between entrepreneurs and the counterculture. But the history of Austin’s tech sector is neither as long nor as storied as that of the Bay Area.

A 1990s upswelling of Dellionaires in Austin gave way to a burst dot-com bubble in the 2000s with the concrete hulk of the Intel Shell reminding downtown visitors what dreams had failed to come. Meanwhile mega-firms such as Google Facebook and Apple roared out of Silicon Valley to define a new twenty-first century age of billionaire industrial barons starting in the second Bush administration. Austin was stuck in the relative bush leagues with Dell hitting a rough patch.

Austin’s current place on the tech-world map has lately been defined by its many secondary campuses for major tech companies—most significantly Apple IBM and Samsung—employing tens of thousands of people in the region. This trend has heated up in recent years with more and more investment from outside firms until one such secondary campus Oracle’s was rechristened last month as a Fortune 500 corporate headquarters.

There’s no question that the Oracle move is huge for Austin. Still it’s worth keeping in perspective what it means both for the company and for its new home city. Oracle’s revenues are on the decline. With no state income tax salaries go notably further in Texas creating an opportunity to cut payroll without cutting employees’ take-home pay. The move is especially easy to make now as a work-from-home “new normal” means there’s no need for Oracle to force all its deeper-rooted California employees to make the move. Indeed Oracle announced its relocation alongside a shift to a “more flexible employee work location policy.” The company seems to want to have its Texas cake and eat it in California too.

Oracle isn’t choosing Austin because the city is poised to overtake the Bay Area as the capital of the U.S. tech industry anytime soon. In 2019 according to the Computing Technology Industry Association the San Jose and San Francisco metro areas combined for over $333 billion in gross tech regional product in 2019. Austin managed just over $33 billion. That’s an order-of-magnitude difference.

Nor is Austin known for producing high-flying home-grown tech firms. The city’s second most famous local tech company after Dell is now arguably SolarWinds a business IT software company that reportedly outsourced its coding to Eastern European engineers and is now at the center of an embarrassing and catastrophic hack of U.S. government and corporate targets by the Russian government.

There’s a built-in-a-day flavor to Austin’s recent rise that while a good starting place for future development pales in comparison to the long record of success relationships and intertwined institutions in Silicon Valley. Decisions to move jobs here that depend on low tax rates or the preferences of young college graduates are fragile. Those same jobs could just as easily get up and leave Texas if another state undercuts us or another city seems hipper to Zoomers.

Furthermore to the extent that more liberal white-collar workers move to Texas the political tides may well continue to shift to the point where we are no longer willing to race other states to the bottom in terms of taxes and regulations. A balance will perhaps be reached in which Austin like other prosperous cities has a positive reciprocal relationship with its biggest employers but is no longer enough of a magnet to ignite the idea of attracting an entire industry away from California. Likewise losing a few businesses and billionaires may ultimately be good news for the Bay Area allowing it some elbow room after a decade of uninterrupted growth.

In addition to building electric cars Musk’s abiding passion these days is sending rockets to Mars to build a human settlement there. It’s useful to imagine his move to Austin in that context. A recent Guardian article on the Oracle move characterized Austin as a “colony” of Silicon Valley and quoted urban theorist Richard Florida: “There is a satellite system that’s developing but the hub of technology and innovation in the United States is the San Francisco Bay Area.”

So if we think of Austin as less a tech-industry hub unto itself and more a colony for Bay Area billionaires what does it mean for the Live Music Capital the City of the Violet Crown? As the industry grows will the music die the slackers be forced to abandon their velvet rut and the violet at dusk fade into a cloud of auto exhaust? Some of these things may already be coming to pass without Oracle’s help but these outcomes aren’t inevitable. The San Francisco metro area’s experience is a valuable lesson from which to learn not a destiny to succumb to.

Yes the Bay Area boasts the highest real estate costs in the U.S. with a years-long eviction crisis in San Francisco likely tied to tech-related gentrification. It is vital that Austin voters and policy makers bone up on these issues before they grow worse in what is already arguably the most expensive city in Texas. Median rent for a one-bedroom unit topped $2000 per month in Oakland and San Jose and $2700 in San Francisco this month though rents are reportedly falling fast as a result of COVID-19 and perhaps the “Texodus.” In comparison Austin’s median one-bedroom rent is $1290 and rising occupying a dangerous zone that feels high to Texans but is still low enough to appeal mightily to priced-out Californians.

Affordability-wise however Austin’s broad horizons give it options not available to San Francisco. For example there’s still plenty of room to sprawl. Austin is surrounded by cheap land that one can easily imagine filling with suburbs and exurbs as Greater Houston and Dallas–Fort Worth have. The Bay Area on the other hand is penned in by mountains and water.

Beyond resorting to sprawl Austin also has the option to avoid repeating some of the worst planning decisions made in San Francisco and Silicon Valley many related to restrictive zoning. The woes of Bay Area renters have led to a robust Yes in My Back Yard (YIMBY) movement pushing back against homeowners who exercise outsized political power to prevent new and affordable housing in their neighborhoods. This YIMBY ethos has already come to Austin. In recent years Austin voters have passed a $250 million bond for affordable housing and delivered a city council majority that favors increased housing density though anti-density forces have been effective in dragging out the process of a comprehensive rewrite of city zoning.

Here’s hoping Austin’s majority political will prevails and affordability in the housing market is aggressively managed because it is unaffordability—not a strong local economy per se—that endangers a lively arts and culture scene. A market where only 32 percent of creatives—down from 42 percent in 2019 according to the City of Austin—can afford enough space to make their art is a problem. An influx of new money that endows mature arts institutions like museums and professional performing arts ensembles on the other hand would be a good thing. If that’s turning into San Francisco Austinites should embrace it.

It’s difficult to prove the prevalent notion that tech nerds have pushed out all the cool people who made the Bay Area’s music scene interesting but let’s take as a given that this is true. If so the Bay Area would be an outlier. Other metros defined by tech including Austin and Seattle—which as home to Microsoft and Amazon has a much stronger claim to being Silicon Valley 2.0 than Austin does—are often recognized for their strong music scenes. Even today as Seattle rents soar thanks to Amazon the region is the origin of three acts in Pitchfork.com’s top twenty albums of 2020. Other expensive cities like Los Angeles and New York have thriving music cultures. Here in Austin Spoon arguably our biggest musical export of the 2000s was cofounded by semiconductor chip designer and erstwhile Motorola employee Jim Eno who has also produced albums for local acts like Bill Callahan and Explosions in the Sky. Being a job magnet for young employable people is by no means a recipe for a moribund music scene. In fact the opposite is often true.

Of course it’s not just artists and musicians at risk of displacement when rents go up or newcomers arrive. The themes of recent arthouse film The Last Black Man in San Francisco will be all too familiar for many Austin-born people of color who have seen their neighborhoods of origin gentrified beyond recognition during the past decade’s tech boom. An influx of Silicon Valley transplants might bring a more globally diverse perspective to Austin’s professional classes but it will also put further pressure on local Black and Hispanic families who have suffered generations of exclusion. This seems unfortunately like an arena in which Austin is on track to parallel some of the Bay Area’s recent inglorious history. Both Austin and San Francisco for instance have lost Black population this millennium—though to be fair Austin’s trend was established long before Oracle or Musk.

The bright spot for Austin is that again the city still has time to make better and more equitable decisions. Is it possible to manage drastic changes in the cityscape in a way that actually serves poor and minority stakeholders? Where did San Francisco go wrong and where can Austin do better? Signs of changes in Austin city politics like the pro-density majority on the city council the affordable housing bond and November’s long-awaited passage of a $7 billion transit ballot proposition that includes urban rail suggest that the citizenry is engaged with these questions.

If there’s one reason to be confident that Austin will not turn into the next Bay Area it’s this: Austinites of all political types from libertarian to social-justice-minded have been warning each other for years that we don’t want to turn into the next San Francisco. How the political fights of the future will go —not to mention tomorrow’s economy—is anybody’s guess. But there’s no chance we are sleepwalking through a reenactment of the past few decades of California history. For better or worse what gets built here will be something brand-new.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Niels Teusink of Dutch cybersecurity firm EYE discovered a secret hardcoded administrative account in the latest 4.60 patch 0 firmware for some Zyxel devices.

$ ssh zyfwp@192.168.1.252 Password: Pr ******* Xp Router> show users current No: 1 Name: zyfwp Type: admin (...) Router>

This account does not show in the Zyxel user interface and has a login name of 'zyfwp' and a static plain-text password. Due to the severity of this vulnerability BleepingComputer decided not to publish the password.

Teusink found that the account could be used to log into vulnerable devices over both SSH and the web interface. Since the SSL VPN interface operates on the same port as the web interface Teusink found that many users have allowed port 443 to be accessible on the Internet.

""As SSL VPN on these devices operates on the same port as the web interface a lot of users have exposed port 443 of these devices to the internet. Using publicly available data from Project Sonar I was able to identify about 3.000 Zyxel USG/ATP/VPN devices in the Netherlands. Globally more than 100.000 devices have exposed their web interface to the internet"" Teusink reported.

VPN device vulnerabilities are extremely dangerous as they can be used to create new VPN accounts to gain access to an internal network or create port forwarding rules to make internal services publicly accessible.

""Someone could for example change firewall settings to allow or block certain traffic. They could also intercept traffic or create VPN accounts to gain access to the network behind the device. Combined with a vulnerability like Zerologon this could be devastating to small and medium businesses"" Teusink warned.

These types of vulnerabilities have become a favorite among threat actors who are known to exploit Pulse Secure Fortinet and Citrix Netscaler VPN vulnerabilities to deploy ransomware or compromise internal corporate networks to steal data.

Administrators of affected devices should upgrade their devices to the latest firmware as soon as possible.

Zyxel releases new firmware for firewalls

In an advisory Zyxel thanked EYE's for their disclosure and stated that they used the hardcoded credentials to deliver automatic firmware updates via FTP.

""A hardcoded credential vulnerability was identified in the “zyfwp” user account in some Zyxel firewalls and AP controllers. The account was designed to deliver automatic firmware updates to connected access points through FTP"" states Zyxel's advisory.

Zyxel has released ZLD V4.60 Patch 1 to remove the hardcoded credentials in vulnerable ATP USG USG Flex and VPN devices. Zyxel states that ATP USG USG FLEX and VPN firewalls using earlier firmware or SD-OS are not affected.

The patch for NXC AP controllers is expected to be released in April 2021.

The table of affected Zyxel products and the patch availability is below.",,,,,,,,,,,,

When PayPal detects suspicious or fraudulent activity on an account the account will have its status set to ""limited"" which will put temporary restrictions on withdrawing sending or receiving money.

A new SMS text phishing (smishing) campaign pretends to be from PayPal stating that your account has been permanently limited unless you verify your account by clicking on a link.

""PayPal: We've permanently limited your account please click link below to verify"" the smishing text message reads.

Clicking on the enclosed link will bring you to a phishing page that prompts you to log in to your account as shown below.

PayPal smishing text and landing page

If you log in on the phishing page the entered PayPal credentials will be sent to the threat actors. The phishing page then goes a step further as it will try to collect further details from you including your name date of birth address bank details and more.

Collecting personal information from the victim

The collected information is used to conduct identity theft attacks gain access to your other accounts or perform targeted spear-phishing attacks.

Yesterday two other people I know received these phishing texts so it is a very active campaign and everyone needs to watch out for these messages.

Smishing scams are becoming increasingly popular so it is always important to treat any text messages containing links as suspicious. As with all phishing emails never click on suspicious links but instead go to the main site's domain to confirm if there is an issue with your account.

What should you do if you enter info at this link?

If you received this text and mistakenly logged into your PayPal account or provided other information you should immediately go to Paypal.com and change your password.

If you use that same password at other sites change them there as well.

Finally you should look out for other targeted phishing campaigns using the submitted data. BleepingComputer also suggests that you monitor your credit report to make sure fraudulent accounts are not created under your name.

To prevent identity theft you can also temporarily freeze on your credit report to stop banks and other companies from issuing credit under your name.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVyLWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvcG9saXRpY3MvbWl0Y2gtbWNjb25uZWxsLzIwMjEvMDEvMDIvc2VuLW1pdGNoLW1jY29ubmVsbC1wZW9wbGUtdXNpbmctdmVubW8tYW5kLXBheXBhbC1kZW1hbmQtMi1rLzQxMTYxMTMwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,People are using Venmo to demand $2K from Mitch McConnell after he blocked stimulus checks,"In the days following Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's blockage of a bill to increase coronavirus stimulus payments to $2000 Twitter users turned to mobile payment services to demand the money.

The Kentucky Republican argued on the Senate floor Wednesday the measure has ""no realistic path to quickly pass the Senate"" while Democrats and some Republicans unsuccessfully pushed for a vote on $2000 stimulus checks before the Senate adjourned Friday.

In response several people tried to demand the money from the Senate majority leader directly using Venmo and PayPal.

""I'm getting that stimulus check one way or another"" one Twitter user wrote Tuesday one day before McConnell blocked the bill's quick passage. The person included a screenshot of a Venmo request for $2000 sent to an account named Mitch McConnell that had the senator's headshot as its profile picture.

""(I)’ll be venmo requesting mitch mcconnell for $2000 every day this year"" another person tweeted.

Another person said they couldn't find a Venmo account for McConnell so they ""took it to PayPal"" which allows users to send emailed requests for money even to people who don't have an account.

A spokesperson for McConnell did not answer an email from The Courier Journal asking for a response to the requests.

During his floor speech Wednesday McConnell said ""the Senate is not going to be bullied into rushing out more borrowed money into the hands of Democrats' rich friends who don't need the help.""

Travel perks still aren’t what they used to be and it’s going to be at least 3-6 more months before they are once again. For travel heavy premium credit cards that means it’s time to get creative. Once again American Express has. After offering $20 monthly credits last year for streaming or mobile devices Amex is offering a broader credit for 2021 with $30 in monthly PayPal credits for 6 months. Here’s everything you need to know.

Amex Platinum PayPal Credit For 2021

If you have the personal Amex Platinum Card in the USA congrats you just got $30 of your PayPal purchases covered each month for the first six months of the year. That’s $180 towards purchases you make with PayPal including shopping at most major retailers.

The only catch – person to person transactions don’t count. With the $30 credit the amount will automatically come off of any tallies you rack up over the month. So if you were to buy some Yeezy’s for $200 you’d receive a credit back of $30 making it $170.

Good to know: the credit resets monthly so if you don’t spend at least $30 in PayPal each month you won’t get the full $180 in perks over the six months. You’ll basically want to spend at least $30 each month via PayPal. If you don’t already it’s quite handy for shopping since it saves all your details and makes checkout both faster and more secure.

PayPal and Amex have a partnership explainer page which hammers out the rest of the details you might be curious about. For example – all transactions must be made in USD.

With an annual fee of $550 on the Platinum Card $180 back in the first six months plus all the 18+ other useful money saving benefits like $180 in Uber credits $100 Saks credit and a $200 airline fee credit plus Fine Hotels & Resorts offers still makes this a compelling card.

If you don’t already have the Amex Platinum Card Amex is currently offering a sign up bonus of 75000 Membership Rewards Points plus 10X points on the first 6 months of gas and groceries which can add up quickly.

PayPal has been a popular partner with credit cards in recent months as Capital One added its name to the list of rewards points currencies which you can redeem directly on PayPal to cover some or all of a purchase instead of paying cash.

Amex has long offered integrations with Amazon and PayPal to present ways to use points for daily online purchases directly but they typically don’t represent the best value. That honor still goes to travel and holding onto American Express Membership Rewards points for when travel recovers is most likely the way to go.

Here’s some inspiration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8wMi9pbnZlc3RpbmcvYml0Y29pbi1wcmljZS0zMDAwMC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFAaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMS8wMS8wMi9pbnZlc3RpbmcvYml0Y29pbi1wcmljZS0zMDAwMA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bitcoin soars past $33000 its highest ever,"1.

PayPal alternatives to explore

While PayPal is still by far the most dominant internet payments platform globally and therefore hard to go around if you want to receive payments there are still some alternatives to explore. It’s important to note however those possibilities depend on your needs what’s possible in your country.

One issue with these alternatives is that it limits the flexibility on the part of the party making the payment to you and sometimes that party may just tell you they are unable to use that alternative.

We list here the most prominent services Africans have been known to resort to.

Paystack

Paystack is by far the largest payments company in Africa (outside South Africa) made for African businesses. It’s a trusted Nigerian company and since October last year is now part of a larger US company called Stripe.

Explore Paystack here: paystack.com

Stripe

Stripe has risen in the past few years to challenge PayPal globally and will be the best alternative for a lot of individuals and businesses. In October last year it acquired a Nigerian payments company Paystack effectively making it available in Nigeria and other African countries.

Paysera

Paysera is a Lithuanian payments company launched in 2004 which now offers payments globally.

According to the company it now offers internet payments solutions in at least 33 African countries including however thee exclude Nigeria Ghana Botswana Uganda Zimbabwe DRC Somalia and the Sudans . Full list here: https://www.paysera.com/v2/en/faq/where-paysera-works

Telegraphic Transfers

Also referred to as TTs for short but also called Bank Wire Transfers this old and extremely expensive way of using banks to make payments across borders still works with a lot of businesses globally. Indeed many will be happy to find you have this alternative.

However in a few regions (EU for example and the US) the paying business may complain that regulations (sanctions of perceived risk by their government) do not allow them to send TTs to certain countries.

In addition while this is a convenient method for businesses to make payment individuals looking to pay you will find it cumbersome as their bank will require some paperwork – definitely not as easy as clicking a few PayPal buttons.

Lastly wire transfer payments are known to take some 4 working days to clear. Also it is an expensive workaround as banks can take as much as US $40 of the amount you’re being paid.

Coinbase Commerce

This method of going around PayPal means you will accept cryptocurrencies as payment. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Etherum Litecoin Bitcoin Cash and so forth. Of course this depends a lot on your target market and if they are able to use cryptocurrencies to pay you. Another downside is that once you have Bitcoin you will need to final a local buyer in your country who will exchange your Bitcoin for cash.

Other method worth mentioning

It was these innovative thoughtfully considered features combined with the package’s eye-catching graphics as well as its high scores in the areas of economics marketing performance environmental impact and “Save Food criteria” that led judges of the 2020 AmeriStar Awards to honor the 16-oz Mtn Dew Game Fuel can with the competition’s Design Excellence Award.

As Colin Haynes Associate Principal Engineer – PepsiCo Packaging R&D explains the Dew marketing team has played a role within the gaming space for the last 15 years. “Through various partnerships and activations in that time we gained valuable insights into what gamers are looking for” he says. “Dew identified an opportunity to create a beverage specifically for gamers and what better way to do so than by working with them.”

Mtn Dew Game Fuel is specially crafted for gamers with theanine and caffeine which in combination have been shown to improve accuracy and alertness PepsiCo explains. The functional beverage is available in multiple flavor options in the resealable can “so both the beverage and packaging aid gamers in their quest for being the best” the company says.

Packaging for Game Fuel was developed in partnership with gaming pros and elite amateurs. “Gamers were involved at the very beginning during concept development and later when vetting prototypes” Haynes explains. “To create a product that was authentic to the gaming space Dew hosted multiple focus groups to understand what players are looking for in a drink including taste and benefits. Dew learned that gamers wanted a beverage container that was resealable in order to protect their expensive gaming equipment from spills easy to open and close with one hand—allowing them to stay in the game—and wouldn’t slip out of their hand. Each of these insights was addressed with the final Mtn Dew Game Fuel can.”

The can’s most innovative feature is its resealable closure which makes Game Fuel the first to nationally scale the use of a resealable aluminum can. The resealable closure is supplied by Xolution GmbH which refined the plastic component for PepsiCo’s needs. According to PepsiCo’s AmeriStar entry form the consumer experience with the XO System closure is related to but still distinct from a standard end. “The opening of the Game Fuel can begins with the familiar motion of lifting a tab. From that point forward the experience is unique and exciting” the entry form explains. “The consumer grabs the lifted tab and slides it back until it passes over a detent locking it open and revealing the drinking aperture. After consuming the beverage (either a sip or half the can) the process is reversed. The tab is slid forward (until a soft click is heard) to cover the drinking aperture. With the slider fully forward and covering the etched line the tab can be pushed down creating a gas-tight and liquid-tight seal.”

Refinements by Xolution included reducing the opening force of the tab from approximately 25N (newtons) to 20N which PepsiCo says is lower than current non-resealable ends. In addition insights from focus groups also led to a design feature that addressed an issue with users damaging the resealing mechanism. The new feature a biaxially-oriented polypropylene tamper band is placed such that if visible it indicates the end is not fully closed. When the feature is completely covered it means the end is fully resealed and is protected from damage.

During development PepsiCo conducted extensive testing to quantify carbon retention. CO 2 measurements were taken weekly and the data showed that the cans met all performance parameters. According to the company “Whether the can has been opened by the consumer or direct from the filling plant once the can is resealed the product is protected from CO 2 egress and foreign object ingress. This exceeds the protection requirements normally assigned to products in cans.” The shelf life for Mtn Dew Game Fuel in the resealable can is 20 weeks.

To enable speed-to-market of the product and minimize capital expenditure the Game Fuel can was designed to work with all existing PepsiCo filling infrastructure. The can is filled on existing fillers from various suppliers seamed by multiple models of Angelus seamers and packed into existing secondary packaging used for standard 16-oz cans. At most of the production locations PepsiCo is now using automatic debagging and lid-feed systems from CSW Can Systems Worldwide which can run both resealable and standard ends leading to efficiency gains for both.

But the can’s resealability is just one of the functional features incorporated into the Game Fuel can that make it more convenient for video gamers at play. Another is the use of tactile ink technology from can suppliers Ball and MCC that helps consumers keep a grip on the can. The tactile ink is combined with standard inks adding a matte/gloss combination effect that helps the can visually pop on the shelf. Graphics include a bright stripe of color that signifies the flavor variant—e.g. blue for Charged Berry Blast red for Charged Cherry Burst etc.—next to a stripe of black bringing to mind the black of gaming consoles.

Additionally there are opening instructions etched on the can end as well as printed on the can body depending on where the beverage is distributed. In California opening instructions on the end were replaced with deposit information to comply with local laws. Game Fuel advertising highlights that resealing the can helps keep the beverage “fresh and your hardware dry so you can focus on grinding.”

Another significant feature of the Game Fuel can that caught AmeriStar judges’ attention certainly my own was its recyclability. According to PepsiCo during development of the can PepsiCo Packaging R&D collaborated with Xolution and Waste Management to identify recyclers with the ability to shred the cans prior to sortation to remove the plastic component and a network was created. Explains PepsiCo “Once shredded the plastic pieces fully separate from the aluminum and can be removed using existing technology (i.e. eddy current separators) prior to the aluminum entering the de-lacquering furnace. Thanks to these two methods we have identified the appropriate ‘graves’ for this packaging and are proud to say that the can is recyclable.”

Launched in 2019 Game Fuel has been a significant contributor to revenue growth for PepsiCo. Noted the entry form “It continually exceeded plans and this trend looks to continue for the remainder of the year.”

Mondelez International Inc. is adding a new Oreo variety to the brand’s permanent lineup: Java Chip. The sandwich cookies feature coffee flavored crème with chocolate chips sandwiched between two chocolate wafers. Each two-cookie serving contains 140 calories less than 1 gram of protein and 13 grams of sugar.

Kellogg Co. expanded its Raisin Bran brand with new Kellogg’s Raisin Bran Toasted Oats and Honey. The cereal features bran flakes and raisins paired with whole grain toasted oats and a touch of honey. Each 1-cup serving contains 190 calories 5 grams of fiber 4 grams of protein and 13 grams of sugar.

“As a classic cereal staple we're always looking to innovate and deliver new experiences to our dedicated Kellogg's Raisin Bran fans” said Erin Storm senior marketing director of Kellogg All Family Cereal. “Just like the original cereal Kellogg's Raisin Bran Toasted Oats and Honey is a heart-healthy option and makes for an irresistible flavor combination — combining our signature bran flakes and juicy raisins with whole grain oats and a hint of honey.”

PepsiCo Inc.’s Frito-Lay business is debuting Cheetos Crunch Pop Mix which combines traditional Cheetos with Cheetos Popcorn. Each 1-cup serving contains 160 calories 1 grams of protein and 1 gram of sugar.

“2020 was a year unlike any other in that we saw the incredibly popular introduction of Cheetos Popcorn in January quickly followed by world-changing events that affected every industry differently” said Rachel Ferdinando senior vice president and chief marketing officer for Frito-Lay North America. “For our brands we saw trends like Cheetos recipe searches skyrocketing 190%. So now we’re thinking with that lens through everything we introduce to the world. Hopefully Cheetos Crunch Pop Mix can provide a small moment of joy and bring a few smiles this year.”

“The company was very forward-thinking in taking the restructuring steps early in the pandemic and then was able to exit in a much better financial position and have so much momentum going forward” said Tirnauer who took over from CPK’s interim CFO Carey Carrington last month.



“Right now we are catapulting ourselves forward as fast as we can at a time when other folks (are) going backwards because they’re facing challenges we’ve already gotten through as well as the (Covid-related) challenges that all of us in the industry are facing.” The Redondo Beach-based fast-casual restaurant chain filed for Chapter 11 protection on July 29 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas citing liquidity issues and state-mandated closure of indoor dining that represented about 78% of its net sales.



CPK’s creditors led by Sawtelle-based Crescent Capital Group agreed to convert more than half of the company’s debt into equity reducing its long-term obligations from approximately $403 million to $174 million. The deal also included $46.8 million in new financing to support ongoing operations.



“Once we get through the unknowns with Covid we’ve got a very reasonable capital structure for the size of our company and the go-forward profitability that … will really allow for the expansion” Tirnauer said. “Instead of using that money for interest we can use it for new store (openings) as well as new business development.”



Prior to the pandemic CPK had roughly 10000 employees 181 locations in 29 states and 36 franchised restaurants at airports in seven countries. It now operates 155 restaurants and has 7500 workers about 75% of whom are back at work.



“We anticipate on bringing the rest back as soon as we can get into more nor malized operating conditions” Tirnauer said.



The management team also renegotiated or canceled some leases generating about $70 million in savings. The move gave the company “a lot of near-term flexibility while the operating conditions are so up in the air” he added.



While the major portion of CPK’s revenue comes from its restaurants it also offers takeout and delivery and has a licensing agreement with Nestlé to distribute its pizzas to some 20000 supermarkets and wholesale clubs. The retail offerings may soon include other popular items from CPK’s menu such as salads or pasta dishes.



“We’ve got a very successful product and market share in what we do best — which is pizza — and we could leverage some of our other product categories through those channels which obviously is a revenue and profit generator and also serves to increase brand awareness” Tirnauer said.



“It’s probably too early to put a timeline on it because it obviously it takes time and resources and the availability of both of those is partially determined on how quickly the world gets back to some level of normalcy” he added.



The company posted $98.7 million in sales from August through November according to the documents it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.



CPK also partnered with Costa Rica-based Morpho Travel Retail to open two airport restaurants in Chile and Costa Rica. Other new franchises include restaurants in the Philippines and South Korea.



“International franchising takes time but then it becomes an annuity” Tirnauer said. “It’s worth the investment in time but you don’t get a big bang right away as opposed to opening your own restaurants where you get the sales and profitability from day one.”



Beverly Hills-based lawyers Rick Rosenfield and Larry Flax founded CPK in 1985. PepsiCo Inc. bought a controlling interest in the company in 1992 and five years later sold it to Buckmann Rosser Sherrill & Co. a New York-based private equity firm. In 2000 CPK went public and traded on Nasdaq. San Francisco-based Golden Gate Capital acquired the company in 2011 and had an 89% stake in the company before the bankruptcy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL210bi1kZXctcGFydG5lcnMtd2l0aC1idXJ0b24tc25vd2JvYXJkcy1vbi1vbmUtd29ybGQtdG8taGVscC1wcm9tb3RlLWEtbW9yZS1zdXN0YWluYWJsZS1mdXR1cmUtMzAxMTk5Nzc1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mtn Dew® Partners with Burton Snowboards on One World to Help Promote a More Sustainable Future,"PURCHASE N.Y.

What to know,"The first wave of coronavirus vaccinations is finally underway and with it comes a heap of questions. Are there different kinds of coronavirus vaccines and when might you get one? Before vaccines started being administered the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prioritized which groups should get the very first available doses of the COVID-19 vaccine (the agency continues to update its guidance). However states aren't required to follow the CDC's lead and some have already started bucking the federal agency's guidelines in favor of their own priority lists.

Regardless of who's first in line for a coronavirus vaccine more are on the way and with them more questions. Who will get those other vaccines and how soon can you expect to be protected against COVID-19?

With more than a dozen COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently in late-stage clinical trials and dozens more not too far behind it's now evident that not everyone in the world will get the same vaccine. Not only are there different manufacturers -- AstraZeneca Johnson & Johnson Norovax and so on -- but each vaccine is delivered and works a little differently from the others. Most COVID-19 vaccines come in the form of a shot but some are patches and others you can swallow as pills. The vast majority require at least two doses but a few are expected to provide effective immunity after just one.

That means it's possible some vaccines may be reserved for certain groups instead of others based on how the drugs act in the body or how they're delivered. For example some single-dose vaccines might better serve low population density rural communities whereas city dwellers and suburbanites who live closer to more health care providers may get vaccines that require subsequent ""booster"" doses.

The vast majority of coronavirus vaccines are still under development and the science continues to evolve so nothing is set in stone just yet. Here we paint in broad strokes a picture of what the coming vaccine landscape may look like. We'll continue to update this story as new information comes to light. This article is intended to be a general overview and not a source of medical advice.

Not all COVID-19 vaccines will need to be injected -- some can be delivered without a needle. Sarah Tew/CNET

Pfizer and Moderna are available now

What they are: Both Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines are mRNA or ""genetic"" vaccines an entirely new class of drugs that are unstable at room temperature and must be kept frozen until right before they're dispensed.

When they're coming: Both have been authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration and are currently being administered to priority individuals like health care workers as well as nursing home residents and staff.

Who they might be best for: So far nursing home staff and residents and front-line health care workers.

Refrigeration: Pfizer's vaccine requires long-term storage colder than Antarctica: minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit. It can then be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures of 35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit for up to five days. Moderna's needs temperatures that a commercial deep freezer could probably handle for long-term storage: minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit. It keeps at typical refrigerator temperatures (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) for 30 days.

Dosing: Both vaccines require an initial injection followed by a booster shot several weeks later.

The frist vaccines are being dispensed to priority groups like front-line health care workers and older adults. Sarah Tew/CNET

Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine could be next

What it is: Once the frontrunner in the race for a coronavirus vaccine the candidate developed by Oxford University and British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has run into a few snags along the way which have delayed its application for authorization.

When it's coming: The UK approved the vaccine just days before the start of 2021 but the FDA won't approve it in the US until clinical trials wrap up here possibly as soon as February or March.

Refrigeration: A standard refrigerator could handle it: 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit.

Dosing: Two doses originally intended to be spaced one month apart. Referring to unpublished results of the trial however regulators in the UK have authorized a three-month gap between doses saying the data supports that window as the more effective time scale.

Novavax shows promise and an advantage

What it is: The Novavax coronavirus vaccine is in late-stage clinical trials. Though it isn't on the road to approval yet this vaccine shows promise in its high efficacy and its stability in regular refrigeration conditions versus deep-freeze conditions. That could make it more practical for wider distribution.

When it's coming: Likely sometime in the first half of 2021.

Refrigeration: Standard refrigeration needs at 39 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit.

Dosing: Two doses spaced three weeks apart plus an adjuvant which is a second drug that helps the vaccine work better.

With several different coronavirus vaccines likely to be authorized in 2021 the next challenge will be figuring out which one's best for you. Sarah Tew/CNET

Needle-free vaccine delivery from Inovio

What it is: Instead of a syringe and needleInovio's unique system uses an electrical pulse to deliver the vaccine into the body where it can trigger an immune response.

When it's coming: Inovio just began midstage clinical trials in December so a summer 2021 release might be a realistic expectation if all goes well with the studies.

Who it might be best for: Children and adults with an intense fear of needles; people in developing areas where safe needle disposal is a challenge.

Refrigeration: Can be kept at room temperature.

Dosing: Two doses delivered with a patch four weeks apart.

There's no guarantee that any of the as-yet unauthorized vaccines listed above will be cleared by the FDA for emergency use nor do any of the timelines take into account the potential for future snags or delays. We'll update this article as new information surfaces and continue to add more vaccines to this list as it becomes clearer when other manufacturers might apply for authorization as well as which groups are likely to receive them.

Jewish News reported on Friday that the open letter signed by more than 70 British-Jewish doctors and published on Tuesday warns against falling for such conspiracy theories and states there is “absolutely no evidence” the Pfizer vaccine contains any non-kosher ingredients.The letter was initiated by Dr. Sam Freeman of the University College London Hospital who said he hoped at least 100 medical doctors would sign the letter by the end of the year.

The letter states that UK medical doctors ""feel obliged to address some rumors surrounding the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine circulating in the Jewish community. We do this as a public service in an attempt to prevent illness and potentially to save lives.“A rumor that the vaccine causes infertility is particularly prevalent in Jewish circles yet there is no evidence behind it"" the letter states.It added that “we live in a time when misinformation is increasingly common. Rumors spread quickly and social media has played a significant contribution in this. We urge people to stop spreading rumors and instead consult those working in healthcare with an ability to appraise scientific evidence.""According to the letter ""widespread uptake of the vaccine will prevent illness and lead to lives saved by protecting people from catching COVID-19 and prevent hospitals from becoming overburdened.”The letter warns that some people may not be suitable for the vaccine as a result of other conditions – while others may be able to take the UK-led vaccine that was ""jointly developed by Oxford University and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca which was approved on Wednesday.""The letter urges people to consider the benefits of having the vaccine against the risks that may come with it as the letter states that ""those aged over 80 years old for every 20 people who get COVID-19 at least one person will die.” Pfizer 's coronavirus vaccine was the first to receive approval for emergency use from both the FDA and the WHO and is currently in the process of being rolled out in the UK. In Israel over a million citizens have already received the first dose of Pfizer's vaccine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9nZXJtYW55cy1jb3ZpZC12YWNjaW5lLXByb2N1cmVtZW50LWxhYmVsZWQtYS1ncm9zcy1mYWlsdXJlL2EtNTYxMTUzMjLSAVtodHRwczovL2FtcC5kdy5jb20vZW4vZ2VybWFueXMtY292aWQtdmFjY2luZS1wcm9jdXJlbWVudC1sYWJlbGVkLWEtZ3Jvc3MtZmFpbHVyZS9hLTU2MTE1MzIy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,German vaccine procurement a 'gross failure',"The Berlin government is under increasing fire from experts and politicians for not buying enough doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer coronavirus vaccine to quickly roll out its immunization program.

Experts and politicians slammed the German government on Saturday for failing to ensure a sufficient supply of vaccine doses ahead of the country's coronavirus vaccination drive.

As a member of the EU vaccine procurement scheme Germany is reliant on regulators at the European level granting authorization of the vaccine to prevent COVID-19 infection.

But the EU has taken longer than countries like the UK US and Canada to give the go-ahead.

So far only the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine is permitted in EU member states but the block as a whole only made an order for 300 million doses during the summer in the belief that more vaccine alternatives would be available.

Frauke Zipp a neurologist and member of the advisory Leopoldina Academy of Sciences on Saturday slammed German lawmakers for their lack of foresight over vaccine procurement.

""I consider the current situation a gross failure"" she told Die Welt newspaper. ""Why didn't they order much more of the vaccine during the summer just to be safe?""

The BioNTech founders said on Friday that they were scrambling to boost production after being pressured to fill the gaps caused by the EU's blunder.

German Health Minister Jens Spahn has shrugged off any suggestion the government has been lackadaisical in its approach towards vaccinating the country. ""Things are going exactly as it was planned"" he told broadcaster RTL.

Spahn said he anticipated a shortfall at the beginning and that the government would have to ""prioritize"" who would be vaccinated but that all nursing home residents would receive the inoculation by the end of January.

Vaccination is a 'race against time'

Luxembourg's foreign minister Jean Asselborn defended the EU's vaccine strategy on German radio broadcaster RBB saying that the Commission had secured almost two billion doses with six different manufacturers.

However Karl Lauterbach health expert for the center-left Social Democrats told the Rheinische Post newspaper that the failure by Brussels to buy more of the Moderna vaccine was ""regrettable.""

""It was clear early on that the Moderna vaccine had a strong efficacy and could be used by GPs.""

Lauterbach thinks it's too late for the Moderna vaccine to play any major role in Germany's short-term vaccination needs. He also criticized the EU for not having ordered more BioNTech-Pfizer vaccines early on.

Bernd Riexinger co-chair of the socialist Left Party called on Health Minister Jens Spahn directly to ensure the further production of BioNTech-Pfizer jabs.

He said given the spread of the new COVID-19 variant in the UK ""a successful vaccine strategy is also a race against time.""

Lockdown must not end too early

Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to meet with state premiers on Tuesday to discuss a probable extension of the current lockdown — which is set to end on January 10.

Ahead of those talks Uwe Janssens president of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine called for the government to rethink its plans.

He told the Rheinischer Post that tough curbs should remain in place even if the government reaches its infection-rate goal of 50 per 100000 people.

""We intensive care physicians strongly advise that no relaxation should be considered until the incidence value is below 25 new infections per 100000 population per week"" Janssens said.

The current infection rate in Germany is 141.2 according to the Robert Koch Institute. However this number varies hugely across the country with some regions of Saxony recording rates of over 500.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdG9kYXkuaW4vc2NpZW5jZS92aWRlby9ob3ctY292aXNoaWVsZC1jb3ZheGluLXBmaXplci1zLWNvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmUtd29yay0xNzU1MTkzLTIwMjEtMDEtMDLSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL2FtcC9zY2llbmNlL3ZpZGVvL2hvdy1jb3Zpc2hpZWxkLWNvdmF4aW4tcGZpemVyLXMtY292aWQtdmFjY2luZS13b3JrLTE3NTUxOTMtMjAyMS0wMS0wMg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Covishield Covaxin & Pfizer's Covid vaccine work? - How Covishield Covaxin & Pfizer's Covid vaccine work? - India Today,The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation's Subject Expert Committee (SEC) has approved the Covishield vaccine against Covid-19 developed by the Serum Institute of India (SII) and AstraZeneca-Oxford University.

PG Tips has long been a household staple in Britain. Initially celebrated for its memorable advertising campaigns featuring its iconic monkeys and renowned comedians like Peter Sellers Bob Monkhouse and Johnny Vegas the tea brand gradually lost its resonance with modern audiences.

Around a decade ago it fell into severe neglect. The monkeys were retired the brand ambassadors appeared outdated and its parent company Unilever significantly reduced its advertising investments.

Today it’s back on TV screens for the first time in eight years with a new brand campaign aptly titled ‘It’s Not Just Tea. It’s Progress’. For its huge return PG Tips has enlisted legendary director Steve McQueen with Top Boy actor and acclaimed musician Ashley Walters in front of the camera to excite a nation of tea drinkers. It’s the brainchild of indie agency Calling which is making a name for itself by modernizing heritage brands.

“We separated the tea business from Unilever just under two years ago” explains Karen Owen global senior marketing executive at Lipton Teas and Infusions. “PG Tips hasn’t really been invested in for many many years. So we said no this is the nation’s tea. It is the nation’s favorite tea.”

‘Rock Solid’ which is the first ad in this new approach forms part of a £12m marketing push that aims to help PG Tips reclaim a place at the heart of modern British culture as well as connect with a younger demographic of tea drinkers.

Owen continues: “When you look at Gen Z culture there’s a real fear of burnout. They are not interested in coffee because that’s burnout culture; it’s pushing the problem down the road. They are much more about recovery and reconnecting with their self.”

It's an idea that Calling brought to the table in the formative chats with PG Tips. Owen says the initial storyboard had relatively few tweaks and the whole team was beyond excited. “The way we positioned it in our strategy is that tea is recovery not a drug” says Calling co-founder and executive creative director Josh Tenser. “And that felt like a massive unlock for the value system of those younger audiences. And then we were like OK so what is it about recovery that people might want to lean into?”

Tea tends to have lower caffeine levels than coffee. Tenser says that this thought process led them to having a cup of tea while reconnecting and having a conversation with themselves.

What transpired in a powerful 70-second film tells the story of overcoming self-doubt and finding inner courage. In the spot viewers watch as Walters coaches himself out of the doldrums over a cup of PG Tips before inviting the nation to summon their self-belief and positivity too.

Tenser continues: “We wanted to use talent that shows the world what a progressive modern Britain could be like and that’s why Ashley is so great. He’s had ups and downs in life they’re well publicized. He’s a hero to so many people because he isn’t perfect but he’s been very open about his mental health.”

The other aspect that makes Walters such a brilliant choice to bring PG Tips back to the nation is that he connects with many audiences the ones that remember him from his music career and the newer fans that know him from acting in Top Boy.

Tenser says they knew that if they were going to bring back this heritage brand they had to have someone equally iconic behind the camera and that person was Steve McQueen. The 12 Years A Slave director doesn’t do a lot of commercials but apparently this one didn’t take a lot of convincing.

“One of the first comments Steve made when he started talking with us was that tea is the lifeblood of the nation” recalls Owen. “He grew up with PG Tips and he said ‘You know what it’s really important that we write something together that is about creating moments of progress.’ So we showed him the draft storyboard that we had and he came up with some amazing additions.”

It wasn’t like working with a typical commercial director; everyone on the team thought about this as more of a film than an ad. Walters talking directly to the audience through the TV screen feels personal and refreshing.

“It was amazing to work with Steve; he’s a wizard” adds Tenser. “There was just such a deep level of respect between Ashley and Steve that it made the whole thing. They both felt totally invested in each other. A different director talent combo wouldn’t have given you that beautiful comfort that you could feel in the performance.”

The ad is an address to the nation in a way. Gone are the days of the dreary grey day being made slightly better by a cuppa this is people’s moment to take a moment of reflection with themselves rain or shine.

“It’s a real honor to be working with such an iconic British brand and be part of a campaign that encourages taking time out putting the kettle on taking a break and giving ourselves some time to re-calibrate” added Walters. “We’ve all grown up with tea being a big part of our lives marking every occasion from starting the day to a family celebration. For me enjoying a cuppa is a moment to pause re-gather re-energize focus and then press play.”

It’s a long-term play for the brand. Recently there’s been a further £40m investment in new machinery training and blends at its Trafford Park site in Manchester. Owen says aside from traditional media they will be launching this campaign across social platforms too which is a key area for reaching younger audiences that are invested in the rising wellness trends. She believes firmly that tea can play a role in that.

“We’re not looking for everything to be perfect and polished. We want to understand what matters. And that’s how we’ll see the campaign evolve” she concludes.

“We don’t know quite what’s going to happen next but what we do know is it’s going to be about progress. And Steve when I was with him last week he’s said ‘So what are we going to do next?’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhcnRhbnN3aXJlLnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9saXN0cy9saXN0LW9mLXNjaG9vbHMtbXN1LXRyYW5zZmVyLXBnLWFqLWhvZ2dhcmQtaXMtcmVwb3J0ZWRseS1jb25zaWRlcmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,List of schools MSU transfer PG AJ Hoggard is reportedly considering,"Former Michigan State point guard AJ Hoggard has reportedly cut the lists of schools he’s considering to only five programs.

ORLANDO — The Orlando Magic are heading to Game 7 after a strong 103-96 comeback win against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday night.

While Jalen Suggs Franz Wagner and Paolo Banchero grabbed credit for being the heads of the snake Anthony played his best minutes of the series so far in Game 6.

Anthony played a series-high 19 minutes some as the closing lineup point guard in the win and scored nine points while doing so.

""I've lost a lot of trust with my lack of play this season"" Anthony said postgame. ""It's been a tough year. But at the end of the day I'm just here to try to help this team win.""

Anthony has struggled to adjust to his full-time bench role this season but he still finds ways to be productive. He's averaged 11.6 points this year which is the worst mark in his four seasons with the Magic. But even with his role changing coach Jamahl Mosley recognizes his value.

“He’s had a pop about him he had an energy about him"" Mosley said postgame. ""I think he got himself going a little bit early. I thought he did a great job defensively staying with the game plan. I think those are the things you look at throughout the game. I thought he did a tremendous job.”

Now with the team going to Game 7 Anthony's confidence is where it needs to be as he helps his team in the biggest game of the season — again.

Is He in Jail? Update,"A newly-wed couple met with a disastrous ending when the husband shot the wife while she was sleeping. To this day the motive behind Amanda Schmitt’s murder is not known and John Grazioli has not spoken a word in that context. Amanda was a beautiful person inside-out for her friends and family who were utterly devastated at her loss. Investigation Discovery’s ‘American Monster’ picked up the tragic tale and retold it in an episode titled ‘Too Good to be True.’ If you are curious to know what happened to Grazioli we have you covered.

Who Is John Grazioli?

John Grazioli grew up in Kersey Elk County and had once studied to become a Roman Catholic priest but he deviated his path towards a career in finance. He obtained a Master’s degree in Public Administration Finance from Gannon University in 1999 according to his LinkedIn Page. He eventually opened a financial management firm in 2017 and boasted about how he had managed a portfolio of $1.4 billion in assets. Grazioli had had no previous disciplinary records. He was a registered investment adviser for PNC Financial Services where he had been an employee since December 2009 as per the SEC records.

However John made headlines when he killed his wife Amanda. According to evidence presented at his trial Grazioli had also admitted to some family members about his on-going pursuits to divorce Amanda Grazioli. But he was simultaneously planning a vacation in the summer with Amanda and her family. The evidence further showed that he had also been looking for an opportunity to indulge in an extramarital affair on a mobile phone app. Additionally he had written Amanda out of his will in January 2018.

The day he shot Amanda he not only confessed his crime to his ex-wife but he had also told a Catholic priest at a church that he had killed his wife. The priest then implored him to inform the police but the priest was the one to dial 911. The police dispatched to the scene then surrounded the church and the neighboring area to contain Grazioli. He was arrested and then charged with the homicide of his wife along with aggravated assault and possession of an unlicensed weapon.

Where Is John Grazioli Now?

Chief Deputy District Attorney Erin Connelly during Grazioli’s trial accused Grzioli of having a “cold and calculated plan” to kill his 31-year-old wife of a few months. A toxicology report entailed that Amanda’s blood contained compounds suggesting the intake of marijuana right before the shooting. The reports also showed traces of cocaine and alcohol which had been used quite recently before her death. Erica Grazioli John’s former wife testified during his trial and mentioned that John had told her about his intentions to divorce Amanda. In an email dated February 2018 he said “I am getting her out of our lives. Please please keep this a secret until I serve her Tuesday.”

In another email a day before the shooting he wrote that he was looking to resolve everything soon. Judge Dan McCaffery noted that Grazioli had also left a box containing his will and letters to his children. There was also a letter addressed to the police with instructions about taking care of his dogs. During his trial Grazioli said that the gun he shot his wife with was a birthday gift for her. Amanda’s birthday was almost a month away from the day she was killed. Grazioli’s attorney tried to mount a defense on Grazioli’s claim that he was intoxicated.

To this Judge Brabender told Grazioli that no one was going to believe Grazioli’s story. Moreover the police officers who arrested Grazioli testified that he had not been intoxicated to the extent that would lead him to kill his wife. Plus he had also written a suicide note where he mentioned that he had killed Amanda and he was going to kill himself. Brabender also included Grazioli’s texts to his ex-wife and his confession to the priest as evidence against Grazioli’s intoxication claim. Grazioli refused to reveal the motive for shooting his wife.

In April 2019 John Grazioli was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole by Erie County Judge Daniel Brabender. Judge Brabender announced the sentence right after Grazioli turned down the last opportunity given by the judge to “come clean” and disclose his motive behind shooting his wife. Grazioli was convicted of the first-degree murder of his wife Amanda Grazioli only a few months after their wedding. He is currently serving his sentence at the State Correctional Institution at Rockview Pennsylvania.

With no long-term debt on its books MTN Uganda has borrowed $114m (Shs385.8 billion) from four local banks in Uganda. This is the third largest corporate finance facility arranged by local banks in Uganda’s history.

The money according to MTN is meant for further expansion of data network construction of their head office on Jinja Road and upgrade of their IT systems.

Two of Uganda’s largest banks Stanbic Bank and Standard Chartered Bank provided the syndicated loan together with Barclays Bank and Citi Bank. A syndicated loan is one that involves a group of lenders (called the syndicate) who pool their lending resources to make a loan.

“We intend to invest Shs238 billion in 2016 and Shs299 billion in 2017 in Uganda for further expansion. We cannot do that without funding from various sources” Mr Brian Gouldie the CEO MTN Uganda told Daily Monitor on the sidelines of the signing ceremony yesterday.

Mr Gouldie further pointed out that investment would improve the quality of service to MTN Uganda customers.

This is the second time MTN Uganda which is Uganda’s largest telecommunication corporation with annual revenues in excess of Shs1.2 trillion is securing a syndicated loan from banks. In 2009 a mix of local and international banks lent MTN Uganda $100m (Shs338.4 billion) meant for expansion.

According to Mr David Blackburn the chief financial officer MTN Uganda the company has long paid off that loan in full.

Mr Glen Ssekabira the deputy executive director Supervision Bank of Uganda (BoU) told reporters that syndicated loans help the banks share the risks associated with lending large corporations.

“MTN Uganda could have gone elsewhere outside the country to get the money. Instead they used local banks and in the unlikely event that MTN Uganda defaults the banks can share the risk” he says.

He also noted that this was an indicator that Uganda’s banking sector had the capacity to finance – to some extent – several projects if they worked together more closely.

Ugandan banks are estimated to have the capacity of financing a single project to a tune of no more than $200m (Shs676.9 billion).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL2J1c2luZXNzL21hcmtldHMvbmljLWludGVuZHMtdG8tY3Jvc3MtbGlzdC1zaGFyZXMtb24tbmFpcm9iaS1zdG9jay1leGNoYW5nZS0tMTU3NjQwMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NIC intends to cross list shares on Nairobi Stock Exchange,"Kampala.

National Insurance Corporation Limited (NIC) plans to float its shares at the Nairobi Securities exchange for the first time as a means of improving the value of individual shares.

NIC will become the second Ugandan firm to cross-list on the Nairobi bourse after UMEME a power utility was cross-listed last year.

The move to cross-list on the Nairobi bourse was announced by the board of directors during the 13th Annual General Meeting of shareholders held on Friday in Kampala.

“We are going to start on the approval process of the various bodies in Uganda and Kenya said Mr Bayo Folayan the managing director of Nic.

Mr Bayo said the insurance company will widen that market for its shares thus increased demand.



“Cross-listing of the shares will lead to better visibility improved competitive edge in the regional markets increased share liquidity better price discovery access to a wider pool of both sophisticated and retail investors and better prospects of raising capital” said Dr Martin Aliker the vice chairman to the Board of Directors as he explained the intention to cross-list to the shareholders.



The insurance giant intends to have its name changed from National Insurance Corporation Limited to NIC Holdings Limited.

“We are changing the name of the company in order to separate the life and none life businesses” said Mr Bayo.

He added that the change of name is in line with Insurance law which was amended in 2011. The law states that the life and general business should be separated into two different bodies. The deadline for all insurance companies is December this year.

The shareholders also unanimously approved the issuing of 819661942 new shares worth Shs20 491548550 at the current market price as bonus shares to shareholders who were on the register of Shareholders on June 20 2014.

The bonus shares shall be selected in the ratio of 11 new shares for every eight shares held by the shareholders respectively on that day and such new shares shall rank pari passu (at the same rate) for all purposes with existing issued shares of the company.

WATERFORD — It was like a scene from that TV classic “The Andy Griffith Show.” Since the early 1960s folks made their way over to Glenn Collins’ barbershop not just for haircuts but to socialize with neighbors and to catch up on the latest news.

Collins turned his small red-colored shop at 306 E. Main St. into a favorite local hangout that resembled the fictional Floyd’s Barbershop of “Andy Griffith” fame.

Norm Nelson recalls getting his first haircut there as a child. Forty years later Nelson has never gone to any barber other than Collins who greeted customers with a relaxing atmosphere and a warm smile.

“He was more than just a barber” Nelson said. “He was a really good friend.”

After nearly six decades as a Waterford business owner and civic-minded citizen Glenn Collins died Dec. 18 at age 83 of complications from COVID-19.

Family members say Collins had no serious health problems previously and he had taken precautions to avoid COVID-19. But he got sick shortly before Thanksgiving and soon landed in the hospital.

“It just happened so fast” said his wife Shirley Collins. “I don’t know what we could’ve done differently.”

Loved Waterford and its people

Born in South Dakota in 1937 Glenn Collins grew up in the central Wisconsin village of Westfield. Two years after graduating from Westfield High School he married Shirley his high school sweetheart.

Collins then graduated from barber school. When he and Shirley learned that a vacant barbershop was for sale in Downtown Waterford they purchased it in 1962 and resettled in the small Racine County community.

“He loved the people” his wife said. “He loved the town.”

Glenn Collins barbershop in Waterford Located at 306 E. Main St. in downtown Waterford Glenn Collins' barbershop opened in 1962 and became a favorite local spot for socializing an…

The couple raised two sons and a daughter in Waterford.

Working days in Oak Creek at manufacturer PPG Industries Inc. Collins operated his barbershop as a side gig. When he retired from PPG in 1999 he was able to fully enjoy his shop at 306 E. Main St.

He filled the place with collectibles and memorabilia much of it reflecting his passion for his favorite baseball team: the Philadelphia Phillies.

Collins coached his sons in Little League Baseball. He also was active in his church the Lions Club and local government serving two terms on the Waterford Village Board.

His son Mark Collins remembers his father as an honest person who cared about others. Mark often watched his father give free haircuts and visit nursing homes to offer haircuts to the elderly residents.

“He liked everybody” Mark Collins said “and everybody liked him.”

Waterford Village President Don Houston said the barbershop grew into a local institution. On many days crowds of people could be seen huddled inside talking and laughing.

“It’s kind of part of Waterford” Houston said. “It’s always — you just expect it to be there.”

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit last spring Collins closed up shop temporarily in compliance with state safeguards aimed at controlling the virus. When he reopened a couple of months later he disinfected the business regularly and insisted on customers wearing face masks.

In his spare time he enjoyed swimming and exercising and staying in shape.

A quick downturn for a good man’

A few days before Thanksgiving Collins began experiencing sinus trouble. The next day he tested positive for COVID-19 and doctors instructed him to stay in bed and rest.

His symptoms worsened and he was admitted to a hospital Dec. 3 with COVID-related pneumonia.

His family praised the efforts of doctors and nurses at Waukesha Memorial Hospital in Waukesha. Still they struggle with how quickly a healthy man even in his 80s succumbed to the upper respiratory virus.

“It’s like a bad dream” his son said. “You wake up every morning and ask ‘Did this really happen?’”

Collins’ family is uncertain what will happen to the old barbershop. They are planning a memorial service and a celebration of his life once the COVID-19 pandemic has eased and public gatherings are safe again.

Shirley Collins said many people in the community have expressed a desire to pay tribute to her husband.",,,,,,,,,

The high taxes instituted on Savings and Credit Corporative Associations and micro lenders continue to hinder financial inclusion according to the Stromme Microfinance chief executive officer.

Speaking at celebrations to mark 25 years of operations in Uganda Mr Paul Katende the Stromme Microfinance chief executive officer said government has failed to appreciate the role of micro lending in boosting financial inclusion given the heavy taxes instituted on Saccos and microfinance institutions.



“We are heavily taxed. We are regarded as just mere companies in a country that are making profits” he said noting government should put in place deliberate policies that uplift micro lending institutions.

In 2016 government dropped taxes on Saccos and other micro lending institutions but were later reinstated with a requirement that Saccos will be charged income tax of 30 per cent on their net profits

Mr Katende said Saccos and micro lending institutions extend financial services to the poor which helps to cover a large gap of the unbanked as well as help extend credit through which businesses and households have been uplifted.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion.

Donald Trump made a transparently racist appeal to the so-called suburban housewives of America warning that liberals were plotting to “abolish the suburbs” by flooding their neighborhoods with low-income housing and Black Lives Matter protests. And while Joe Biden acknowledged the increasing diversity of American suburbia his campaign continued the decades-long centrist Democratic project of crafting electoral appeals and calibrating policy positions toward moderate upper-income voters. The obsession with upper-income white suburban professionals provides myopic understandings of the past and flawed lessons for the future. In 2010 the US Census revealed that for the first time a majority of African Americans Asian Americans and Latinos in America’s one hundred largest metropolitan regions resided in suburban areas and not in central cities. More than half of all poor people and of first- and second-generation immigrants in these major metropolitan regions also lived in the census-designated suburbs where fewer than one-fourth of households conformed to the mythical suburban ideal of a married couple with children under the age of eighteen. Suburbs today are more working-class and more diverse than ever before. But it is not clear that the Democratic Party establishment including the incoming Biden administration is ready or willing to embrace the suburban electorate on its own terms.

The Roots of the Affluent Suburban Strategy The Democratic Party’s suburban strategy of chasing affluent white-collar professionals and simultaneously marginalizing its traditional working-class base has deep roots in the racial upheavals and economic crises of the 1960s and 1970s. During the intraparty warfare of the 1980s a faction of professional-class politicians labeled the “Atari Democrats” argued that embracing high-tech corporations and suburban knowledge workers represented the best path forward to a prosperous future and an electoral realignment. In the aftermath of the 1988 election when George H. W. Bush defeated the technocrat Michael Dukakis the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) the self-styled centrist outfit of professional class Democrats commissioned political scientists William Galston and Elaine Kamarck to draft a postmortem. The resulting document titled the “Politics of Evasion” insisted that the party needed to fashion its appeals to middle-income white voters in the suburban Midwest and affluent white professionals in the high-tech suburban Sunbelt. It was a direct repudiation of the multiracial working-class “Rainbow Coalition” strategy of Jesse Jackson in his 1984 and 1988 presidential bids which sought to mobilize the “desperate the damned the disinherited and the despised.” Jackson responded that the DLC which he dismissed as the “Democrats of the Leisure Class” was seeking to “suburbanize the Democratic party.” He was quite right. The “Politics of Evasion” shaped the DLC’s centrist agenda in the 1990s most notably Bill Clinton’s approach to the white suburban electorate and his “Third Way” rejection of a progressive policy agenda especially after the Republican takeover of Congress in the 1994 midterms. During his 1996 reelection campaign Clinton elevated America’s “soccer moms” — imagined as affluent college-educated white married suburbanites — as the archetypal swing voter and captured 53 percent of the suburban female vote. During the nadir of the George W. Bush administration the Democratic Party’s quest for dominance in the white suburbs seemed hopelessly adrift. But in 2008 Barack Obama captured 51 percent of the diversifying suburban electorate during a severe recession by promising progressive economic policies that “invest in our middle class.” Obama proved able to thread the needle electorally galvanizing record turnout among African American and young voters while also making inroads in the white suburban swing districts of new battleground states such as Virginia and Colorado. In 2016 Donald Trump’s racist campaign and shocking victory convinced many mainstream Democrats that their path back to power required writing off white workers and rural America in favor of rebuilding the unstable coalition of white college-educated suburban professionals and reliably Democratic nonwhite voters. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer famously argued that the party could regain control of Midwestern battlegrounds by targeting moderate Republicans in the white-collar suburbs rather than trying to win back blue-collar white voters in places such as Western Pennsylvania. Leading Democratic strategists termed this the “Panera Bread” strategy a blueprint for retaking Congress in 2018 and the presidency in 2020 by focusing on moderate and conservative white suburbanites across the nation who were alienated by the rhetoric and character of Donald Trump. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s “Red to Blue” initiative intervened in the primaries in a number of suburban districts to thwart progressive challengers helping to bring moderate Democrats such as Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia into the US House of Representatives. These centrist suburban politicians have urged the party to reject the progressive left and double down on its white-collar suburban strategy. But it is becoming increasingly clear that this is a strategic cul-de-sac with fewer and fewer moderate Republicans left to convert — and a misguided path for anyone invested in a progressive policy agenda.

The Dangers of Courting Moderate Suburbanites In the lead-up to the 2018 midterms we argued in an op-ed in the New York Times: “Democrats cannot cater to white swing voters in affluent suburbs and also promote policies that fundamentally challenge income inequality exclusionary zoning housing segregation school inequality police brutality and mass incarceration.” The relentless pursuit of moderate white suburbanites is at once a symptom and cause of the Democratic Party’s unwillingness to fight for a working-class agenda. These warnings are even more critical two years later as the United States confronts an interlocking set of social economic and political crises that are rooted in both the bipartisan policymaking of recent decades and the inept and reactionary leadership of the Trump administration. Immediately following the 2020 election a coalition of progressive groups issued the “Memo to Interested Parties  ” which laid out the electoral drawbacks in stark terms. The groups warned of the risks of alienating grassroots organizations of color and other progressive activists that have spent the last four years mobilizing the party’s “core base of support: young people Black Brown working class and social movements.” The relentless pursuit of moderate white suburbanites is at once a symptom and cause of the Democratic Party’s unwillingness to fight for a working-class agenda that attacks economic inequality systemic racism and the global climate crisis by guaranteeing quality housing health care and employment; freedom from police brutality and the carceral system; and enacting a Green New Deal. This moment plainly calls for the Democratic Party to stop viewing economic redistribution and far-reaching criminal justice reform as political liabilities and instead to understand that tackling entrenched problems of economic and racial inequality offers an alternative way to mobilize the American electorate including the diverse working-class populations that live in suburbs and metropolitan regions. The Democratic breakthrough in Georgia in the 2020 election offers a case in point. The Biden-Harris campaign won Georgia because the voter registration drives led by Stacey Abrams’s New Georgia Project helped to mobilize a multiracial electorate regardless of where they lived. While some moderate white professionals and typically Republican suburbanites did vote for the Democratic presidential ticket it is a profound mistake to equate the suburban counties north of Atlanta with the demographic category of the white college-educated professional vote. Joe Biden won 56.3 percent of the vote in Cobb County and 58.4 percent in nearby Gwinnett County both of which were overwhelmingly white and Republican strongholds as recently as a quarter-century ago. Today Cobb County is less than two-thirds white and Lucy McBath an African-American progressive activist easily won reelection in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District which includes parts of Cobb and two other suburban counties. Gwinnett is now a majority-minority suburban county (30 percent African American 22 percent Latino 13 percent Asian) and in 2020 a progressive white Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux flipped the Seventh Congressional District thanks in large part to the multiracial get-out-the-vote efforts of progressive organizations. In Arizona the Biden-Harris victory in the 2020 election also depended upon grassroots progressive organizations targeting a multiracial increasingly working-class electorate in new battleground areas. Maricopa County once gave Ronald Reagan more than 70 percent of its vote and Trump carried it by a 3.5 percent margin in 2016 leading the Democratic establishment to treat it as hopeless in presidential contests. Groups such as the Latino-oriented Living United for Change in Arizona (LUCHA) however mobilized working-class families in Maricopa where the population is now almost one-third Hispanic through an agenda of economic and racial justice. Biden narrowly won the suburban county. At the same time there is ample evidence that the Democratic Party’s prioritization of affluent white suburbanites actively undercuts a progressive policy agenda. It is extremely optimistic to expect a meaningful number of affluent white suburbanites to accept such priorities even if more of them have been reading White Fragility and throwing out terms like “institutional racism.” Despite the conventional wisdom about hyper-partisan polarization many affluent white suburbanites are still inclined to split their tickets and vote for Republicans in down-ballot elections. This is true even in very “blue” states such as Massachusetts Maryland and Vermont where a significant subset of white college-educated voters who are reliably Democratic in presidential contests prefer moderate Republican governors that support fiscal conservatism and cultural tolerance. It therefore should not be surprising that a sizable number of the moderate and generally Republican suburbanites who rejected the extremism and incompetence of Trumpism on the presidential ticket simultaneously voted for GOP candidates and divided government in congressional races and in contests at the state level. Even in California where Trump received barely one-third of the vote the majority of the statewide electorate along with the majority in blue-trending suburban areas such as Orange County handily rejected ballot initiatives aimed at increasing corporate taxes to fund social welfare programs restoring affirmative action in higher education and public employment and curtailing Uber’s and Lyft’s assault on workers’ rights.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL2J1c2luZXNzL2NvbW1vZGl0aWVzL25pbGUtYnJld2VyaWVzLXVudmVpbHMtbmV3LWxvb2stMTY2NDQ0ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nile Breweries unveils new look | Monitor,"Kampala.

Beer company Nile Breweries Limited (NBL) has launched a new corporate identity which it says is meant to align it to changing consumer needs and tastes.

While unveiling the new company outlook on Monday Mr Greg Metcalf the NBL managing director said since 1951 when the company was established it has been using a roaring lion as its logo which is old yet times and customers have changed.

“Sometime in 2008 when I was attending a business function I told some consumer that our brewery is in Jinja and he described it as a rural brewery because he thought this company is small yet today it is a dominant player in the beer industry” he said.

He added that as the leading company in innovations in the industry there was need to change the company corporate identity to reflect its corporate vision and show the consumers and other players in the industry that this is a progressive company.

According to Mr Onapito Ekomoloit the NBL director corporate affairs research conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organisation in areas where they draw their raw materials especially sorghum shows that farmers in those areas have a better standard of living compared to the rest of the farmers because of steady incomes they earn from growing the raw materials.

“This is true for farmers from Teso Bugiri and Tororo where we grow our sorghum where their incomes have steadily risen because of supplying us sorghum” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL2J1c2luZXNzL2luc3VyYW5jZS9pbnN1cmVycy1yZWplY3QtbmV3LWxldnktMTU1MjEzONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Insurers reject new levy | Monitor,"Players in the insurance industry have demanded for the adoption of a progressive funding model for the proposed Policy Holders’ Compensation Fund arguing that starting with a big levy could negatively affect the industry.

Insurers who were attending an Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) consensus building workshop unanimously said a high levy rate will make insurance policies very expensive for consumers something that may work against the industry.

IRA the regulatory body of the insurance sector had proposed that all insurers and policyholders contribute 0.25 per cent each of the paid insurance policy premiums to the board that will be instituted and given powers to manage and administer the Fund’s resources.

Players who attended a consultative meeting on the draft legislation on the policyholders’ Fund unanimously advised that it would be better if the levy is lower and increased progressively saying buyers of insurance products are already paying the training levy and stamp duty which have slightly increased the charges for insurance policies.

Ms Evelyn Nkalubo Muwemba the IRA director of legal and compliance promised to revisit the rate but added that players should be mindful that lower contributions might slowdown accumulation of monies in the Fund.

She added that clear regulations will also be put in place to state how the Fund finances should be invested.

Additionally expense guidelines should be established so that the Fund is not depleted.

The establishment of the Fund which is provided for in the Insurance Amendment Act 2011 seeks to provide a safety net for policyholders to protect policyholders’ interests by helping in the settlement of clients’ claims in case individual insurance companies fail to pay.

There were several claims in the past of insurance companies failing to pay their clients’ claims something that worked against the industry’s reputation.

When operational

Regulations on the Policy Holders’ Compensation Fund are expected to be finalised by December this year with an aim of having it operational by January next year according to IRA chief executive officer Mr Ibrahim Kaddunabbi Lubega.

If finalised Mr Kaddunabbi added the Policy Holders’ Compensation Fund would help enhance protection of policyholders minimise the risk of moral hazards and provide certainty on the level of compensation when an insurer becomes insolvent.",,,,,,

The purpose of these publications is to explain the principles techniques and methodologies used by the financial supervisors to monitor authorised persons and entities bringing to light the scope approach/es interlinkages and complexities of carrying out supervisory and enforcement work.

The ultimate aim is that of informing stakeholders on what financial supervision means and how through their work MFSA officials aim at achieving the common good specifically by protecting consumers of financial services and safeguarding systemic stability and the integrity of financial markets.

Thematically financial supervision falls under four main areas: micro-prudential supervision which looks into the soundness of individual financial institutions; macro-prudential supervision focusing on threats to the system as a whole; conduct supervision monitoring the way financial services are provided to customers; and the supervision of the integrity of the financial system which includes the prevention of financial crime mainly in the form of fraud money laundering the financing of terrorism and financial market abuse.

Effective supervision is not a static process but involves continually striving for improvement efficiency and effectiveness and responding to new challenges.

It is a process whereby risks to the safety and soundness of a financial institution including operational prudential conduct and financial crime risks are properly identified through desk-based analytical reviews and inspections and analysed with the aim of detecting failures and weaknesses in the system.

Effective supervision is not a static process but involves continually striving for improvement efficiency and effectiveness and responding to new challenges

Regulatory action which is proportionate and dissuasive ranging from requests for remediation plans to the cancellation of licences depending on the severity of the case is then taken to address these weaknesses. Financial supervision also involves understanding changes and developments in financial services such as in the field of technology (fintech) and climate change and the associated regulatory risks and proactively adapting the approach to financial supervision accordingly.

Looking back on 2020 it has been another eventful year with measures being imposed by supervisors national and supranational alike inter alia to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the exit of the UK from the EU. During this year financial supervision has been strengthened in line with Moneyval’s recommendations. The authority carried out over 380 inspections a significant increase from previous years.

The MFSA has published its supervision priorities document which sets out where we are going to focus our supervisory engagement in 2021.

Five cross-sectoral priorities have been identified for 2021 namely: corporate governance and culture; financial crime compliance; the impact of COVID-19; ICT risk and cybersecurity; and fintech and innovation. Building on these cross-sectoral priorities sector-specific areas of focus have also been identified. The document also highlights the MFSA’s risk-based approach to supervision which seeks to ensure the efficacy and effectiveness of supervisory engagement together with select key initiatives that may impact stakeholders.

In 2021 the MFSA will continue implementing its Strategic Plan 2019 – 2021 and start setting the tone for the next strategic period (2022-2024). We will seek to reinforce the industry’s compliance culture and lay the foundation for an outcomes-based approach to supervision.

Participation in the policy discussions taking place at EU and national level will continue being a priority; particularly sustainable finance digital finance and the upcoming EU AMLCFT framework all of which will broaden the duties of financial supervisors and add more layers to the complex nature and art of financial supervision.

The speculation on how the two will play into the performance of businesses continues to indicate a negative outlook. During the year however there was another development which partly reflects a tough business environment and businesses simply failing to stand the test of time.

Oil company layoffs

Oil companies made news this year when all the three operators China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) Total and Tullow laid off workers. The timing of the layoffs was mainly contributed by two factors: the falling global oil prices and limited activity at the various oil fields. Global oil prices continued dropping in 2015 and by mid-December the prices had hit a low last seen 11 years ago. With low global oil prices at least Tullow noted it had to downsize. In fact the oil company laid-off in excess of 100 employers this year.

Interestingly Total E&P’s first exit was the general manager who had only been in Uganda for six months. He left partly because he was expected to lead the company into oil production but Total is yet to receive oil production licences. About 30 plus staff mainly field operators who had completed their tasks at the exploration phase were laid off during the year.

CNOOC also laid off an “undisclosed” number of staff members during the year.

The government had revealed that by the end of 2015 licences would be issued.

Russian firm named preferred bidder for oil refinery

A consortium led by a Russian firm RT Global Resources was picked as the preferred bidder for the construction of the $3b oil refinery. The firm was picked ahead of a consortium led by South Korea’s SK Energy. The ministry of Energy together with an independent consultant is still negotiating with RT Global Resources on the financial model for the oil refinery. The initial plan by the government is for the preferred bidder to take at least 60 per cent share of the refinery. The other 40 per cent is for the Uganda government and other East African countries. Again the government had made some commitment that this deal would be concluded by the end of 2015. The government’s insistence on an oil refinery is because it is believed to create more value and returns for the country.

Vodafone makes entry Africell lays-off 56

Vodafone in February 2015 officially launched its voice and data services in the country becoming the sixth player in the telecommunications market. The entry of Vodafone came at a time when the market was dominated by two players MTN and Airtel. At the time Tage Rasmussen the acting chief executive officer told Daily Monitor that “Vodafone doesn’t run away in any of the countries we operate. We are always in this for the long haul. The investors may change but the Vodafone brand will always exist.”

Vodafone uses the “0723” says it is focusing on the provision of internet packages. Recently they have been marketing their voice service with a tariff as low as Shs3 per second.

As Vodafone was making its entry with relative ease Africell was restructuring the business it acquired from Orange. Africell had acquired Orange in November 2014 and by March 2015 they opted to lay-off at least 56 people in the company. The company issued termination letters to 59 members of staff in a move it then described as one that would allocate “proper resources into improving operational activities.”

Despite the outcry from the laid-off staff Mohammad Ghaddar the chief operating officer Africell Uganda said Orange wanted out because it could not sustain the repeated losses.

Kenyatta’s Brookside acquires Fresh Diary

In April 2015 East Africa’s largest milk producers acquired Sameer Agriculture Livestock Limited (SALL) the makers of Fresh Diary and Daima at Shs3.2b. SALL which came onto the Uganda scene during the privatisation era of the 1990’s had only just secured a 40-year lease from the Uganda Government when it eventually ceded its rights to the Kenyatta family business Brookside.

Prudential acquires Goldstar Assurance

Businessman Sudhir Ruperelia cashed in on a business transaction with one of the largest insurance companies Prudential PLC.

Fare-thee-well Kyayonka

In May 2015 one of Uganda’s finest executives passed on. Ivan Kyayonka was at the time the chairman National Social Security Fund (NSSF) when he suffered a stroke and died. He had been board chairman of NSSF for three years and is known for his astute business mind which in part was seen when the Fund acquired shares in power distributor Umeme. He is however best known for his 31 years at fuel company Shell (now Vivo Energy).

UTL swims closer to the sharks

Uganda Telecom survived having its licence withdrawn by the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) after its financials indicated that the business may not be sustainable going forward. In five-page document issued by the UCC the regulator highlighted six areas where UTL was falling short of requirements. The largest concern was that its Shs366b liability outstripping its total asset base of Shs220b. The largest liability is a Shs160b debt.

“The commission reviewed the UTL’s external audit reports for the period 2011-2013 and noted with concern that UTL is consistently making losses and is on the brink of financial collapse” read the notice in part in April 2015. In July 2015 an emergency meeting by the largest shareholder in the company LAP Green Libyan government officials President Yoweri Museveni and ministry of finance officials agreed on a rescue plan for the telecom. The shareholders approved cash injection of about $65m (Shs217b) by the end of September 2015.

Airport upgrade begins BA exits as Etihad launches flights

A $200m (Shs700b) upgrade of Entebbe Airport started in August 2015; eight months after the Civil Aviation Authority unveiled a National Civil Aviation Master plan. The first phase of the upgrade is the expansion of the cargo centre at the airport. The expansion project is being financed using a loan from the Chinese government through their Export and Import bank (EXIM). Construction of a new passenger terminal is expected to start in 2016.

But even as Entebbe Airport is expanded one of the longest serving airlines in Uganda British Airways (BA) exited the market in September 2015. 24 years later BA decided to halt the Uganda route after failure to turn it into a profit making venture.

“Unfortunately we have concluded that at the present time our services to Entebbe are not commercially viable” BA said in a statement at the time.

Prior BA’s exit announcement United Arab Emirates (UAE) national carrier Etihad Airways launched flights into Uganda in May 2015. Etihad Airways launched four times a week flights connecting people to its hub in Abu Dhabi the capital of UAE.

Imperial Bank put on sale

In October 2015 Imperial Bank Uganda was put on sale by Bank of Uganda after its largest shareholder Imperial Bank of Kenya was closed over questionable business dealings. 2015 has not seen any bank closures in Uganda but Imperial Bank’s problems in its home market Kenya nearly offered the country another closure.

Mutebile gets fifth term

As the iconic company turns 100 what lies ahead?,"The iconic Pep Boys chain founded in Philadelphia will turn 100 next year. Its latest owner billionaire corporate raider owner Carl Icahn is facing turbulent financial times. Read more

The New Year marks 100 years since a group of World War I veterans opened the first Pep Boys at 63rd and Market Streets where Philadelphia’s suburbs began.

Its stores and garages festooned with statues and cartoons of founders Manny Moe and Jack sell car parts mount tires and change oil for an auto-dependent nation. Its block-long headquarters and warehouse at 3111 W. Allegheny Ave. is a city landmark.

But where is it bound?

Corporate raider Carl Icahn who has owned Pep Boys since 2016 turns 85 in February. He has been selling off businesses including Federal-Mogul the big car-parts maker Icahn once said fit so well with his part stores and repair shops.

Last month S&P cut its credit rating of his holding company Icahn Enterprises to BB (a “speculative” or junk rating) requiring higher interest payments to support Icahn-style borrowing. The rating firm’s analysts noted that too many of Icahn’s businesses including Icahn Automotive which combines Pep Boys and smaller auto chains were losing money.

Well before the S&P downgrade Icahn folded Pep Boys and three other companies (including Horsham-based Aamco Total Auto Care the transmissions chain) into Icahn Automotive Group — before cutting that into two new companies separating the stores from the garages.

Sales for the 2000-store Icahn auto group including Pep Boys’ 1000 stores fell to $660 million last quarter from $744 million a year earlier. Most of the drop was due to store closings group chief financial officer Sung Cho told investors in an October conference call.

And Icahn recently sold Pep Boys’ Allegheny Avenue headquarters though for now it is leasing back some of it. Spokeswoman Arianna Sherlock would not say how much space it has leased or say for how long. Nor would she say how many of the 500 jobs at the headquarters when Icahn bought Pep Boys were still based there.

Sherlock said the billionaire Icahn was still putting money into Pep Boys investing in technology to permit customers to order parts online or to book car repairs that way. too.

“We remain committed to the Philadelphia area” which still “has one of the densest Pep Boys store-footprints in the country” she said.

“We look forward to the company celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2021 as a Philadelphia-based business” said Kevin Lessard spokesman for the city Commerce Department with a hopeful tone. He acknowledged that city officials haven’t met with Pep Boys executives since 2018.

When Icahn paid just more than $1 billion for Pep Boys to outbid tire giant Bridgestone-Firestone four years ago city leaders were upbeat. They hoped they could not just hold on to the company’s main office but also even gain jobs.

They saw Icahn’s purchase as a step to reverse the exodus that has turned Philadelphia once a center of American manufacturing finance and energy companies into just another branch town with less than its share of corporate headquarters and the jobs taxes and charity they provide.

Japanese-owned Bridgestone-Firestone was expected to run Pep Boys out of its U.S. headquarters in Tennessee. When Icahn won out Mayor Jim Kenney dispatched his Commerce Department to urge Icahn to enhance the Allegheny Avenue headquarters — and even move some of his own investment activities here from high-cost Manhattan.

“The city did reach out and we really appreciate it” Pep Boys general counsel Brian Zuckerman said at the time shortly before he and other Philadelphia-based Pep Boys executives went off the payroll. Some were replaced by executives with Icahn’s smaller AutoPlus chain in Georgia.

Icahn also sent his longtime lawyer Daniel A. Ninivaggi to run Icahn Automotive. Though based in New York Ninivaggi pledged to “spend a lot of time in Philly” to keep the Pep Boys “core team” here and even to increase local staff. He also added parts from Icahn’s Federal-Mogul manufacturing group to Pep Boys shelves.

And then in 2018 Icahn Enterprises sold Federal-Mogul to Tenneco Corp. for $2.5 billion (plus debt) while plowing cash into the oil business which Icahn expected would gain value during the pro-petroleum Trump administration. Ninivaggi departed Icahn Automotive and Pep Boys.

Brian Kaner chief executive for the auto-service wing has an office in Philadelphia but lists his home on social media as Indianapolis. Christopher Cox his opposite number at the parts division works out of Georgia.

The top tech officer serving both companies remains primarily based in Philadelphia. But the chief financial legal workforce and marketing officers work in places ranging from New York to Detroit.

As for Icahn himself he left New York City for Florida in 2019 citing high taxes as a reason.

Icahn has continued restructuring its auto businesses Icahn Enterprises chief executive Keith Cozza told investors in the October conference call. Cozza is now working closely with Icahn’s son Brett who returned to the company this fall and is now his father’s official successor.

Last month after cutting Icahn Enterprises’ credit rating S&P analysts noted the company’s debt had doubled over the last year even after Icahn pumped in an additional $750 million in cash. This partly offset falling oil prices on its oil-refining investments.

In addition S&P noting the enterprise’s ongoing losses and shrinkage through asset sales deemed that it no longer had a “satisfactory” risk profile only a “fair” one. The asset shedding included Icahn’s sale this year of most of his stake in casino giant Caesar’s Entertainment

Pep Boys has plans for celebrating its 100th year said spokeswoman Sherlock. The company she said has put out a new “commemorative calendar that takes a trip through the decades using the vehicles and milestones of the times.”

And she said it will continue to back community activities in the city where it was founded.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Lawmakers are pushing for a statewide mandate requiring every police department in Maryland to equip officers with body cameras. But the cost for equipment and maintenance of the footage may be the biggest challenge.

In October a bipartisan legislative workgroup formed to focus on police accountability recommended that every police department in Maryland be required to use body cameras by 2025.

Sen. Justin Ready who is a member of a separate legislative task force looking into police body cameras said he isn’t opposed to a statewide mandate for body cameras if it’s financially feasible.

“We need to provide a way for counties to do that where it’s not breaking their budget” Ready (R-Carroll) said. “You can’t mandate something that would be expensive for a small county or a small town and leave them to their devices.”

“I would be a proponent of a statewide usage of body cameras” Sen. Charles Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County) told Capital News Service. “But the question that the task force is wrestling with is: How do you create an environment where local police departments will be able to do it?”

The task force has talked with numerous attorneys law professors and companies that manufacture body cameras. The financial burden of storing body camera footage is one of the biggest problems that the task force came across.

“Sometimes the expense isn’t necessarily the cameras themselves but the back-end storage processing footage for [Public Information Act] requests processing footage for trials” said Sydnor a co-chair of the task force. “That’s the thing we have been wrestling.”

Law enforcement agencies in Maryland can establish a body-worn camera program but the state does not require it.

Police body-camera footage — with some exceptions — is available under the state’s Public Information Act so storage and retrieval of the images require additional staff and resources.

Ready said he would much rather leave police departments to make their own decision on equipping officers with body cameras but also said there should be a way for small counties and towns to piggyback on a state contract if cameras are mandated.

“I’m not really big on wanting to mandate it but I think [cameras] are good and encouraging them is good” Ready said. “We need to work out the financial sides so it’s easier for jurisdictions to make that choice on their own.”

Montgomery County Baltimore County and Baltimore City are among the Maryland police departments that have officers equipped with body cameras.

Body cameras “provide transparency and accountability both for the officer and the violator” Washington County Sheriff Doug Mullendore (D) said.

Mullendore who is also a member of the task force said the Washington County Sheriff’s Office has used body cameras for several years. According to Mullendore it costs $40000 a year for more than 60 body cameras.

Baltimore County however spends $1.2 million a year for its body-camera program which includes 1455 cameras. According to the Baltimore County Police Department they use two professional staff employees to process and redact requests. The department has four part-time police assistants to help obtain footage for the State’s Attorney’s Office.

Body cameras “have been working wonderfully in Washington County” Mullendore said. “We run a police academy here and we show them footage from a body camera on how the incident was handled both good and bad and we tend to learn from those things.”

The task force has agreed that body cameras are beneficial for training and clarity in officer interactions. However it’s not always the primary solution in solving trust issues people may have with police officers.

“I don’t think body cameras would restore trust in itself but I do think they provide information that we were never really privy to” Sydnor said. “I believe they capture interactions between law enforcement and citizens [and] give us insight into how these engagements occur.”

Sydnor said that although he believes body cameras provide accountability he thinks video camera footage shot by people has provided better awareness of police brutality. George Floyd’s death which sparked national protests was recorded by a teenage girl in Minneapolis.

“Video camera footage is evidence of things and mistreatment people have said have been happening for decades” Sydnor said. “A lot of mistreatment in the Black community at the hands of police is nothing new. It just hasn’t been documented at the level (it is) today.”

There is no one quick fix in restoring trust particularly in minority communities said Andrea Headley a Georgetown University assistant professor who has researched police-community relations in communities of color and has evaluated body-worn cameras.

“We don’t think (body cameras) are going to be the fix all and transformative solution that communities of color are looking for” Headley said. “There was one study that found body camera footage was used more often to try citizens in court and they were used less often as an accountability mechanism for officers. Maybe cameras can have crime-reducing benefits but if we want it to increase trust that’s not a strategy.”

Headley said she thinks a statewide mandate can be effective if there are clear recommendations in place that prevent officer discretion and provide public access to footage in a timely manner.

“Pulling apart every single piece from activation to public review to storage and retrieval practice ― I’m not saying states should say what each of those aspects would look like but I think there should be some clear and best recommendations” Headley said.

Near the end of 2020 Xiaomi became the first brand to launch a flagship powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset. More are expected to be revealed in the weeks to come especially when the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2021 happens but we're already seeing a lot of rumours with the latest one for a new Nubia flagship.

According to GSMArena the ""nubia NX669J"" found on Geekbench is Nubia's next flagship gaming phone. And as you can see this is an Android 11 device with the 'lahaina' motherboard which was previously identified as the one for the Snapdragon 888 chipset. Besides that the phone will come with 8GB of RAM and should also have at least 128GB of internal storage.

The company has confirmed that it will be launching a device featuring the new Snapdragon 888 chipset at Qualcomm's big launch last month. It's more or less confirmed that it will be the Red Magic 6 so that would mean this device found on Geekbench should be it. The single and multi-core benchmark scores are also around the same range.

Unlock Bootloader: Overview

The bootloader is a program that starts whenever a device is powered on to activate the right operating system. It packages the instructions to boot the OS from the kernel. Like a smartphone tablet or PC etc.

A Locked or Unlocked Bootloader is what gives you access to root a device easily. If you root your device it means you have a superuser or administrator access to the operating system that runs on your phone. Therefore you can change some of the system settings manage customizations tweaks etc.

Unlocking your Android Device Bootloader may get security issues. Android users often unlock their device bootloaders to root and install Custom ROMs. But it may void your device warranty sometimes. If your device bricked or stuck into boot loops etc. For the same reason Android doesn’t come rooted; smartphone OEMs also don’t want to unlock the bootloader or root your device. It’s your choice and needs.

Donna Faulborn and Janet Boyhen help operate a food pantry that feeds up to 250 households in town.

Faulborn was named in November as a “Giant Hero” by the New York Giants and Quest Diagnostics and last month Boyhen was recognized as a 5th Congressional District “Hometown Hero” by Rep. Josh Gottheimer.

Faulborn is the director of the Dumont Senior Center where the food pantry is based and Boyhen is a longtime volunteer.

Faulborn a Giants season ticket holder said she received the honor after a Dumont resident who is also a Giants fan submitted her name. It was an honor that she was reluctant to receive.

“Like Janet neither one of us likes being in the spotlight. It’s kind of like a killer for us” Faulborn said with a laugh. “We just do what we do.”

Faulborn also the borough’s director of social services said her work at the pantry with some volunteers and one part-time worker involves receiving boxes of food at the senior center donated by various organizations in the area then assembling bags of food which are picked up by or delivered to residents.

It’s work that she sees as “a necessity” especially in such difficult times. But it's also rewarding.

“When I have people telling me sending me notes thanking me wishing they could hug me yelling as they drive by ‘Donna I love you thank you for what you do for me' that’s really what it’s all about — knowing how much of a difference I can make in someone’s life"" Faulborn said.

Boyhen received the Hometown Hero designation during a virtual ceremony after she was nominated by Dumont Borough Council President Carole Stewart.

“It was very nice of her to nominate me and to be honored. It’s not why I do this work but it was very nice” Boyhen said.

Her work at the pantry includes delivering food two to three days a week often to seniors who are shut-ins due in large part to COVID. She said it's about being of service to others.

“It’s always about paying it forward. I didn’t have a lot growing up and so for me it’s about paying it forward” Boyhen said.

Stewart had nothing but praise for both women for what they do in the community.

“Faulborn is just an amazing person; 24/7 I can count on her” Stewart said. “And Dumont is a community known for its volunteerism but there’s no better example than Janet Boyhen.”

Anyone in Dumont in need of food from the pantry open Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. can contact Faulborn at 201-387-5062.

But Tampa Bay has a lot riding on its regular-season finale:

The Bucs clinch the NFC’s No. 5 seed with …

• Win/tie vs. Falcons

OR

• Rams loss/tie vs. Cardinals

Clinching the No. 5 seed for the Bucs means traveling to the No. 4 seed for a first-round playoff game. The No. 4 seed will be the East Division winner — either Washington Dallas or the New York Giants. It’s Washington if it wins at Philadelphia tonight. If Washington loses it’s the winner of the Dallas-at-New York afternoon matchup.

The Bucs fall to the No. 6 seed with …

• Loss vs. Falcons

AND

• Rams win vs. Cardinals

Here’s where it becomes a far tougher playoff path for the Bucs. Dropping to the No. 6 seed means they travel to the No. 3 seed in the first round — either at Green Bay New Orleans or Seattle all still vying for the top-three seeds in the NFC. If Green Bay (at Chicago) New Orleans (at Carolina) and Seattle (at San Francisco) all win Sunday the Packers clinch the top seed followed by the Saints at No. 2 and the Seahawks at No. 3. That means the Bucs head to Seattle for their first-round game. However there are a variety of permutations where either Green Bay or New Orleans also could fall to No. 3. Since we don’t want your head to explode you’ll just have to trust us on that.

Here are each of the scenarios for Green Bay New Orleans and Seattle to clinch the NFC’s top seed and a first-round bye:

Green Bay clinches No. 1: Win/tie at Bears OR Seahawks loss/tie at 49ers

New Orleans clinches No. 1: Win at Panthers plus Packers loss plus Seahawks win

Seattle clinches No. 1: Win at 49ers plus Packers loss plus Saints loss/tie

Playoff picture

Division winners in each conference are the top four seeds. No. 1 seeds get first-round byes. Each of the remaining three division winners hosts a first-round game on Wild Card Weekend. They face the three teams with the best records among nondivision winners. The matchups: No. 2 seed vs. 7 3 vs. 6 4 vs. 5. So currently the Bucs would travel to Washington. The first-round winners advance to the division round along with No. 1 seeds:

Special for IndyStar

TAMPA Fla. – Shirtless fans beer-chugging on the Jumbotron and tailgating were all back for the Indiana football experience for the first and only time this season.

Indiana capped off one of its best seasons in decades with a trip to the Outback Bowl which the Hoosiers lost 26-20 to Ole Miss the game offered an opportunity for fans to attend a game for the first time during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Under restrictions set by the Big Ten Indiana was only allowed to have family members in attendance for games throughout the season. Even with the state of Indiana allowing fans to attend games at Lucas Oil Stadium and Notre Dame Stadium Memorial Stadium was mostly filled with artificial crowd noise.

Doyel:The Hoosiers did this to themselves. They took this special season and stained it.

That was not the case at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.

There were 11025 fans — about 6% of maximum capacity — allowed inside to watch the Outback Bowl and Indiana was strongly represented.

“It was cool to be home and play in front of a semi-full crowd and just hear the roar” Indiana linebacker and Tampa native Micah McFadden said postgame. “Glad we got to do it one time this year.”

Outside the stadium there were plenty of patches of cream and crimson preparing for the game. One tailgate featured Tampa resident and former Indiana football player Matthew Rohan who was a member of the 1979 Holiday Bowl team under Lee Corso.

Rohan has seen the ample amount of Tampa fan experiences lost last season including the Rays making it to the World Series the Lightning winning the Stanley Cup inside a bubble and Tom Brady leading a hopeful season with the Buccaneers this season which initially brought him hope about Indiana coming to play in the “city of champions.”

Despite the game not going as Rohan expected he is among the numerous alumni who are excited about the culture and direction of the program under Tom Allen.

“He’s the real deal” Rohan said. “…And he’s recruiting people from Florida. That’s the key. We’ve got (22 athletes) from Florida — student-athletes who are getting their degree and going out there to change the world. That’s what college is about.”

It wasn’t only those that were left out of the stadium this season that made the trip to Tampa for the game.

Indiana senior Sierra Bergdoll has been interning with Indiana’s marketing department this season which meant she was one of the few allowed inside on gamedays.

Her family was already planning on vacationing in Florida before the bowl announcement so they decided to drive up the morning of the game.

Bergdoll a senior was disappointed she wasn’t able to tailgate and celebrate IU’s wins like normal circumstances in Bloomington would allow but she found the silver lining in still being able to attend and watch a successful football team.

But the Outback Bowl allowed her to get a taste of what she missed.

Her family and friends helped fill the same parking lot as Rohan just outside the stadium with candy stripes and IU gear before heading into the game as a group for the first time this season.

“I’m super excited that everyone can enjoy the nice sunny weather and we’re able to tailgate” Bergdoll said. “It’s a good day to be a Hoosier.”

Joey Saporito is a former IU student from Cincinnati who didn’t have a group to attend the game with but still decided to make the trip on his own to get a glimpse of the historic season.

Saporito knew he’d be attending the game wherever it was as long as fans were allowed. Once the Outback Bowl was announced he was quick to book his trip.

“It’s been rough” Saporito said of not being able to attend games. “That’s why I wanted to jump on the opportunity since I wasn’t able to watch them any other time.”

Kevin Greve has been an Indiana football fan his entire life. He and his fellow IU friends got together each week to watch the team compete this season and they made the same decision as Saporito to attend a bowl game regardless of where it was.

They initially thought Indiana would be playing in Arizona for the Fiesta Bowl but once it became clearer IU would be left out of a New Year’s Six game the Citrus Bowl came into the picture.

One of Greve’s friends even booked a ticket to Orlando before finding out that Indiana would be knocked down in the pecking order in the Big Ten and would actually be playing in the Outback Bowl.

“Once we saw it was Tampa we were a little disappointed just for the guys because we thought they deserved a little better bowl” Greve said. “But the Outback Bowl is incredible and it was a cool opportunity. We knew we’d get the chance to go.”

Greve his wife and four of their friends made the trip for New Year’s and through the weekend.

Most of the group has owned season tickets since they were kids. Greve wore No. 11 as a quarterback in high school because of Antwaan Randle El.

They attended the Gator Bowl last season and after not being able to attend games this season Greve said it was a no-brainer to come to Florida.

Although the game didn’t meet up to expectations — Greve predicted a 37-14 win for Indiana — the attention now shifts to next year and hopefully returning to Memorial Stadium for another successful season.

“It’s gonna be hard not to shed a tear when we go to Memorial Stadium next year and get to ‘The Rock’” Greve said. “To just see them back in action there it’s gonna be a great feeling.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBmZi5jb20vbmV3cy9uZmwtMjAyMC13ZWVrLTE3LXBmZi1yZWZvY3VzZWQtdGFtcGEtYmF5LWJ1Y2NhbmVlcnMtNDQtYXRsYW50YS1mYWxjb25zLTI30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NFL Week 17 PFF ReFocused: Tampa Bay Buccaneers 44 Atlanta Falcons 27 | NFL News Rankings and Statistics,"The Tampa Bay Buccaneers dominated the Atlanta Falcons at Raymond James Stadium in Week 17 to win 44-27 and secure the No. 5 seed in the NFC playoff picture. The victory locks the Bucs into a matchup with the NFC East division winner — either the New York Giants or the Washington Football Team.

Bucs WR Mike Evans became the first player in NFL history to record seven straight 1000-plus-yard receiving seasons to begin his career though he suffered an injury to his left knee that required him to leave the game. Evans reappeared later on the sideline with a brace on that leg.

Editor's note: All of PFF's grades and advanced stats from this game will be finalized and made available to ELITE subscribers within 24 hours of the final whistle.

Story Of The Game

The Bucs are riding a four-game winning streak with Tom Brady and the offense firing on all cylinders. Brady finished 26-for-41 for 399 passing yards and four touchdowns and repeatedly torched the Falcons' secondary for big chunk plays.

The 43-year-old QB threw the ball 11.8 yards downfield on average and he now leads the league in completions to targets 20 or more yards downfield (36).

Chris Godwin and Antonio Brown both played their best game of the season in Evans' absence combining to finish the game with 16 receptions for 271 receiving yards and four scores. Brown has scored in three straight games after suffering a drought over his first five starts.

Tampa Bay’s impressive performance looks even better when considering the team played its regular-season finale without Devin White Shaq Barrett and Carlton Davis. Although the Bucs defense missed its leading tackler best pass-rusher and best defensive back the unit held the Falcons to the same score it did in Week 15 when Tampa Bay had those three starters healthy and playing.

The Buccaneers' run-defense is the ninth-highest-graded unit in the league but the Falcons’ offense gashed its opponent on the ground for 127 rushing yards today. Fourth-year pro Brian Hill ripped off a 62-yard gain in the fourth quarter and Atlanta kept the game within one score for a majority of the afternoon until Brady & Co. distanced themselves with under five minutes left.

For as explosive as Tampa Bay looked on offense the team's defense deserves credit for holding down Matt Ryan. Ryan is the 10th-highest-graded QB in the NFL this season (83.9) and he completed 65.9% of his passes today for 265 yards and two touchdowns. Ryan never threatened the Bucs’ secondary downfield finishing the game with an average depth of target of 5.3 yards.

In Week 15 Calvin Ridley caught 10-of-14 targets for 163 yards and a touchdown. Ridley had been red-hot entering today’s game with four straight games of at least 100 receiving yards though Tampa Bay held the ex-Alabama star in check for eight catches and 52 yards this afternoon.

Rookie Watch

On the Tampa Bay defense Cam Gill recorded the first sack of his career and the Bucs’ first sack of the day while teammate Antoine Winfield Jr. made his first NFL fumble recovery.

Tristan Wirfs played every snap on offense for the Bucs and surrendered one pressure for the entire game. Wirfs is the third-highest-graded right tackle in the NFL this season (81.7).

Falcons’ first-round pick A.J. Terrell played 56 of a possible 64 snaps on defense lining up predominantly at wide corner on the left side. Brady targeted him 10 times completing three passes for 61 yards.

The Buccaneers announced going with the all-pewter or color-rush look via Twitter.

All-pewter became a new option for the Bucs following the uniform overhaul between the 2019 and 2020 seasons. The Bucs first wore all-pewter in Week 3 against the Denver Broncos a 28-10 victory on the road. Tampa’s second time donning all pewter didn’t go as well in a 27-24 loss at home against the Los Angeles Rams the last time Bucs superstar Tom Brady posted a quarterback rating under 90.

Brady and the Bucs will look to end the regular season on a high note and secure the fifth seed for the NFC Playoffs. The Bucs will play in the postseason for the first time since 2007.

Brown Trending

Antonio Brown caught his first touchdown pass of the season a game-winning 46-yard connection two weeks ago against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 15.

The Bucs star receiver hopes to add to the tally in the rematch on Sunday and make it three-consecutive games with a touchdown. He caught his second touchdown in Week 16 at Detroit and took to Instagram following the game.

Bucs offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich said earlier in the week that Brown has found his niche among a deep receivers group.

Brady-Gronk Resurgence

While Brady hasn’t been perfect since his late interception spoiled the Bucs’ comeback changes against the Rams he’s looked more like the six-time Super Bowl winner getting ready for a playoff run in the past month.

Brady posted quarterback ratings of 96.1 120.9 110.4 and 158.3 in the post four games while throwing for 11 touchdowns and two interceptions.

Longtime teammate and tight end Rob Gronkowski aided some of Brady’s resurgence. Gronk posted a 106-yard receiving game 9.7 yards per catch in another and a two-touchdown performance in his most recent game. Bucs head coach Bruce Arians has confidence in Gronk’s progress per Rick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times on Twitter.

Brady and Gronk look to keep that stride going and lead the Bucs to their first 11-win season since 2005 against the Falcons on Sunday.

Brady Passing Favre

When Brady starts on Sunday against the Falcons he will pass Hall-of-Fame quarterback Brett Favre for the most career starts per ESPN Stats & Info on Twitter.

Favre ironically started his career with the Falcons before spending most of it in Green Bay. He made a similar move to Brady late in his career leading a different team in the Minnesota Vikings to an NFC title game in his 40s.

Favre and Brady are friends and Favre came out for Brady’s first home game as a Buccaneer per NBC Sports Boston.

Jones Returns

Tampa gets leading Ronald Jones III back against the Falcons after missing two games due to a pinkie injury. Jones will have extra protection for the injured finger on Sunday according to Tampa Times Reporter Rick Stroud via Twitter.

Jones needs 100 yards against the Falcons to eclipse the 1000-yard mark for the season. He has 900 yards and six touchdowns on 180 rushes.

The Revision 2.0 board the spitting image of the prior revision sports a third 8-pin PCIe power connector.

The GeForce RTX 3080 rated for 320W makes do with a pair of 8-pin PCIe power connectors. Bearing in mind that the PCIe x16 slot provides 75W a setup with two 8-pin PCIe power connectors provides power delivery up to 375W more than sufficient for a GeForce RTX 3080. However custom models with high factory overclocks typically sip more power explaining the dependency on more PCIe power connectors.

In terms of pure performance the Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Master 10G sports a 1845 MHz boost clock approximately 7.9% higher than the boost clock on the Founders Edition model. The graphics card is the second-fastest SKU in Gigabyte's Ampere GeForce RTX 3080 product stack. It only lags behind the Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Xtreme 10G which flaunts a 1905 MHz boost clock and has three 8-pin PCIe power connectors.

Image 1 of 2 Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Master 10G (Rev. 1.0) (Image credit: Gigabyte) Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Master 10G (Rev. 2.0) (Image credit: Gigabyte)

The previous revision of the Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Master 10G only required two 8-pin PCIe power connectors. The revamped power design certainly calls for attention. We suspect that Gigabyte's decision was purely based on optimizing costs because the Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Xtreme 10G and the Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Master 10G are practically the same graphics card sans the boost clock speed. By unifying both power layouts Gigabyte could easily recycle GPUs that don't qualify for the Xtreme variant for the Master variant.

With the extra 8-pin PCIe power connector on the new revision Gigabyte also raised the minimum power supply recommendation from 750W up to 850W. It remains to be seen whether Revision 2.0 will actually sip more or the same amount of power under normal circumstances. In any event it shouldn't be a major issue unless you're running a power supply at the borderline capacity of what Gigabyte recommends.

We don't expect the first revision to be in ample circulation anymore. Performance should be identical on both revisions but if you're set on adding the Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Master 10G to your system grab the new revisions just for peace of mind. We've reached out to Gigabyte for more information and will update as necessary.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1wbGFubmluZy1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDgwLXN1cGVyLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwNzAtc3VwZXItZ3JhcGhpY3MtY2FyZHMv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLXBsYW5uaW5nLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwODAtc3VwZXItZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA3MC1zdXBlci1ncmFwaGljcy1jYXJkcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA Reportedly Planning GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER Graphics Cards,"We have seen a ton of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series graphics card configurations that have been through the rumor mill only to be canceled soon after. It looks like NVIDIA is still deciding on what to do next with its Ampere lineup and as such there are new rumors emerging from Kopite7kimi (via Videocardz) according to who NVIDIA is preparing two brand new SKUs which might possibly by the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER Reportedly Under Consideration Could These Feature 16 GB GDDR6(X) VRAM?

For starters the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER are not going to affect the upcoming card lineup which would include the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti & the GeForce RTX 3060. The GeForce RTX 3070 Ti could be a whole different story since we have heard about this SKU for a while now but nothing has been formulated aside from some rumored specifications. The RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti have also been canceled and relaunched with different specs a couple of times now.

The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is even going to be introduced earlier than the RTX 3070 Ti so the status of this particular SKU is not confirmed yet. At the same time one thing to note about the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3060 is how both of them feature much higher memory capacities than their predecessors. The RTX 3080 Ti replaces the RTX 2080 Ti with 9 GB higher VRAM (11 GB vs 20 GB) and the RTX 3060 replaces the RTX 2060 with twice the memory buffer (6 GB vs 12 GB). The same might just be the case with the SUPER series that NVIDIA has planned.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & RTX 3070 SUPER

We don't have any concrete specifications of these two chips but if we go back to earlier rumors then we can tell that NVIDIA had initially planned higher VRAM variants of both RTX 3080 & RTX 3070 graphics cards. The RTX 3080 was expected to feature 12-16 GB VRAM while the RTX 3070 also had been expected to feature similar VRAM amounts. However that plan was scrapped in favor of NVIDIA going literally bonkers with its RTX 3090 design and keeping the rest of the lineup capped to 10 GB VRAM due to limited availability of GDDR6(X) modules.

I know there are some new SKUs recently but I don't know their names yet maybe 3070 Super and 3080 Super. — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) December 31 2020

By the time the RTX 3080 Ti launches the memory supply will be far better. NVIDIA themselves have also confirmed that supply would get better by the end of the first quarter of 2021 so that is probably when NVIDIA can devise a better plan to re-release their GeForce RTX lineup in a SUPER fashion.

For this purpose the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER and GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER could be the first entrants in the lineup. Similar to the previous generation NVIDIA wouldn't want to touch the high-end models since they will be positioned right against the competition. It's the RTX 3080 and below lineups such as the RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti which would require a SUPER refresh to tackle AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and RX 6700 series.

GA102 and GA103S — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) December 31 2020

For that purpose alone NVIDIA could end up featuring 16 GB of GDDR6(X) memory on both the RTX 3080 SUPER (GDDR6X) & the GeForce 3070 SUPER (GDDR6). As for core configurations they might also change with the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER expected to utilize the GA103S GPU while the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER would retain its GA102 GPU.

However one critical thing to consider here would be the prices. Whether NVIDIA offers a price cut on existing variants and ends their production to make room for the new cards which is similar to what they did in the last generation or keep the existing cards and offer the SUPER variants with a slight premium that remains to be seen. Lastly don't expect the SUPER cards anytime soon as the green team has yet to be done with the original lineup. We can probably expect an announcement around Computex or during Summer which was also the case with the GeForce RTX 20 SUPER line.

This model features GA104-200 GPU from the RTX 3060 Ti graphics card model.

Gigabyte has a new VISION

The RTX 3060 Ti VISION OC is a factory-overclocked model to 1755 MHz which appears to be an average clock speed for customs designs based on this NVIDIA SKU. Compared to the RTX 3070 the new VISION model features the same triple-fan WindForce 3X cooling solution however for the first time Gigabyte has brought this cooler in a true 2-slot design. Previous models such as RTX 3070 or RTX 3080 were all 2.5 to 3-slot designs.

The graphics card features a full custom PCB with dual power connectors. Unlike many other custom designs this card features 8-pin and 6-pin power connectors which theoretically provides as much as 300W of power for the whole card when PCIe power is also considered. Naturally this model will not consume this much power but the power envelope for potential manual overclocking is certainly improved. Sadly Gigabyte does not list TGP values for its graphics cards hence it is unclear how much more power the graphics card needs compared to the Founders Edition.

Another interesting aspect of this model is the display output configuration. Unlike reference design this card features dual DisplayPort 1.4 and dual HDMI 2.1 ports. Sadly there are no USB Type-C on this card despite the VISION series being targeted for content creators.

Gigabyte has not yet confirmed when will this model will be available for sale it has only just appeared on the company website this week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDgwLW1vYmlsaXR5LWdwdS1zcGVjaWZpY2F0aW9ucy1iZW5jaG1hcmstbGVhay1vbi1wYXItcnR4LTIwODAtdGkv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwODAtbW9iaWxpdHktZ3B1LXNwZWNpZmljYXRpb25zLWJlbmNobWFyay1sZWFrLW9uLXBhci1ydHgtMjA4MC10aS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Mobility GPU Specs & Benchmark Leak Out GA104 With 6144 Cores 16 GB Memory & On Par With An RTX 2080 Ti,"The specifications of NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3080 mobility graphics card have been confirmed within a listing over at Geekbench. The listing was spotted by TUM_APISAK and shows the next-gen RTX 30 series mobility GPU running in the OpenCL test suite.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Mobility GPU To Feature GA104 GPU With 6144 Cores 16 GB Memory & 1540 MHz Clock in Max-P Variant On Par With An RTX 2080 Ti

Just a few days ago we got to see the benchmarks & specifications for the GeForce RTX 3070 GPU for laptops along with the first listings for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series mobility lineup along with some preliminary specifications. Also based on the clock speeds alone we can tell that this is the Max-P variant of the GeForce RTX 3080 instead of the Max-Q variant which offers conservative clock speeds to deliver higher efficiency and battery times.

So coming to the specifications the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Mobility will feature 48 SMs on the GA104 GPU SKU (presumably the GA104-775). This chip would feature a total of 6144 cores and a maximum clock speed of around 1540 MHz. The graphics card also features 16 GB VRAM which runs across a 256-bit wide bus interface but it remains to be seen if NVIDIA is utilizing 12 or 14 Gbps DRAM modules for its mobility lineup.

Preliminary specifications also seem to indicate that the Max-Q variant will feature a TGP between 80-90W while the faster Max-P variant will feature a TGP of 115-150W. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Mobility was tested on an ASUS ROG Zephyrus GX551QS next-generation laptop which comes with the AMD Ryzen 9 5900H CPU with 8 Zen 3 cores 16 threads a base clock of 3.30 GHz and a boost clock of up to 4.55 GHz. You can see benchmarks of the CPU in this previously reported article.

In terms of performance the GPU scored 139181 points in the OpenCL test. The score puts the GeForce RTX 3080 mobility on par with the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti & GeForce RTX 3070 Desktop variants. But at the same time it is slower than the desktop GeForce RTX 3080 desktop by 30% which should be expected since the variant does not only offer lower cores but also comes with much lower clocks even though it's a Max-P variant. The score also puts the GeForce RTX 3080 mobility around 25% faster than the GeForce RTX 3070 mobility results we saw before.

So essentially you will be getting RTX 2080 Ti levels of performance in a GPU which was pretty much not the case in the previous generation.

AMD patents GPU chiplets

A new patent submitted to the US Patent Office on December 31 describing the AMD approach to potential GPU chiplet design. The manufacturer has outlined the problematic structure of such a design and explained how it would be possible to avoid them in the future.

According to AMD the GPU designs have been kept in a monolithic state due to various problems with implementation. GPU programming model is inefficient to work with multiple GPUs (that also describes Crossfire configurations) as it is hard to distribute parallelism across multiple active dies in the system. It is also complex and expensive design-wise to synchronize memory content across multiple GPU chipsets AMD describes.

AMD thinks that it would be possible to avoid such problems by implementing ‘high bandwidth passive crosslinks. According to AMD the first GPU chipset would be direct ‘communicably coupled’ to the CPU while each of the GPU chiplets in the array would be coupled to the first GPU via a passive crosslink. In this sense AMD considered passive crosslink as communication wires between chiplets that are placed on a single interposer. (in multiple layers if needed). Such GPU group would work as a System on a Chip which is divided into different functional chips.

In conventional GPU designs each of the GPU features its own last-level cache (LLC) but in order to avoid problematic synchronization AMD thinks that each of the GPU chiplets should feature its own LLC but in a way that each of those caches is ‘communicably coupled’ to physical resources so that the cache remains ‘unified and remains coherent across all GPU chiplets’.

AMD has not publically confirmed it is working on a GPU chiplet design. However there have been rumors that RDNA3+ designs could be based on chiplets. AMD has a lot of experience with multi-chip designs especially from its Ryzen series and various APUs including current-gen gaming consoles.

Both competitors NVIDIA and Intel are also expected to follow this route which will allow them to produce GPU chips at higher yields. Intel has already confirmed its tile-designed Xe-HP graphics cards which are expected to make a debut later this year. Meanwhile NVIDIA is rumored to introduce its first MCM (multi-chip-module design) with the Hopper architecture.

The automotive aftermarket industry is going through interesting times. People are fixing up their old cars to avoid public transport amid the coronavirus crisis resulting in an increased demand for car parts. Even though the car parts industry wasn't safe from uncertainty and losses in 2020 the new year could bring in huge opportunities for long-term investors. Click to skip ahead our discussion and see the 5 best auto-parts stocks to buy for 2021.

Like every industry the automotive aftermarket sector has experienced a bumpy ride in 2020 amid the coronavirus crisis. In the beginning the industry got hammered after vehicle miles traveled (VMT) dropped across the country resulting in a steep decline in auto parts demand. Restricted movement in all states also resulted in less usage of personal vehicles fewer collisions and limited customer spending on new auto parts. Vehicle sales in the U.S. which were already crashing worsened after the COVID-19 outbreak as consumers started to limit their spending. In November new car sales posted a 15% decline. All of this painted a bleak picture for the auto-parts industry.

An Antifragile Industry

But the auto-parts industry is known for its anti-fragility. In the period between 2007 to 2009 when the U.S. economy was in recession and auto sales for new cars plunged 42% the aftermarket experienced just a 1% decline. Analysts now believe that the auto-parts industry is set for a strong rebound and growth in 2021 on the back of several factors.

Firstly a decline in new car sales will buoy demand for auto parts as people drive their old cars and trade used cars. Secondly people are starting to shun public transport and prefer using personal cars to avoid contracting the coronavirus. Stephan Wöllenstein chief executive of Volkswagen Group China said earlier this year that the company is seeing a rise in sales mostly from young buyers who accounted for about 60% of the company’s sales in March. In a survey conducted by the Institute for Transport Research in June and July 50% of respondents said they are using public transport less often or much less often because of health risks. This trend will help the auto-parts industry grow in 2021 and beyond.

McKinsey & Company forecasts that the auto-parts industry will grow at a rate of 3% per annum through 2030. However the industry is expected to go through several key changes in consumer behavior including a shift to e-commerce direct distributions and partnerships. The aftermarket industry growth will touch new highs in Asia according to the report. McKinsey expects automotive aftermarket revenues of approximately €337 billion in North America and approximately €295 billion in Europe in 2030.

Unarguably so as the region has immense potential which is yet to be explored to the fullest.

“Till recently we were majorly confined to a job-seeking mindset. But the good news is that the past two-three years have witnessed the onset of a paradigm shift in the mindset of the people in the region. More and more people especially the youth are realising the importance of innovation to tackle the myriad local challenges themselves rather than expecting someone else to resolve the problems” says HK Borah the head of ecosystem development for IIM Calcutta Innovation Park (IIMCIP) which has been leading the mission to develop the startup ecosystem in the north-east since 2016. “It has also been observed that India’s top VCs and angel networks have their eyes on the region. With the markets saturating elsewhere north-east India’s reasonably unexplored potential has investors warming up to the region” Borah adds.

From adventure tourism and agritech to media and entertainment there are a whole lot of startups that may see increased business in the new year. We profile some exciting ventures here…

My3DSelfie

A Guwahati-based 3D selfie store that is the first to create a 3D figurine from any type of photo

Harsha P Deka CEO and founder of My3DSelfie always knew that it was easier for him to do business in Canada or the US but coming back to India and starting something new acknowledging and accepting the challenges of a developing economy and at the same time understanding the need of businesses that worked towards exports was what intrigued him the most. That was the driving force for the Guwahati native to return to India after 14 years in 2016 and start his own venture.

The 32-year-old alumnus of Carlton University in Ottawa Canada where he did his bachelor’s in computer science with specialisation in business management system started his first company in 2010 called Myware Solutions while he was still in university. “We consulted SMEs to billion-dollar corporates. We also built a couple of products one that dealt with bartering textbooks. Another was a stress management application” he says.

With My3DSelfie which started in 2016 Deka was the first in the world he says to be able to create a 3D figurine from any type of photo. “In my initial years as an entrepreneur I realised that the 3D industry is new and the possibilities with it are endless. I could envision north-east India as a hub for 3D technology and traditionally-crafted figurines much like what textile is to Bangladesh or manufacturing in general is to China” he explains.

My3DSelfie operates in both B2B and B2C models. It has delivered products to thousands of consumers in over 39 countries including Hollywood celebrities sports personalities high-profile government officials Fortune 500 companies universities like Harvard Stanford and Cardiff among others. “We are seeing 2x growth in terms of revenue compared to last year and are growing 25-30% every month. Our Q3 2020 revenue was 3x times compared to Q2 2020 and Q4 is on track to be 2x more than Q3 2020. We have been doing record-breaking numbers every month since July” Deka says.

The startup raised Rs 50 lakh from the IIMCIP raised Rs 15 lakh as a grant from the government of Assam signed a term sheet with an investor at the first North East India Fund Fest held in 2020 of Rs 1.5 crore and is in talks with a few investors to raise a bigger round. “We are seeing enormous growth even during Covid. We successfully launched our new product line opened up a subsidiary in the US and raised another round from a US investor all in the midst of the pandemic” he says.

But not everything was rosy. Wanting to create a 3D industry in the north-east was itself a challenge firstly due to a lack of professionals in the field. “Hiring was a tough job… everyone had to learn and unlearn at the job” Deka says adding “India has become too rigid with its systems. Processes are slow and are driven by a set of hierarchical undertakings which is time-consuming and in most cases unnecessary. When it comes to exports policies are taut and extensive. Ease of doing business when it involves exports is largely inconvenient and comes with multiple compliances.”

These however were some of the exact reasons why Deka wanted to come back. “I was always aware of the challenges but we have slowly and persistently been able to overcome each one of them. I have slowly been able to start a culture in our office where we are motivated to come to work. We work not only for ourselves but also as a team” he says.

Going ahead Deka is looking at raising funds and fulfilling his startup’s ultimate goal of employing 5000 employees.

Zizira

Dealing in spices and herbs this company in Shillong aims to make local farmers famous by popularising their rare produce

When 70-year-old Ralph Budelman came to Shillong from Chicago in 2004 he was influenced by the potential he saw in the youth of the north-east. He wanted to ensure that this potential did not go waste and so he started Chillibreeze the parent company of Zizira to generate employment and offer better opportunities.

Inadvertently Budelman saw the agricultural resources that the north-east had to offer that were being severely underutilised especially in Meghalaya. So 10 years after Chillibreeze’s inception he took another leap of faith and launched Zizira a food-based company with a mission to make farmers famous. Zizira which deals with spices and herbs delivers the ‘undiscovered treasures’ grown by the small farmers of Meghalaya to discerning and food-conscious customers all over India.

“The abundant rainfall rich soil high altitude hilly terrain fresh air and clean water produce unique plants and crops endemic to a few regions globally.

We hunt for these treasures from what is considered by some to be ‘the richest most biodiverse region in India’ using our knowledge of the local languages cultures and drawing from ancient wisdom and folk medicine to give customers rare and authentic products… we also work with small family farmers in Meghalaya” he says.

Zizira’s revenues are generated directly from discerning customers who consume its products. It works directly with local farmers to deliver products

to customers all over India. “The main user base and target profile of Zizira is the niche food-conscious Indian population living in metro cities which does not have access to pure herbs and spices” explains Budelman.

Zizira started in 2015 with nothing but a young group of individuals and one vision — ‘making farmers famous’. “Everything from there was trial and error. We learnt everything the hard way” says Budelman adding “We had to figure out ways to pack our goods properly ways to process them how to select the right farmers how to solve logistics issues. Zizira is defined by the challenges we faced.”

However the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent lockdown proved to be a problem which negatively impacted the flow of the business on many levels. The company’s supply chain was the most affected but the challenges faced by the team forced them to grow and adapt to the new normal. The team put in great effort to tackle the limitations brought by the lockdown. This meant staying at the office for months on end working extra hours and conducting meetings on shipments and logistics to prevent future problems. “In hindsight however all of it was a blessing in disguise” says Budelman adding “We want to put Zizira on the map. We also have plans of expanding the business in terms of delivering our products to discerning customers outside India as well.”

The aim is to build a larger farmer network and partner with more family farmers who are not just from Meghalaya but from other north-eastern states as well.

Voyage

An environment conservation model based in Gangtok that works towards a goal of zero-waste Himalayas

Being an Army child Pritam Pany lived in over 15 cities across India until nostalgia brought him back to his home state Sikkim. The 30-year-old started Voyage in 2018 with the goal of achieving a zero-waste Himalayas and has had a grassroots-level focus in Gangtok ever since. “My intervention point in environment conservation began in 2010 when I had gone for an internship to Austria and was able to observe the stark difference in sanitation and hygiene with respect to our country” says Pany.

This was always running at the back of his mind and he finally quit his corporate job in 2016 to pursue solid waste management full-time with the intention of working towards the betterment of his country. Voyage as an impact enterprise has a hybrid model. Its NGO arm works towards uplifting landfill ragpickers out of poverty. “We conduct medical camps improve livelihoods and also supported them during Covid times. Our NGO’s primary funding source has been online crowdfunding which we have been able to successfully achieve with the help of our active supporters” explains Pany a graduate of IIT-Roorkee who has worked as a teacher architect and a management consultant in two MNCs and a startup based in Bengaluru before starting Voyage.

“Voyage’s commercial arm was earlier involved in consulting… we have made Gangtok military station zero-waste by installing composting and dry waste management systems onsite effectively stopping 90% of the waste generated from going to the landfill daily” says Pany.

To increase its impact and utilising the grant money awarded to it by the North East Council (NEC) it established a one-tonne-per-day plastics processing unit in October. “This way we will be able to stop roughly 300 tonnes of plastic per annum from getting burnt or going to the landfill. Our project focus is currently on households and we have signed up with 50 of them. We collect their dry waste once a month and take it to our unit for further processing” he says adding “We are a very agile startup with the ability to pivot at the drop of a hat. The systems we have installed right now would see us processing a minimum 300 tonne of plastic per annum. That combined with our newly-forged partnerships with local communities and authorities sees us poised for exponential growth in the coming year.”

Runway Nagaland

Platform for local artisans in Kohima offering handmade products using indigenous technique & designs

Runway Nagaland started in 2012 as a platform to provide space to local artisans to promote and market their creations. Gradually the startup got into manufacturing handmade accessories using indigenous techniques and designs with a motive to preserve and pass on the art of the region. “Our revenue model is based on channel partners retail online wholesale etc. We have a varied profile from jewellery to home furnishings to decorative and gifting” says 33-year-old Nengneithem Hengna a first-generation entrepreneur hailing from Kohima in Nagaland.

Runway Nagaland’s ‘Gou-lu’ tribal jewellery brand has made a visible mark in the fashion world and the startup has shown healthy growth in the past three-four years with a revenue of `40-67 lakh. “Nagaland is well known for its creativity and craftsmanship but we didn’t have any systematic way of doing business. I took the opportunity… and based on my favourite quote ‘Winners don’t do different things they do things differently’ I created Runway Nagaland as a platform for our artisans” says Hengna a Delhi University alumna who worked with Dabur India and HDFC Life in various capacities before starting her own venture.

However it was never an easy journey. From people not taking a woman entrepreneur seriously to facing societal taboos and judgments to funding her business were some of the challenges that she faced while starting up. “I knew it’s difficult to sustain business in Nagaland due to many factors. So my focus was always to market our local products outside the state and this strategy has proven to be successful mitigating other drawbacks” she says.

Then came the coronavirus pandemic. “Business operations were badly affected due to the lockdown. So for the moment we are concentrating more on our social media presence and working on developing new designs. We have also taken up interior designing projects and training sessions” she says.

Hengna also utilised the time in researching experimenting with and understanding banana fibre its usage and sustainable ways of harvesting it without harming nature. “With our new project on banana fibre which is projected to make at least 35% profit within the first financial year we are hopeful to break even by the third year. We have high hopes and are looking forward to 2021” she says.

Natventure

An adventure travel firm in Guwahati offering cycling and trekking tours

While working with various organisations in Delhi Assam native Jitu Pegu realised that travellers were eager to know more about the north-east and were ready to travel there but were unable to do so due to lack of professionalism in the region. Safety is a major concern for hardcore adventure travellers as they tend to venture out only where certified and trained professionals are available.

“There are high chances of diversion of tourist flow to this region” says 35-year-old Pegu a master’s degree holder in tourism and leisure with adventure tourism as specialisation from the Indian Institute of Tourism and Travel Management in Noida. And so Pegu started his adventure travel company based in the north-east with co-founder Supuraj Gogoi in 2016.

“We specialise in cycling and trekking tours in this part of the country. Besides we also do outdoor educational tours for school children and corporate outdoor training programmes” says Pegu. Natventure which was awarded the ‘Best Adventure Tour Operator’ of Assam in 2018-19 by the state tourism department generates revenue mainly from cycling and outdoor educational trips. “In the next two years we are planning to introduce water- and air-based activities to our itineraries” explains Pegu.

So far the co-founders have invested around Rs 20 lakh a majority of which was spent on equipment and product development. Natventure has just completed its third operational year. While it made a transaction of around Rs 8 lakh in the first year it increased to Rs 13.5 lakh in the third adds Pegu. “We have handled international travellers but our main target group is the domestic adventure traveller. Within India our clients are mainly from Delhi Karnataka West Bengal and Maharashtra” adds 43-year-old co-founder Gogoi who graduated from Gauhati University and is a hardcore adventure enthusiast.

According to Gogoi lack of trained manpower has been the biggest challenge in starting up in a region like the north-east. “However we have been working closely with organisations like Assam Mountaineering Association. We have also been successful in polishing a few local youths” he adds. Also as compared to the rest of India says Gogoi adventure circuits are not developed in this region. “This has made us spend a lot of time as well as money in developing adventure activity-based circuits” he says. Going forward Natventure aims to be a one-stop solution for adventure seekers. “To fulfill this we are diversifying our option of activities as well as developing various circuits in all the states” Pegu adds.

Spokehub Cycling

A premium bike service and retail point based in Guwahati offering spares & accessories

When Ajanta Boro and Bikash Doley were working in corporate houses outside Assam they owned geared bicycles from Giant which they used to ride whenever they came to Guwahati. However they realised there was a lack of service for premium bicycles in the city and traditional bike shops were not equipped to handle those bikes. “So we quit our jobs in 2016 and worked on setting up a bike service and retail point to give access to service and sale of high-end bikes along with spares and accessories” says 33-year-old Boro an IIM-Indore and NIT-Nagpur alumna. Thus was born Spokehub Cycling in 2017.

Before starting Boro worked with Tata Steel and Diageo while Doley worked in Mother Dairy and Glenmark. “Once we started this venture we realised that the cycling scene here will improve only if an ecosystem is developed. So we evolved our business model from a retail chain to community engagement and development developing cycling as sports through our ‘Spokehub Racing Team’ events and races bicycle tours and rental programmes and content generation through our digital content partner Whacky Talky” says Boro who married Doley last year.

In early 2020 Spokehub Cycling was selected for incubation with Startup Assam an initiative of the Assam government to create a startup ecosystem in the state. Through it Spokehub received a grant of Rs 15 lakh which was used for expansion of its retail chain and upgrade of its media partner. “Apart from that the venture is bootstrapped one” says Boro.

The pandemic proved to be a blessing as people realised the importance of fitness and there was a spike in demand. Spokehub Cycling too has seen around 3x growth. “But the curve is bound to go down as things normalise. Then we would be growing at our normal rate which is about 1.5x y-o-y” explains Boro.

According to her having a base in Guwahati can be both a bane and boon. “When we started we had an open field to try out new things for creating demand rather than working as a trading firm” she says adding “It was a bane in the sense that examples of startups were quite rare. Initial hiccups on credit support inventory availability and many more were overcome once we showed results not only in terms of revenue but also in terms of building the brands” Boro says. What’s their mantra for success? “There is no shortcut believe in yourself and don’t lose focus of your purpose and aim. Everything takes time so patience and hardwork helped us achieve where we are now” Boro signs off.

Interview: HK Borah head ecosystem development IIM Calcutta Innovation Park

‘The way N-E feels at home with music a similar trend for startups is needed’

IIM Calcutta Innovation Park (IIMCIP) has been leading the mission to develop the startup ecosystem in east and north-east India since 2016. Kunal Doley speaks with HK Borah the head of ecosystem development at the B-school’s incubator to know why the region is fast emerging as a one-of-a-kind ecosystem. Edited excerpts:

Some reports say the north-east is fast emerging as a one-of-a-kind startup ecosystem. What are your observations?

North-east India has carved a unique position in the nation’s entrepreneurial landscape by dint of its emphasis on social entrepreneurship. Every region has its typical challenges and advantages and I think it’s imperative to carve a niche than follow a fad.

We might not be the best tech innovators like a Bengaluru or Kerala or Chennai. But our uniqueness lies in our unique challenges and the unique society-centric innovations to deal with the challenges. So when a Tage Rita brews the world’s first variety of kiwi wine her venture is predominantly fuelled by the intention to find a market for the abundantly-grown kiwi in Arunachal Pradesh. Or for that matter Khasi entrepreneur Bestarly Marwain’s aromatic plantations are inspired from his intent to restore green coverage in the mining wastelands of Meghalaya. While addressing the core local issues these entrepreneurs from the north-east are innovating products and services that can meet global demands. And this indeed puts north-eastern entrepreneurs in a unique position.

You’ve been associated with the startup ecosystem in the north-east for quite some time now. What are your key takeaways so far? What kind of challenges if any do startups from the region face vis-a-vis their counterparts in other parts of the country?

The major challenges infesting north-eastern startups could be summarised in three pivotal factors — mindset exposure and knowledge. The job-seeking mindset is intrinsic to our upbringing in this part of the world. In order to convince ourselves that we are far more capable than being mere survivors is something that would take time awareness drives and a few success stories from the local ecosystem.

Apart from security another very important element attached to a job or career in this part of the world is respect. We often want our children to grow up to be doctors engineers professors or someone holding a coveted position in administration. This desire does not just emerge from the income considerations but also from the notion of respect that these professions command. As such it’s important to convey to the people the fact that entrepreneurship doesn’t just bring profit but also immense respect by the positive changes that they bring in society and to the economy as bold and ethical leaders. When we talk about changing mindsets change must be brought both in the youths to take up entrepreneurship as well as in their parents to support the decision to take up entrepreneurship.

This can come through extensive awareness campaigns. However even if one has finally realised the amount of money and respect that entrepreneurship can bring he/she might still pat an argument: “Business isn’t in our blood.”

Perhaps what they see as a genetic construction is in reality a lack of exposure. In order to stop playing safe and start taking risks without a fear of failure the need is to get exposed to a challenging environment where brilliant risk-takers are playing smart gambles to successfully resolve problems through innovative thinking.

In this part of the world even if someone thinks of a startup idea they would most possibly bury it within themselves without realising the idea’s potential to be built into a profitable scalable and sustainable business. Cut to a city like Bengaluru Mumbai or Delhi a youth deciphers the commercial viability of an idea as soon as it hits him or her. It is this kind of exposure and familiarity to entrepreneurship that we lack.

The way the north-east feels at home with music and guitar a startup trend needs to be created with a supportive ecosystem so that the youth feel at home with startup and entrepreneurship as well.

However even if one has the required mindset it all comes down to zero without the knowledge of doing business. Being more of a job-oriented community our interests as well as the academic curriculum are focused more on job-based subjects than on entrepreneurship courses. But we must understand that while passion and risk-taking are entrepreneurial virtues they will end up like a mighty bedlam without strong and level-headed knowledge of business.

That’s one of the fundamental reasons why a lot of brilliant ideas die down in this part of the world without making any noise. This is where the IIM Calcutta Innovation Park plays a significant role in terms of disseminating business knowledge and handholding fledgling entrepreneurs to grow with knowledge and confidence.

Many young entrepreneurs from the region have made their mark with their unique startups. What makes them click? Any interesting entrepreneurial ideas and projects that you have witnessed so far?

A rundown of the cases of successful startups brings out three significant qualities that have made them click.

First is the intent to solve a problem rather than obsessing over their own innovation. It’s a common mistake made by startups to focus more on their innovation than trying to align it with the market need. Successful startup founders have a keen understanding of the pain points and are smart enough to tailor their innovation according to the need.

The second standout quality is perseverance. They aren’t bogged down by lean patches but are rather quick to make decisions to tweak the business model according to the situation. The car service aggregator from Assam Automovill Technologies is a good example of this. When the lockdown had dried up their business the startup founders quickly pivoted to offering vehicle sanitisation services. They use high-grade anti-microbial solutions to sanitise government vehicles as well as a number of government and corporate offices in Guwahati. Being a startup it’s important to stay nimble and alert and waste no time in adapting to situations. And this is one quality that makes startups like Automovill script success.

The third unique quality especially of the startups from this part of the world is their knack at harnessing local resources to resolve problems typical to the region. So be it a tea startup from Assam — Esah Tea — working closely with small tea growers to push the quality of tea production and help align it with the global demand or the Meghalaya-based startup Zizira-working closely with local farmers to procure process and sell quality herbs and spices to cater to a global market — these statups are making significant contributions towards livelihood creations thus addressing the grave problem of unemployment in the region.

What is your message to budding entrepreneurs from the region?

It’s encouraging to see more and more youths from the region jumping on to the entrepreneurial bandwagon. I must congratulate them for taking the first step by daring to aspire to be an entrepreneur. But while entrepreneurship is slowly but certainly emerging as a fad in the region one must realise that entrepreneurship is a serious business that demands a lot of hard work perseverance and the courage and skills to survive the initial failures. Planning is a must before kickstarting the operations. Do not rush yourself. Do the homework well. Do a thorough market research understand the needs and determine your prospective customers. Remember that your brilliant innovation might prove a waste if it isn’t serving a need.

CPS Energy VIA and energy company EDL are working on an initiative that will provide CPS Energy with natural gas from Republic Services’ Tessman Road landfill just south of Interstate 10 on San Antonio’s East Side. That gas will be part of a renewable fuel credit swap that will generate revenue for VIA while putting a former waste product to use.

The landfill methane will make up only 1 percent to 2 percent of the entire supply in CPS Energy’s distribution system said Richard Lujan CPS Energy’s senior director of gas solutions. Still CPS Energy expects it will receive enough of the landfill methane to offset the fossil fuel-derived natural gas needed for an estimated 75 percent of VIA’s fleet of 502 buses Lujan said.

“That’s natural gas displaced from traditional fossil fuel sources” Lujan said in an interview last week. “We’re taking this from our community waste and making use out of it.”

Gas harvested from landfills has long been used as a fuel for electricity generation. CPS Energy officials say the municipally owned utility receives 0.2 percent of its annual electricity generating capacity from two landfill gas-fired power plants on San Antonio’s Southwest Side.

But renewable natural gas (RNG) is gaining interest as a vehicle fuel across the U.S. Dallas Area Rapid Transit began integrating RNG into its fleet in 2018. The Environmental Protection Agency counts 67 active landfill RNG projects across the U.S. in 2020.

In San Antonio this gas won’t flow directly from the landfill into a VIA bus. Instead the gas supplier CPS Energy and VIA will participate in a renewable fuel credit swap arrangement that will assign a different role to all three parties.

EDL an international power supplier headquartered in Australia will convert its existing landfill gas power plant at the Tessman Road landfill to a plant that can inject pipeline-quality gas into CPS Energy’s system. CPS Energy will get the gas at a “favorable” price Lujan said though he declined to cite a specific price.

The entire exchange relies on renewable energy credits generated by the EPA as a result of the 2005 Energy Policy Act. That law set a standard for fuel refiners and importers to introduce certain amounts of renewable fuels into the market. It’s the reason gas stations sell gasoline blended with ethanol derived from corn.

Refining companies and importers who don’t generate enough renewable fuels can buy credits for them via this system which the EPA oversees. Lujan said it could generate up to approximately $530000 per year for VIA.

This method means VIA can continue using its compressed natural gas fueling station at 1721 N. Flores St. The facility was billed at its opening in 2018 as the largest of its kind in North America.

“One of the beauties of RNG is that the region reaps environmental benefits while VIA as a customer does not need to make any changes to our infrastructure equipment or practices” VIA CEO Jeff Arndt said at the transit authority’s October board meeting.

The new partnership should also yield significant climate benefits. Landfills are constantly generating methane through the decay of organic material. Methane that escapes to the atmosphere has a potent effect on global climate with a warming potential 80 times that of carbon dioxide the most common greenhouse gas.

Kristi Villanueva who serves on VIA’s board is president of the West San Antonio Chamber of Commerce. She was also an important figure in San Antonio’s Climate Action and Adaptation Plan where she served on one of the volunteer committees that helped draft the vision for the city to effectively abandon fossil fuels by 2050.

“There are no negatives to this for us being a part of it” Villanueva said in a phone interview. “VIA as an agency really has no risk.”

VIA’s trustees approved the initiative at their October board meeting with the RNG plant expected to begin operations in fall 2021.

But what if that packaging is damaged?

AI-driven recycling company WinGo Deposit has made it possible to accept damaged packaging for the first time using AI technology and a gamification model for consumers.

The Riga Latvia-based green tech company has launched the world's first deposit machine that uses artificial intelligence machine vision and neural network technologies to recognize and sort all types of packaging even if they have been flattened damaged or with a missing label.

“WinGo Deposit offers a system created from the point of view of the population. It will make the transfer of beverage packaging as convenient as possible for the whole society” says Vismands Menjoks CEO and co-owner of WinGo Deposit. “The smart waste sorting machine created in Latvia is a significant turning point because the technological solution with the help of artificial intelligence and neural networks recognizes accepts and sorts different types and volumes of both intact and flattened beverage packages. In nature however the packaging does not look like a store shelf.”

In the WinGo Deposit system the package is not only weighed but also photographed. Computer vision logic analytics and other smart machine skills can evaluate different types of packaging. This technology is adaptable to other waste groups such as tires household chemical packaging or hazardous waste such as deodorants and paint vials.

The technology significantly improves the functionality of automatic recycling deposit points which until now have only been able to accept undamaged products. This significantly reduces the amount of waste it is able to accept as many used products are often flattened after use.

“WinGo Deposit’s smart waste sorting machine accurately identifies PET bottles cans tetra packs and other types of packaging that are damaged or unlabeled if the citizen is digitally authenticated. Digital authentication and wallet also provide a preventive function to prevent the risks of fraud” says Menjoks. “It is a novelty for the solution developed in Latvia. It offers to accept both intact and flattened bottles – the function of recognition does not only read the barcode of the package; it scales recognizes the material and visually analyzes. Such a system where damaged packaging is accepted fulfills the overarching task – it more effectively solves the issues of environmental management and waste.”

Using the principles of gamification the consumer does not just receive their deposit money either in a digital wallet or on a loyalty card. But for each transferred item WinGo Deposit points are accumulated which can be exchanged for various benefits thus motivating consumers to sort more.

“The system provides a connection to a mobile application that reduces the physical consumption of paper checks by digitizing the return” says Menjoks.

The app scans the QR code on the screen of the device and disposes of waste opens. Those who do not have a smartphone can scan the store's loyalty card so that the system can recognize them and accumulate the transferred waste points.

“In principle the WinGo Deposit machine offers as part of an entire digital ecosystem. A bonus to digital authentication in this ecosystem would be that in addition to the whole system we also have partnerships with Wolt telecommunications companies and other services. That means you earn points order food ride a car or a scooter for free – it is another ecosystem that benefits people” says Menjoks.

WinGo Deposit’s business model focuses on providing added value to companies in waste collection as well as maintaining a positive public image.

“It is no secret that large beverage companies generate a lot of waste so we have the opportunity to reduce the adverse effects on the environment” says Menjoks.

The company has signed an agreement with the Ministry of Waste a British-based organization to distribute its deposit facility in Southeast Asia to implement modern waste management principles in the region.

“The essence of technology is to make services and products more democratic both in terms of price and usability. Combining several technologies and solutions in our approach makes the system convenient for today's consumers. At the same time only existing producers are talking about this solution” says Menjoks. “With this approach we can collect more packaging for recycling. The solution is designed so that we can organize a new type of packaging at any time significantly reducing the potential investment for the deposit system operator and making the system more efficient day by day.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pdGNoZWxscmVwdWJsaWMuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvbWF4aW5lLWktaG9oYmFjaNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maxine I.

How do we get and not hurt neighbors?,"Mo Stein and Sheila Harris

opinion contributors

Arizona is sadly experiencing increased homelessness. The challenges faced by those seeking support are more complex than we knew or understood 15 years ago when the Human Services Campus was created in Phoenix’s Capitol Mall neighborhood.

The campus does not create homelessness. But it simply cannot keep up with the needs especially during the global pandemic and economic downturn we now face.

At the same time it is not a responsibility of neighborhoods to solve homelessness challenges either. Phoenix’s general plan clearly notes that every neighborhood has a right to be sustainable and support the lives of individuals and families in all walks and ambitions.

Every neighborhood and community deserve to have a level of certainty.

The campus has helped thousands

The campus was the result of significant energy love and money to invest in our city’s social equity. The idea of bringing social service providers together at a common place to leverage missions had never happened before. It was the result of a willingness to take on the toughest of problems because there was no constituency prepared to own them.

This effort remains a landmark experience that has truly made a difference in thousands of lives.

Everyone involved in the formation of the campus knew we could not end homelessness definitively but we knew we could make a difference.

Today we are faced with an unfair situation: growing homelessness maintaining safe and equitable neighborhoods and recognizing this issue requires all parts of a great city to be involved.

The neighborhoods surrounding the campus are negatively impacted because many cannot be helped at the campus. As you might expect others not seeking support are drawn here too. There are not enough beds and services to meet the volume.

Everyone agrees we have a problem

The campus has asked for zoning permission to grow to 1000 beds to address the growing need. However the neighborhoods need to be able to grow thrive and restore the sense of community and safety they have worked so hard to attain.

Both conditions must be addressed.

On Sept. 17 the Phoenix Community Alliance (PCA) convened a forum of public officials and community stakeholders to bring people together to solve a tough problem. Catherine Reagor of The Arizona Republic moderated the discussion.

Catherine asked two very clear questions to get past the normal angst and emotion of zoning conditions. The goal was meaningful dialogue and new ideas:

First what is it that you really want to accomplish?

Second what are you willing to do to make it a reality?

The result was a call to listen and a plea for action. The issue is not agreement on the problem; the issue is not having consensus on what to do about it.

What we can agree on

This is a regional reality. Most agree the problem we face is a regional issue. While the initial investment of the county is laudable and the continuing efforts of the City of Phoenix are significant this is not just a Phoenix issue and it is not just a downtown issue. This problem can never be moved the right direction until other parts of the city and other cities themselves take action and provide resources and energy.

We must better communicate. While the concerns of the campus and of neighborhood residents and businesses would seem to be aligned that is not the case. This is largely due to lack of common conversations or resources to bring people together until there is a mandatory public reason to work together. Investing in neighborhoods by zoning stipulation is never successful.

There is much fear and uncertainty. Although we are talking about a location that is walkable to downtown and the state Capitol with a future light rail extension years of not knowing where to turn and where to go for answers impact neighborhoods. The result is an environment based on fear and uncertainty.

5 ways we can help solve this

Based on this dialogue and transparency PCA calls on elected officials and business leaders at all scales to join us in recommending these specific actions:

1. The boards of the Human Services Campus and the neighborhoods must act in concert and with the earned support of each other. We call on each to diversify their boards to include members of both groups.

2. Communication that goes beyond a zoning request is essential. We call on city leaders to assign a “go to” person to coordinate efforts backed up by a coordinated hybrid inter-departmental work group.

3. Every part of our city has a core plan or special district plan to guide growth – every part except the Capitol District. We ask the city Planning and Development Department and Central City Village Planning Committee to initiate the formation of an East Capitol District Special Plan and then overlay the entire geography with a Planned Area Development (PAD) to assure it is followed. The 1997 Legislative Governmental Mall Commission District Plan has been largely ignored for more than two decades.

4. We ask the city Community and Economic Development Department to work with business leaders and area representatives to create a new model of improvement district that will attract opportunities for business and affordable residential development. The goal is to establish new financial resources and critical mass for maintenance safety and public amenities.

5. We applaud Mayor Kate Gallego’s plan to dramatically increase affordable housing in Phoenix. We propose to initiate that challenge with the first 1000 homes to be built in this district to incent our new spirit of urban growth and commitment.

We know other nonprofit organizations and businesses are working diligently to address the issues of affordability supportive housing and homelessness. We ask you to align efforts with PCA to bring the effort and attention that this problem deserves. We cannot get to any goal line until we have the city county and state committed to working together to improve the Capitol Mall neighborhood.

The September forum was the first dialogue PCA will convene on reframing the social infrastructure of homelessness and supportive housing. PCA remains committed to doing our part to bring diverse groups together roll up our sleeves and get the job done.

It is a difficult and thankless job but that’s what caring communities do.

Food and nutrition security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is subject to the relentless impact of conflict epidemics and climate events that have persisted in the country for decades further compounded by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Lack of infrastructure and investment in agriculture health and human capital development combine to impede progress towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 2 and 17. While there are several legal instruments and policies that promote food and nutrition security poor coordination weak national capacity and exponential population growth present serious obstacles to the achievement of zero hunger. Political instability and siloed sectoral responses to humanitarian and development needs have also affected results to date.

Fragile national disaster preparedness and weak capacity to respond to persistent conflict and climate change force poor individuals and households to adopt negative coping strategies that disproportionately affect women. Emergency and development response is complicated by the sheer size of the country and its limited roads bridges and river transport systems. Food system constraints limit supply; markets affected by conflict are poorly served and 70–80 armed groups are present in areas where WFP operates at any given time. Deep-rooted food insecurity and malnutrition are driven by poverty; diseases such as Ebola measles and tuberculosis; and limited access to health services education and livelihood opportunities that is underpinned by entrenched gender inequality. Added to this the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to further deepen the fragility of the country.

Through this country strategic plan WFP will support the Government’s national priorities for achieving food and nutrition security through key shifts that include a commitment to translating the triple-nexus approach into stronger partnerships that support peace and development outcomes. New opportunities presented through the socioeconomic response to COVID-19 are also captured.

The plan will allow WFP to work with the Government and partners to address governance and technical gaps to increase local production and consumption of nutritious food. Similarly WFP will tackle the challenges that women and men in rural areas face every day due to their lack of access to land markets and nutritious food and the risks posed by conflict and climate events.

WFP is committed to mainstreaming gender equality measures in all of its activities and has adopted a gender-transformative approach based on the knowledge that men and women boys and girls experience poverty differently and face different barriers in accessing services and economic resources that impact their food security and nutritional status.

WFP interventions will be programmed and implemented in such a way that they are conflict sensitive contributing to conflict transformation and peace building. WFP’s partnership with the Government and assistance to the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be based on four mutually reinforcing strategic outcomes which are also WFP corporate priorities:

Strategic outcome 1: Conflict and crisis-affected men women boys and girls from all ethnic groups are able to meet their food and nutrition requirements throughout the year.

Strategic outcome 2: The human capital of conflict-affected and/or at-risk populations is equitably and inclusively protected and strengthened by 2024.

Strategic outcome 3: Smallholder farmers and food value chain actors have improved livelihood opportunities resilience social cohesion and protection and make progress towards gender equality by 2024.

Strategic outcome 4: Humanitarian and development partners have access to reliable air services and improved supply chain and other services during and in the aftermath of conflicts and crises.

This country strategic plan has been developed in consultation with the Government and other partners. It is aligned with the Government’s national strategic development plan approved in December 2019 and the 2020–2024 United Nations sustainable development cooperation framework. It contributes to efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goals 2 and 17 and to WFP Strategic Results 1 3 and 8."

Campaigns and messages have told us enough that no matter how you consume it or in what form you consume it — be it cigarettes hookah or bidi there is no safe substance in any tobacco product.

“These substances don’t just affect your lungs they have a detrimental impact on your entire body and contribute in reducing the number of years in your life” shared Dr Sibasish Dey from ResMed.

Effects of smoking

While few long-term effects of smoking can take years to develop — some of the physical effects that develop in short term are anxiety and irritability dull sense of smell nausea loss of appetite along with yellow fingers and more.

“In fact according to the American Lung Association cigarette smoking generates over 7000 chemicals many of which are poisonous and over 70 are carcinogenic. Smoking damages the air sacs in your lungs and makes breathing difficult leading to respiratory ailments such as COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)” pointed out Dr Dey.

Did you know that for an asthma patient even passive smoking which happens by standing close to a person who is smoking can prove to be a factor for an exacerbation?

Evidence suggests that smoking is by far the leading cause of the development of COPD because there were more than 10 million deaths globally as a result of tobacco consumption. “According to WHO (World Health Organisation) over 80 per cent of the 1.3 billion smokers live in low-income countries where the burden of respiratory ailments is the heaviest. Out of these over 12 per cent of the smokers are found in India itself” said Dr Dey.

While COPD or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is not that much heard of but it is projected to be the third leading cause of deaths worldwide as per a 2020 report by GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) an international body dedicated to the disease.

“Closer to home reports suggest that India contributes 38 per cent to the global burden of COPD – a rather alarming figure” says Dr Dey.

How to avoid respiratory ailments?

The first and major effective method to avoid respiratory ailments is to quit smoking. “The ongoing pandemic is an opportunity for people who smoke to recognise the serious health risks associated with the addiction such as COPD vulnerability for COVID-19 and consider quitting” shared the doctor.

Existing COPD patients must continue with their medications and refer their treating physician in case of difficulty in breathing and those with critical cases should resort to Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) and Long Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) in order to avoid exacerbation of COPD symptoms.

Once again they fell behind this time to Mainz but ended up with the win.

Bayern Munich 5-2 Mainz Allianz Arena

(Burkardt 32' Hack 44' — Kimmich 50' Sané 55' Süle 70' Lewandowski 76' pen. 83')

Five goals in 33 second half minutes turned a shock defeat in to a comfortable win as Bayern Munich continued their recent pattern of winning from a losing position.

This is is the eighth Bundesliga match in a row where they've trailed. But the champions have taken 18 points from those contests which included games against Borussia Dortmund Bayer Leverkusen and RB Leipzig the rest of the Bundesliga's top four.

""At the moment we need an alarm call to get into the game"" said Leroy Sané afterwards.

Turning it around

That call came when Manuel Neuer tipped Danny Latza's close-range effort on to the post shortly after halftime. Mainz's interim coach Jan Siewert must've had a sinking feeling.

Jonathan Burkardt had edged out Jerome Boateng to finish after half an hour and Alexander Hack's towering back post header had doubled the lead but no two-goal lead is safe against this Bayern team.

When the returning Joshua Kimmich nodded in Bayern's first the tide had turned. Leroy Sané drove inside to crash in a left-footed drive Niklas Süle's deflected effort gave Bayern the lead and then Robert Lewandowski extracted his pound of flesh first from the penalty spot then inside the six-yard box.

Though Hansi Flick's men seem to have mastered the comeback the Bayern coach was not comfortable relying on the eleven men he sent out to do the job. Leon Goretzka and Niklas Süle were sent on for struggling duo Benjamin Pavard and Jerome Boateng at the interval.

Energy-sapping style

But it was the challenge as well as the changes which seemed to invigorate the Bavarians. Eight titles in a row can easily lead to complacency and as with Borussia Dortmund there's been a measure of it in Bayern's recent displays. The relentless schedule of 2020 has also played a part with Flick often conceding his side have looked tired.

""It's really difficult when you keep going a goal down"" said Kimmich afterwards. ""We have to win games more easily because winning them like this costs energy.""

It does and with a jam packed six months ahead of them more controlled wins will be required. They may be the best team in the Bundesliga and in Europe but even Bayern surely can't afford to handicap themselves every week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYXZhcmlhbmZvb3RiYWxsd29ya3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMS8zLzIyMjExNzI4L2JheWVybi1tdW5pY2gtaGFuc2ktZmxpY2stcm9iZXJ0LWxld2FuZG93c2tpLWpvc2h1YS1raW1taWNoLW5pa2xhcy1zdWxlLWJ1bmRlc2xpZ2HSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Three and a half observations from Bayern Munich's 5-2 comeback win against Mainz,"Hansi Flick isn’t afraid to admit his mistakes

It became clear that whatever setup that Bayern Munich manager Hansi Flick put out today was not working from the get-go. Jerome Boateng’s lack of pace was severely exploited and the flanks were not helping the attack in any way. Flick wasted no time in making two crucial changes in Leon Goretzka and Niklas Süle letting Joshua Kimmich slide into right back. The changes paid off as the flanks became infinitely more productive and the midfield pressure soon returned with Goretzka’s introduction. Süle even scored a goal! Even the later introduction of Jamal Musiala was a success as he started the buildup for Robert Lewandowski’s second goal.

It takes a lot of courage to admit that you’re wrong and make such drastic changes right at halftime no less. Some coaches will just ignore the warning signs and play like everything is alright. Thankfully Hansi was not one of them.

The first half was absolutely horrendous

I know we won and everything but my goodness that first half was one to forget. Bayern had their chances but fluffed every single one of them and had it not been for Manuel Neuer in goal could have been down by more than two. Mainz’s counterattacks were immensely effective especially when playing against a rather slow Boateng. The attack was stagnant and the defense was porous. Thankfully as aforementioned Hansi Flick made the necessary changes and made Bayern play like Bayern again. Let’s hope he’s learned his lesson and we don’t have to sit through more halves like that.

Bayern play for the badge

That said what really won the game was the spirit that the players showed. I for one thought the game was over when the score read 2-0 I’ll shamelessly admit that. But clearly the players didn’t think so. After going two down yes TWO down the team didn’t give up. They started fighting right from the start of the second half and were rewarded with two quick goals. Then once the ball started rolling it was all Bayern. No excessive celebrations even though they made a dramatic comeback just pure will and determination on their faces.

Yes I know it’s only Mainz — second-from-bottom Mainz — but coming back from a two-goal deficit is not easy against any team especially the way that the teams respectively played in the first half. The will-to-win was still as evident as it was when the boys won the treble and long may it prosper. That will be the key to any more success going forward.

Bonus: Robert Lewandowski may be the best penalty taker in the world

Did you see the calm collected way he scored that penalty? Mind games with the keeper and a precise shot into the opposite corner. The last time Lewy missed a penalty was almost two years ago. The man is good at a lot of things and taking penalties is one of them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdmFuY291dmVyLmNpdHluZXdzLmNhLzIwMjEvMDEvMDMvY2FuYWRpYW4tY29tcGFuaWVzLXBheWluZy1ib251c2VzLWFuZC1ldmVuLWluY3JlYXNpbmctdGhlbS1hbWlkLWNvdmlkLTE5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Canadian companies paying bonuses — and even increasing them amid COVID-19,"TORONTO — Canadian companies may have spent the past year laying off staff and dealing with temporary closures stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic but that isn’t stopping many from rewarding workers this holiday season.

Several including the country’s top banks say they are planning to thank their staff for a year of hard work with year-end bonuses — and some are even topping up the amount.

An online survey of 600 senior managers from companies with 20 or more employees in Canada revealed 48 per cent plan to offer year-end bonuses this year.

The survey conducted by consulting firm Robert Half and research company Dynata between Nov. 20 and Dec. 7 also showed that 27 per cent plan to increase bonuses this year 59 per cent will keep them the same as previous years and 14 per cent will reduce them.

David King Robert Half’s Canadian senior district president said so many companies are paying a bonus and even upping them because the pandemic is making continuity and high performance more important.

“Companies still need to prioritize the retention of top-performing employees particularly at a time when many are taking on heavier workloads working remotely and balancing home or family commitments“ he said in an email.

Royal Bank of Canada the country’s second most valuable company on the TSX said it will offer bonuses to recognize everything its staff have done to support each other their clients and their communities in a tough year.

The Toronto-based bank decided to give bonuses after “considering the external environment and the long-term interests of shareholders and employees” said spokesperson Andre Roberts.

“This year RBC’s overall performance was impacted by the unprecedented challenges brought on by the global pandemic and while year-end results were down year-over-year our performance demonstrated the strength stability and operational resilience of our franchise” he said.

Fellow banks — TD Bank Group Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Bank of Montreal — also said they will be paying bonuses. Bank of Nova Scotia declined to provide any details about whether it will offer bonuses.

Meanwhile engineering firm Siemens Canada announced it will split $3.4 million between all employees that aren’t senior managers.

Each staff member will wind up getting $1550 said Siemens President Faisal Kazi said in a release announcing the bonus.

Claudine Mangen a Concordia University professor who has researched corporate disclosures wasn’t surprised to hear that companies are rewarding staff despite economic uncertainty.

Many businesses especially those in delivery or e-commerce like Amazon have done well during the pandemic so it wouldn’t make sense for them to withhold a bonus if their future is looking is bright she said.

E-commerce company Shopify Inc. eclipsed RBC to become the most valuable company on the TSX during the pandemic and reported massive profits as it helped small businesses switch to online sales.

The Ottawa-based company did not respond to a request for comment about what it is doing with bonuses.

But not every company had Shopify’s fortune. Many more laid off workers or slashed salaries or had to find a way to pivot to new businesses.

While Mangen expected those companies to stop or reduce year-end bonuses some may have a case for sticking with them she said.

“If you’re a company that has had to fundamentally change its business model… and you see certain employees that are really thriving in this new environment of course you don’t want them to be hired by somebody else” she said.

That incentivizes companies to toy with bonuses or non-monetary compensation like covering childcare costs or extended parental Mangen said.

Others will be more arbitrary with bonuses or offer different sums to employees in different areas of the company depending on how impacted some departments were by COVID-19 she said.

Top TSX companies Brookfield Asset Management Manulife Financial Corp. and CN Rail all declined to share any info about how they are handling bonuses.

So did Air Canada which has used rounds of layoffs to combat waning interest in travel amid COVID-19.

Enbridge spokesperson Tracie Kenyon said her company has yet to end its fiscal year so “it is too early to discuss 2020 bonuses.”

Trent Campbell of the Beaver Dam Area Development Corporation confirmed that construction continues at the Heritage Village shopping center 1645 N. Spring St. for a Marshalls a Ross and a Five Below. Campbell said the current construction is on schedule but the internal furnishing and stocking of the future stores is to be determined alongside the actual opening dates. He said the hope is for the stores to open in the spring but any date would be tentative.

Campbell said the coronavirus pandemic presented unique circumstances for a process that is usually “like clockwork” making it more fluid such as when knowing when orders will be in and so on.

The three new stores will fill the space left by the closure of the Boston Store nearly three years ago. City officials approved a development agreement last year offering incentives to the mall developers to help cover the costs of the project by taking advantage of the tax increment finance (TIF) district covering the mall area.

TIF districts allow the city to pay for incentives to developers by using the additional property tax revenue from new development not by raising residents’ property taxes. The TIF district was created to reduce blight in the mall area after the Boston Store closed and attract new development there including a Holiday Inn Express.

The agreement calls for the city to offer up to $800000 or 20 percent of project costs whichever is less to the mall developers not the retailers for Marshalls Ross and Five Below. The incentive would be paid when the tenants are moved in and would be in the form of a zero-interest forgivable loan due ten years after closing with no payments due during the term. The principal balance would be reduced up to ten percent for each year the businesses remain open.

The community development committee forwarded the agreement in May and the Common Council approved it in June.

The Boston Store closed in 2018 after serving as the anchor store at the mall since 2009. The mall first opened in 1981.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cruise line executives staff and shipboard crew have been working to develop and implement new health and safety protocols that will be in place when sailings resume again. And while some of these measures may only be in place for the duration of the global health pandemic others are likely here to stay.

Here is what Royal Caribbean is doing to keep its passengers safe when sailings resume:

The Healthy Sail Panel

Over the summer Royal Caribbean Group together with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings created its Healthy Sail Panel. The resulting document outlines 74 different best practices for the safe resumption of cruise from temporary amendments to services and amenities as a result of COVID-19 to long-term solutions that are here to stay.

The Healthy Sail Panel forms the basis of not only Royal Caribbean and Norwegian brands but for the broader industry as a whole. Many lines have adapted the Healthy Sail Panel's recommendations as well as recommendations set forth by the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA).

Mandatory Pre-Boarding COVID-19 Testing

CLIA has mandated that all member lines including Royal Caribbean perform COVID-19 PCR testing before allowing passengers and crew onboard. CLIA's directive applies to all vessels with a capacity over 250 passengers.

Mask Wearing Throughout the Vessel

If you're outside your cabin expect to wear your mask at all times unless seated eating or drinking. Royal Caribbean has put its masking rule in place in order to prevent transmission of viruses in places where physical distancing cannot occur.

Physical Distancing Measures

Physical distancing will have to be practiced throughout the ship. On early December sailings aboard Quantum of the Seas in Singapore decals were applied to floors and select seating roped off to ensure that minimum distancing requirements were met.

Digital Check-in And Electronic Muster Drill

Royal Caribbean will increase its reliance on technology including its own app to facilitate contactless check-in procedures at the terminal.

Another innovation is the new ""E-Muster"" lifeboat drill that no longer requires the ship's company to assemble all at once.

Instead passengers will watch a safety briefing on their smart device or stateroom television then visit their dedicated muster station at their leisure (but before sailing) to check-in with staff on-hand there.

Contact Tracing Bracelets

Passengers will be provided with a wearable bracelet (similar to the technology Royal Caribbean introduced aboard its Quantum class ships several years ago) that will enable contact tracing throughout the ship should a case of COVID-19 or any other communicable disease occur.

Reduced Self-Serve Options

While Royal Caribbean is not getting rid of the buffet it will be doing away with all self-serve options -- at least for now.

That means passengers will place their orders with staff members in the casual Windjammer Buffet and foot will be served to them. The same goes for coffee tea and water -- drinks that were formerly available under self-serve options.

Reservations Will Be Key

Reservations for dining and select entertainment venues will now be standard in order to limit crowd control and ensure physical distancing requirements are met.

In many ways this could be an improvement over cruising in the past: no longer will people spend half an hour sitting in an empty theatre each evening in order to be assured a seat for the nightly stage production.

Reserving time slots for shows and select entertainment venues also eliminates queuing which has for many been one of the primary stressors of big-ship cruising.

Ventilation Will Be Improved

Onboard ventilation will be improved across the Royal Caribbean fleet to ensure fresh air circulation at all times. Air will no longer be recycled inside the vessel and will instead be changed out as often as possible. Air will also be double-filtered to keep out smaller particles (like coronavirus) and will be changed out between 15 to 20 times per hour in larger public venues and 12 times per hour in staterooms.

For comparison the average large grocery store or retail outlet cycles air out only three to four times per hour.

Upgraded Medical Facilities

Onboard medical facilities will be upgraded both in terms of staffing and amenities. Medical centers will have at least two doctors with training in acute and intensive medical care along with four registered nurses. Royal Caribbean will upgrade all medical equipment onboard including hospital-grade ventilators a cardiac monitor a central oxygen system nebulizers defibrillators and external pacemakers and EKGs.

Ships will also carry COVID-19 PCR test kits onboard.

An Ongoing Situation

These are just a few of the major changes Royal Caribbean has implemented for its safe and healthy return to service both for the assurance of its passengers and crew.

As the industry inches closer to a full restart of cruise operations it is entirely likely that more health and safety measures will be rolled out. Some lines like Cunard have even taken the step of prohibiting those with certain acute medical conditions from travelling -- at least for now.

The overriding message from Royal Caribbean as with all other cruise lines is this: When they return to service it will be in a safe comfortable and healthy environment for all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vQ3J1aXNlLVRyYXZlbC9DcnVpc2luZy1uZXQtemVyby1jb21taXRtZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruising's net zero commitment,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelweekly.com/Cruise-Travel/Cruising-net-zero-commitment on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vQ3J1aXNlLVRyYXZlbC9DcnVpc2luZy1uZXQtemVyby1jb21taXRtZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

San Diego Padres manager Mike Shildt came to the defense of his right fielder saying Tatis is ""seeing way too many pitches up and in.""

The rant came after the Padres' 7-1 win over the NL West rival Arizona Diamondbacks.

Tatis ducked out of the way of a pitch near his head several innings after he hit a two-run home run.

""It's enough. It really is enough. If you want to throw in that's fine. But I don't know what people are trying to accomplish by throwing up and in. All you're doing is p---ing the guy off and it's uncalled for"" Shildt said. ""It's happening way too frequently and it's not something that we're going to tolerate much longer.

""Throwing inside is part of the game’’ Shildt added. ""We know this for 100-plus years. It’s part of it. And the inner half can be a battle between the pitcher and the hitter. We do it. We expect people to do it. It’s part of it. But I’ve seen way too many pitchers up and in on Tati.

""I mean listen if you want to throw up and in on the guy fine. But get away from the top of his body and definitely stay away from his head. That’s just not appropriate. And no hitter no pitcher nobody could defend it. I don’t get it. It’s not necessary. It’s not the way it needs to be played.""

YANKEES' AARON JUDGE GETS EJECTED FOR FIRST TIME IN CAREER AFTER 'BULLS--T' CALL

Tatis says it's simply just a strategy.

""Pitchers feel like that’s the only way to get me out"" he said.

But he says he has noticed there have been a few pitches near the danger zone.

""I’m trying to stay in the game but I feel like there’s been so many of those"" Tatis said. ""You're throwing at my head. So if you can’t go inside just figure it out and clean it up.""

Tatis received an 80-game suspension after testing positive for a banned substance in 2022 but he doesn't think it has anything to do with that. It's been well over a year at this point.

Tatis is without a doubt one of the more colorful players in the league though. When an opposing fan base mocked his suspension with a chant last season he danced to it. And his bat flips will always annoy plenty.

He's even had a brushback from his own organization.

When Tatis got suspended Padres general manager A.J. Preller seemed to insinuate Tatis was out of his circle of trust citing a lack of ""maturity."" Tatis had been injured in one of several of his motorcycle crashes over the previous offseason and the suspension came down just as he was about to return from injury.

Tatis is slashing .246/.333/.455 after winning a Gold Glove in right field last year his first year at the position. He finished in 14th in the NL MVP vote last year after finishing in fourth and third in 2020 and 2021 respectively.

Tatis signed a 14-year $340 million extension before the 2021 season after playing just 143 big league games.

Peyton Woodyard a four-star safety who committed to Alabama as part of its 2024 recruiting class in December and enrolled in the school for the spring semester entered the transfer portal in late April. He committed to the Ducks on Sunday. Woodyard is the second win for the Ducks this weekend as Michigan State transfer defensive tackle Derrick Harmon committed to the Ducks on Friday.

247Sports' recruiting analyst Greg Biggins describes Woodyard as ""a smart heady safety with an extremely high football IQ.""

Woodyard and Harmon are two massive additions for Oregon which now ranks second in the 247Sports transfer portal team rankings trailing only Ole Miss. The Ducks have added 14 players via the portal this offseason as they prepare for their first season in the Big Ten.

The biggest additions have been quarterback Dillon Gabriel from Oklahoma former five-star receiver Evan Stewart from Texas A&M and cornerback Jabbar Muhammad who helped rival Washington win the Pac-12 and reach the College Football Playoff title game last year. Then there's former five-star quarterback Dante Moore who comes to Oregon from UCLA. The Ducks are not just landing talent in the portal but plucking players from other top programs.

Ohio State is the favorite to win the Big Ten this season but even with Michigan coming off a national title many view the Ducks as the biggest threat to the Buckeyes in 2024. It would be a remarkable story for the Ducks to compete for a conference title in their first year in the league. It would certainly buck the trend of what normally happens when new schools enter one of the Power Four leagues but with the way Oregon has recruited at both the high school level as well as in the portal there may not be a team that's ever been in such a strong position to do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5kdHYuY29tL2luZGlhLW5ld3Mvcy1qYWlzaGFua2FyLXJlYWN0cy10by1jYW5hZGEtYXJyZXN0aW5nLTMtaW5kaWFucy1pbi1oYXJkZWVwLW5pamphci1tdXJkZXItNTU5MTE2NNIBeGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5kdHYuY29tL2luZGlhLW5ld3Mvcy1qYWlzaGFua2FyLXJlYWN0cy10by1jYW5hZGEtYXJyZXN0aW5nLTMtaW5kaWFucy1pbi1oYXJkZWVwLW5pamphci1tdXJkZXItNTU5MTE2NC9hbXAvMQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,S Jaishankar Reacts To Canada Arresting 3 Indians In Hardeep Nijjar Murder,"S Jaishankar said he had seen news of the arrests. (File)

India will wait for Canadian police to share information on the three Indian men it has arrested and charged with the murder of a Khalistani terrorist last year Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said on Saturday.

Canadian police charged the three on Friday over the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and said they were probing whether the suspects had links to the Indian government.

Mr Jaishankar said he had seen news of the arrests and said the suspects ""apparently are Indians of some kind of gang background... we'll have to wait for the police to tell us.""

""But as I said one of our concerns which we have been telling them is that you know they have allowed organized crime from India specifically from Punjab to operate in Canada"" said Mr Jaishankar.

Sanjay Verma India's high commissioner to Canada said that it hopes to get regular updates from Canadian authorities regarding the three arrested Indians.

""I understand that the arrests have been made as a result of investigations conducted by the relevant Canadian law enforcement agencies. This issue is internal to Canada and therefore we have no comments to offer in this regard"" Mr Verma added.

Cosmetics?

Sabrina Herlory - I’m not going to lie it was - and still is - hard! But at the same time it was exhilarating. The world to come is going to be like this: we’re all going to be disrupted 70000 times in our lives and we’re going to have to get out of our comfort zone more regularly. For managers like me this means making quick decisions based on partial information and no longer with full knowledge of the facts. And this is not an ability that can be learnt overnight it’s a muscle that you train throughout your life.

What measures have you taken to withstand the crisis?

Sabrina Herlory - We have trained our sales consultants in ""virtual selling"" i.e. one-to-one personalized advice at a distance. This has been appreciated by the teams who have suffered quite a lot during these periods of partial unemployment which are very depressing. They realized that even if there was pressure on the retail sector their occupation could evolve thanks to digital technology and not disappear!

And does ""virtual selling"" work for makeup?

Sabrina Herlory - Many doubted it but I can tell you that yes it’s very interesting from a human point of view and from a pure business point of view as well. The one-to-one digital concept is a bubble even more insulated than the physical experience in the store. It allowed us to maintain a connection with our customers who are used to human interaction when buying makeup. We launched these virtual appointments in September 2020 and 70% of the customers who received advice remotely then moved on to a physical store. Real remote personalized advice can channel traffic for brands when the stores reopen.

Is the humanization of digital the next step?

Sabrina Herlory - I’m convinced it is! This was the missing piece and the lockdown allowed us to implement it thanks to digital tools. It’s quite satisfying to say that yes there has been an explosion of the digital but what we’re learning is that consumers need to talk to real people! For me the brands that understand this will be the ones that will remain sustainable. If we can prove that the humanization of digital is turning into R.O.I. live chats will be one-to-one remote consultations will be one-to-one... Because we are all social animals with a real need for quality human interactions. And that goes beyond sales.

What does that mean?

Sabrina Herlory - Today if a brand is not organically socially committed to a 360-degree project I think it will not be able to count in the world to come: it’s ""how I treat customers my suppliers what footprint do I leave how do managers treat their employees"". I see more and more managers deeply preoccupied by this global commitment. They often come from the next generation I must say. They are socially engaged and that’s very gratifying!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdG93YXJkc2RhdGFzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9zZXR0aW5nLXVwLXB5dGhvbi1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC11c2luZy1naXRodWItYWN0aW9ucy05YTgxOTM2YmU1YznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Configure Github Actions the Easy Way. | by Salma El Shahawy,"Introduction

The historic Sherwin warehouse along Horton was the only building persevered when the former Sherwin-Williams paint factory was demolished in 2006. The building once supported the iconic “Cover The Earth” neon sign whose history we spotlighted last year.

The 3-story building consisting of 72000 square feet and is part of a larger 7.9 acre FDP that will include 500 housing units over two acres of park space ground floor commercial space the continuation of the Greenway and the city-funded bike/ped bridge to Bay Street.

DES Architects presented their plans to renovate and modernize the building to attract Life Science startups and office tenants.

The most dramatic update for the building will be the creation of a pass through “Alley” at 45th street allowing bicycle & pedestrian thoroughfare and breaking up the super-block the long structure created. The feature was a concession to neighbors of the 45th Street Artists’ Cooperative giving them more convenient access to the forthcoming park space.

The pass through will also include recessed linear downlighting and illuminated bollards. Renovations will also include street and landscaping improvements accessibility updates and roof screens to obscure the unsightly ventilation and mechanical equipment.

Shortly after the plans were approved a sale of the building was announced between Lennar Multifamily and Chicago-based Walton Street Capital. The deal was facilitated by New York-based Commercial Real Estate broker the The Newmark Group.

“1450 Sherwin represents a rare opportunity for an investor to acquire a fully-entitled large block vacancy with the ideal foundation for life science repositioning in one of the region’s hottest life science markets” Newmark’s Head of Northern California Capital Markets Steven Golubchik stated in a press release.

According to Newmark Walton Street Capital is actively acquiring and seeking acquisition of other Life Science opportunities located within the primary bay area clusters.

Emeryville appears to be in a strong position to build on its place as a hub for the flourishing Life Sciences sector. In addition to this project the city has seen the recent completion of the EmeryStation West tower approved plans for the Public Market’s Parcel B as well as the sale of the nearby Novartis property to BioMed Realty with plans to build another 561K square feet of office space.

When completed these projects will extend the Berkeley-Emeryville Biotech Corridor that already contains more than 150 life science companies.

According to Newmark research the Northern East Bay life sciences “footprint” totals over four million square feet and represents 15% of the total Bay Area market. They collectively boast an availability rate of just 5.6% with a current tenant demand of 630000 square feet.

That's about 59.5% of the price the mall traded for in 2015.

The Shops at Sunset Place in 2016

The parcel located at 5701 SW 72nd St. is situated along U.S. 1 a major road. It was originally developed as a site for Holsum Bakery and in the 1980s was transformed into the Bakery Centre Shopping Plaza. That was demolished in 1996 to make way for The Shops at Sunset Place which opened in 1999 with an FAO Schwarz and a Virgin Megastore both long closed.

The mall struggled with vacancies in recent years and Simon Property Group sold the property for $110M in 2015 to the publicly traded Maryland-based REIT Federal Realty Investment Trust along with local partners Grass River Property and the Comras Co. An annual report disclosed the mall was only 62% leased in 2019 though it still had major tenants including an AMC Theatres and an LA Fitness.

The owners planned to tear down half of the shopping complex about 80K SF of vacant retail space and replace it with three 17-story towers that would include apartments and hotel rooms. However the partners defaulted on a $61M loan during the coronavirus pandemic.

In November Federal Realty Investment Trust CEO Don Wood said the partners would be abandoning the redevelopment plans. On New Year's Eve FRIT Shops at Sunset Place Fee Owner LLC sold the property to Midtown Opportunities a Miami-based firm that developed portions of Midtown Miami including co-developing the recently opened 32-story GIO Midtown tower and it is developing 22 acres in Orlando.

“When the opportunity came to purchase Sunset Place a landmark property located in South Miami we jumped on it. For us this is about more than just real estate"" Alex Vadia principal of Midtown Development Midtown Opportunities’ development arm said in a statement. ""Although Midtown Opportunities has closed significant transactions in various key sectors South Miami is our home turf. We look forward to re-imagining the possibilities of Sunset Place alongside our community partners.”

Cheese’s Friendly’s other chains filed for bankruptcy in 2020,"This year saw a number of large chains file for bankruptcy. Some will close but many will survive.

As the coronavirus outbreak began to take hold in March some businesses closed in Maryland as retailers saw consumers shift to online purchases to avoid potential exposure to the virus. In-person dining was prohibited at restaurants in Maryland for months as carryout and delivery became the only option for eateries looking to stay operational.

The financial hemorrhaging of retailers and restaurants was felt strongly in Maryland where several companies closed their doors. Retail analyst firm Coresight Research estimates 8736 businesses shuttered in 2020 nationwide. Here is a list of many in Maryland that closed last year.

Permanently Closed

Catherine's: The affordable plus-sized clothing retailer for women announced it was shuttering all stores after parent company Ascena filed for bankruptcy in July. Maryland had four Catherine's stores: Capitol Heights Glen Burnie Waldorf and Windsor Mill.

These included three in Maryland: Jos. A Bank stores in Baltimore's Inner Harbor Gaithersburg Rockville and Severna Park as well as the Men's Wearhouse in Towson Town Center.

Smucker Co.’s expectations as elevated at-home consumption improved execution of the company’s strategy and momentum behind its brands led to a sharp gain in earnings in the period.

Net income for the period ended Jan. 31 rose 40% to $261.5 million equal to $2.32 per share on the common stock up from $187.4 million or $1.64 per share in the same period a year ago.

Quarterly sales rose 5% to $2.077 billion from $1.97 billion.

“We are delivering exceptional financial performance while significantly increasing investments in our brands strengthening our balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders all of which are important building blocks for supporting long-term growth and increasing shareholder value” Mark T. Smucker president and chief executive officer said during a Feb. 25 conference call with analysts.

US Retail Consumer Foods unit sales increased 5.8% to $447.6 million from $422.9 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Segment profit soared 32% to $110.9 million up from $84.2 million a year ago.

“The actions we have taken on the Jif brand led to over 20% sales growth on core peanut butter offerings” Mr. Smucker said. “In multi-outlet retail sales Jif was the fastest-growing national brand in the quarter increasing over 13% more than twice the category average. This growth reflects benefits of improved distribution and in-stocks strong marketing support pricing actions in response to higher costs and competitive supply disruption. The Jif brand gained over 3 points of volume and dollar share sequentially from the second quarter and our total peanut butter portfolio grew to over a 50% share of the peanut butter category.”

Mr. Smucker said the company’s Uncrustables business also delivered exceptional growth during the third quarter as net sales for the brand increased 21%.

“Household penetration is up 23% compared to a year ago” he said. “For our combined US Retail and Away From Home segments the Uncrustables brand delivered $100 million of net sales this quarter recording its 27th consecutive quarter of growth. The brand is on pace to deliver over $400 million of net sales this year and is on track to exceed our $500 million target in fiscal year 2023.”

Sales for Smucker’s US Retail Coffee business unit increased 12% during the quarter to $625.9 million from $558.8 million the year prior. Segment profit moved up 11% to $210.7 million from $189.5 million.

“The Dunkin’ and Café Bustelo brands as well as K-Cups have become an increasingly important part of our portfolio collectively growing over 20% and accounting for over 50% of segment net sales in this quarter” Mr. Smucker said. “Café Bustelo and Dunkin' are the two fastest-growing brands in the coffee category with 52-week sales up 28% and 21% respectively.

“The Dunkin’ brand has eclipsed $1 billion in all channel retail sales dollars inclusive of club and e-commerce over the past 12 months. The Folgers brand gained 3 million new households at the height of the pandemic and had the highest repeat rate by new consumers during the holiday season. Further our portfolio of brands gained more incremental households in the last year than any other manufacturer and has gained share in all channel consumption inclusive of club and e-commerce.”

Sales rose 6.4% to $768.6 million in Smucker’s largest business unit US Retail Pet Foods up from $721.9 million a year ago. Segment profit though fell 7.5% to $135.1 million from $146 million in the same period a year ago. The decline primarily reflected an $8.1 million legal settlement related to a supplier issue received in the prior year. Excluding this prior year impact Smucker said segment profit decreased $2.8 million primarily due to the impact of lower net pricing and higher costs partially offset by favorable volume/mix.

Smucker said its full-year net sales are expected to increase approximately 2% compared to the prior year up from earlier forecasts of 0% to 1% growth. The increase primarily reflects elevated at-home consumption benefiting the US Retail Coffee and US Retail Consumer Foods segments as well as a decline for the company’s Away From Home business the lapping of a $185 million incremental benefit to net sales related to COVID-19 in the fourth quarter of the prior year and $166 million of noncomparable sales in the prior year from the divested businesses.

Adjusted earnings per share guidance also was raised to $8.70 to $8.90 up from an earlier forecast of $8.35 to $8.65.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A scheduled exhibit of all 122 statues for elsewhere in Dallas (NorthPark Center) has been postponed until later in 2021 due to COVID-19 so DAL art specialist Rachel Simpson coordinated a pop-up preview exhibition at the airport as part of the Love Field Art Program.

The Dallas Love Field pop-up exhibit features 15 statues from the If/Then series. Ten statues in the secured side of the terminal represent women working in aviation/aerospace professions. Five statues in the unsecured main lobby feature women working in other STEM related career fields.

Here is the full list of the women whose statues are featured in the pop-up exhibition at Dallas Love Field and their bios can be found at the If/ThenSheCan website.

Adriana Bailey – Atmospheric Scientist National Center for Atmospheric Research

Charita Castro – Social Science Researcher Office of the US Trade Representative

Xyla Foxlin – Engineer Entrepreneur and Nonprofit Director Beauty and the Bolt

Miriam Fuchs – Telescope Systems Specialist East Asian Observatory

Joyonna Gamble-George – Health Scientist National Institutes of Health

Erika Hamden – Professor of Astrophysics University of Arizona

Kelly Korreck – Astrophysicist Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Adele Luta – Scientist and Innovator Oceaneering

Jenn Makins – STEM Educator and Inventor Parish Episcopal School

Amanda Masino – Biologist Professor and Research Director Huston-Tillotson University

Tiffany Panko – Women’s Health Researcher Rochester Institute of Technology

Jasmine Sadler – Dancing Rocket Scientist and STEAM Entrepreneur The STEAM Collaborative

Nikki Sereika – Aviation Maintenance Technician Southwest Airlines

Nicole Sharp – Aerospace Engineer and Science Communicator Sharp Science Communication Consulting

Mary Beth Westmoreland – Vice President Amazon

To make each statue the subject stands in a scanning booth that uses 89 cameras and 25 projectors to generate a 3D image. It then takes a special machine about 10 hours to print/build the full-sized 3D human figure with layers of acrylic gel.

Why statues?

The larger If/Then project is an initiative of Lyda Hill Philanthropies and is designed to give young girls a look at a wide variety of career options especially those in STEM careers where women are grossly underrepresented.

The If/Then initiative believes that ‘IF she can see it THEN she can be it’ and says that the creation and exhibition of the statues “is just one of the ways If/Then is promoting positive portrayals of women in the images young people see in everyday life hoping to pique their interest in STEM careers.”

The group notes that the people a society chooses to honor with statues says a lot about culture and values.

Lyda Hill Philanthropies cites a 2016 study led by former Treasurer of the United States Rosie Rios that found the 10 largest US cities publicly display fewer than a half-dozen statues of real women.

“Women make up less than 30% of today’s STEM workforce – could there be a connection?” the If/Then initiative asks.

The statues featuring women in STEM professions is their answer: “Seeing is believing. When a girl sees a woman successfully pursuing a STEM career (and having fun!) she is more likely to imagine a STEM career for herself … and perhaps even change the world.”

The pop-up If/Then exhibit at Dallas Love Field will run through 9 March 2021. And now that this subset of statues of women working in aviation and aerospace has been gathered Lyda Hill Philanthropies says it is open to bringing the temporary exhibit to other airports that may be interested.

It hasn’t flown in 6 years but has continued to serve as an employer in Gaza. Down to just two Fokker 50 aircraft those were returned from lease by Niger Airlines during the pandemic.

The 1995 Oslo II Accord included international funding for Yasser Arafat International Airport in the Gaza Strip. Saudi Arabia and the Netherlands donated a Boeing 727 and 2 Fokker 50s to help launch Palestinian Airlines.

The airline began service in 1997 from Port Said and Arish in Egypt to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and Amman Jordan. When the new Gaza airport opened they moved in and launched routes to 5 countries in the region and added an Ilyushin Il-62 to their fleet.

But the airline’s operations were shut down during the Second Intifada which began in the fall of 2000 after the 2000 Camp David Summit failed to reach an agreement (July) and Ariel Sharon (peaceful yet provocative despite advance notice to Palestinian authorities) visited the holy site at the Temple Mount (September). In 2001 Israel destroyed the airport’s control tower and radio tower in 2001 and bulldozed the runway in 2002 to prevent the airline from smuggling weapons into the territory and as a response to killing of Israeli soldiers.

The airline again moved to El Arish International Airport 29 miles away in Egypt but this wasn’t viable. Egypt could take up to a day to process Palestinians crossing the border. Palestinian Airlines shut down in 2005.

A brief restart of service again based at El Arish in Egypt was attempted in 2012. They offered flights to Cairo Jeddah and Amman. But it was no more viable seven years later and the Fokker 50 service was halted after less than two years. Their two remaining planes were leased to Niger Airlines and Palestinian Airlines hadn’t flown since 2014.

Niger Airlines returned the leased aircraft in summer 2020. At this point Paleistinian Airlines reportedly still had 140 employees. The Palestinian Authority has announced Palestinian Airlines will be liquidated (at closure they reported just 2 pilots 3 administrative staff and 3 ground staff). The Fokker 50s are for sale.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9odW1hbi1pbnRlcmVzdC8zLWRlYWQtYWZ0ZXItcGxhbmUtY3Jhc2hlcy1pbnRvLW1pY2hpZ2FuLWhvbWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Family of 3 Killed After Their Plane Crashes Into Michigan Home,"Three people were killed after their plane crashed into a Michigan home.

After responding to the scene on Saturday the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement they found the house which was located just north of the Oakland/Southwest Airport “fully engulfed” in flames.

“We have confirmed there are three fatalities at the scene [are] believed to be the occupants and pilot of the plane” the police said in a statement while the local fire department noted that the ""occupants of the house made it out safely.""

Although the police have yet to share the names of the victims the Home Builders Association of Southeastern Michigan released a statement identifying the deceased.

“It is with the deepest sorrow that we let you know of the death of HBA's 2020 President David S. Compo his wife Michelle and their son Dawson this afternoon when their private plane crashed into a home in Lyon Township just a half a mile from the Oakland Southwest Airport which was their destination” the association wrote. “The family had flown to Canton Georgia on December 29 and was returning home today.”

The home impacted by the crash belonged to a family of five according to CNN affiliate WDIV. While the parents and their three children survived the crash their pet cat did not.

A GoFundMe has been set up to help cover the costs of repairing the home.

According to one neighbor after the crash there was “so much smoke” that “you couldn’t even see the house.”

“There was a huge cloud of smoke really tall flames and we thought the whole house was going to be gone” Chase Southwick told WDIV.

Another neighbor shared that a plane crash has “always been my biggest fear” about living in the area. “With the airport being there I knew one of these days one of those planes would have to go down for whatever reason"" they told WXYZ Detriot.

The crash is currently under investigation."

(NYSE:SWK) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Stanley Black & Decker Inc. (NYSE:SWK) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 2 2024

Stanley Black & Decker Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.56 expectations were $0.55. Stanley Black & Decker Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange you may begin.

Dennis Lange: Thank you Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 first quarter webcast. Here today in addition to myself is Don Allan President and CEO; Chris Nelson COO EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning Don Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.

And as we normally do we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO Don Allan.

Don Allan: Thank you Dennis and good morning everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent solid execution and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy. We are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin. This is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24 versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022.

Story continues

Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results. Specifically we have captured 1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024 consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations. We believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months.

As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20% which is predominantly our cyclically depressed outdoor business and the rapidly recovering aerospace fastener business. We are actioning significant cost efficiencies to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as widebody plane production continues to recover. Our long-term success will be driven by improved profitability coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand.

We are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023 ACE Hardware named Craftsman as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award. Congratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners it's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return.

Turning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down 1 point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand. Adjusted gross margin was 29% up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. We are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50 up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. On April 1 we completed the sale of STANLEY Infrastructure to Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet. Looking forward in 2024 we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. At the same time we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses. I want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward.

I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance.

Chris Nelson: Thank you Don and good morning everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor first quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion down 1% organically versus prior year as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand which pressured volume. Pricing was relatively flat consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain and organic growth. Now turning to the product lines.

Power tools was up 1 point organically led by pro-driven growth in DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high margin DEWALT cordless. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand. Outdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data which showed an early start to the season versus prior year. We are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last two years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays. The independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory which pressured shipments in the quarter.

We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025. As Don alluded earlier the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure. Consistent with our overall strategy our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the UK.

We are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share. In aggregate all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America Brazil Mexico Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter. In summary for Tools & Outdoor we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength. We are making deliberate investments in our brands market activation and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to the long-term shareholder returns.

I will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and engineered passing volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and a point of currency pressure. Within the Industrial segment Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. We believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening. Industrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1% an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity.

A toolbox filled with an array of different tools representing the professional products of the company.

This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced. The quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year. Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode ramp-up time is eliminated between shots.

DEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20-volt MAX cordless 2-1/4 Peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site. Additionally our TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps PROs maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites. These are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive.

We believe these innovations coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains. As we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT Craftsman and STANLEY. Thank you and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.

Pat Hallinan: Thanks Chris and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately 145 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the period bringing our aggregate savings to approximately 1.2 billion since program inception. As we focus our portfolio streamline our business structure and transform our operations our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure. Given the dynamic macro environment we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025.

Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components finished goods and indirect expenditures. Our operations excellence program which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities. A pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming which are more event-driven will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.

We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025. And -- the manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter which affected five sites with the goal to complete the site modifications this year. Regarding product platforming this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.

In aggregate our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024 improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases. This quarter our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately 360 million where we've traditionally averaged a roughly 700 million increase in the first quarter of the year.

Days of inventory is now approximately 150 days an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days. We used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet. We remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. For the full year 2024 we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency. CapEX is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives.

These items combined with organic cash generation support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent investing in organic growth and our transformation funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. We expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024 and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year.

We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s. We are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls.

Our view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Infrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly. Our planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024.

These are designed to accelerate innovation market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley brands. This should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.

Our adjusted EPS range remains $1 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million largely relating to the supply chain transformation program with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024 with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.

Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25% with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile. In summary we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion cash generation balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market. We are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that I will now pass the call back to Don.

Don Allan: Thank you Pat. As we report another quarter of progress our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team. As our profitability continues to improve we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands particularly DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley. We believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2x to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools and Outdoor and Engineered Fastening. We are focused on consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. With that we are now ready for Q&A Dennis.

Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks Don. Shannon we can now start the Q&A please. Thank you.

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

(NASDAQ: SBUX) had a bumpy year in FY2020 but it appears to be on the right path for FY2021. The company has a clear growth strategy for the year ahead and the China market forms a key part of this plan. The coffeehouse chain sees significant growth opportunity in this region and continues to invest meaningfully to drive growth here.

Q4 and FY2020 performance

Starbucks’ global comparable store sales declined 9% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Comp store sales in China fell 3% with comparable transactions down 7%. This was partly offset by an increase of 5% in average ticket. For the full year of 2020 comp sales in China were down 17% driven by a 21% drop in comparable transactions but slightly offset by a 5% growth in average ticket.

Starbucks ended Q4 with 32660 stores globally with stores in the US and China comprising 61% of this portfolio. At the end of Q4 the company had 4706 stores in China.

Strategy

Starbucks’ store fleet forms a key part of its growth strategy in China. After opening 259 new stores in the fourth quarter of 2020 the company is working on opening 600 new stores in the region during the full fiscal year of 2021.

Starbucks has a strong presence in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities and it plans on expanding further in these areas through its Reserve stores and Starbucks Now concepts. The company plans to roll out the Starbucks Now format in over 10% of its new stores in China in FY2021. Looking ahead Starbucks aims to have 6000 stores across 230 cities by the end of FY2022.

Starbucks’ investments in its digital capabilities such as mobile order and pay and delivery offerings are also paying off. At the end of Q4 the company had 13.5 million 90-day active members across its 4700 stores. Digital sales mix rose to 26% in the most recent quarter more than double versus last year.

Starbucks continues to expand its product offerings through its plant-based GOOD GOOD menu and its Tea Cloud platform. These are also expected to help drive growth going forward.

Outlook

For fiscal year 2021 Starbucks expects comparable store sales growth of 27-32% in China. In FY2022 new store openings is expected to continue with a net unit growth rate in the low teens. Starting in FY2023 the company expects comp store sales to grow 2-4% annually based on its belief that it can capture additional market share through investments in its digital capabilities and store fleet.

Competition

Luckin Coffee (OTC: LKNCY) which was once seen as a formidable opponent to Starbucks in China has had a nasty fall from grace. Following a round of allegations and investigations earlier this year it was found that the company’s 2019 revenues were inflated by more than RMB2 billion. This led to a change in management and the company reaching an agreement with the SEC to pay penalties.

Even though Luckin’s shares have jumped massively in the past three months the stock appears to have lost its charm and most analysts recommend staying away from it.

The 12-year-old daughter of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt was seen picking up a cold drink from Starbucks with her body guard in Los Angeles. She donned a white sweater black shorts and black sneakers along with a blue protective face mask while pulling her light brown tresses back into a ponytail. It’s hard to believe how quickly she’s growing up!

Despite years of back and forth Vivienne’s parents are still involved in court proceedings over custody of their six kids. The Once Upon a Time in Hollywood actor 57 and Maleficent actress 45 also share Shiloh 14 Knox 12 Pax 17 Zahara 15 and Maddox 19. Just last month it was reported that Vivienne her twin brother Knox and Shiloh would be with their dad on Christmas Day. “They can spend the night with him on Christmas Eve” a source told Us Weekly in a December 23 report. It also noted that Brad and Angelina previously discussed spending the holidays as a family when they were “getting along” earlier this year. However it appeared their plans changed.

Back in November Angelina took a loss when a judge denied her attempt to have the judge overseeing the couple’s custody case Judge John W. Ouderkirk replaced. As HollywoodLife previously reported in August Angelina filed court documents in LA requesting that he be removed due to his alleged previous relationship with Brad‘s attorney Anne C. Kiley. In response Brad fired back in separate court documents obtained by HollywoodLife. “Jolie’s abrupt cry of judicial bias reeks of bad faith and desperation not to mention careless disregard for the procedural rules intended to root out legitimately conflicted judicial officers” the Fight Club actor‘s attorneys stated in the legal documents. “Unfortunately the individuals hurt most by Jolie’s transparently tactical gambit are the parties’ own children who continue to be deprived of a final resolution to these custody issues.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWF0ZGVhbHMuY29tLnNnLzIwMjEvMDEvMDMvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWNueS1veC1jb2xsZWN0aW9uLW1lcmNoLWphbi0yMDIx0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ3JlYXRkZWFscy5jb20uc2cvMjAyMS8wMS8wMy9zdGFyYnVja3MtY255LW94LWNvbGxlY3Rpb24tbWVyY2gtamFuLTIwMjEvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks to launch ‘Year of the Ox’ Lunar New Year Collection including a Money Bank from Jan 4,"There's also a Ox Bearista

Police said 262 people in St. Louis last year — five less than the record of 267 set in 1993. But because the city's population has declined since 1993 the homicide rate was much higher in 2020.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the city's hit 87 per 100000 residents in 2020 the highest on record since 1970. The figure exceeds the previous high of 69 per 100000 people set in 1993.

City leaders and experts said the stress caused by the coronavirus pandemic last year likely contributed to the in in the nation's largest cities. But St. Louis' homicide rate was already high in 2019.

Richard Rosenfeld a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis said violent crime rose sharply in 28 U.S. cities he reviewed starting last May — around the time many stay-at-home orders related to the pandemic were ending.

“St. Louis sees a similar spike that we saw elsewhere but what’s different is its starting level was already so high” Rosenfeld said.

Kansas City recorded 180 homicide victims in 2020 the highest number of killings in a single year in its history as gun violence surged nationwide.



The last time the city saw anywhere close to as many homicides was 2017 when it recorded 155 killings including four fatal police shootings The Kansas City Star reports.

In addition to the  2020 also marked a dramatic surge in nonfatal shootings. More than 620 people were shot and survived — a statistic that Mayor Quinton Lucas described as “crazy” and “embarrassing.”

The city’s current response to killings is “not smart” said Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker. If the approach doesn’t change she said Kansas City will continue to have a “disgusting homicide rate” year after year.

Baker was the chief architect of a previous anti-violence strategy KC NoVA which garnered national attention after killings dropped to 86 in 2014 the fewest in Kansas City in more than four decades. The police department under Chief Rick Smith abandoned the strategy after he took the helm in 2017.

In September Lucas announced a new effort aimed at reducing violence called Reform Project KC. The focus is meant to be on prevention intervention enforcement and administrative reforms.

With the win Sunday SCSU took a two point lead over UMD and North Dakota for first place in the NCHC . The Bulldogs and Huskies will meet again five days late at Amsoil Arena in Duluth for the first home games of 2020-21 for the UMD men’s hockey program.

“Disappointing” UMD coach Scott Sandelin said of Sunday’s result. “We had opportunities in the first period with power plays to take the lead and we didn’t do that. I thought they got some momentum off that. I felt like we chased the game the rest of the game. We made a very good push in the third and got caught on a line rush. They capitalized and that was the difference.”

All three of the Huskies goals Sunday came from their two Finnish forwards.

Sophomore Jami Krannila of Nokia Finland recorded the game-winner with just over five minutes to play in regulation capping a 4-on-2 rush for the Huskies by tapping the puck in backdoor.

Veeti Miettinen a freshman wing out of Espoo Finland had two goals for the Huskies. He broke a scoreless tie in the opening minute of the first period driving through the middle of the UMD zone and firing a laser into the back of the net to score. He added an insurance goal on the power play with 1:07 left in the game.

“It was kind of that body blow theory” Huskies coach Brett Larson — the Duluth native and former Bulldog player and assistant coach — said of the win. “We were able to give a few more body blows to try and score one later. Last night we weren’t able to get any. They body blowed us to death last night. It was the opposite. I was happy with the way we were able to turn that around.”

The Bulldogs who won 4-3 in overtime on Saturday  had three power plays in the opening period Sunday but failed to score on either advantage.

UMD wouldn’t get another power play until almost six minutes into the third period and just as they did Saturday the Bulldogs converted. Junior center Jackson Cates took a feed from freshman defenseman Wyatt Kaiser and one-timed a bullet into the back of the net to tie the game at 1-1.

“We had a couple of good keeps in the zone and then Kaiser made a good play on the blue line” Cates said. “He was able to get it over to me and I was fortunate to bury it.”

Kaiser’s special teams heroics continued on a penalty kill that came just over a minute after Cates tied the game. UMD junior center Jesse Jacques was called for holding but Kaiser made sure the Huskies didn’t capitalize blocking three hard shots to keep the game tied.

“The penalty kill was outstanding” Sandelin said. “You see a guy sacrifice like that it’s a good sign. It’s a good uplifting thing for your team. The bench was up after that. That was an important kill and unfortunately they got the game winner.”

Thumbs up to the Bulldogs penalty kill

After giving up three power play goals on four penalties Saturday — and finishing the night 3-for-6 because of a major penalty — the Bulldogs penalty kill redeemed itself by holding the Huskies to just one power play on four advantages on Sunday. SCSU’s lone power play goal came in the closing minutes of the game when the Bulldogs were pushing to tie the game shorthanded.

“There are a lot of small details that go into the PK” said Kaiser who finished with four blocked shots Sunday. “We watched some film and tightened up on those things. We executed.”

The penalty kill not only executed it created a burst of momentum for UMD in the third thanks to the shot-blocking efforts of a 6-foot 175-pound freshman defenseman.

It also created a scoring chance as well in the second. UMD — already with two goals on the penalty kill this year — nearly picked up a third shorty via a solo breakaway by junior wing Cole Koepke off a faceoff. Koepke’s stick snapped as he released his shot and the puck sailed out of play.

UMD’s penalty kill entered the weekend at 81.1% but finishes at 76.1%. That’s good for only sixth in the league going into the rematches next week with St. Cloud State.

“The guys have pride” Sandelin said of the penalty kill. “It was much better tonight and hopefully the guys feel better about the job they did tonight.”

Thumbs down to the power play

The power play came through for the Bulldogs in the third period for the second night in a row Sunday but as Sandelin said it needed to get going earlier in the game. It needed to score off one of the three advantages in the first period the coach said.

UMD’s first power play came four minutes in when senior Easton Brodzinski — who had two power play goals for the Huskies on Saturday — was called for slashing. St. Cloud State’s penalty kill came out aggressive pressuring the Bulldogs throughout. Sandelin said his team wasn’t ready for it.

“I thought our intensity level wasn’t good enough” Sandelin said. “We got a big goal when (Jackson Cates) scored to tie it but we had an opportunity there with the three power plays to build an early lead on a team we won an emotional game with last night. I think that was certainly a difference in the game to make them chase the game instead of us chasing the game.”

UMD was 2-for-4 on the power play Saturday but finished 1-for-5 on the advantage Sunday. They generated just four shots on goal during the three first period power plays with zero coming on that first chance.

“They were way more aggressive it was hard for us to get set up” Cates said. “We have to execute on those three power plays. That’s the difference between a win or not.”

2. SCSU sophomore center Jami Krannila — The game-winning goal plus two assists.

1. SCSU freshman wing Veeti Miettinen — The Huskies leading scorer with seven goals and eight assists has a goal in each of the last five games. He finished with two goals and an assist Sunday.

But those who deal closely with water will tell you this is false. There is plenty. It is just in the wrong places.

Cibola Ariz. is one of the wrong places. Home to about 300 people depending on what time of year you’re counting the town sits on the California border in a stretch of the Sonoran Desert encircled by fanglike mountains and seemingly dead rocky terrain. Driving across the expanse where the temperature often hovers near 115 degrees I found myself comforted by the sight of an oncoming eighteen-wheeler carrying bales of hay which at least implied the existence of something living where I was headed.

Thanks to the Colorado River which meanders through town Cibola is a verdant oasis that chatters at dusk with swooping birds. Along both banks a few hundred acres produce lush alfalfa and cotton amid one of the more arid and menacing environments in North America.

This scene is unlikely to last though. A few years ago a firm called Greenstone a subsidiary of a subsidiary of the financial-services conglomerate MassMutual quietly bought the rights to most of Cibola’s water. Greenstone then moved to sell the water to one of the right places: Queen Creek a fast-growing suburb of Phoenix 175 miles away full of tract houses and backyard pools."

T-Mobile said in a statement emailed to The Verge that it had notified “less than 0.2 percent” of its customers— which works out to about 200000 people— that some account information may have been illegally accessed. That information “may have included phone numbers number of lines subscribed to and in a small number of cases some call-related information collected as part of normal operation and service.” T-Mobile says it “identified this attack in early December and quickly shut down the incident.” Affected customers were notified via text message.

In a notice on its website T-Mobile said its security team “shut down malicious unauthorized access” and it began an investigation to determine what information was involved. The company reported the situation to federal law enforcement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob25lYXJlbmEuY29tL25ld3MvdW5sb2NrZWQtZ2FsYXh5LXMtMjAtbW9kZWxzLXJlY2VpdmUtYW5kcm9pZC0xMS11cGRhdGVfaWQxMjkyODbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Android 11 One UI 3.0 update is more widely disseminated in the states to Galaxy S20 series,"According to Android Police word keeps coming in from U.S. owners of the unlocked Samsung Galaxy S20 series phones about the Android 11 update that they just received.

Reports about the update becoming available for unlocked units in the states first were seen on December 21st.

The update (with Android 11 and the One UI 3.0 interface) hit the unlocked U.S. Galaxy S20 series not too long after it started to surface on carrier-locked models from Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T.

Here is the list of 10 best services in USA.

In United States of America mobile SIM network faces problem due vast area and less network coverage. Also many network providers offer pricey services. Now with 4G roll out in the entire country their is an increase in competition to gain more potential customers by offering the best value for money services. In the US you will find a lot of MVNOs and tempting GSM prepaid plans for various categories of customer. Some mobile operators are expensive but provide high speed while some are cheap but have poor services and some others are so-so in terms of speed and customer satisfaction. Even though having such a large network USA faces problems with connectivity and stability. We have come up with the list of best mobile SIM providers in the USA.

The following rankings are based on research polls reviews and surveys. Here is the list of best GSM and CDMA mobile SIM network in the USA:

1. Verizon Wireless

Verizon Wireless is the biggest and most widespread cell phone carrier in America. Verizon Wireless offers some of the fastest 4G mobile internet with speeds reaching up to 11 Mbps download and 3.5 Mbps upload. In peak hours it is even possible to see Full HD videos without any buffering. It offers nationwide coast-to-coast coverage with consistency. According to independent testing and analytic agency RootMetrics Verizon offers the best connectivity strongest reliability and highest average speeds across both urban and rural areas. But its contract service high price ($60-$750) and non-refundable clause may set you back if you have a tighter budget.

Verizon Wireless is the best of the best and their services may be worth paying that little bit extra.

2. T – Mobile

T-Mobiles SIM network used to be weakest of the top four nationwide mobile carriers but with time this underdog carrier has shown its potential. T-Mobile built on GSM provides great value for money. Every T-Mobile prepaid plan comes with unlimited talk text and data with a very high speed. But company’s rural coverage is substandard. If you live in a metropolitan area you’re probably safe but stepping out too far into the suburbs will cause connectivity problems.

With excellent monthly plans aggressive & appealing prices wide device selection offers and superb speed T-Mobile should be your first choice especially if you live in cities.

3. AT&T

AT&T’s network is one of the biggest carriers in the country. AT&T provides good speeds has solid coverage and provides excellent device selection options including tablets hotspots Data cards and all of the latest mobile phones at subsidised prices. Its LTE services in over 650 markets provide fast data rates averaging over 7 Mbps. But on other hands it has the distinction of being the most expensive.

If you are looking for something with high speed and stability with good rural coverage then AT&T is for you. But its high pricing could be a critical factor.

4. Sprint

Sprint operates one of the largest mobile networks in the country and offers features such as unlimited 4G unlike others who restrict the usage. The best thing Sprint has going for it is its pricing which is quite reasonable offering the best bang for your buck. Sprint’s weakest attribute is its network even though it covers more of the United States than T-Mobile (but less as compared to Verizon or AT&T). You may have to deal with dropped calls low signals or other connectivity issues. It provides an average speed of 4.4 Mbps which is much lower as compared to others.

It’s offering of cheap prices and unlimited data are definitely non-arguable but its poor speed and connectivity may point at issues.

5. U.S. Cellular

U.S. Cellular SIM network is one of the oldest in the United States yet the network only covers a fraction of Americans. While you can get 3G coverage across the country thanks to partnerships with other carriers U.S. Cellular’s 4G LTE towers only cover Iowa Nebraska North Carolina and select counties. One of the selling points for U.S. Cellular touts is its reward points program. Noteworthily it is just as expensive as AT&T and Verizon with the infamous contract plan.

U.S. Cellular is only worth if you never need to travel beyond its coverage region. It is a solid alternative to some of the bigger names in the region.

6. Cricket Wireless

Cricket Wireless network acquired by AT&T runs on pair with AT&T’s solid network with fast 4G. Cricket competes with other low-cost prepaid networks. Cricket’s plan includes unlimited talk text and high and unlimited internet data speed. It offers superfast upload speed ranging from 4 to 6 Mbps. Its download speed could be up to 8 Mbps max while basic could be low. The customer care service are not responsive when it comes to switching the devices. Coming to the price they are a bit on the higher side compared to what it offers.

With no disturbance of contract & good unlimited speed and AT&T support it is a good pick for many.

7. MetoPCS

MetroPCS is a prepaid provider offering a plan with unlimited 4G data. It runs on T-Mobile which offers some fastest data speed in the country. MetroPCS offers some competitive data plans starting at around 35$ with unlimited call text and limited data. And for $60 it offers unlimited high-speed data. As it runs on T-Mobile you could expect some very high speed on LTE and good coverage But it has very limited mobile device selection options which mostly include Android phones.

If you are picking a smartphone which is available under their device options then getting MetroPCS SIM is really worth it as it offers exceptional speed at very low and affordable price bracket.

8. Ting

Ting SIM network is an MVNO or mobile virtual network operator. The coverage of ting is substandard which runs on sprints CDMA network. It also doesn’t offer unlimited talk and text. Ting is not suitable for heavy users and it also doesn’t have many latest smartphones to the list. Ting has excellent customer service team.

Ting network is very good for those who have minimum phone usage as you have to pay only for how much you use. It is not suitable for heavy data users. As it runs on sprint CDMA network make sure you have coverage in your area.

9. Consumer cellular

Consumer cellular does not provide unlimited call and text but the limited one is cheap and inexpensive. Consumer Cellular has a lot of attractive plans that are more flexible than some others. The company offers two separate plans in the form of call and data ranging from different price bars. Thanks to AT&T network the consumer cellular provides some good coverage and net speed. Heavy users may not get much much this SIM provider. The customer support is terrible and misleading.

AT&T provides solid coverage but it has its limitations. Consumer cellular is best suited for AARP members and retired family.

10. Boost Mobile

Boost is a prepaid SIM provider and has some of the most affordable price plans under its roof. Boost mobile runs on Sprint’s network so if you have a phone that works on it then you can try Boost’s cheap prepaid plan starting at around 30$. It doesn’t offer many device selection options other than Android and IOS. You may find some issues with call drop or internet connectivity. Customer support is poor.

With the trust of Sprint networks speed & coverage and affordable prepaid plans boost mobile is a good choice for whose having a particular habit of use.

This year Rockstar Games is releasing an ""expanded and enhanced"" version of Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online for the PS5 Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Meanwhile it's believed that it's also already hard at work on GTA 6 which is likely PS5 Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X-bound as well. That said many GTA fans would love to see the developer return to previous releases. From San Andreas to Vice City entries from yesteryear are begging for a remaster or remake but at this point it's foolish to expect Rockstar Games to go back to these wells.

That said while Rockstar Games may never go back to these earlier releases YouTuber ""XXII"" has with a new video for ""GTA: San Andreas Definitive Edition"" a fan-made trailer that reimagines the game as a PS5 remaster.

As you can see the trailer gives the game a visual upgrade and while it's far from perfect it does provide a taste of what a remaster of the game could look like. And as you would expect all of the major characters -- CJ Big Smoke Ryder Officer Frank Tenpenny Kendl Cesar and Sweet -- are all present.

While it's unlikely Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive will remaster or remake GTA San Andreas there's a good chance it alongside a few other nostalgic entries will be re-released on PS5 just like it Vice City and more were re-released on PS4 last generation. That said for now this hasn't been confirmed. What GTA fans can look forward to this year is an ""expanded and enhanced"" version of GTA 5 and who knows maybe a GTA 6 reveal too.

When the Highland-cross cows reach a certain point the blue plastic medallion dangling from their necks plays a melody like a mobile phone ringtone. The cow turns around and the invisible GPS fence has done its job.

Fenceless grazing is being hailed as revolutionary by conservationists and farmers particularly in beautiful sensitive or rough upland landscapes that are impractical expensive or undesirable to fence.

The technology is being embraced by rewilders who want cows to mimic the grazing of extinct wild herbivores such as aurochs and move through wider landscapes in a natural way ensuring their grazing creates mosaics of habitat and boosts rare flora.

“This is a gamechanger for us” said Charlie Burrell of the rewilded Knepp estate which is keen to embrace the technology. “If we can restrict or move grazing animals through the landscape without fences or wolves it’s just bloody brilliant. We can use animals as tools to encourage biodiversity and we simply use an app to draw a line around sensitive areas where we don’t want the animals to spend any time.”

In Cumbria 19 cows on the RSPB reserve of Geltsdale have successfully trialled the £300-per-collar technology as part of a North Pennines AONB Partnership project funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund.

David Morris of the RSPB said: “The habitat change we’ve seen has been absolutely fantastic. The cows have got into the coarse vegetation areas and broken it up diversifying and improving the habitat. The technology has allowed us to do that in a really smart and sustainable way.”

The cows have been fenced away from springs so they won’t pollute the watercourse and they can even be fenced away from individual wild flowers such as orchids or ground-nesting birds if required.

Emma Wright of the North Pennines AONB said that since the RSPB’s successful trial at Geltsdale other Cumbrian landowners were keen to use the technology as hill-farmers looked for more wildlife-friendly alternatives to intensive sheep-grazing.

“These collars allow us to get larger animals such as cows that create a perfect variety of sward into this really difficult upland terrain and help manage grassland and wood-edges for really picky species such as ring ouzel and black grouse” said Wright. “Fences in the uplands can also be a problem for species such as black grouse which die when they collide with them.”

The technology has also been used in Wanstead Park and Epping Forest for long a pioneer in fenceless systems to ensure grazing animals can mix with large numbers of visitors and it is being rolled out in several dozen locations around Britain.

The fenceless grazing system was devised by a Norwegian company Nofence. Landowners simply draw a map on their phone app of the area they want fenced. The solar-powered GPS collars play a melody to alert the animals when they approach the invisible fenceline. If they cross it the collar administers a small electric pulse like an electric fence. After a short training session with the collars the cows swiftly learn to turn away when the melody plays on.

Nofence has delivered collars to landowners grazing cows sheep and goats in Norway Spain France Germany Belgium and Italy as well as 25 customers in Britain.

According to Synne Foss Budal of Nofence individual cows have caused the warning melody to begin 400 times but are smart enough never to receive a shock. The fact that cows use hearing to detect the invisible fence rather than sight means they don’t blunder into it in the dark as they do with conventional electric fences.

A National Trust trial of fenceless grazing at Studland Bay Dorset found that the collar system delivered just 1-2% of the electric pulses that a conventional electric fence gave to livestock.

Foss Budal said the technology helped ensure that if cows got into trouble in remote areas – falling into a ravine for instance – farmers could rapidly locate them via the GPS collar and help them.

She said: “I’ve had farmers in Norway who for the first time in 15 years have gone on holiday because they can monitor their animals on the app. We’re trying to increase farmers’ welfare as well as animal welfare.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maW5hbmNpYWxleHByZXNzLmNvbS9hdXRvL2VsZWN0cmljLXZlaGljbGVzL3Rlc2xhLTIwMjAtc2FsZXMtdGVzbGEtZWxlY3RyaWMtY2Fycy10ZXNsYS1kZWxpdmVyaWVzLWVsb24tbXVzay10YXJnZXQtcGFuZGVtaWMtdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwtMy8yMTYzMTQ3L9IBowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maW5hbmNpYWxleHByZXNzLmNvbS9hdXRvL2VsZWN0cmljLXZlaGljbGVzL3Rlc2xhLTIwMjAtc2FsZXMtdGVzbGEtZWxlY3RyaWMtY2Fycy10ZXNsYS1kZWxpdmVyaWVzLWVsb24tbXVzay10YXJnZXQtcGFuZGVtaWMtdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwtMy8yMTYzMTQ3L2xpdGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla delivers over 4.99 lakh electric cars in 2020: Just 450 shy of Elon Musk’s target,"Tesla’s delivery push has been supported by its new Shanghai factory the only plant currently producing vehicles outside California.

Tesla Inc reported better-than-expected 2020 vehicle deliveries driven by a steady rise in electric vehicle adoption but narrowly missed its ambitious full-year goal during a punishing year for the global auto industry. The company delivered 499550 vehicles during 2020 above Wall Street estimates of 481261 vehicles according to Refinitiv data – but 450 units shy of CEO Elon Musk’s target. Musk tweeted he was proud of the Tesla team for achieving this major milestone. “At the start of Tesla I thought we had (optimistically) a 10% chance of surviving at all” he said.

On Twitter congratulations from supporters and bullish investors poured in lauding the electric vehicle maker for its stellar year which has defied wider auto industry trends of slumping sales quarterly losses and global supply chain disruptions.

Tesla’s share price has risen more than 700% over the last year the company has reported five consecutive quarterly profits and in December it was included in the S&P 500 index.

But some online investor accounts criticized Tesla for saying it had achieved its guidance.

Tesla at the start of 2020 said it would “comfortably exceed 500000 units” for the year a target it has left unchanged despite the pandemic. Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn in October said Tesla was “aiming to achieve (its) original 2020 guidance.”

Tesla has pinned hopes on new markets such as Europe and Asia with competition intensifying in its home turf as legacy automakers double down on their investments in the booming EV space.

Tesla’s delivery push has been supported by its new Shanghai factory the only plant currently producing vehicles outside California. The carmaker said Model Y production in Shanghai has begun with deliveries expected shortly.

National Housing and Construction Corporation (NHCC) has said they are resuming the construction of low cost housing estates countrywide to address the housing needs of the middle-income population.

While commissioning the NHCC Impala Apartments in Namungoona on Tuesday Mr Parity Twinomujuni the NHCC chief executive officer said during its inception in 1953 NHCC was meant to construct low cost houses to sell to Ugandans in a profitable and sustainable manner so that they live in organised settlements.

However when president Idi Amin took over power in 1971 that vision was lost and the subsequent governments never bothered to maintain that vision.

“We constructed estates in Bugolobi Kyambogo Jinja Mbarara Kabale and other major towns and there was an impact on the quality of lives of people living there” he said.

He added that with a $ 9.5m (Shs32b) funding from Shelter Afrique the corporation has started constructing similar estates in Mbarara and Kabale districts to resume the project because NHCC has developed the capacity to carry out such projects.

The minister of Finance Mr Matia Kasaija who commissioned the apartments urged the corporation to carry out research on cheaper construction materials so that Ugandans can be able to buy good quality but cheaper houses.

Target market

He added that NHCC should embark on conducting business in a competitive and profitable way because the housing market is available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL2J1c2luZXNzL3Byb3NwZXIvaG93LXRvLWRlYWwtd2l0aC10YXgtbGVha2FnZXMtaW4tZG91YmxlLXRheGF0aW9uLWFncmVlbWVudHMtMTg0MzU5ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to deal with tax leakages in Double Taxation Agreements,"Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) the country’s tax prefect has raised a red flag over the abuse of the Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) after it has become obvious that the real benefits of the treaty are thoroughly being abused by multi-national companies and some wealthy individuals who shouldn’t be having difficulties paying their fair share of taxes.

Unlike previously the tax collector (URA) now has no second thoughts regarding the damaging effects of DTAs considering its ability to accentuate a growing risk of revenue losses to the country.

Uganda has DTAs with nearly a dozen countries including Netherlands a tax haven jurisdiction. Soon China and United Arab Emirates (UAE) – who all accounts for a growing number of major investments in Uganda will join the list.

Already through the legally binding agreements multinationals and wealthy individuals are taking undue advantage of the low tax rates provided for in the DTAs to avoid and evade paying their due taxes all at the expense of domestic revenue generation efforts which URA has for years been trying to widen.

“DTA is a tax leakage point; and this concerns us a lot” URA Commissioner General Ms Doris Akol said last week in a sideline interview.

She continued: “This is because it (DTA) creates an avenue for people to take away income earned here and have it recognised as income earned in jurisdictions with low tax rates.”

Profit shifting

Then there is profit shifting. Here what should technically be a profit that the corporation has made is characterised as another form of income that attract no taxes or pays very little revenue if at all. According to Ms Akol this ‘immoral’ method is increasingly rearing its ugly head.

She said: “Recently profits that should pay corporation tax are being characterised as intellectual property (IP). And this is because in many of the DTAs intellectual property is paid to jurisdictions that own it (IP) and in many cases its tax rate is low.”

All these according to tax experts does not happen by default but by design particularly after combing through the DTAs looking for any advantage to exploit to the fullest.

In case of a dispute according to Ms Ruth Namirembe a tax and legal expert DTAs supersede the Income Tax Act making it almost impossible for the likes of tax prefects to win back any tax rights given away by the treaty to another country.

The recent ruling of the High Court of Uganda on what constitutes a permanent establishment among other issues further exemplifies the effects of DTA to a country’s rights to collect taxes earned within its jurisdiction.

In this matter URA carried out a comprehensive tax audit on Target Well Control Uganda Limited (Target Well Uganda) and assessed tax of Shs1.9 billion in relation to Corporate Income Tax Withholding Tax (WHT) Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Value Added Tax (VAT).

The tax collectors demanded Withholding Tax (WHT) on lease payments by Target Well Uganda to Target Well Control (UK) Limited in respect of leased directional drilling equipment. URA also disallowed input VAT arising from supplies made by Neptune Petroleum (U) Ltd (Neptune) to Target Well Uganda.

Target Well Uganda objected to the assessments on grounds that lease payments are not subject to WHT under the Uganda-UK Double Taxation Agreement (DTA). Despite URA objection the High Court ruled in favour of Target Well Uganda thanks to the DTA. URA is believed to have appealed this decision because of its impact on domestic revenue mobilisation.

Way forward

There is a mixed reaction regarding government’s view and understanding of DTAs. On one hand the government seemed concerned about its effects and on the other it looks unbothered by the state of affairs.

In an interview with the acting director economic affairs at the Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development Mr Moses Kaggwa it emerged that the government fully understands the extent of the damage that the DTAs have on the country’s ability to internally generate revenue explaining why the government took the decision to suspend DTAs in 2014.

But he is also cognisant of government’s policy to attract FDI into the country using all sorts of sweeteners and baits with DTA despite being a revenue leakage tool being one of the hooks used to achieve that end of the bargain even as studies indicate that this kind of initiative does not hold water; for tax and related issue come down the pecking order of a serious investor looking to invest in a country.

In an interview with an economist and a tax expert at the Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development Mr Gerald Namoma it was clear that government is not about to ditch DTAs but try to reform them with reflection of the country’s current and future aspirations.

“There is no we way can discuss DTAs in isolation of the international context because if you do so you will be an island” Mr Namoma said.

He continued: “Others will sign them (DTA) and you could lose out. The important thing is to have control over them and that is what we are trying to do.”

According to Mr Namoma DTA relevance far supersedes FDI claims stressing that it is needed to help to relieve tax constraints that could arise between two countries.

He disclosed that government is currently renegotiating with some tax havens over DTAs such as The Netherlands.

Eventually all DTAs will be reviewed and renegotiated as the Cabinet according to Mr Namoma has already been put on alert by the minister of finance.

“We are doing this because we are aware about the revenue losses caused by DTA” he said.

About Double Taxation Agreement

A Double Taxation Agreement is all about who has taxing rights. The purpose is to ensure that taxes are not paid in two jurisdictions. Multinationals who operate in more than one country therefore plan their taxes in such a way that they pay where the tax rates are low.

Transfer pricing

For Uganda according to Ms Akol DTAs are being used to perpetuate transfer pricing resulting into revenue losses that the country should have otherwise collected.

Through transfer pricing a multinational corporation can “transfer the prices” of income and expenses to a low-tax jurisdiction to reduce taxation or get away with it should opportunity arise.

As if that is not bad enough multinational companies have also taken to treaty shopping to further abuse DTAs. Under this the corporation does business here but chooses to register the entity in a jurisdiction that has DTAs with Uganda to take advantage of the treaty and not pay its due share of taxes yet the income of the business is being earned in the country making it taxable here according to Ms Akol.

Solving DTA issues

As for Mr Gerald Byarugaba a specialist in Extractive Resources Policy and Governance at Oxfam Parliament must play an active role during DTA negotiations and have the last word on it by endorsing it before enforcement. Currently DTA is almost exclusively a Cabinet affair and a few government ministries namely Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

He also suggested that an anti-abusive clause is provided in the DTA saying that will go a long way in plugging tax leakages emanating from the treaty further stressing that no matter the circumstances DTA shouldn’t take away tax liabilities. This he said should be in addition to denying third parties any opportunities to cash in on DTA.

Mutual benefits needed

For the Commissioner Customs Dicksons Collins Kateshumbwa government shouldn’t shy away from tackling this matter which has since become a global concern. To benefit from DTA Mr Kateshumbwa said the benefits between the countries involved must be mutual.

“There is always a danger if you have a DTAs with a country that perhaps you don’t have any trade or economic relations with or very minimal for that matter. With that you will be giving away perhaps a lot than the benefits you accrue” said Mr Katehsumbwa in an interview last week.

Already in an effort to deal with the challenges emanating from DTAs whose actual objective is to avoid paying taxes in two different jurisdictions the tax prefect has set up International Tax Division that specifically manages multinationals companies.

Aggressive tax planning

To reduce the abuse of DTAs Ms Akol said: “We are beefing up our capacity with help from international tax organisations to enable us recognize all these aggressive tax schemes which are increasingly being frowned upon at international level.

“Aggressive tax planning now being identified as tax evasion is frowned upon. There are moves to create sanctions for it. Listed companies and their regulatory agencies also frown upon aggressive tax planning and we think this is a good gesture” Ms Akol said at the sidelines of URA E-Hub closure last week.

Automatic exchange of information to profile multinationals and understand whether they use DTAs to avoid paying taxes in both countries is becoming a practice among revenue authorities.

She also disclosed that URA has always advocated for renegotiations of DTAs especially “Where we see a lot of investment being reported as if doing business with Uganda and yet that may not be entirely the case.”",,,

In a news release posted on its website the company said it had delivered 180570 cars in the fourth quarter bringing its total for 2020 to 499550 a new milestone for the electric carmaker.

The 2020 sales total represents a 36 percent increase from 2019. And Tesla’s production of 509737 cars in 2020 was up 40 percent from 2019.

It is the latest success for a company that excelled in 2020 despite the pandemic.

Tesla (TSLA) hit its goal of building a half-million cars in 2020 a first for the company it reported Saturday.

The completed deliveries to customers which is slightly different from the production figure fell just short of that same goal as it delivered 499550 cars. That sales total rounds up to the 500000 target though.

The full-year production and deliveries rose by more than a third from 2019 levels an impressive gain especially considering that the company’s major factory in Fremont California was shut for nearly two months from mid-March to early May by Covid-19 stay-at-home orders. A global recession caused by the pandemic also cut into worldwide auto sales. Tesla’s new plant in Shanghai which opened in late 2019 was a key element of its increased production and sales.

The company produced 179757 cars in the fourth quarter up 71% from a year earlier and it delivered 180570 a 61% jump. While Tesla CEO Elon Musk provided guidance in October that the company would reach the 500000-car target for the year Wall Street analysts were expecting the company would miss it by about 9000 cars rather than a few hundred.

Hitting that half-million number “is a major feather in the cap for the company and the bulls” given the hit to consumers’ buying power during the pandemic wrote analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities. “In a nutshell Tesla had a high bar to hit for the fourth quarter and impressively exceeded the Street … an eye popping performance to finish the year.”

The company has even more ambitious plans to increase production with plants under construction and expected to open this year outside Berlin Germany and Austin Texas. Tesla is also set to start selling cars in India in 2021.

The company’s impressive sales growth is nothing compared to the rise in the Tesla (TSLA) share price which soared 743% for the year. The company’s 2019 and 2020 results proved it could be consistently profitable and its forecast of greater sales and profits in the future helped to fuel the stock rise.

Other automakers are due to report US sales totals on Tuesday and global sales totals for 2020 later in the month. But most are expected to report a drop in sales due to the impact of the recession and pandemic.

Impressive as Tesla’s sales numbers may be they are dwarfed by established automakers. Volkswagen (VLKAF) the world’s largest automaker sold just under 11 million cars worldwide in 2019. General Motors the largest US automaker had global sales of 7.7 million cars in 2019.

Tesla’s stock rise over the last 18 months has made it the most valuable automaker in the world. Its current market cap is worth roughly the combined value of the next eight most valuable global automakers – Toyota (TM) Volkswagen Daimler (DDAIF) GM (GM) BMW Honda (HMC) Hyundai and Ford (F).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdGVzbGFtb3RvcnNjbHViLmNvbS90bWMvdGhyZWFkcy9yZWFyLXdpbmRzaGllbGQtZ2xhc3MtdHJpbS1taXNzaW5nLjIxNzAzNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rear Windshield Glass Trim Missing?,"You can install our site as a web app on your iOS device by utilizing the Add to Home Screen feature in Safari.

U.S. electric car company Tesla in 2019 built its first Gigafactory outside the United States in the new Lingang area with a designed annual production capacity of 500000 units.

Tesla said Saturday that it delivered 180570 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter beating its previous record as well as Wall Street expectations. The electric automaker produced 179757 vehicles total.

For the year Tesla delivered 499550 vehicles in 2020 slightly missing its most recent guidance of 500000 vehicles.

At an annual shareholder meeting earlier this year CEO Elon Musk told shareholders he expected deliveries to hit an implied range between 477750 and 514500 cars for 2020 despite the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Q4 numbers represent a new record for Musk's auto business which set its previous best in the third quarter of 2020 with deliveries reaching 139300 then.

As of Thursday Wall Street expected Tesla to report fourth-quarter deliveries of 174000 vehicles over the last three months according to a consensus of analysts surveyed by FactSet. Estimates ranged from 151000 at the low end to 184000 at the high end and included forecasts published between October and mid-December.

In the fourth quarter Tesla delivered 161650 Model 3 and Model Y cars and produced 163660 such vehicles. The automaker also delivered 18920 Model S and X vehicles and produced 16097 of them.

For the year Tesla delivered 442511 Model 3 and Model Y cars while producing 454932 of the vehicles. It delivered 57039 Model S and Model X cars while producing 54805 such vehicles.

In its quarterly reports Tesla does not break out delivery and production numbers by region. Tesla also combines delivery numbers for its older Model S and Model X electric cars and newer more popular Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.

However Tesla observers can glean some understanding of these segments from Light Vehicle Production reports published by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

Auto manufacturers are required to report the number of vehicles they produced for sale in the U.S. to NHTSA per quarter. The production numbers refer to the make model model year and propulsion system of a given vehicle that any auto manufacturer produces for the U.S. market through the end of each quarter.

According to these reports analyzed by CNBC In the first nine months of 2020 Tesla made 66175 of its 2020 Model 3 electric sedans and 46773 of its 2020 Model Y crossover SUVs for the domestic U.S. market alone.

By the third quarter of the year Tesla was making more 2020 Model Ys than 2020 Model 3s for US drivers.Tesla began producing its 2020 Model Y crossover SUV in serious volumes in the first quarter of 2020.

The NHTSA Light Vehicle Production reports indicate that Tesla only made 119 of its 2020 Model Ys in the fourth quarter of 2019 for sale in the US market-- but it made 29216 of its 2020 Model Ys for customers here in the third quarter alone. That compares to 28071 2020 Model 3s in the first quarter and 22667 of its 2020 Model 3s in the third quarter for the U.S. market.

(Before publication NHTSA had not published Q4 U.S. production numbers for Tesla.)

Throughout 2020 Tesla was able to increase vehicle production and deliveries by ramping up Model Y production successfully operating a new car plant in Shanghai and bringing on new battery cell suppliers (alongside its longstanding partner Panasonic) to make more of the high voltage battery packs that power its electric cars.

Tesla said on Saturday that Model Y production has begun in Shanghai with deliveries of the Made In China Model Y expected to commence shortly.

Musk has proclaimed that he wants to increase Tesla's vehicle sales volume from about 500000 in 2020 to 20 million annually over the next decade with plans for an electric vehicle that costs $25000 its Cybertruck Semi and revamped Roadster in the works.

After Tesla's Model 3's unveiling brought in higher than anticipated pre-orders in 2016 Musk said the company aimed to produce 500000 cars per year at the Fremont plant by the end of 2018. He also said that Tesla would produce 800000 to 1 million cars per year at Fremont by 2020 then reiterating the goal in 2018 with a slight hedge saying it could look more like 700000 to 800000 per year in Fremont. The company hasn't apparently hit that goal yet in California.

But looking ahead to 2021 Tesla is building new factories in Austin Texas and Brandenburg Germany among other efforts to grow its production and sales volume. Musk cautioned shareholders on the company's last earnings call that it could take 12 to 24 months to hit full capacity at new factories after they begin operations — significantly slower than what Tesla achieved in Shanghai.

As Tesla faces a greater number of competitors the world over in luxury and lower priced segments IHS Markit forecasts electric vehicle sales will represent 10.2% or 9.4 million of the nearly 92.3 million vehicles it expects to sell globally in 2024.

Correction: Tesla's Model 3 was unveiled in 2016. An earlier version had the wrong model. Also Tesla slightly missed its target for annual deliveries and the car company produced 179757 vehicles total in the fourth quarter. A previous version misstated the annual target and the Q4 production numbers due to editing errors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8wMi90ZXNsYS1kZWxpdmVycy1uZWFybHktNTAwMDAwLXZlaGljbGVzLWluLTIwMjAv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY3J1bmNoLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzAyL3Rlc2xhLWRlbGl2ZXJzLW5lYXJseS01MDAwMDAtdmVoaWNsZXMtaW4tMjAyMC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla delivers nearly 500000 vehicles in 2020,"Tesla delivered 499550 vehicles in 2020 a 36% increase over the previous year and just a few hundred short of hitting an historic and long-awaited milestone that CEO Elon Musk has been targeting for more than five years.

Tesla reported Saturday that it produced 509737 electric vehicles in 2020.

Tesla was able to reach the 500000-vehicle target by ticking up production and sales in the fourth quarter — a final push that has mirrored numerous other end-of-the-quarter efforts by the company. Tesla delivered 180570 in the fourth quarter setting a new quarterly record and 30% higher than the previous quarter.

The company’s production and sales figures were also driven by the launch of the Model Y its mid-sized SUV and a new factory coming online in China.

The fourth quarter and annual figures show the rise in demand for its more affordable and newer models and waning interest in its flagship Model S sedan and Model X SUV. The company delivered 18920 Model S and Model X vehicles in the fourth quarter and 57039 for the year. Sales of the Model 3 and Model Y hit nearly 162000 in the fourth quarter and 442511 for the year. Tesla doesn’t break out sales figures for each model instead combining its older vehicles into one bucket and its newer Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in another. The company also doesn’t provide regional sales figures.

Producing and selling more than 500000 vehicles a year seemed unreachable for Tesla just a handful of years ago. But Musk has taken a bullish view of the company noting in 2015 that he remained confident that Tesla would be producing half a million cars in 2020.

“That’s five years from now” Musk said at the time. “If you go five years in the past for Tesla we were producing 600 cars per year — now we can produce 600 cars in three days. So I think going from here to 500000 cars a year is a much smaller leap.”

Musk has reiterated that target periodically including in January of last year when he noted that deliveries should comfortably exceed 500000 units. Tesla didn’t adjust that forecast even as the COVID-19 pandemic upended the economy and forced the company along with every other automaker to temporarily pause production for several weeks last spring."

A CD player may no longer be the prized possession it once was but it’s still possible to dabble in the world of 120 mm polycarbonate discs if you have a fancy for it. It’s something [Daniel1111] has done with his Arduino CD player which uses the little microcontroller board to control a CD-ROM drive via its IDE bus.

The project draws heavily from the work of previous experimenters notably ATAPIDUINO but it extends them by taking its audio from the drive’s S/PDIF output. A port expander drives the IDE interface while a Cirrus Logic WM8805 S/PDIF transceiver handles the digital audio and converts it to an I2S stream. That in turn is fed to a Texas Instruments PCM5102 DAC which provides a line-level audio output. All the code and schematic can be found in a GitHub repository.

To anyone who worked in the CD-ROM business back in the 1990s this project presses quite a few buttons though perhaps not enough to dig out all those CDs again. It would be interesting to see whether the I2S stream could be lifted from inside the drive directly or even if the audio data could be received via the IDE bus. If you’d like to know a bit more about I2S  we have an article for you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhY2tzdGVyLmlvL25ld3MvdGhpcy1lc3AzMi1zMi1icmVha291dC1pcy1ib3VuZC10by1ib290c3RyYXAtc29tZS1wcmV0dHktaW50ZXJlc3RpbmctcHJvamVjdHMtOGMzNmRmOWU5NGM30gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGFja3N0ZXIuaW8vbmV3cy90aGlzLWVzcDMyLXMyLWJyZWFrb3V0LWlzLWJvdW5kLXRvLWJvb3RzdHJhcC1zb21lLXByZXR0eS1pbnRlcmVzdGluZy1wcm9qZWN0cy04YzM2ZGY5ZTk0YzcuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"This ESP32-S2 ""Breakout"" Is Bound to Bootstrap Some Pretty Interesting Projects!","It's the new year at last. 2021 eh?

While many of us are putting our feet up for just a little bit — reveling in ""the void"" before work starts up again some of us might have earned that break a bit more than others.

One example of someone who probably should take a well earned holiday is the ever assiduous Greg Davill who somehow managed a miraculous stint of a project per day pouring out practically a PCB a day in place of the somewhat more traditional ""chocolate-based"" advent calendars.

Although many of us would likely find ourselves struggling to keep up with perhaps a basic well-designed breakout board a day the Git commits Davill has been making are anything but basic. The list below reads as a formidable game plan for a design team with half a year to burn. For one man in one month this is a momentous effort!

With a whole month's worth — 31 full project folders there's a lot to dig through here but we're going to start with the one that caught my eye and likely would yours also — Davill's take on the ESP32-S2 breakout board with a few extras thrown in that should make fit for any low power ESP32-S2-based application.

Striking silkscreen artwork aside there is an initial thought of ""woah that's huge"" when compared to the designs Davill is normally known for turning out.

Besides accommodating a generous array of SMD and PTH pads for piggybacking additional prototyping circuitry onto the ESP32-S2 core — there's a secondary reason for the size of this PCB that we'll touch on in just a second — first up let's take a look at the smaller details that make up this striking circuit board.

ESP32-S2 at heart...

Based around one of the newer Espressif parts the ESP32-S2 is the single core variant of the ESP32 that we all know and love. Aimed at doubling down at what the ESP silicon is known best for doing — a great Wi-Fi MCU — this single core sibling of the Espressif silicon family also bids farewell to the Bluetooth functionality previously found on the ESP32 die. putting the focus purely on connectivity based around straight-up Wi-Fi or alternatively perhaps the ESP-NOW orESP-MESH frameworks.

With not a single pin left unmapped on the ESP32-S2 IC this may as well be one of the reference designs for this hot new silicon even if it takes a little teasing apart to pick up on all the small details packed into the schematic page.

Things like the built-in USB transceiver of the ESP32-S2 with the net names USB_N/USB_P giving away the alternate functionality of GPIO19 and GPIO20!

We can see Pcbnew confirms this pretty freaking awesome feature enhancement — with no USB-Serial converter to be seen in-between the edge-mounted USB-C connector and the ESP32-S2 itself.

All there is to be seen sitting on the USB differential lines is the well placed USBLC6-2 providing some ESD protection to this external interface along with the typical inline series resistors.

Time keeps on ticking away....

It is Interesting to note that despite the built in RTC of the ESP32-S2 the lack of any 32kHz crystal on the associated ESP32 pins indicates that Davill has chosen to instead employ an external device for this task.

Snooping around the schematic quickly reveals the the RV-8803-C7 RTC device from Micro Crystal.

This all-in-one tiny SON packaged device occupies a footprint of just 3.2mm x 1.5mm and even more impressively incorporates its own 32kHz crystal oscillator — similar to other such I2C RTC devices as the Maxim DS3231M that we have been seeing lately.

We've touched on the benefits of such co-packaged crystal RTC devices before and when looking at the timekeeping current of these chips the 240nA of the RV-8803 is certainly quite appealing in comparison to some of the competition.

With a SMD coin-cell battery to back up the RTC power domain this PCB should be able to keep tabs on time for quite a while between the occasional bit of juice when it's plugged in to USB!

Properly designed power!

Sometimes you just want some well proven parts when it comes to picking components for your power stage — so it's little surprise to see Texas Instruments stealing the show here.

With portability in mind this board is fitted out to run either from the USB supplied 5V DC or alternatively from a Li-ion battery with a TI BQ24072 managing the safe charging of the cells chemistry.

Aimed at making things a bit simpler the BQ24072 is a fully integrated stand-alone device able to keep tabs on the safe management of the Li-Ion cell without any host intervention required. Sometimes it's nice to have these things ""just work"" — this is one of those times.

Interestingly we see the use of two separate DC/DC converters.

With a TLV62569 handling the 3.3V rail at up to 2A of current there's no risk of brown out on anything this board should be doing...

But with the ESP32-s2 more than happy to run at 3.3V we wonder what is the purpose of the TPS63900 buck-boost converter configured to supply a decent 5V rail?

A decent 5V rail for a decent display!

With a recent slew of project that look to make use of a recent fire-sale of some very attractively priced 400 x 240 2.7"" memory LCD panels this breakout board has a secret identity — as a base board for all things memory LCD related!

These panels are a half-way house between a conventional LCD panel and an ePaper display both in terms of power consumption and functionality.

While offering a fantastic display update rate with a speedy SPI interface they do require a little more int the way of supply voltage with glitching occurring anywhere below the ~3.6V mark - meaning the 3.3V rail although capable is not going to cut it here.

Now we see the reason for the 5V DC/DC boost converter — that will not only happily feed this display but give a whole bunch of overhead should you have any need for 5V on the prototyping area of this PCB.

One other oddity of these displays is that the require an approximate 1Hz duty cycle square wave to be applied to one of the display input pins — as part of the mechanism to keep the display image driven (I have a feeling these displays are internally clock-less requiring this external time base to toggle things along in order to keep the pixels positioned as required).

This is where we see a little ingenuity from Davill with the 100R resistor between the nets RTC_OUT and LCD_COM indicating that he has configured the RTC device to provide this signal.

This has the advantage of allowing for some really low power display options — the RTC can kick the ESP32 awake update the display frame buffer and then hold the image in place while the ESP32 goes back to sleep for another nap.

That's a clever two-birds-one-stone sorta hack that we love to see!

Finishing off with some flash

If you've ever done much display work you will know that 400 x 240 pixels even in monochrome is a sizable amount of memory to manage and most MCU would benefit from some external storage onto which to sling extra bitmap blobs or GIF graphics.

With a hefty 32Mbit of SPI flash there's likely no limit the amount of graphics data you could decide to add to your next ESP32-s2 project and if (somehow?!) 32Mbit is still not enough well thankfully the DFN-8 package is simple enough to swap out.

Get your fill of all the GitHub files for this funky looking FR4 stack over here and as always be sure Davill is on your list of those to follow over on Twitter — @GregDavill.",,,,,,,,,

The Thermo Fisher Scientific renovation will be used for a new cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice) plasmid DNA manufacturing operation.

The plasmid is used as a critical raw material to develop and manufacture gene-based therapies including life-saving cancer treatments and mRNA vaccines including vaccines for COVID.

Testing Kits

Thermo Fisher Scientific was among the first companies to produce testing kits for COVID-19 and provides other equipment used in developing vaccines and equipment for COVID-19 research according to its website.

The expansion of Thermo Fisher Scientific in Carlsbad is but part of what the commercial real estate brokerage JLL cited as a growing demand for life science space heading toward the end of 2020.

“Growth is occurring within biotech companies of all size ranges” JLL reported in its third quarter review of the market.

Strong leasing activity “decreased total availability in the San Diego life science cluster to its lowest point in the past decade” JLL reported.

JLL is expanding its life science practice nationally and in San Diego County according to Peter Belise JLL’s market director for the Southwest.

“Some of the biggest private equity funds that we know of in the world are heavily playing in this space and are buying and selling entire portfolios” Belise said.

Demand Continues to Grow

“I’ve been bullish on San Diego for years Phoenix and San Diego” Belise said. Looking ahead Belise said he expects demand for life science space to continue to grow in San Diego and elsewhere.

“We see a lot of developers and owners in real estate start to develop or in some cases redevelop product to meet this demand” Belise said. “This is not a two-year run. This is like a 10-year run.”

The renovated Thermo Fisher Scientific site in Carlsbad will have the capability to produce large-scale plasmid DNA as a primary drug substance for DNA therapies.

Construction on the Thermo Fisher Scientific project is expected to be finished in the first half of 2021.

The renovated building will have a combination of labs and office space with additional room for manufacturing.

The expanded service in the renovated building will add 150 jobs over the next 12 months at the Carlsbad campus. The company employs about 2200 people at its Carlsbad site 5791 Allen Way.

“The race to develop new transformative cell and gene therapies is outpacing supply of commercial-quality plasmid DNA that can be produced at scale” Mike Shafer senior vice president and president of pharma services at Thermo Fisher Scientific said in a statement.

“Our new state-of-the-art site will not only tackle the supply bottleneck for our customers but also uniquely position us to deliver robust end-to-end cell and gene therapy capabilities” Shafer said.

Plasmid DNA are circular loops of DNA that are used to introduce genetic sequences into cells according to Larry Pitcher senior director and general manager of plasmids at Thermo Fisher Scientific.

“There is currently insufficient capacity in the market for plasmid DNA to support the accelerated growth in gene therapy including life-saving cancer treatments and mRNA vaccines” Pitcher said.

According to the national Center for Disease Control mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine to protect against infectious diseases such as COVID-19.

To trigger an immune response many vaccines put a weakened or inactivated germ into human bodies. Instead mRNA vaccines teach cells how to make a protein—or even just a piece of a protein—that triggers an immune response.

That immune response which produces antibodies is what protects people from getting infected if the real virus enters them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAwMzI1OTEwMjAzMDg3NTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stability and thermophysical properties test of carbide-derived carbon thermal fluid; a comparison between ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032591020308755 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAwMzI1OTEwMjAzMDg3NTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL2J1c2luZXNzL3Byb3NwZXIvdGhlLWRhdW50aW5nLXRhc2stb2YtZG5hLXNlcnZpY2VzLTE2MDg4NjDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The daunting task of DNA services | Monitor,"As I take the lift for a scheduled interview I keep asking myself what Africa Biosystems Limited does.

I had been briefed by my editor but I am anxious to know what happens at this company that towers above Kampala on the 11th floor of Diamond Trust building.

First forward it is now 1pm and I am ushered into a room where the company’s three people including Janmohamed Verjee a director Ms Yasmin Verjee managing director and Leonard Bagenda the Field applications specialist of Africa Biosystems Uganda will be letting me in on how the company started its operations challenges and future prospects.

Africa Biosystems Uganda is a subsidiary of Africa Biosystems Limited which has headquarters in Nairobi Kenya.

It is part of Life sciences a brand of Thermo Fisher Scientific a world leader in Life sciences Technology and among the Fortune 100 companies in America.

Africa Biosystems Limited was formed in 1999 but was this year extended to Uganda to distribute as well as offer services related to Life Sciences Technologies and Thermo Fisher scientific including but not limited to advanced DNA technologies.

The company’s main activities include offering products services and support in Forensics including human identification crime scene investigation food security and testing including technology support in GMO testing and environmental analysis among others.

It is also involved in the distribution of equipment such as genetic analyzers for DNA profiling and sequencing and real time machines for gene expression studies among others.

How it started

“We started in a small room with one chair and a computer” says Mr Verjee adding: “But after some time a South African company contacted us to work on a certain project which earned us about $40000 annually.”

“We quit our small room and expanded into a spacious offices where we currently employ more than 20 people” he adds.

According to Mr Verjee they started the company on the inspiration that everything living has DNA and a vest amount of information can be derived from analysing DNA of a given organism.

“Look at everything. There is a DNA element somewhere and with technology it is becoming everything” says Mr Verjee.

“Initially we were active in Nairobi until we had customers here (Uganda). This is why we decided to open here” he adds.

The company’s core existence is enshrined in the increasing focus of real time research and investigations in human animal and plant life with technologies that offer greater precision and answer. “it took 13 years to complete the Human Genome Project we can do the same work in less than six months using next generation sequencing” emphasizes Bagenda.

“We were inspired by the need to eliminate diseases that have become so severe among humans plants and animals. There is no reason as to why samples are taken to America South Africa or Kenya for investigation” Mr Verjeehe adds.

“Getting results of any infection which previously could take a week or two can now be done in about 30 or 40 minutes.”

How they operate

According to Yasmin Verjee the company works in coordination with the Life Sciences Group to provide world class equipment for conducting human identification as well as detecting infectious diseases such as Ebola.

“We have just begun here [Uganda] and we are still observing everything because projects such as this one take long to give results” she says.

Ms Yasmin Verjee has a strong conviction that the world needs to take science serious as well as giving special attention to everything that revolves around science life.

The business

According to Bagenda the company has a number of clients including government institutions Research centers hospitals and higher institutions of learning and private medical and diagnostic centers.

“Currently we are working with African Orphan Crops Consortium looking at increasing food security in Africa. We provide technical support research in disease outbreaks in plants criminology data basing and DNA” he says.

Recognition

Africa Biosystems has had some good achievements and worn a number of service awards but the most outstanding is when it was last year ranked 26th among Kenya’s Top 100 mid-sized companies in Nairobi.

“To us this was a milestone that has given us a platform to continue on a growth trajectory” Yasmin Verjee says.

“We have not had many challenges. Sometimes we have used situations that people see as challenges as opportunities to work on new things” says Mr Verjee.

Future prospects

“We hope to replicate the success we have had in Kenya and take research and investigations in life sciences to new heights. There is no longer need to ship any sample out for advanced investigation because we can provide the same technologies here” says Leonard Baganda the sales and field applications specialist at Africa Biosystems Uganda Limited.

“We just need to identify a partner(s) and together we shall form an institution which can make a centre of excellence in the fields of Molecular diagnostics and Research” says Ms Yasmin Verjee.

While the aviation industry has been decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic LaGuardia Airport has been quietly undergoing major renovations.

NEW YORK -- It's long been the bane of traveling New Yorkers' lives and incoming president Joe Biden once described it as ""third world.""

But while the aviation industry has been decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic LaGuardia Airport has been quietly undergoing major renovations.

And now $8 billion later the new Terminal B is almost finished.

""New Yorkers love to criticize and they love to hate. I think if you looked at every single passenger survey LaGuardia was always the worst"" says Rick Cotton executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

""Our challenge was to take it from worst to first"" he tells CNN.

Today filled with art installations including one of the largest mosaic walls in the US and even a breathtaking water feature which projects images of New York icons such as the Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge onto a cascading fountain LaGuardia is a very different place.

Passengers for Air Canada American Airlines Southwest and United -- which are all housed at the new terminal -- have been enjoying the new public spaces since the summer.

From worst to... best?

It was Joe Biden's comments in 2015 that sparked the renovation effort.

New York authorities green-lit the works after the then-Vice President said ""If I blindfolded you and took you to LaGuardia Airport in New York you'd think I must be in some third-world country.""

The central terminal B was built in 1964 and had barely changed since then.

And LaGuardia was according to travelers among the most outdated noisiest and least accessible airports in the country. Not to mention its on-time record which was one of the worst in the United States.

The redevelopment is the largest public-private partnership in US aviation history and is still only 80% complete -- there are still some last gates to demolish and reopen. The project will be fully completed in 2022 and will see three out of the four terminals completely redeveloped.

But for now travelers in Terminal B can enjoy the new breezy light-flooded departures hall its entire back wall covered in Laura Owens' colossal 25000-square-foot mosaic mural ""I NY"" in which NYC icons such as signs for the Stonewall Inn Apollo Theater and Coney Island's Cyclone roller coaster are depicted against a background of blue skies and fluffy white clouds. It's accompanied by a monumental aviation-themed sculpture by Sarah Sze ""Shorter than the Day"" hanging in mid-air.

In the Connector area is Sabine Hornig's ""La Guardia Vistas"" a modern stained glass installation (of latex ink and vinyl mounted on glass) pairing over 1100 photos of New York City into a cityscape in honor of the airport founder and former NYC mayor Fiorello La Guardia.

Jeppe Hein's 70 steel balloons dangle from the ceiling throughout the terminal and his bench sculptures provide photo-friendly seating.

Free Covid tests for all

2020 isn't the best year to be relaunching an airport.

When New York was the US center of the epidemic in March passenger numbers across the city's three airports plummeted by an astonishing 98%. Numbers are still down 75-80% according to Cotton.

But the airport is offering free Covid tests alongside the art to attract passengers back.

Cotton thinks the offering -- which spans 840000 square feet and four floors -- is now ""best in class.""

The Port Authority will be hoping that more travelers get to experience it in 2021.

They prefer taking off some time to relax and explore different things. Jack an insurance broker working with a global insurance firm in Canada recently came to Uganda to oversee some business. However after work was done he decided to spend his last weekend at the source of Africa’s longest river the Nile in Jinja District.

Business travellers — especially those who are beginning their careers — are excited to see the world and are ready to find ways of maximising their travel time. A growing trend of business travellers combining work and play is described as bleisure.

Bridge Street Global Hospitality – which runs serviced apartments in more than 60 countries polled 640 international travellers. The survey showed that 83 per cent of respondents use free time on business trips to explore the cities they are visiting.

According to Bridge Street Hospitality report for 2014 published by Skift a travel website ‘bleisure’ is already a way of life among many business travellers world over.

By combining business and leisure travelers gain experiences and save money. The Bridge Street Global Hospitality survey shows 96 per cent believe they gain cultural experience and knowledge through business trips.

Travel industry specialist Frederic Gonzalo who has spent over 20 years within the hospitality industry attributes the rise in ‘bleisure’ travel to the fact that people have become pressed for time especially as business becomes global.

“A lot of business travellers are on the road quite often and don’t know how else to strike the work/family balance. For the new generation business trips are not just about work but about quality time” he says.

Just as leisure travellers are always working business travelers are now often extending their stays to include a leisure component.

Andrew Nganga the general manager of Great Lakes Safaris says there has been an increase in people who mix business and leisure.

Great Lakes Safaris one of the largest tours and Travel Company in Uganda which operates three different lodges across the country experiences an influx of travellers who come to the country for business and leisure.

Nganga however notes that before they confirm any bookings with them the first thing the people always ask if whether they have Wi-Fi/ Internet connection in the rooms.

“This is because people now move with their offices; they want to work while on leisure” he notes.

Nganga says that because of the growth in technology advancement today working while doing leisure also makes people more productive. The Bridge Street Global Hospitality survey shows that about 78 per cent feel adding leisure days to business travel adds value to work assignments.

Nganga who affirms “Business has become leisure” says the evolution of travel technologies and social media has changed the way people perceive work these days.

Technology has helped inform customers about opportunities at their destinations. He says they engage more with people on social media. The hotels travel companies are very active on social media and as such a business traveler can quickly know what leisure spots and activities are available.

“Hotels restaurants and destinations are monitoring their updates and adding suggestions on Twitter Facebook and Instagram to build up the publicity for the destination” he explains. “Likewise the industry wants to keep in touch with its customers after they leave – maybe that business traveller will return one day on a leisure trip.”

Bleisure can benefit business because in the process of relaxing one can cut a deal. For most marketers hoping to sell a product leisure spots like golf resorts where the potential clientele meet to relax and blow off some steam are their target areas.

The report states that nearly four out of five responders agreed that adding leisure days to business trips added value to work assignments. However while a desire for ‘bleisure’ is growing amongst employees majority of businesses are yet to embrace the concept. Very few have a formal policy addressing bleisure.

Clear and fair guidance around ‘bleisure’ trips will we believe help foster trust between companies and their employees as well as motivate them make them more productive and create a positive attitude to work/life balance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL2J1c2luZXNzL3Byb3NwZXIvdGFraW5nLXRvdXItYW5kLXRyYXZlbC1hLW5vdGNoLWhpZ2hlci0xNTIzMTM20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taking tour and travel a notch higher,"She gave up a car to save for a business. The Shs12 million she received as a graduation gift from her relatives overseas to buy a car was instead saved only to become her initial capital.

She had a dream of becoming a millionaire at an early age which was only possible if she set up a personal business and offered it the best of management.

At only 27 years Anisha Mariah Nabikolo is already self-employed minting money from offering services to travelers.

She runs a tour and travel company— Amie World Exposure— at Equatorial Mall Kampala.

Having started out as an employee of Taroma Tours and Travel at Kamu kamu Plaza in Kampala. She was not only paid a salary but also took each day as a learning experience to acquire a wealth of management skills.

“I worked for other people for so long since 2003 and they inspired me to start my own business” Anisha told Prosper replying business emails on her tab.

With Shs27 million as her initial capital she set out to started her company in June last year.

“This was partly my savings from my hard earned salary but also partly the money that was sent by my uncles.”

To many this may seem enormous capital but for Anisha she believes in investing big: “You reap what you sow. I invested big so that I could make enormous profits. And so far so good.”

With the few customers she acquired from her first job she set the ball rolling. Unlike many other professions the tour and travel industry depends on the personal relationship one creates with the customers.

“Customers can actually keep doing business with a given company because of a particular individual in the company who understands and serves them well. For my special relationship with them customers at my former job became my initial clients.”

Within 12 months her clientele has grown to more than 100 customers a number almost double the initial 63 clients. The market growth is attributed to intense marketing which Anisha does on-line and also door to door marketing by her agents family and friends.

And with such a wide market she has spread out her wings to providing services such as ticket booking hotel reservation bookings for tours and safaris and car rentals. For the bookings most of them are made online a move that relieves her of transport costs and telephone bills among others.

Profit growth over the months

Over time Anisha has grown her profit base. Each month comes with better proceeds. With nine years experience since her Senior six vacation Anisha has made good profits.

She says that the peak seasons often bring profits ranging between $3000(Shs7.5million) to $5000(Shs12.5million) per month. This is during the months of February March and April. But the low end months also bring in as high as $1000(Shs2.5million)

However 2012 has had a twist in events. “This year has been unique the peak seasons were bad and the usually dormant seasons turned out to be good. We have done a lot of business in the usually dull months” she narrates with a seemingly surprised look.

The changes in the peak time have been attributed to the economic changes that characterised the country’s economy in the last quarter of last year—record high inflation at 30 per cent the weakening shilling against the dollar and high market prices. This dampened the mood of travelers as ticket fares went high while luxuries like touring become secondary.

Future plans

Anisha intends to own tour vehicles of her own to facilitate in transporting tourists something that she hopes will increase the profitability of the enterprise.

This venture she says needs at least Shs300m which she is optimistic will be attained before end of the year. This year Anisha’s plan is to re-invest her profits in the business to facilitate its growth attainment of these vehicles is part of the plan.

Her next plan to fall in line is to expand and become an International Air Transport Association (IATA) certified company authorised to sell out tickets for airlines transact business for big international companies and as act as a wholesaler of tickets to other tour and travel companies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL2J1c2luZXNzL3Byb3NwZXIvdG91cmlzbS1wb3RlbnRpYWwtYXJlLXVnYW5kYW5zLXJlYWR5LXRvLWhvcC1vbi10aGUtdHJhaWwtLTE4MjUzNTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tourism potential: Are Ugandans ready to hop on the trail?,"Despite the minimal budget (Shs17b) allocation towards the tourism industry lately government’s body language towards this industry is moving in a positive direction.

This enthusiasm is gradually spreading across without a known national brand. People in government currently have tourism promotion at the centre of their discussions wherever they go.

To take this further Ministry of Tourism through the Uganda Tourism Board (UTB) has embarked on some ambitious marketing campaigns – both local and international – to promote tourism.

Locally four aggressive campaign drives namely Twende Uganda Destination Uganda Campaign Pearl of Africa Tourism Campaign and enhance Tulambule Drive are on-going. At the same time a new campaign pitched last week and dubbed “Breathtaking Uganda” is going to use digital media including social media to woo more Ugandans into being tourists in their country.

At the international level UTB has contracted four market destination representatives –public relations and marketing companies to sell destination Uganda in the traditional markets and emerging source markets.

PHG –Canada North America and China KPRN-German Austria and Switzerland and Kamageo-UK and Ireland while Aviareps is for the Gulf States and Japan.

All this is aimed at increasing the numbers of tourists from the current 1.6 million to 4 million visitors by December 2020. The World Tourism Organisation ranked Uganda third among the world’s top 10 most promising tourism destinations amidst a number of global endorsements for destination Uganda.

The impact of these campaigns has started paying off for domestic tourism and outbound travelers.

From CNN and Netgeo giving a nod to some of Uganda’s National parks to winning a Gold award for best exhibitor at the just-concluded Ndaba Trade Fair in South Africa cements these efforts. All these are most likely to spur the numbers of inbound tourists.

Speaking to Prosper Magazine at the sidelines of a training of tour operators on the requirements of Chinese travelers Ms Catherine Mei Travel sales director –China PHG Consulting said: “Chinese outbound travelers have started showing interest and asking questions about Uganda’s culture and wildlife.”

Opportunities

These ambitious targets beg the question: is Uganda’s private sector ready to handle?

Mr Amos Wekesa who has invested in safaris accommodation and water services sharing his insights on the opportunities said: “Government taking on tourism is a very prudent thing to do. Reason is we cannot compete in sectors like agriculture minerals.”

Secondly Wekesa adds that the fastest way to balance Uganda’s trade as a country is through tourism. In February 2019 Uganda recorded a trade deficit of $308m (Shs1.1 trillion).

“If Uganda attracts the 4 million tourists coming as per the government’s five-year plan this means that the country will need more investments right from the airport” Mr Wekesa shared.

Experts say the opportunities that should be exploited to make Uganda ready are quite a number.

Culture

Attracting tourists to spend more money in Uganda goes beyond taking them to see gorillas and other wild animals. It should be a different ball-game.

As they travel to these places they have at least an hour or two to experience our culture. Just like when you travel to Japan USA or France you don’t want to return without a Japanese souvenir.

Similarly this should be emulated by Ugandans like telling stories about Uganda’s culture which have not been written or told.

Mr John Ssempebwa the proprietor of Ssemagulu Cultural Museum and former deputy CEO of UTB said: “The opportunities are many but the first challenge Ugandans must understand is trading in services.”

He shares that at Ssemagulu Museum they spent four years reading about the Buganda Culture. After understanding it they put up monuments and art paints collected which are being showcased.

“Because of this collections on a good day go beyond Shs1 million ($266) from people who visit our museum. They also walk away with knowledge about the Buganda culture” he shares.

Kingdoms

UTB’s new chief executive officer Lilly Ajarova said: “Buganda Tooro and Bunyoro are well-organised and classical Kingdoms. If we work together with them we shall be able to offer a perfect product for the Chinese market.”

Giving his views on promoting cultural tourism the Katikkiro of Buganda Mr Charles Peter Mayiga said Cultural tourism is possibly second to the safaris in attracting tourists to Uganda.

“In Buganda the traditional cuisines; the traditional music and dance; clans ancestral homes (obutaka) and numerous features at the Kabaka’s events; the sites like tombs - showcase the heritage of the Baganda which is of immense interest to tourists from China and other places” Katikkiro shared.

He urged UTB to partner with the Buganda Heritage and Tourism Board (BHTB) to lead them to the numerous tourist sites.

Buganda Kingdom has 54 clans each with a headquarter and rich stories dating back hundreds of years.

“Such information from the clans should be documented and each headquarter turned into a cultural village. The same message should be done by the other Kingdoms such as Tooro Bunyoro and Busoga. This is what will attract the Chinese” Mr Ssempebwa added.

In this stride the European Union is financing the preservation of cultural buildings in Buganda Busoga and Toro as a pilot.



Food

Uganda is endowed and rich in food which is organically grown. But there are nearly no places specifically meant to showcase these foods from the way they are grown prepared and served.

“We have years of history of producing local beers and food; these are the opportunities that need to be promoted. Wildlife tourism is declining because people have seen it all and now countries such as China are setting up big animal zoos to exhibit the actual animals we have” Ssempebwa shares.

Look at a mere street snack - the Rolex (combining an omelette and vegetables wrapped in a chapatti) a popular delicacy tourists enjoy.

Besides this most tribes in Uganda have their own specialty dish or delicacies which are organic - talk about Nsenene (Grasshoppers) Eshabwe (Ankole Appetiser) Malakwanga (A vegetable from Northern Uganda) Apata (Millet Bread from Eastern Uganda) Ajon (a local brew enjoyed in Eastern Northern Uganda) and not forgetting Malewa - dried preserved bamboo shoots enjoyed in Mbale all these should be promoted.

Lake Victoria

Lake Victoria is not only Africa’s largest lake by area the world’s largest tropical lake but also the world’s second largest fresh water lake by surface area after Lake Superior in North America. It’s a potential that has not been exploited.

UTB’s Ajarova said water transport tourism is going to be a priority resource as government seeks to build on the gains so far reached.

Speaking during the launch of the MV Vanessa boat in March Ajarova said water bodies in Uganda especially Lake Victoria were under-utilised in terms of tourism.

“This is the beginning of utilising Lake Victoria and other water bodies for the benefit of Ugandans and the international community” she said.

MV Vanessa – a luxury boat with capacity to sit 54 passengers – is seeking to tap into the current void in the water transport tourism potential in Uganda.

The boat according to online sources costs between $200000 (Shs741m) and $350000 (Shs1.2b).

Mr Maxime Van Pee the Nyanza Evergreen Waterways director said the investment was informed by the tourism potential in water transport saying the boat will start with scheduled routines on water frontiers in Jinja and Entebbe.

Accommodation

Uganda’s National Parks all combined currently do offer about 2000 rooms.

According to Amos Wekesa who owns several accommodation facilities in the different national parks under the brand name Uganda Lodges Uganda needs more investment in this area to handle the numbers that are predicted to increase.

“Kenya’s Masai Maraa is a smaller park compared to Uganda’s Murchison Falls but they have got more than 5000 rooms. This is more than Uganda’s combined 2000 rooms in all its national parks” He shared.

This is not because there is no land for developing but few private sector players have showed interest.

In addition the company raised $26.75 million in funding through strategic partners. The funding enables Future Meat to scale up production and accelerate its R&D.

The low production cost for a ¼-lb serving puts Future Meat in position to begin marketing to consumers and foodservice within 18 months according to the company. Food category players such as Tyson Foods ADM Müller Group and Rich's Products Corporation all back the firm and it has capital investment from as S2G Ventures ADM Capital Emerald Technology Ventures Manta Ray Ventures and Bits x Bites.

“Cultured meat technology is the Apollo program of the 21st century” said Professor Yaakov Nahmias founder and chief scientific officer of Future Meat Technologies. “It required massive efforts of biologists chemists engineers and food experts to reduce the cost of cultured meat by over 1000-fold in just a few years. We are proud to be within reach of cost parity with traditional agriculture without any need to resort to genetic engineering ensuring the supply of safe delicious food for coming generations.”

Future Meat uses proprietary technology based to produce cultured meat directly from animal cells without the need to harvest animals. The technology is based on the rapid natural proliferation of connective tissue cells growing in stainless steel fermenters that continuously remove waste products to maintain a constant physiological environment.

“Cost-efficient production has been a critical focus area for the cultured meat industry” said Rom Kshuk chief executive officer of Future Meat Technologies. “This development is a major step forward in Future Meat Technologies' ability to provide affordable scalable and sustainable products that can meet the growing demand for meat.”

The company plans to start production at its pilot facility in the first half of 2021 and is currently seeking regulatory approval in several territories. Future Meat also produces cultured fat. This removes the necessity for adding palm-oil or high levels of sodium for flavor an aspect the company feels gives it a major advantage.

Cargill Protein Latam’s Honduran poultry processing plant Pronorsa located in San Pedro Sula is now almost fully functioning after having been hit by two of the worst hurricanes to pass over Honduras in decades. The plant was severely affected by water entry and equipment lost emergency planning meant that no lives were lost.

No one expected the last hurricane season to be so destructive despite warnings.

Category 4 Hurricane Eta began to hit Honduras on November 3rd 2020. Exactly two weeks later the country was struck again this time by Hurricane Iota another devastating category 4 hurricane. The impact of the two hurricanes is thought to have set Honduras’ economic development back by 22 years and the country is not expected to fully recover for another 10 years. The number of people in the country facing food security since the hurricanes struck has more than doubled.

No exception

Cargill’s Pronorsa processing plant is located close to a stream that during the rainy season records a significant increase in water levels. Little surprise therefore that the plant has containment walls and shut down protocols in place should the risk of flooding be deemed high.

High water levels are potentially dangerous for the plant for two main reasons. Firstly the site contains a large high voltage electricity substation while secondly flooding could result in the release of ammonia used for refrigeration and freezing into the surrounding community.

Plans into action

On Tuesday November 3rd in advance of the impending hurricane hitting the plant’s technical team reviewed its shutdown procedures carried out drills and alerted in the in-house emergencies team trained to take control of the plant.

By Wednesday the first hurricane hit with full force and the disaster had started.

Luis Fernando Rivera Operations and Supply Chain Director with Cargill Protein Latam explains: “This hurricane was unprecedented. The last strong storm – Hurricane Mitch – was 22 years ago and the worst in Honduran history”.

Circumstances have changed however since Hurricane Mitch hit Honduras. Upstream from the plant various settlements and buildings have been erected and during these most recent hurricanes rain was particularly heavy.

The order for a preventive shutdown was given with the expectation that flooding could be prevented. However by 9 pm water started to slowly but continuously enter the plant.

Two hours later water trapped upstream surged and there was no time to evacuate the plant and distribution center’s 240 staff. Water levels had risen so quickly and high that buses could not be used to move them to safety.

Rivera continues: “Our closed-circuit cameras showed a counter current water flow that we think came from the dykes made at the settlements upstream that finally gave way”.

It was this surge of water that caused most damage with equipment quickly being under 1.5 meters of water.

The 240 people trapped inside the plant had to be moved to the second floor spending the night in space without light or electricity and that was doubly unsuitable given the need to prevent COVID-19 transmission.

While equipment may have spent several hours submerged in water the preventive shutdown meant that there was no electrical danger for those trapped in the plant and by 6 am water levels had receded sufficiently to carry out an evacuation with no lives lost.

Losses

Of the plant’s 35 truck fleet waiting to be loaded for deliveries the following day 30 were saved. Five however were total losses. The company notes that there were several heroes – for example the workers that saved these trucks and the supervisor that implemented the shutdown.

Rivera notes: “If he had taken an extra hour to do it more serious problems would have occurred”.

The plant however sustained significant damage. At first floor level finished product raw materials and equipment were lost. All equipment was damaged including recently purchased items. Electronic items were damaged and the workers’ cafeteria was also destroyed

After eight days some processing was restarted but not all operations could be restored immediately as the plant lacked spare parts and suppliers were also affected. Over 250 motors had to be dried and refurbished.

Disruption at the plant also led to problems at farms. Unable to receive all of the broilers originally planned for slaughter birds had to be kept on farm for longer with consequent increases in their weight feed costs and knock-on effects for hatcheries and breeder farms.

Stocking densities were raised and the time between flocks reduced. Some farms had difficulties in accessing feed due to blocked or flooded roads while a few farms were flooded and flocks lost.

To make matters worse the disaster happened in the run-up to Christmas the company’s busiest period.

Second hit

Hurricane Iota was as severe as Hurricane Eta  however its impact on the plant was less as the shutdown was implemented more quickly electrical fuse boxes were raised in case of water entry and the plant was evacuated more quickly. This time it was only necessary to close the plant for five days.

Rivera explains: “This was a much more controlled interruption without permanent damage. This time we knew of the impending threat earlier so we started to fill storage facilities deliver sufficient feed to the farms fill fuel tanks and stock up on gaskets for example and other materials”.

Sales down

A full week of sales was lost overnight and supply shortages were felt throughout the country. Yet in times of disaster competitors tend to pull together and this helped in securing nationwide food supply and fill the gaps in supermarket shelves.

Rivera notes that nobody has control where nature is concerned. Working with other companies and the Honduran government will be the only way to ensure stronger protection measures.

The company has also learnt that due to the plant’s position in relation to the country’s mountain ranges water passing through the area will be channeled through the river valley. In a worst case scenario hydraulic pressure is not sufficient to force the water out of the valley and it builds up and flows back. To minimize future disruptions the plant’s infrastructure will have to be redesigned and all electronic circuitry raised.

But as importantly the company has learnt about communication and risk management. Signs indicating dangerously high-water levels will need to be completely revised.

Despite the pandemic slowing recovery and the product mix having to be altered the majority of the Pronorsa plant is now back in operations.

Community effort

People and communities are more important that crisis or destruction of property and in response to the devastation wrought by the hurricane Cargill threw itself into helping its employees and the local community.

The Minneapolis-headquartered company immediately authorized funds to help people get back to normal as quickly as possible.

Around 200 of the plant’s 1200 employees lost their homes or cars. Despite this they dedicated themselves to the tasks of rebuilding the company and their jobs so that they could then rebuild their homes.

“There is no better example of commitment and solidarity” notes Blanca Villela Communicatinos Director with Cargill Protein Latam.

The company also joined with several non-governmental organizations private companies and 1500 volunteers working for the World Central Kitchen to distribute over 200000 meals during the last three weeks of November.

Courtesy of Northwest Community Healthcare

After retiring from a corporate career Ira Fingerman is now a beloved uber-active volunteer at Northwest Community Hospital in Arlington Heights where staff members say he's become a true staple.

The 71-year-old Fingerman volunteers an average of six to eight hours a day four to five times a week in the nutrition and food services department. In the last three years he's racked up 3175 hours helping greet people serving food cleaning tables and working in the physicians' lounge.

Fingerman “truly knows everyone” said Stephanie Chan Vo director of guest services for Northwest Community Healthcare.

“People are comforted when they see Ira and he asks how we are doing. He has gotten to know everyone and meal times are not the same without him” she said.

Fingerman was the hospital's No. 1 volunteer hours contributor for 2018 and 2019. Volunteer hours for 2020 will be tallied ahead of the recognition typically announced in March.

“Ira is our Northwest Community Healthcare community hero” Chan Vo said.

When asked why he gives so much time to the hospital Fingerman said he's the one who truly benefits.

“I get out of it more than I give to it” he said. “The community and the sense of seeing other people who do this it's a wonderful thing. ... There are many volunteers some who do far more about the patients getting families to and fro doing things in the emergency room. This is a community.”

Fingerman grew up in Skokie and owned the former Ira's Northbrook hot dog stand in Northbrook before working nearly 30 years in sales management for Tyson Foods. After retiring at the end of 2014 and moving from Chicago to Arlington Heights to be closer to family he decided he needed to volunteer.

He'd learned the value of giving back to others from his mother he said. Plus “sitting around is not a great thing for a person who is retired.”

He reached out to Northwest Community Hospital because it was near his new home and he especially credited the welcoming attitude of Chan Vo who interviews prospective volunteers.

“She was willing to listen to where I could help which is important” Fingerman said. “She was very welcoming about 'what are your thoughts?' and 'what do you need?' and 'let's see if we can fit you into it.'”

The nutrition and food services department was a natural fit because of his background in the food business and over time he got to know the hospital's staff members.

“I felt like the best way to get to know people is to clean their tables” he said. “I don't need to walk around in a suit and tie and ask 'How are you enjoying your meal?' I would take their trays and it went from there.”

Eventually Fingerman was asked if he'd like to staff a pop-up hot dog stand for “specialty day” at the cafeteria which he now does several times a year working with staff member Videl Vargas. The rotating menu also includes Polish sausages Italian beef and Italian sausages.

“The line is out the door with his fans” Chan Vo said.

“It's great fun” Fingerman said.

The hospital community is a true family of people who care for one another and that has been particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic Fingerman said.

“I do love it” he said. “I couldn't work one hour there if I didn't like it.”

Many industries including the food and beverage industry have felt the effects of these shifts.

In this post we’re going to talk about 6 of the top trends in the global food and beverage industry in 2020 that will carry on into 2021. Throughout this post we will assess how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced these trends. To wrap things up we will also talk briefly about the most popular food products of the past year and leave you with some information on selling food and beverage products on Alibaba.com.

What’s going on in the food and beverage industry?

For the larger part of 2020 the global spread of COVID-19 changed people’s lives in all corners of the world. Businesses began to operate at limited capacities people were forced to stay at home and lifestyles changed.

Quarantining and self-isolation changed many people’s habits. Some set out to improve their cooking skills while stuck at home and others made changes towards healthier living. Many people turned to food for comfort during this stressful time.

Consumer behavior isn’t the only shift we’ve seen this year. Factories and farms have shut down at different points in time in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus. Shutting down factories has the unfortunate consequence of delaying production and creating temporary shortages in some regions.

This year has been far from normal which has definitely affected the food and beverage industry in many ways.

Top 6 trends in food and beverage

Each of the factors that we mentioned above has made a different contribution to trends in the food and beverage industry. Let’s take a look at the top 6 trends that we’ve seen on a global scale in the past year.

1. Plant-based food

Vegetarianism and veganism are two growing trends. People are making these lifestyle shifts for a variety of reasons including promoting health and wellness eliminating animal cruelty and prioritizing sustainability.

Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have been two major forces in this industry. They create meat substitutes from plant-based ingredients. Their products are available in grocery stores restaurants and even some international fast-food chains including Burger King1. These brands are not the first to manufacture plant-based foods but they grew in popularity due to their ability to produce meatless products that taste like meat.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has also led to a meat shortage in certain areas. The prices of items like chicken breasts and ground beef skyrocketed. It is the animal-based meat shortage combined with increasing interest in natural and organic products that contributed to the significant spike of retail plant-based food sales in the past year according to the researches2.

Meatless “meats” are not the only plant-based products that are on the rise. Some businesses like Green Mustache a Gold Supplier on Alibaba.com produce snacks that are totally vegan to appeal to consumers that avoid animal products due to sensitivities beliefs or the general desire for “better for your foods.”

Since the market for this type of product is growing3 more businesses are emerging to fill that need.

2. Increases in fresh and frozen produce consumption

Although produce isn’t a new trend consumers are buying more fruits and vegetables than ever before to ensure an adequate intake of immune-boosting vitamins and nutrients.

According to a study done by 210 Analytics IRI and the Produce Marketing Association (PMA) in May 20204 fresh product sales saw a 14.3% YoY increase and frozen produce sales had an impressive YoY growth of 33.8%. Consumers were in their stock-up mindset and were turning to frozen produce to avoid multiple grocery store trips during the quarantine.

“Pre-Covid sales for our [produce] products were around 2-3% of the total basket. We’re seeing...at least 10% at a sustained level post-pandemic.”

- Cathy Burns the CEO of PMA

The spread of COVID-19 has sparked a revolution in the way that people view their health. Many people have set out to strengthen their immune systems to the best of their ability5 One of the best ways to get a healthy amount of these vitamins is through fruits and vegetables. This caused an increase in demand for produce.

Since Vitamin C is widely known for its immune system support and oranges are known as a good source of this vitamin sales for oranges and orange juice saw a significant increase.

The increase in produce consumption will likely go on for years to come since improving immune system health was just one catalyst for this change. The popularization of plant-based diets that we mentioned also comes into play but we will talk more about this later.

3. “Premiumization”

Spending extra money on premium products including premium foods that emphasizes the superior quality and exclusivity is referred to as “premiumization”.

As we mentioned people have had many different mental and emotional responses to the pandemic that have influenced food and beverage consumption. As the “self-care” and “treat yourself” mentalities continue to grow in popularity during the pandemic pampering and treating yourself with premium food has become even more important as a way to cope with the tough times.

The inability to travel and enjoy other outdoor activities has freed up many people’s budgets leaving them with money to spend. Researches also show that millennials and Gen Z make premium purchases far more often. In addition to the superior quality and greater performance – the 2 most obvious characteristics of premium products that justify a higher price point the young consumers also cite emotional reasons that align with their “treat yourself” state of mind. Brands should leverage the “premiumization” trend in order to tap into Gen Z’s growing purchasing power.

Some of the top premium food products include:

Baked goods

Hot drinks

Chocolate

Processed fish

Aged meat

Egg products

Although the world slowly begins to open back up and people can begin to go out again premiumization is predicted to become even more popular in the coming years. According to a report published by MarketWatch6 the global premium chocolate market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.28% from 2018 to 2022.

4. Increase in demand for spices and condiments

A common quarantine hobby was picking up cooking skills. People who were used to being on the go and regularly eating food from restaurants began to learn their way around the kitchen.

As people discovered new recipes they often needed spices and condiments that they hadn’t purchased before. In fact the first quarter of 2020 saw a 67% year-on-year increase in ingredient and condiment sales on Alibaba.com.

This trend probably will not be sustainable for long because at some point people with the demand for these products will eventually build well-rounded spice and condiment collections. This will cause a decrease in demand.

Of course there will still be some demand for these products but it will likely not be as high as it was when it surged earlier in 2020.

5. Production uncertainty

Different countries territories and municipalities have gone through lockdowns at different times over the course of the past year. Some situations called for factory shutdowns that lasted a week or two while other shutdowns lasted for months.

According to the World Bank developing countries have had the most issues with food shortages and supply chain disruptions in the past year7.

In the United States however there was never a real issue of food shortage8 since the country already produces an overabundance of food but people were scared that there would be. This caused people to panic buy.

Tyson Foods an American meat manufacturer had several shutdowns in large plants which led to fear of shortages over the summer9. Smithfield was another American meat factory with similar closures.

6. Preference for sustainability

Over the past couple of years more people have started taking actions and prioritizing sustainable living. The motivation for this shift comes from the collective desire to reduce the global carbon footprint and preserve the non-renewable natural resources on this planet.

Researchers propose that a plant-based diet is better for the Earth10 than a diet that is centered around meat and dairy. While some environmentalists totally rebuke the consumption of animals the general consensus is that the world would eat less meat.

The manufacturing of plant-based food that we mentioned above is also related to this preference for sustainability. The idea is that it is much more resource-efficient and eco-friendly to raise crops than it is to raise animals.

Top food and beverage products on Alibaba.com in 2020

Survival mode has kicked in for many people over the course of this year as we’ve all navigated through uncharted territories.

Between the loss of jobs economic instability and the looming fear of the future many people stocked up on foods that would last in the event that they were unable to leave their homes for long periods of time. Canned goods and non-perishables were a must.

Here are a few of the top-selling food and beverage products in 2020 on Alibaba.com’s international marketplace.

Top-selling food products

Canned tuna

Corned beef hash in a can

Canned wild Alaskan pink salmon

“Fad Free” tuna (sustainably sourced)

Canned fruit (pineapple mango etc.)

Black olives

Top-selling beverage products

Redbull

Soft drinks

5 Hour Energy

Oviten Energy Wake Up

Final thoughts

If there was one conclusion that we can draw from the food and beverage trends over the past year it would be that health is wealth. Food trends in 2020 have been primarily influenced by the spread of COVID-19 and a growing desire for healthy living by younger generations.

The next year is filled with uncertainty as global COVID-19 cases continue to rise and vaccines are introduced but the food and beverage industry will likely see some shifts if or when the world finds some sense of pre-COVID normalcy.

However we do believe that the trends towards plant-based eating healthy food preferences and sustainability will carry on into 2021 and beyond.

This was the same number as in 2019. The median number of failures since the FDIC was established in 1933 was 7 - so 4 failures in 2020 was below the median.



The great recession / housing bust / financial crisis related failures have been behind us for several years.



The first graph shows the number of bank failures per year since the FDIC was founded in 1933.



Click on graph for larger image.



Typically about 7 banks fail per year.



Note: There were a large number of failures in the '80s and early '90s. Many of these failures were related to loose lending especially for commercial real estate. Also a large number of the failures in the '80s and '90s were in Texas with loose regulation.



Even though there were more failures in the '80s and early '90s than during the financial crisis the financial crisis was much worse (larger banks failed and were bailed out).



The second graph includes pre-FDIC failures. In a typical year - before the Depression - 500 banks would fail and the depositors would lose a large portion of their savings.



Then during the Depression thousands of banks failed.

If you were lucky to have their contacts you would then call one and if he was far then you would wait until they returned.

All this changed last year when Uber an online taxi service launched in Uganda taking the industry by surprise and changing urban mobility. But before this there was entry of some private car hire businesses into the industry.

According to Blu Cruise proprietor a car hire company Ms Stephen Ochola this was not only because more companies are outsourcing their transport need but the way car hire business is being done compared to the previous way of special hires.

“It is more of organised groups. People think it is a viable business. Apps have helped to overcome many transport challenges so this has cut down on the bottlenecks of doing business” he says.

Rise of Uber

Kampala was the 462nd city that Uber launched. Two things were distinct. The first being you could order for a taxi online and watch it arrive. The second was you could track your journey home on the app. For taxi drivers this meant a new market place created from the urban folk. It was also a time for drivers to make a killing driving people in the thick Kampala traffic and in the night from bars and clubs across town.

Uber is a service that uses technology to empower any owner of a vehicle to take part in commercial ride-sharing ventures. It has revolutionised the transport industry in many European and US cities and created jobs as one simply needs a car and a smartphone to register. Customers can easily order the service via a smartphone app. Therefore in many places it has provided cheaper and more reliable transport than the traditional taxis.

Mr Moses Mulindwa an Uber driver says he never quit his job to be a driver but looked out for a venture that was worth undertaking.

“This is more like working smart.

I have a platform where I can get my clients without having to negotiate and I do not have ties with anyone I can work when I want. If I want to work I go online” he says.

Like some businesspeople Mr Mulindwa took out a loan from three people to buy a car that he currently uses to transport clients.

When he had just started working using Uber in September there were free incentives on the platform the money was great because he would get Shs10000 per hour for remaining online and nearly Shs10000 per trip taken. He claims drivers were making millions of shillings in a week.

However this changed when the firm slashed prices to attract new clientele. Last year a trip cost Shs900 per kilometre minus the incentives Shs200 per minute and base fare of Shs1300. A trip from Acacia Mall to Najjera was between Shs13000 and Shs15000 for a 10-minute journey. Unfortunately the rates were cut to Shs750 per kilometre Shs150 per minute and base fare to Shs1100 to attract a bigger market.

Lower rates

“A trip that used to be Shs15000 is now Shs10000 so it means on every trip I take I am losing about Sh5000. In the long-run if I do 10 trips I lose about Shs50000. If they had kept that fare we would get by” he says.

Mr Mulindwa says the business has become tough because of the high costs of fuel spent yet the returns are limited by the low rates high cost of servicing a car.

“I service the car after every three weeks because I will drive 500km every weekend which is from Friday Saturday and Sunday and this costs me Shs75000 to 95000 depending on what exactly I have to change.”

Amidst these challenges Mr Mulindwa is worrisome on whether he will be able to pay back his loan.

“The rate at which am going I might have to sell the car so I can pay it off” he says.

On an average day depending on the opportunities and minimal traffic jam he makes 10 to 15 trips that get him a profit of Shs70000. On a bad day he says he will start the day with Shs50000 and return home with Shs40000 because the amount of money he pays for fuel is not equivalent to what clients pay.

He however says the business is profitable because people need a service especially those who work at night.

The only problem is it is not viable for the drivers.

“At the end of the day I am going to quit because I cannot make money using this. If at most I am making Shs300000 a week this is peanuts in the transport business” he says.

This has given the online taxi hailing applications a bad image especially for Ugandan start-ups that have joined the craze and developed similar platforms.

Mr Latimer Wandera general manager Spesho Uganda LTD a start-up that offers practical transport solutions with reasonably priced rides available both day and night says many drivers have been demoralised by the price cuts. He says many of them think they are all the same yet their service offerings are different.

Spesho launched in March 2017 and has signed up more than 100 drivers on its platform. However unlike Uber the company offers three product offerings on demand cab hailing hiring scheduled trips and virtual driver where one can just hire a driver for a day.

Spesho offers location based cab hailing services.

Technically as long as there’s an Internet/data connection you can request for the service. But at the moment Spesho’s driver network is limited to Kampala and the greater Kampala area which is commonly referred to as a Request area.

Uber has sparked controversy in many cities due to concerns of regulation as and how the service can be taxed. The potential costs in this respect for cities such as Kampala where it is not easy to identify an Uber taxi or even a special hire unless one is identified by the app.

Services like Uber could provide mechanisms for user-based self-regulation in areas of pricing and safety.

Challenges

Operation costs are high because the price of fuel is very high yet on a daily basis Mr Ochola says one has to fuel the car pay allowances to drivers and do car repairs.

“I cannot put a cost because the operational costs vary a lot. But you are looking at maybe a total of up to about 30 to 40 per cent of your earnings” he says.

Besides the road network greatly increases costs.

“A car works for a maximum of one and a half years and then we have to put it off our fleet because it is mechanically unsound and its purely because of our roads” Mr Ochola says.

No Regulation in Uganda

Mr Winstone Katushabe the commissioner transport regulation and safety at the ministry of Works and Transport says they are in the process of regulating special hire taxi operations. He says they learnt about the online taxi system when Uber entered the Ugandan market in 2016.

He says these are new developments in terms of regulatory frameworks for the country. But under the current law there is no provision for vehicles or business of such nature online where you can have an app you choose a driver and they come to you.

“Government is in the final stages of drafting rules and regulations to govern these special hire taxi services” he says.

The entry of online taxi hire services has allowed many different individuals to use their cars for special hire taxi services leaving a huge regulation gap.

Mr Katushabe says a passenger can be murdered in a vehicle and nobody takes charge. What we have done is come up with new amendments to the law. He says it is one of the proposals already before cabinet for consideration.

The new amendments will require the online taxi hire services to provide the ministry with a profile of their drivers.

“We have asked Uber to submit all the drivers they have on the platform for biometrics inspection. Additionally they will be investigated by Interpol so that in case of anything we are able to trace that driver” he says.

He says they intend to confirm that the people who are operating these vehicles are the rightful owners and all vehicles have to be verified by Uganda Revenue Authority to get them on to the database.

Taxes

Once you leave Uber unregulated there are a number of negative impacts to society including taxation security and safety. The ministry is working to ensure they comply with all the regulatory regimes of the country.

In terms of safety lax or lacking regulation means any person can operate a taxi regardless of the state of their vehicle or whether they have a valid driving licence.

Accreditation of drivers

The ministry has also asked them for a list of these drivers so that they carry out further checks on their conduct professionalism and competence of the driving permits they have.

“If a driver wants to do Uber and you ask him:do you have a card by ministry of works and transport if they don’t have there is reason for suspicion. Special hire vehicles must be marked and that is the only way you can quickly tell. Currently they are working but illegally” he says.

Revenue sharing

For a base rate of Shs1100 Shs750 per km and Shs150 per minute charge Uber recently revised its prices to attract more people to use the online taxi services. This is affordable compared to what one would pay previously using the old taxis

The drivers are expected to remit between 25 to 30 per cent of the fares per trip to the online apps. Uber calculates how much the driver is supposed to receive and how much they are supposed to remint.

Burke arbeitete für die Zeitschrift New Yorker die brünette Partnerin in einer Werbeagentur. Die junge Frau hieß Margot Heumann. Sie stammte aus dem kriegszerstörten Europa und war an einer Tätowierung auf ihrem Unterarm als Holocaustüberlebende erkennbar.

Margots Geschichte ist das erste Zeugnis einer queeren Frau die als Jüdin die KZs überlebte. Viele Forscher*innen wiesen darauf hin wie schwierig die lesbische Geschichte zu erforschen ist – unsichtbar und zugleich als unwichtig angesehen. In den Konzentrationslagern begegnete lesbischen Frauen die Homophobie der anderen Häftlinge. Deren Vorurteile bestanden in der Nachkriegsgesellschaft fort sodass die wenigen queeren Holocaustüberlebenden ihre Geschichten kaum jemals festhielten. Die wenigen Ausnahmen sind bisher allesamt Männer.

Heute ist Margot Heumann 92 Jahre alt

Margots Stimme ist einzigartig für die Holocaustforschung für Frauengeschichte und für queere Studien zugleich. Durch meine Forschung zu queerer Holocaustgeschichte lernte ich Margot kennen. Sie ist heute 92 Jahre alt sie lebt noch immer in den USA. Ich reiste zu ihr eine Woche lang erzählte sie mir ihre Geschichte.

Margot wurde 1928 geboren als erste Tochter des Einzelhändlers Karl Heumann und seiner Frau Johanna in Hellenthal an der belgischen Grenze. Drei Jahre darauf kam eine jüngere Schwester. Die Mädchen erlebten eine glückliche Kindheit in der Eifel und später in Lippe. Der Familie ging es wirtschaftlich gut und es gab viele Verwandte zum Spielen. 1937 zogen die Heumanns nach Bielefeld wo der Vater für den Hilfsverein der deutschen Juden arbeitete. Als Margot in der Schule als Jüdin ausgegrenzt wurde schickten ihre Eltern sie auf eine jüdische Schule.

Früh fühlte sie sich zu Mädchen hingezogen

Früh entdeckte Margot dass sie sich zu Mädchen hingezogen fühlte. Schmunzelnd erzählt sie von ihrer besten Freundin: Als diese in die Pubertät kam und einen engen Pullover mit einer Einstecktasche in Busenhöhe trug steckte Margot gerne ihre Hand in die Tasche und erklärte wie sehr ihr gerade diese Tasche gefalle. Auf meine Nachfrage antwortete Margot: „Sie war nicht lesbisch. Sie hat geheiratet und soweit ich weiß hatte sie keine weiteren Beziehungen mit Frauen.“ Geredet haben die beiden darüber nie.

Ab September 1941 mussten Margot und ihre Familie den gelben Stern tragen kurz darauf begannen die Deportationen. Da ihr Vater für eine jüdische Einrichtung arbeitete wurden die Heumanns nicht wie die meisten Bielefelder Juden 1942 in die Vernichtungslager deportiert sondern im Juni 1943 ins Ghetto Theresienstadt.

In Theresienstadt wurden Kinder in Jugendheimen untergebracht. Dort erhielten sie gehaltvolleres Essen und eine minder überfüllte Unterkunft. Zuständig hierfür war die sogenannte Jugendfürsorge geleitet von Gonda Redlich und Fredy Hirsch dessen Homosexualität bekannt war. Da die Kinder nach Geschlecht Alter und Sprache getrennt untergebracht wurden kamen Margot und ihre Schwester in zwei unterschiedliche Heime.

Tagsüber galten sie als beste Freundinnen

In ihrem Heim lernte Margot Dita kennen ein hübsches Wiener Mädchen. Dita war ohne ihre Eltern nach Theresienstadt deportiert worden begleitet nur von ihrer Tante und ihrer Großmutter. Margot verliebte sich in Dita und die beiden wurden unzertrennlich. Nachts legten sie sich ins Bett und tauschten Zärtlichkeiten aus. „Wir hatten nicht eigentlichen Sex. Sehr nah daran aber keinen Sex.“

Tagsüber galten Margot und Dita einfach als beste Freundinnen und Dita hatte auch einen Freund. „Ich war eifersüchtig“ erzählte Margot „aber es gab nichts was ich daran hätte ändern können und ich tat es auch nicht. Damals war ich schon klug genug keinen Aufruhr zu machen.“

Bereits mit 15 Jahren wusste Margot dass ihre Liebe keinen Platz in der Öffentlichkeit hat. Dabei teilten auch andere Mädchen nachts das Bett erzählt Margot. Einige von ihnen überlebten und berichteten in ihren Memoiren von ihren „besten Freundinnen“ unterschlugen jedoch Liebe und Intimität. Margots Einblick erinnert uns dass wir den queeren Blick auf Teenagerfreundschaften im Holocaust nicht außer Acht lassen sollten.

Damals lernte Margot auch ihre andere große Leidenschaft kennen die Oper. Das Kulturleben in Theresienstadt war eine wichtige seelische Stütze für die Häftlinge und ist zu Recht heute bekannt. Jahrzehnte später wurde Margot begeisterte Besucherin der New Yorker Metropolitan Opera. Ihre erste Aufführung war die Theresienstädter La Bohème. Margot leuchtet auf wenn sie erzählt wie sie damals die Arie „Wie eiskalt ist dies Händchen/Laßt ich mache es Euch warm“ zum ersten Mal hörte.

Weitere Texte zur queeren Geschichte in der NS-Zeit:

Im Mai 1944 wurden die Heumanns nach Auschwitz deportiert in das sogenannte Theresienstädter Familienlager. Den ganzen Weg nach Auschwitz weinte Margot – weil sie von Dita getrennt war. Einige Tage später trafen auch Dita und ihre Tante ein. Im Familienlager erlebte Margot zum ersten Mal wie schrecklich Hunger sein kann.

Anfang Juli wurde das Familienlager aufgelöst. Die meisten Menschen dort wussten mittlerweile um die Gaskammern und damit auch um die Bedeutung der anstehenden Selektion in der die als arbeitsfähig erachteten Menschen zur Zwangsarbeit ausgewählt wurden. Dita und ihre Tante „bestanden“ die Selektion. Margots Eltern versuchten es nicht erst da sie Margots dreizehnjähriger Schwester keine Chance gaben. Margot beschloss Dita zu folgen. Ihre Mutter war sehr aufgebracht: Sie meinte die Familie solle zusammenbleiben. Als Margot von ihrem Vater Abschied nahm segnete er sie. Sie sah ihn das erste Mal weinen.

Damals waren all ihre Gedanken bei Dita. Heute weint Margot wenn sie davon erzählt. Im Frauenlager in Birkenau wurden Margot und Dita für einen Transport nach Hamburg eingeteilt in die Außenlager des KZ Neuengamme.

Ausgehungert und geschwächt

Die jüdischen Frauen aus Auschwitz waren dort die ersten weiblichen Häftlinge. Sie waren ausgehungert und geschwächt mussten Trümmer beseitigen und Notunterkünfte für ausgebombte Zivilisten bauen fast immer draußen im Freien und mit langen Arbeitstagen. Margots Gruppe durchlief drei Lager: Dessauer Ufer im sogenannten Freihafen Neugraben im Süden und Tiefstack im Osten Hamburgs.

Hier zeigte sich wie das Alter die Lagererfahrung prägte. Während die älteren Frauen unter dem rohen Lagerumgang ebenso wie unter Hunger und Kälte litten erlebten die 16-jährigen Mädchen das Lager auch als Abenteuer: Sie sammelten Pilze im nahen Wald und rollten sich durch frischgefallenen Schnee einen Hügel hinab.

Sie hatten zwar Hunger fanden aber immer Wege etwas Essbares zu ergattern das sie miteinander teilten. Dita war Margots Ein und Alles. Die beiden sicherten sich ein Bett am Ende der Baracke wo sie nachts zusammen sein konnten. Aber die queere Beziehung störte und einmal hörte Margot eine laute Bemerkung „Das ist nicht normal.“ Ditas Tante verteidigte sie: die beiden seien noch Kinder.

Anfang April 1945 löste die SS die Außenlager auf und schickte die jüdischen Frauen nach Bergen-Belsen. Die Bedingungen in Hamburg waren schon erbärmlich aber in Belsen war der Schrecken nochmals größer. „Die Toten waren an beiden Seiten der Straße baumhoch aufgestapelt. Es war einfach unglaublich.“

Als das Lager befreit wurde wog Margot nur noch 35 Kilo

Als die britische Armee am 15. April das Lager befreite war Margot an Typhus erkrankt und wog nur noch 35kg – und das bei einer Größe von 167 Meter. Sie lag zwei Monate im Krankenhaus und wurde im Juli nach Schweden gebracht um sich zu erholen. Dita blieb zurück und ging später nach England.

Margot verbrachte zwei Jahre in Schweden. Sie erholte sich lernte Schwedisch und konnte das erste Mal so etwas wie ein „normales“ Teenagerleben führen. Sie ging zur Schule – und hatte auch zum ersten Mal Sex mit einer schönen blonden groß gewachsenen Schwedin wie sie mir erzählte. 1947 zog sie in die USA zu ihren Verwandten. Eigentlich wollte sie nur ein Jahr bleiben aber das lesbische Leben in New York zog sie in ihren Bann. Über eine Freundin wurde Margot bei einer Werbeagentur angestellt die über die Jahre zu einer der größten weltweit wurde. Und sie lernte Lu Burke kennen eine Intellektuelle WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) – und eine legendäre Lektorin für den „New Yorker“.

Nach drei Jahren beschloss Margot dass sie Kinder haben wollte. Den einzigen Weg dorthin sah sie in einer Ehe mit einem Mann. Sie trennte sich im Guten von Burke und heiratete 1953 einen Kollegen aus einer anderen Agentur. Die nächsten zwanzig Jahre in Margots Leben mögen oberflächlich wie der All American Dream erscheinen. Sie bekam zwei Kinder lebte in einem Haus in Brooklyn und konnte dank einer Schwarzen Haushälterin später ihre Karriere weiterverfolgen. Parallel hatte Margot eine Affäre mit einer Nachbarin; die Ehemänner hielten die Frauen für beste Freundinnen.

Mit 88 Jahren outet sie sich

Auf die Frage ob ihr Mann etwas merkte betont Margot: „Ich bin eine sehr gute Schauspielerin.“ Erst als ihr Mann der glücksspielsüchtig war sie in den 1970ern zu misshandeln begann verließ Margot ihn. Einen bewussten Neuanfang jedoch wagte sie erst mit 88 Jahren als sie auf einen Alterssitz in den warmen Südwesten der USA zog: Sie outete sich gegenüber ihrer Familie. Niemand war überrascht: Alle hatten es schon immer gewusst.

Warum gelingt es erst 2020 dass wir mit Margot die erste lesbische Stimme einer Holocaustüberlebenden hören? Margot wurde mehrfach für Holocaustarchive interviewt. Die Geschichte die sie mir erzählt hat war eigentlich in all ihren Zeugnissen in den bekannten Holocaustarchiven enthalten – aber versteckt. Dita erschien als die „beste Freundin“. Niemand hinterfragte warum sie für Margot so wichtig war.

Eine Biografie als selbstbestimmte lesbische Frau

Erst durch meine jahrelange Forschung erfuhren Margots Verwandte von meiner Arbeit über einen Kollegen in Jerusalem und machten mich mit ihr bekannt. Margot wusste dass ich selbst lesbisch bin und sprach mich auch immer wieder darauf an. So konnte sie sich sicher fühlen und ihre Biografie als selbstbestimmte lesbische Frau erzählen.

Es ist tragisch dass homophobe Vorurteile verhindert haben dass etliche queere jüdische Frauen die KZs überlebten Zeugnisse ihres Leben hinterließen. Auch deswegen sollten wir Margots Geschichte aufmerksam zuhören.

Fernweh zu wecken das ist in diesen Tagen keine große Kunst – außer es geschieht auf so außergewöhnliche Weise wie bei Aleksandra Mizielinska und Daniel Mizielinski. „Auf nach Yellowstone“ heißt der neue Band der polnischen Kinderbuchautoren die schon mit ihrem Landkartenbuch „Alle Welt“ höchst erfolgreich waren das in 32 Sprachen übersetzt wurde. Nun schicken sie das Wisent Kuba und das Eichhörnchen Ula auf eine Reise um die Welt auf der sie acht Nationalparks erkunden auf allen Kontinenten. Sie lernen viel über Bisons und Bambus Wölfe und Pandas das Überleben in der Wüste und die Dunkelheit der Polarnacht und auch über den Unterschied zwischen dem Erlenschnäppertyrann und dem Weidenschnäppertyrann zwei Vogelarten in Amerika.

Wie die Hybride Liger und Töwe – Nachkommen von Löwe und Tigerin beziehungsweise Tiger und Löwin – die ebenfalls ihren Platz haben im Buch ist das wundersame Werk ein hinreißender Hybrid zwischen Comic und Lehrbuch: Man kann ebenso gut absichtslos darin herumstöbern wie sich rettungslos in den Feinheiten der ausgestorbenen Vogelarten Neuseelands verlieren. Die Beispiele zeigen schon: Die Autoren haben große Lust daran sich ins Detail zu vertiefen was manchmal fast nerdig wirken kann wenn etwa die unterirdischen Nestbaugewohnheiten der Blattschneiderameisen erläutert werden dank der Zeichnungen aber nicht zu trocken-gelehrtem Lexikonwissen erstarrt. So kommt die Neugier beim Lesen nie zur Ruhe.

Die großflächigen Tableaus sind überwältigend sie stellen im Breitwandformat vor Augen wie viele Formen und Farben Flora und Fauna ausmachen wie das Zusammenspiel der Natur in fein austarierten Ökosystemen vor sich geht welchen Bedrohungen sie ausgesetzt sind und welche Folgen diese Bedrohungen haben können. Auf diese Weise vermitteln Aleksandra Mizielinska und Daniel Mizielinski mit ihrer Comic-Weltreise auch ein Gefühl des Staunens der Bewunderung des Respekts vor der Natur. Und am liebsten würde man sich selbst aufmachen zu den Geysiren im amerikanischen Yellowstone-Park den Sanddünen des Namib-Naukluft-Parks in Namibia und den urtümlichen Waranen im Nationalpark Komodo in Indonesien. Bis es irgendwann vielleicht so weit sein wird lässt sich die Zeit mit diesem Werk herrlich vertreiben. Nicht nur als Kind."

The UK-based e-commerce company which recently purchased US prestige skincare brand Perricone MD for USD 60 million in cash thus accelerates the growth of its beauty business in the U.S.

Increased US reach

Founded in 1999 Dermstore.com is a leading online retailer for prestige skincare and specialty beauty brands in the U.S. Target has chosen to sell the asset after having inked a partnership agreement with Ulta Beauty.

Antitrust clearance is expected to be received in late January 2021. Dermstore is therefore expected to contribute for 11 months of THG’s 2021 financial year adding sales of approximately USD 180 million (about GBP 135 million) and adjusted EBITDA of approximately USD 4 million (about GBP 3 million).

Key digital beauty partner

THG’s ambition is to become a key global digital partner across the beauty industry powering channel shift from offline to online. The group intends to achieve this goal through the expansion of Lookfantastic.com to become the global leader in online multi-brand distribution and by helping global beauty brands in addressing channel shift of marketing spend from offline to online via its beauty box business (Glossybox.com and Lookfantastic.com) but also by developing sales of its own beauty brands (Perricone MD ESPA Christophe Robin Grow Gorgeous Illamasqua Eyeko Mio Skincare and Ameliorate).

The deal was fueled by the USD 2.6 billion THG raised in its September IPO.

""A key driver behind the decision to list THG on the London Stock Exchange just over three months ago was to enable the Group to make major global investments such as Dermstore.com. Accessing capital through a London listing has enabled us to accelerate our growth plans and build out a global leadership position within the exciting beauty industry"" said Matthew Moulding Chairman and CEO of THG.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWF1dHlwYWNrYWdpbmcuY29tL2NvbnRlbnRzL3ZpZXdfYnJlYWtpbmctbmV3cy8yMDIxLTAyLTAxL21hc2NhcmEtbWFrZXMtaGVhZGxpbmVzLXRyYWNlZS1lbGxpcy1yb3NzLW1pY2hlbGxlLW9iYW1hLXRpa3Rva3MtZmF2b3JpdGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maybelline is 'the TikTok Mascara'—& What's On Tracee Ellis Ross' & Michelle Obama's Lashes?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.beautypackaging.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /contents/view_breaking-news/2021-02-01/mascara-makes-headlines-tracee-ellis-ross-michelle-obama-tiktoks-favorites/ (Caused by SSLError(SSLError(1, '[SSL: UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION_DISABLED] unsafe legacy renegotiation disabled (_ssl.c:1006)'))) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWF1dHlwYWNrYWdpbmcuY29tL2NvbnRlbnRzL3ZpZXdfYnJlYWtpbmctbmV3cy8yMDIxLTAyLTAxL21hc2NhcmEtbWFrZXMtaGVhZGxpbmVzLXRyYWNlZS1lbGxpcy1yb3NzLW1pY2hlbGxlLW9iYW1hLXRpa3Rva3MtZmF2b3JpdGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL2Nvbm5lY3RpY3V0L29yYW5nZS9vYml0dWFyeS1saW5kYS1tYWUtbW9xdWV0LWNyYXdmb3JkLTY4LW9yYW5nZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary: Linda Mae Moquet (Crawford) 68 of Orange,"Obituaries Obituary: Linda Mae Moquet (Crawford) 68 of Orange Linda a truly devoted wife and mother most recently worked for Duracell Inc.

ORANGE CT - (From Cody-White Funeral Home) Linda Mae Moquet (Crawford) 68 of Orange beloved wife of Douglas Raymond Moquet passed peacefully of natural causes on the morning of December 29 2020.

Born on February 6 1952 in Orange NJ she was the daughter of the late Fred Forneur Crawford and Sally Karr Crawford (Grant). Linda led a distinguished 35-year career as a product manager and environmental safety specialist at several large corporations including Procter & Gamble in Bethel; Seton Identification Products in Branford; General Electric in Fairfield; and Stauffer Chemical in Westport.

From 2006 until her passing she worked for Duracell Inc. a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway in Bethel holding various positions including North America and Latin America Product Safety Division Manager. Linda was a proud 1970 graduate of Joel Barlow High School in Redding. She then attended Cazenovia College in Madison County NY and completed her Bachelor’s Degree in Legal Studies at Quinnipiac University in Hamden. She later earned her Master’s in Environmental Science from Southern Connecticut State University in 1998.

Linda met her husband Doug on Anchor Beach in Woodmont in 1985. Throughout thirty-five years of devoted marriage they traveled the country and remained faithful companions until the end. Linda was a devoted mother and took special delight in commissioning her son Major Douglas Moquet Jr. into the U.S. Air Force Judge Advocate General’s Corps in 2014.

Celebrated by her colleagues for making them feel special and appreciated Linda frequently gave gifts and organized social events for her “work family.” She also coordinated the Barlow Lunch Group staying connected with her classmates and celebrating their life milestones. In addition to her many professional and academic accomplishments Linda enjoyed cooking delicious family meals and caring for the family’s several rescue cats including the late Mingo Little Kitty Jellybean Meeper Peeper Flufkin Lucy and Striper. She is survived by her beloved tortoiseshell Pandy—who was always by her side.

An avid traveler Linda loved touring Puerto Rico’s northern coast with her husband and vacationing each summer with her extended family on Block Island RI. For Linda family attendance at cocktail hour was non-negotiable along with sunsets white wine and littleneck clams. Still she savored nothing more than moments spent with her sister Debbie and brother-in-law Dennis Bernas; daughter-in-law Sheridan Ribbing; in-laws Jon and Leslie Whitlock; niece Sarah Whitlock her husband Jessie Schiffrin and their beautiful twins Natalie and Charlotte; and late nephew Mark Whitlock. Linda had a discerning taste for cuisine and loved dining at her favorite restaurants where she always treated the waitstaff like family. She took special pride in preparing her famous shrimp cocktail which was a perennial hit at holiday dinners. Naturally beautiful Linda loved fashion and selecting outfits for herself—but particularly for her husband and son. They will never be without need for her tender love guidance and support. She will be sorely missed. Services and burial will be private. In lieu of flowers memorial contributions may be made to the Dan Cosgrove Animal Shelter 749 E. Main St. Branford CT 06405.

Colorado Midland & Pacific Railway files to operate Tennessee Pass Line - by Tara Flanagan,"Will trains rumble through Chaffee County and over Tennessee Pass again? Do the communities between Cañon City and Eagle need and want them – particularly their environmental impacts?

A subsidiary of the Rio Grande Pacific Corporation is now in a commercial agreement with the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) for the majority of the Tennessee Pass Line the former Denver & Rio Grande Western line that has been sitting dormant since 1997. The route entails 163 miles from Cañon City to just past Eagle. In railroad parlance those are the Parkdale and Sage stations.

Colorado Midland & Pacific Railway Company (CMP) filed on Dec. 31 for common-carrier authority to operate the line with the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) the federal agency that regulates railroads.

None of this guarantees that trains will once again polish the rails hereabouts. CMP says that it now plans to turn to the communities and policy makers along the way to take their temperatures regarding next steps.

The process is a “long arc” according to CMP spokesperson Sara Cassidy.

Indeed CMP may see open arms among the contingent that would like to see passenger service delivering tourists to the high country and possibly employees from Lake County into the resorts of Eagle County.

But the company can expect to see pushback from those who aren’t keen on the possibility of freight trains and what they might carry through places like Browns Canyon in Chaffee County. Claiming that the trains could eventually transport substantial amounts of crude oil through Browns Canyon and other environmentally sensitive areas the Friends of Browns Canyon organization is urging people to review and comment on a draft environmental impact statement on Utah’s Uinta Basin Railway – which could have connections to Tennessee Pass.

Environmentalists are also unhappy about the August 2020 rule from the Trump administration that relaxed guidelines for transporting liquefied natural gas creating the remote but thought-provoking possibility of “bomb trains” that could level entire cities. Ergo discussions about freight trains may now be more explosive so to speak.

The Dec. 31 filing with the Surface Transportation Board means that a much smaller suitor for Tennessee Pass KCVN and Colorado Pacific Railroad lost its bid for the line prompting a sigh among some railroad watchers who wanted to see the operation succeed in connecting lines to ship grain and mining commodities to the West Coast.

As part of that arrangement Stefan Soloviev who controls Colorado Pacific proposes to restore daily passenger service between Pueblo and Minturn. Soloviev had already taken over the old 122-mile Towner Line in eastern Colorado. The Towner connects Soloviev’s elevators in southwestern Kansas and southeastern Colorado to rail lines east of Pueblo. Acquiring the Tennessee Pass Line would have provided a shortcut through the mountains to the west.

The STB rejected without prejudice in March an $8.8 million attempt by Colorado Pacific to purchase the Tennessee Pass Line at liquidation value from UP. The “without prejudice” designation meant Colorado Pacific could file again.

Soloviev’s Colorado Pacific made moves to garner support for a second bid with the STB including letters to chairs of county commissioner boards and other parties outlining plans to add passenger service into its plans which would meet the “statutory test for public convenience and necessity” which the STB said had been lacking from Colorado Pacific’s earlier bid. There was also mention of an easement for trails.

But at the same time Union Pacific said it had been in negotiations with Rio Grande Pacific in a deal that could restore service to Tennessee Pass. Ultimately that plan came forward in CMP’s Dec. 31 filing.

Supporters of the smaller railroad say that whereas Soloviev has a plan of action they speculate that CMP may not get anywhere with passenger or freight service each of which is a possibility as CMP begins to reach out to communities along the route.

Critics say the local rails are a very possible conduit for transporting oil shale resources from Utah’s Uintah Basin. Rio Grande Pacific operates short-line railroads including the A-Train commuter service of Denton Texas and has been involved in an effort to build the Uinta Basin Railway to transport the waxy crude from northeastern Utah to existing rail lines.

The deposits hold an estimated 300 billion gallons of oil – some of the largest oil-shale resources in the world. Environmental groups are fighting development.

It should be pointed out that oil shale is not the same as shale oil (typically accessed through fracking) in that oil shale is basically rock that contains kerogen which is used to make oil. The reserves in the Uintah Basin are generally considered low quality but of possible interest if the right technology and economics play out.

“They’re betting on an oil play” speculated Salida’s Forrest Whitman a former Gilpin County commissioner current railroad enthusiast and vice chair of Chaffee County’s Transportation Advisory Board. “You never really know; it might help get them (CMP) investors.”

Whitman said the railroad blogosphere “lit up” after the Dec. 31 announcement with “a wide range of reactions.”

As someone who loves to ride trains he said the notion of passenger service sweetens the appeal. “They couldn’t possibly make money on it” he said but admitted he liked “the idea of getting on a train from Salida to Glenwood then picking up the California Zephyr.”

He said the future conversations with CMP will be interesting. “Certainly we’ve got a rail segment in there” he said regarding Chaffee County’s master plan. “We talk about what it could be.”

As of now the upcoming discussions with communities remain open as to whether the operations would include passenger service freight or both. There’s also the possibility that nothing will transpire.

Cassidy said the next step is to start talking to communities to determine how much they need and want rail service which could have a significant impact on the movement of workers and tourists in Fremont Chaffee Lake and Eagle Counties.

She said Thursday’s filing was the culmination of more than seven years’ discussion as well as several dormant phases.

“This is the initial step in a long process” she said. She described the Tennessee Pass move as “bringing a new option to the table” and “being a part of the conversation without overriding it.”

Cassidy said there have been numerous parties looking at the Tennessee Pass over the years. Given the typically slow speed of regulatory processes and the amount of restorative work the rails would require Cassidy wouldn’t speculate on how long it would take to actually run trains again.

It has been a long while since trains came through Chaffee County. The last passenger train departed from Salida in July 1967.

Freight service took quite a bit longer to go away. In 1984 Philip Anschutz acquired Rio Grande Industries Inc. the Denver & Rio Grande Western’s holding company which bought the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1988. Southern Pacific merged with Union Pacific in 1996 and that same year Union Pacific filed to discontinue the 173-mile Tennessee Pass Line.

The tracks were taken out of service but were left in place and not officially abandoned.

Brooks 61 is a former heavy equipment operator forced into an early retirement by a stroke. Because of his age he’d be at a higher risk of complications if he were to get COVID-19 which has spread widely in homeless shelters in Colorado.

Fortunately the owner of the hotel where he was staying helped connect him with the United Way of Weld County which had just opened a new type of shelter in an unused apartment building. The rooms are simple with a bed miniature refrigerator microwave two chairs and the kind of foldable table that your school probably pulled out of storage for the annual bake sale. But it’s safe warm and as quiet as can be expected when you have a neighbor on either side Brooks said.

“If this was a regular place that was open (to rent) I’d stay here” he said.

The shelter in a formerly vacant building on the Good Samaritan Society’s Bonell campus in Greeley has 30 rooms housing people at a higher risk from COVID-19 because of their age or chronic conditions. It opened Nov. 6 and will run through April 15 said Shawn Walcott assistant director of household stability for United Way of Weld County. The campus also includes a nursing home an assisted living facility and seniors-only apartments.

It’s one example of nonprofit organizations and governments looking beyond traditional shelters during the pandemic. The states of California and Oregon purchased hotels to use as transitional or permanent housing for their homeless populations according to the Associated Press and the city of Denver rents 800 hotel rooms for people who are at a high risk of COVID-19 complications or need a safe place to quarantine.

Normally the United Way of Weld County operates an 80-bed emergency shelter during the winter Walcott said but it can only take 39 people with social distancing. They looked into renting hotel rooms but the city of Greeley helped set up the partnership with Good Samaritan Society he said.

Benjamin Snow director for economic health and housing for Greeley said the city used some of its funding from the federal coronavirus relief package to make sure the plumbing and other utilities were ready for temporary residents. He estimated about 40 people were staying in the apartment shelter because some rooms can accommodate couples.

Reducing the number of people in the congregate shelter makes it safer for those who stay there by allowing for distancing Snow said.

“This has essentially bought us some time during COVID-19” he said.

Ryan Mertz administrator of the Good Samaritan Society’s Bonell community in Greeley said the building was originally intended for affordable housing but the plans fell through and it sat vacant for at least a year. In the spring they struck a deal with Greeley to accommodate people who were less severely ill if hospitals needed to free up beds. Ultimately it wasn’t needed for hospital overflow so they made a new agreement to use it as a shelter during the cold months he said.

In Denver federal disaster money allows for temporary safe housing in hotels during the pandemic said Cathy Alderman spokeswoman for the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless. A permanent option also opened earlier this year in the former Quality Inn & Suites at 36th Avenue and Quebec Street she said. Tenants in the complex called Fusion Studios pay 30% of their income toward rent with the rest covered by voucher programs.

It took about six months and $8.4 million to renovate the hotel for long-term residents which is faster and cheaper than building new affordable housing Alderman said. Some tenants likely will move into market-rate housing while others who need more support may live out their days there she said.

“I hope we see more of it” she said referring to repurposing buildings.

The apartment-style shelter in Greeley is more expensive than a typical congregate shelter because it’s open 24 hours instead of just overnight Walcott said. In a normal year it costs about $220000 to run the congregate shelter but this year the congregate shelter will cost $380000 because of the need for extra cleaning supplies and security to enforce distancing rules he said. The apartment-style shelter will cost about $600000.

The apartment model has advantages though because private rooms reduce opportunities for conflict and residents made fewer hospital visits in the first month Walcott said.

Some residents reported their health was improving. Michael Lynch who said he’d been experiencing homelessness for 10 years was a frequent patient in local emergency rooms with 113 visits in 2016. Shortly before he moved into the shelter in November he’d been unable to walk because of complications from alcohol use disorder. As of early December he said he hadn’t had alcohol in three weeks and was starting to get around better with a walker.

“I probably would have died out there this winter” he said.

A study from University of Washington found that people who were moved into hotels in Seattle because of concerns about COVID-19 reported better physical and mental health and were more likely to move into permanent housing than those living in traditional shelters perhaps because they didn’t have to spend as much time worrying about day-to-day survival and could begin making plans.

After the cold-weather shelters close the city and United Way will examine whether those living in apartments were more likely to move into permanent housing Snow said. If the results are better they could look at whether a similar set-up is feasible in the long-term he said.

Brooks who was previously living in a hotel said he’s working on saving money for a deposit and the shelter’s housing navigators have taken him to check out apartment options. It’s easier than it was when he had to rent rooms because the only expenses are groceries and food for Milo a chihuahua and Pomeranian mix who acts as his service dog.

“Soon maybe I’ll be back out on my own again” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was conducted in the seven districts of Dodoma region: Dodoma Municipal council Bahi Chamwino Kondoa Mpwapwa Kongwa and Chemba. The region was selected because the CHF Iliyoboreshwa was implemented there before a wider roll out to other regions in the country. Dodoma region is the administrative capital of the United Republic of Tanzania. The region is the 8th most populous in Tanzania with a population of 2083588. Dodoma urban (410956) and Chamwino (330 543) are the most populated districts while Bahi (221645) and Chemba (235711) are the least populated. Subsistence farming and livestock keeping are the main livelihood activities.

By 2015 the region had 360 health facilities providing health services [38]. Accessing health facility services was highly dependent on out of pocket payments with little contribution from health insurance schemes. At the time of the study about 15.9% of the households were enrolled in CHF Iliyoboreshwa a rate that was considerably below what was expected by its initiators and implementers. Bahi district had the highest enrollment (25.3%) followed by Chamwino (25%) and the lowest was Dodoma Municipal council (8.6%). Implemented by the council authorities of the seven districts with support from the Health Promotion and System Strengthening (HPSS) project the Redesigned CHF program reformed the original CHF to make it a viable social health insurance scheme [15]. The program described in detail elsewhere [15 37] comprised reforms across administrative governance and health service provision structures and management of enrolment outcomes. In the reformed scheme the CHF management teams (comprising CHF manager accountant Medical advisor District Medical officer District planning officer District Treasurer and District Community Development officer) were in charge of managing the scheme processes and the council health management team (CHMT) under the leadership of the District Medical officer were in charge of providing health services to the CHF clients. The district leaders such as the District commissioner The District chairperson (Mayor) District Executive Director and Councillors oversaw the implementation of the scheme in their areas of jurisdiction.

Study design

This paper is part of a broader study [19] that employed a concurrent mixed methods design [39] to assess the implementation processes of the Redesigned CHF at different levels of the district health system structures. The Good Reporting of A Mixed Methods Study (GRAMMS) framework for reporting mixed methods studies were followed in reporting the results for this study [40] (additional file 1). In this paper we focus specifically on implementation processes at the district level.

We adopted a mixed methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection and analysis to provide a more comprehensive picture of adoption fidelity and their modifiers. Based on the theory of intervention (TOI) developed by our team and described in detail elsewhere [19] we mapped the intervention district-level components to be followed up in the implementation assessment and grouped them into the following functions to facilitate analysis: 1) recruitment and training of program actors; (2) materials for the program; 3) remuneration of actors in the program; 4) monitoring progress; 5) addressing CHF benefits; 6) promotion to attract enrolments; and 7) addressing the quality of healthcare.

The quantitative component uses a multi-method approach employing a survey questionnaire and a document review checklist both aiming to identify to what extent certain processes were adopted carried out as planned and maintained as routine processes of the scheme and the influence of moderating factors.

Study sample

Sample for the quantitative component

The quantitative component of the study relied on a structured survey and a document review. The sample for the structured survey was drawn from district level implementers (N = 68) meaning the district CHF management team district health management team and policy leaders (such as District commissioner District executive director). The questionnaire was filled by all (census) concerned implementers.

The sample for document review checklist was drawn from documents from all seven districts in the region (N = 7). The documents that provided data for the study are: (i) program reports; (ii) day to day communication about the program i.e. letters memos and meeting minutes; (iii) strategic and operational plans; (iv) redesigned CHF policy documents and by-laws; and (v) information from insurance information management system (IMIS) database.

Sample for the qualitative component

The qualitative sampling procedure was multilevel in nature whereby the sample comprised 39 key informants purposively selected at regional and at district level. Participants ranged from regional leaders technical advisors for the CHF district leaders (public administrators and elected leaders) to frontline implementers (CHF officers and enrolment officers).

The respondents at regional level were selected based on their capacity and position to provide information related to the support given to the districts in implementing the CHF scheme but also their knowledge on contextual influencers of the implementation process. The respondents at the regional level included the regional secretariat members (N = 7) and the development partners operating at regional level (N = 6).

Respondents from district levels were selected based on their experiences with the redesigned CHF their position in the scheme and the expected knowledge they had about the scheme processes. They came from three districts: D3 D4 and D6 which had high average and low enrolment rates respectively in relation to the baseline values since the start of the CHF Iliyoboreshwa. The respondents at the district level included district leaders (N = 8) such as District commissioner and frontline implementers (N = 18) such as CHF manager accountant and CHF officers. The frontline implementers were included in this part of the study to verify the information provided at district level in terms of the support provided to the village level actors.

Table 1 provides a summary of the sample size for the quantitative and qualitative sources of data.

Table 1 Sample sizes for the study Full size table

Data collection instruments and procedures

The first author managed data collection directly with support from a small team of trained research assistants who were recruited based on their level of training (mostly bachelor’s and master’s students in sociology anthropology public health development studies and rural development) and their experiences in conducting public health research.

Quantitative data

Questionnaire

We used a questionnaire (additional file 2) to collect data related to implementation outcomes focusing mainly on the adoption and FOI of the program components such as the recruitment and the training of program actors and materials for the program as reflected in our TOI. The questions on the adoption of the scheme focused on the functionality of Redesigned CHF structures and the usability of the guidelines in daily routines. FOI questions captured adherence to or departures from the CHF standard operating procedures (CHF-SOP) and the probable related moderating factors. The questionnaire was composed of yes/no and Likert scale questions. To ensure validity and reliability of our questionnaire 1) Development of the questionnaire was based on our theory of intervention 2) The questionnaire was discussed among the authors to agree on how the questions are constructed to improve the face validity 3) The questionnaire by the authors together with the trained research assistants 3) Principal component analysis was employed to ascertain key constructs and come up with scales and subscales 4) Cronbach’s alphas of each of the formulated scales were determined as an indication of consistency within the scales. Cronbach’s alpha of at least 0.7 was considered acceptable to measure the internal consistency of each of the scales and sub-scales [41].

Document review checklist

We used a checklist to extract data from the documents relevant to the scheme adoption and implementation (additional file 3). The checklist aimed at extracting numerical information that could quantify districts’ adoption and FOI based on the redesigned CHF original plan.

Qualitative data

We used a semi-structured in-depth interview guide to collect qualitative data from the participants. The interview guide aimed to collect experiences and opinion related to the implementation processes and the contextual influencers at the district level (see additional file 4). The interviews were conducted in Kiswahili recorded verbatim transcribed and translated to English by professional translators. The first author checked all the transcribed translations for accuracy.

Data analysis

Quantitative analysis

Data from the survey questionnaire

To understand the implementation outcomes and their moderators as reported by participants in the survey we had first to define and measure the outcome and explanatory variables before proceeding to statistical analyses. The outcome variables included in our study were: adoption and FOI.

In line with our previous work [19] we measured adoption as the presence or absence of and functioning of the redesigned CHF structures availability status and use of guidelines and related processes and job description. The structures considered include CHF governing board CHF management teams and the conduct of the scheduled or ad hoc meetings of these structures.

We measured FOI as adherence to the program model as originally stipulated in the Redesigned CHF standard operating procedures (CHF-SOP) and related operational document such as planning manuals supervision guidelines (movement plans) and financial management guidelines. To measure FOI we assessed adherence to procedures related to the seven functions of the redesigned CHF reflected in our TOI.

The questionnaire consisted of several items related to each of the outcome variables (adoption and FOI). To provide a clear picture about larger theoretical constructs under study and not to focus on single items included in the questionnaire not meaningful in and out of themselves composite indices were calculated based on an unweighted sum of scores of the items. Items with high face validity that measure the same construct were selected [42]. Thereafter a composite score (sub-scale) or index was obtained from the sum scores of the items. Sub-scales related to adoption were adoption of CHF structures adoption of CHF guidelines and adoption of the CHF processes and adoption of job-description.

Subscales related to FOI (measured as adherence) were 1) recruitment and training; (2) materials for the program; 3) remuneration of actors; 4) monitoring progress; 5) addressing CHF benefits; 6) promotion to attract enrolments; and 7) addressing the quality of health care.

It is worth to note that overall indices (composite scores) for adoption and FOI were obtained as sum scores of the sub-scales related to the adoption and FOI respectively.

Thereafter using the median as a cut off point adoption and FOI indices were categorized into high and low scores.

Explanatory variables here also called “modifiers of the implementation outcomes” were socio-demographic factors (Age categorized into <=40 years and > 40 year Sex categorized as male and female Occupation categorized as CHF service providers CHF fund managers and others Level of education categorized as secondary and below and post secondary and years of schooling categorized as <=15 years and > 15 years) Time worked in the scheme categorized as <= 20 months and > 20 months and Time stayed in the district categorized as <=7 years and > 7 years.

In our statistical analyses we were aided by STATA version 13 (STATA Corporation College Station TX USA) through which both descriptive and detailed analysis techniques to determine the relationship between variables were applied.

Descriptive analysis based on frequency percentages and measures of central tendency or dispersion (mean median or standard deviation and range) were used to understand the situation related to the adoption and implementation of the scheme. We used a chi-square test to determine the association between implementation outcomes and modifiers and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The unit of analysis were the respondents of the questionnaire.

Data from the document review checklist

The document review checklist consisted of several items grouped together per theoretical constructs intended to be measured. We assigned an arbitrary weight of score to each item. The weight scores were from 1 to 10 (or 10–100 in percentage). The summation of each item score lead to a composite variable namely adoption and FOI index for adoption items and FOI items respectively. The analysis of data from the document review was mainly descriptive with an explanatory component in the qualitative part of the study. We conducted descriptive analysis based on frequency percentages and measures of central tendency or dispersion (mean median or standard deviation and range) to understand the situation related to the adoption and implementation of the scheme. The unit of analysis were the districts.

Qualitative analysis

Qualitative data analysis was carried out by two independent researchers (the first two authors) and utilized the framework method [43] assisted by the N-Vivo software (QRS-international). The framework method as described by Gale et al. [43] was applied to analyse the transcribed material. The framework method is flexible and follows step-by-step interconnected stages that guide the analytical process. Coding started after multiple reading of the transcripts. It started deductively based on predetermined theoretical constructs based on our TOI followed by the addition of emerging codes as they emerged from the transcripts. The codes were applied to capture the adoption and fidelity of implementation of the scheme and the factors shaping these experiences also as explanatory to the district level implementation outcomes as determined in the quantitative document review checklist.

Integrated interpretation

The integration of quantitative and qualitative findings occurred at the interpretation level using a triangulation approach [39 44 45]. We investigated where the findings converged offered complementary information or appeared to contradict one another. Integration allowed us to develop a composite holistic and cross-validated picture of the facts based on the results from both quantitative and qualitative datasets. This process of integration took place after the completion of data analysis and entailed identifying similarities and differences merging the results and discussing the meaning of the integrated results across the two levels of analysis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndoby5pbnQvYmFuZ2xhZGVzaC9uZXdzL2RldGFpbC8wMy0wMS0yMDIxLWFkdmFuY2luZy1kaWdpdGFsLWhlYWx0aC1zdHJhdGVneS1pbi1iYW5nbGFkZXNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Advancing Digital Health strategy in Bangladesh,"Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) supported by WHO Bangladesh initiated the development of a national digital health strategy an essential step towards harnessing digital solutions to improve the accessibility quality and affordability of health services.

A one-day stakeholder consultative workshop was organized on 22 December 2020 by Management Information System (MIS) under Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) to finalize the draft strategy developed by the Technical Working Group and refined by the international experts from WHO..

The workshop was facilitated by MIS and was attended by senior officials from MoHFW representative from different Directorate General under MOHFW Bureau of statistics academic institute Directors and Line Directors of DGHS Regional Advisor (HIS) - SEARO representatives of UN-agencies NGOs and private organizations.

The event aimed to finalize the strategy with active engagement of key public and private stakeholders. Stakeholders were invited to share their observations and suggestions to enrich the draft strategy.

“The need for digital health has never been more visible and acute than since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic when disrupted access to health service has forced health care providers and patients to employ alternative means to access and deliver health services.

Furthermore the development of a digital health strategy will allow the country to advance in a more structured and planned way towards the development of infrastructure connectivity quality and validation of the digital applications in healthcare ecosystems. Bangladesh is already at a better stage to use digital technology across all sectors and provides scope for the general population to access the digital solutions to enable the advancement of socio- economic development” said Dr. Bhupinder Aulakh WHO Deputy Country Representative to Bangladesh.

Attending the event Secretary Health Service Division (HSD) MOHFW Md. Abdul Mannan highly appreciated the initiative and emphasized the use of digital technology in achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC).

Director General Directorate General of Health Services Prof. Dr Abul Bashar Mohammad Khurshid Alam highlighted the importance of the strategy and expressed how it will offer a common platform and enable the country to address existing challenges in the area of digital health such as interoperability cross border data security proper use of information.

In August 2019 Bangladesh initiated the development of digital health strategy in pursuing the resolution 71.7 of the World Health Assembly (WHA). WHO is fully committed to support the Government of Bangladesh towards strengthening the digital health systems and welcome all health and development partners to work jointly on this initiative which will ultimately lead to better health for the people of Bangladesh.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbWluaW9ucG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8wMi9zdHJldGNoaW5nLXRvLWZpdC10aGUtdGltZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stretching to fit the times,"Yoga studios adapt to change caused by the coronavirus

by Olivia Murray

omurray@dominionpost.com

Local yoga studios have undergone significant changes to not only the number of students permitted in their classes but how their classes are conducted and even the demographics of clientele — all as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Three yoga studios in Morgantown — The Mindbody Center Morgantown Power Yoga and Inner Life Yoga Studio — have all been affected by the pandemic though the ways in which the virus has impacted these businesses differ.

Chase Hyson owner and operator of The Mindbody Center offers a variety of services including massage therapy and life coaching in addition to workout programs and yoga classes. Hyson said while some services offered at his studio have changed in compliance with COVID-19 regulations others have remained almost unaltered.

“[Yoga has] definitely been impacted because I’m not using the studio as much” Hyson said.

Hyson’s studio can host 20 people during a class but the number of people allowed in the building at once decreased in accordance with social distancing. As the pandemic wore on students began to feel uncomfortable with in-person attendance further contributing to the decline in people attending classes at the studio.

“People weren’t able to consecutively get their classes in and people kind of just stopped coming altogether except for maybe one or two people and at that point it’s not conducive to keep the class for one or two people” Hyson said.

Hyson explained the difficulty of altering his style of teaching in accordance with COVID-19 guidelines. He can no longer physically help his students adjust their positions or perform Thai Yoga Massages on them during class. “It’s changed the dynamic of the classes for sure” he said.

Hyson said he doesn’t teach yoga online. However Hyson’s business has still been functional as its other services have become more prominent. These services particularly massage therapy haven’t drastically changed Hyson said.

“A lot of [massage therapy] surrounds universal health care precautions and safety measures like clean linens [the cleaning] of equipment not touching a human body and then touching my face washing of hands clean nails things like that. People wear masks for massages and I offer a little paper mask that are easily disposable and I think maybe those are the easiest to breathe in” Hyson said.

It is because of the other services offered through Hyson’s multi-faceted business that The Mindbody Center has been successful despite the hardship of COVID-19 on the Morgantown area he said.

“Surprisingly I actually have thrived this year. My massage and coaching have went up because people are now more stressed” Hyson said.

While The Mindbody Center may have managed to survive the difficult situation another local yoga studio suffered.

Suhil Zia owner of Morgantown Power Yoga said his yoga studio was a large older building that lacked the potential for expansive ventilation and he made the decision to close his studio in March to protect himself his teachers and his students.

“It would not have been wise to practice yoga during [the outbreak of] a respiratory virus” Zia said.

Though Zia anticipated the pandemic would be under control quickly he does not regret his decision to close his studio.

“I would not have minded if I got sick. I just wouldn’t have felt good if I gave it to somebody else and they got hurt significantly or very seriously so that was the biggest part of the decision-making” Zia said.

Since the closure of his studio Zia has stayed involved in the Morgantown yoga community and has been able to use his knowledge and expand his skills by offering online classes and working with Inner Life Yoga Studio.

The transition to online classes was difficult for Zia. “It didn’t feel natural to me; it didn’t feel organic … it was very different” Zia said.

He said he did acclimate to the new online teaching environment.

At Inner Life Yoga Studio Zia teaches Thursday classes that differ stylistically from what he taught at his own studio. Inner Life uses the Iyengar yoga method an innovative form of yoga developed by B.K.S. Iyengar.

“I was actually a student of their studio for the last two years. I’ve been taking their workshops. I just really love that place I love the Iyengar method” Zia said.

Kimberly Williams CEO of Inner Life Yoga Studio said she and her co-owner husband are trying to make the necessary changes to their studio to keep their business afloat. The studio now offers online classes in addition to onsite classes and has expanded its teaching staff to include styles of yoga supplementary to the Iyengar method the studio was founded on.

“We brought Iyengar Yoga [to Morgantown] … we were students of [B.K.S. Iyengar] and we teach his style of yoga or at least we did for the last 25 years” Williams said.

The studio offers courses in mindfulness meditation and yoga therapy in addition to traditional yoga.

Inner Life too experienced a shutdown in March due to the statewide stay-at-home order implemented by Gov. Jim Justice. During the shutdown Williams and her coworkers conducted classes over Zoom which she said about “one-third” of her clientele attended.

The studio has since been able to reopen though there has been a significant loss of loyal but high-risk older students and the retirement of three teachers. Since reopening the studio has been adhering to COVID-19 guidelines by requiring face masks social distancing temperature checks and symptom screening for students upon arrival and handwashing before and after classes.

Williams said the process of replacing Iyengar Yoga instructors is difficult because the method requires five years of practice prior to beginning training as an instructor as well as an exam to gain certification. The training and certification process can sometimes take an additional five years to complete.

The owners of Inner Life were forced to examine ways in which they could keep their passion for yoga and their livelihood alive. Their landlord has been willing to accommodate the owners who did receive a West Virginia Cares Grant which they used to pay off some back rent while they reevaluate their business.

“We decided ‘OK we want to reach out to a younger population.’ A lot of the young people are doing what they call Vinyasa yoga … it’s more of an athletic workout but it’s also something that young people like to do. We teach that but it’s not our main thing” Williams said.

To attract a younger clientele to the studio Williams realized that meant incorporating more styles of yoga and bringing in younger teachers.

Bri D’Alessandro a student of Williams and an instructor of Monday classes at Inner Life expressed gratitude for the staff at Inner Life for mentoring her.

“I’m so lucky I’ve got an opportunity to work with Kimberly and be a part of the Inner Life teacher team and staff. There are a lot of amazing people that have helped support and allowed us to stay open despite COVID-19” D’Alessandro said.

Inner Life Yoga Studio has incorporated discount offers. Students of all ages — middle school high school and college — are eligible for a 25% discount. Teachers are also encouraged to take advantage of the 25% discount through Jan. 31 2021.

“Trying to get the word out that’s the challenge” Williams said.

(PhilHealth) said on Saturday that it would start collecting the mandated hike in members’ contributions this month despite persistent exposés of corruption and wrongdoing at the state-run health insurer.

Rey Balena spokesperson for PhilHealth said in a radio interview that Republic Act No. 11223 or the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act mandates increases in member premiums by increments of 0.5 percent every year starting 2021 until it reaches the 5-percent limit in 2025.

This year the premium rate of PhilHealth members will increase to 3.5 percent of monthly basic salary from 3 percent in 2020.

“This will sustain and expand current benefits that are enjoyed by all. The aim of the UHC law is for benefits not to become stagnant” Balena said in Filipino during a radio interview adding that the state corporation would not be able to sustain the benefits enjoyed by members if premiums are not increased.

Balena also said that while PhilHealth recognizes that the country is currently facing a pandemic the state insurer is bound to implement the UHC law.

But Rep. Mike Defensor pressed PhilHealth to defer the increase in members’ contributions for at least six months especially since the state insurer has much to explain to the Filipino people.

One of the irregularities PhilHealth needs to explain is why it has not recovered over P15 billion in illegal advances to private hospitals that have not recorded COVID-19 cases.

‘Recover advances first’

Aside from advances for nonexistent COVID-19 cases Defensor said PhilHealth officials should also go after to an additional P1.5 billion in advances to health facilities with fraud cases.

“They should recover those advances first before effecting any premium increase” said Defensor who used to chair the House public accounts’ panel that jointly probed the allegations of corruption in PhilHealth last year.

Defensor said the state health insurer should not add to the burden of its members who are suffering from the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“My appeal to PhilHealth is to defer or delay the increase by at least six months to give time to Congress to pass an amendatory bill and other measures reforming the agency to make it more efficient and effective and to lessen corruption which results in billions in financial losses every year” he said.

He pointed out that even if the House fails to approve remedial legislation the state health insurer could implement the adjustment later in 2021 and still be compliant with the law.

“Even if the increase is delayed PhilHealth will not run out of funds because it will receive a budgetary subsidy of P71 billion this year from taxpayers. It can also use its earnings from its investments” Defensor said.

Under the UHC Act and its implementing rules and regulations those with a basic monthly salary of P10000 and below in 2021 would pay P350 a month in premiums while those earning P70000 and higher will pay a fixed P2450 per month.

Some senators were displeased over PhilHealth’s decision to implement the scheduled premium rate hike amid public distrust in the state health agency due to corruption.

In September President Duterte approved the filing of administrative and criminal complaints against PhilHealth officials involved in the irregularities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdtYW5ldHdvcmsuY29tL25ld3MvdG9wc3Rvcmllcy9uYXRpb24vNzcwMTY1L2dyb3VwLWhpdHMtcGhpbGhlYWx0aC1wcmVtaXVtLWhpa2Uvc3Rvcnkv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ21hbmV0d29yay5jb20vbmV3cy90b3BzdG9yaWVzL25hdGlvbi83NzAxNjUvZ3JvdXAtaGl0cy1waGlsaGVhbHRoLXByZW1pdW0taGlrZS9zdG9yeS8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Group hits PhilHealth premium hike,"The Health Alliance for Democracy (HEAD) on Saturday slammed the increase in the contribution rate of members of the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. despite the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.

“Amid the people’s economic hardships particularly in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic and despite serious corruption issues within its organization PhilHealth callously announced that effective January 2021 it will implement an increase in monthly premium contributions as provided in the Universal Health Care Law” HEAD said.

Starting this month the premium rate of PhilHealth members will increase to 3.50% of monthly basic salary from 3.00%in 2020.

Contributions of employed members shall be equally shared between employees and employers while those of self-paying members professional practitioners and land-based migrant workers and other direct contributors with no employee-employer relationship are computed straight based on their monthly earnings and paid wholly by the member.

Under the Universal Health Care (UHC) law the premium rate shall increase to increments of 0.5% every year starting 2021 until it reaches the 5% limit in 2025.

HEAD said it has since been raising serious objections to the insurance-based UHC Law with PhilHealth as its prime mover.

“HEAD has also since pointed out that the scheduled increases of up to 5% in premium contribution in the next seven years as mandated in the UHC Law will impact heavily on the people” it said.

“PhilHealth’s announcement of the increase in the premium contribution reflects the government's utter disregard to the people’s well-being” it added.

The group said that instead of alleviating the people’s economic hardships the government inflicts more burdens to the people by increasing PhilHealth premium contribution from last year’s 3% to 3.5% deduction to the members’ salary in 2021 — amounting to P350 to P2450 per month.

“The additional government’s exaction is sought by PhilHealth amid the scandals and various cases of fraud and graft and corruption that its top officials have been accused of and which had resulted in the exhaustion of [health insurance] funds” HEAD said.

During the Senate hearings on the PhilHealth case billions of pesos were reported lost to corruption.

Based on the testimony of a whistleblower during a Senate hearing HEAD said that in 2019 alone an estimated P15 billion of taxpayer's hard-money and premium contributions went to the pockets of its officials and their cohorts.

“For year 2021 71.4 billion of people’s money is again allotted to the corruption-riddled PhilHealth” the group said.

PhilHealth has since defended the contribution rate hike saying it is mandated under the UHC law and it will sustain the health care benefits for all Filipinos.

“HEAD calls on the Filipino people to demand the government to reject the increase of PhilHealth premium and denounce the practice of making the insurance corporation a milking cow for corrupt officials” the group said.

“HEAD also reiterates its call for the government to take full responsibility for the people’s health and address the crisis of corruption” it added.

The group also called for abolishment of PhilHealth and allocate its funds directly for public health state-run hospitals and health facilities.

“With bigger and better funding public health facilities can have more medical supplies and medicines and can provide free and quality out-patient services while bigger facilities like hospitals will have better and more complete diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities” it said.

HEAD also called for the development and strengthening of the public health care system that is integrated and tax-funded and that can provide free and comprehensive health care.

“Develop a health care system that is centrally planned and anchored on the principle that health is a basic right” it said. —LBG GMA News"

Kevin Lassahn has been named vice president and general manager of the complex the company said in a statement Wednesday. He succeeds Dennis Payne who retired Jan. 2 after 33 years with the company.

Lassahn has been with Valero since 2005.

Before to moving to Corpus Christi he was the vice president and general manager of Valero's Ardmore refinery in Oklahoma. Lassahn has also held several positions at Valero’s corporate headquarters in San Antonio as well as worked in Benicia Calif. and Delaware with the company.

“Kevin is a proven leader who brings a wealth of experience to our Corpus Christi refineries” said Lane Riggs Valero president and chief operating officer. “We thank Dennis Payne for his service and wish him only the best in his well-deserved retirement.”

Lassahn holds a Chemical Engineering degree from Drexel University. He and his wife Jennifer have four children.

“It’s an honor to be selected to lead the Corpus Christi team. We will continue to run safe and reliable operations and be a good corporate neighbor.” Lassahn said. “I look forward to meeting more community members and settling into the Coastal Bend.”

Valero operates 15 petroleum refineries including the two-plant Bill Greehey refining complex in Corpus Christi.

Aún con la pandemia del coronavirus Domino’s pudo adaptarse rápidamente atrayendo nuevos clientes que buscaban opciones de comida a domicilio mientras estaban en cuarentena.

Los franquiciados de Domino’s han reportado que es posible obtener ingresos de seis cifras en sus restaurantes y más de la mitad de los franquiciados poseen más de una sucursal por lo que no es sorprendente que haya un aumento en la cantidad de personas que quieren tener su propio Domino’s Pizza.

Si este es tu caso toma en cuenta que necesitarás demostrar que tienes $75000 dólares en activos líquidos (que son aquellos que pueden convertirse en dinero en efectivo a corto plazo) además de pagar una tarifa de franquicia de $25000 dólares. Todo esto es solo para que Domino’s te considere para una abrir una sucursal según se informó en Mashed.

Después de esto y si eres aceptado para abrir una franquicia la inversión total puede estar entre los $120000 y los $462000 dólares y debes pagar una tasa de regalías del 5.5% de las ventas a la cadena.

Otra cosa más que debe considerar es que más del 95% de los franquiciados de Domino’s comenzaron como empleados de la cadena donde aprendieron las habilidades que se necesitan para dirigir una franquicia.

El formato físico fue una de las principales medios de distribución de juegos en los albores de la industria del entretenimiento electrónico. Sin embargo con el paso de los años en la industria ha surgido la opción de comprar juegos completamente de forma digital que para muchos es una opción mucho mejor y que por consecuencia ha relegado la compra de videojuegos en caja. Sin embargo aún hay muchos entusiastas del formato tradicional y como prueba está Limited Run Games que compartió la millonaria cantidad de juegos físicos que ha vendido en años recientes.

Limited Run Games fue fundado en 2015 y tiene como meta mantener vigente el negocio de los videojuegos en formato físico que aunque parece que su popularidad va a la baja aún hay personas que prefieren este formato antes que el digital. Desde su establecimiento esta compañía no sólo se ha aliado con estudios indie para lanzar versiones físicas de juegos nuevos sino para hacer relanzamientos de títulos añejos dándoles así la posibilidad a muchos fans de tener una copia física de su juego favorito al igual que ediciones de colección muy llamativas que muchas veces se venden en exclusiva en esta tienda en línea.

Por si te lo perdiste: el juego mexicano Neon City Riders tuvo distribución física gracias a Limited Run Games.

Limited Run Games muestra que aún hay interés por el formato físico

Pues bien el fundador de Limited Run Games Josh Fairhust reveló que la compañía comenzó el año de gran manera ya que el primer día de 2021 superó la marca de los 2.5 millones de juegos en formato físico vendidos un logro que se consiguió en en el transcurso de los últimos 5 años.

“Sinceramente puedo decir que en 2015/2016 nunca pensé que alcanzaríamos esta meta. Gracias por todo su apoyo a lo largo de los años” comentó Josh Fairhust.

Si crees que esta cifra es algo pequeña para el número de años debes tomar en cuenta que Limited Run Games como su nombre lo indica lanza juegos en tirajes limitados que tienen como objetivo principal a los fans que desean una versión física o de colección de algún título. Dicho esto en muchas ocasiones el número de copias disponibles no superan las 5000 unidades (y suelen agotarse en pocos minutos) por lo que una vez que se agotan las copias disponibles no se vuelven a producir más.

Today we crossed 2500000 physical games sold over the last five years at @LimitedRunGames.



I can sincerely say that back in 2015/2016 I never thought we'd reach this milestone. Thank you for all of your support over the years! — Josh Fairhurst (@LimitedRunJosh) January 2 2021

Si bien este tipo de productos aún representan un bajo porcentaje de las ventas generales de automóviles a nivel mundial su expansión sigue en marcha y en Estados Unidos ya han superado a los vehículos con transmisión manual. Ahora parece que las inversiones realizadas por las marcas en electrificación están recibiendo un impulso por parte de los gobiernos.

Adiós a los motores de combustión

Decimos esto porque el estado de Massachussetts ha anunciado su intención de prohibir la venta de automóviles nuevos alimentados por combustibles fósiles tradicionales para el año 2035 tal y como cuentan nuestros compañeros de C&D USA. El gobernador Charlie Baker publicó una hoja de ruta de descarbonización para 2050 que incluye la reducción de las emisiones de los automóviles de pasajeros. Massachusetts afirma que el 27% de las emisiones en todo el estado provienen de vehículos ligeros y su objetivo es alcanzar las cero emisiones netas de combustibles fósiles para dicho año.

Para asegurarse de que esos vehículos eléctricos sean realmente utilizables el estado planea expandir la infraestructura de carga pública para así beneficiar a todos aquellas personas que no tienen un garaje en el que cargar un automóvil ecológico. Las iniciativas de California y ahora Massachusetts podrían ser el comienzo de una tendencia de los estados para prohibir lentamente la venta de vehículos nuevos de combustión. Mientras tanto Joe Biden ha anunciado un plan para acelerar la electrificación de vehículos en los Estados Unidos que incluye reemplazar las flotas del país con este tipo de automóviles.

¿Y los de segunda mano?

El Departamento de Protección Ambiental de Nueva Jersey también anunció durante el pasado mes de octubre su intención de eliminar de las calles los vehículos de combustión interna para el año 2035. Dado que se espera que el costo de los vehículos eléctricos alcance la paridad con los automóviles de gasolina en unos pocos años algunos de los problemas relacionados con el precio de venta de estos productos que frena a los compradores potenciales desaparecerán.

Actualmente Massachusetts y California solo exigen que los vehículos nuevos vendidos para 2035 sean eléctricos. Se seguirán permitiendo la venta de vehículos usados ​​a gasolina. En otras palabras todavía será posible que cualquiera amante de la gasolina pueda adquirir un Corvette V8 de segunda mano para entonces.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbHNvbGRlZHVyYW5nby5jb20ubXgvbG9jYWwvbXVuaWNpcGlvcy9jb21lcmNpYW50ZXMtZGUtcm9wYS1lbi1jYW5hdGxhbi1hc2VndXJhbi1xdWUtY2VycmFyb24tMjAyMC1jb24tYnVlbmFzLXZlbnRhcy02MTk3Mzg5Lmh0bWzSAZEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWxzb2xkZWR1cmFuZ28uY29tLm14L2xvY2FsL211bmljaXBpb3MvY29tZXJjaWFudGVzLWRlLXJvcGEtZW4tY2FuYXRsYW4tYXNlZ3VyYW4tcXVlLWNlcnJhcm9uLTIwMjAtY29uLWJ1ZW5hcy12ZW50YXMtNjE5NzM4OS5odG1sL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comerciantes de ropa en Canatlán aseguran que cerraron 2020 con buenas ventas,"CANATLÁN DGO.(OEM).- Con buena venta cerraron el año comerciantes de ropa en la ciudad de Canatlán Durango.

Wie kam es dazu? Ein Blick in die Historie des Unternehmens der Samwer-Brüder.

„Dingdong!“ – Rocket-Internet-Chef Oliver Samwer beim Börsengang im Jahr 2014

Dieser Text erschien zuerst am 31. März 2020 und hat in diesem Jahr besonders viele Leserinnen und Leser interessiert.

Keimzelle der Berliner Startup-Szene seelenloser Firmenkopierer Ego-Show von Oli Samwer – egal wie man Rocket Internet bewertet die Bedeutung des Inkubators und Investors für die deutsche Digitalbranche ist unbestritten. Doch wie wurde das Unternehmen zu dem was es heute ist? Was waren die Meilensteine und Rückschläge auf dem Weg von Rocket Internet? Wir blicken zurück auf fast 20 Jahre Firmengeschichte – von den frühen Jahren bis zur aktuellen Entscheidung das Unternehmen von der Börse zu nehmen.

Dieser Artikel erschien zuerst im Januar 2021 und wird laufend aktualisiert da er besonders viele Leserinnen und Leser interessiert.

Vorgeschichte und frühe Jahre

1999

Die Brüder Oliver Marc und Alexander Samwer machen ihren ersten Firmenklon zu Geld: Das Online-Aktionshaus Alando ist noch keine 100 Tage alt als sie es für 50 Millionen Dollar an sein offensichtliches US-Vorbild Ebay verkaufen.

2000

Die Samwers gründen den Klingeltonanbieter Jamba der für überteuerte Abos und Kreationen wie den „Crazy Frog“ bekannt wird. 2004 wird das Unternehmen für 273 Millionen Dollar vom US-Internetkonzern Verisign übernommen. Oliver und Marc Samwer bleiben bis Ende 2005 Geschäftsführer.

2006

Die Brüder investieren in das soziale Netzwerk StudiVZ das Beobachter verdächtig an den US-Konkurrenten Facebook erinnert. Zwei Jahre später werden sie ihre Anteile an Holtzbrinck verkaufen das StudiVZ für 85 Millionen Euro übernimmt – und kurz darauf eine Plagiatsklage von Facebook am Hals hat.

2007

Gründung von Rocket Internet. Das Unternehmen startet als Inkubator für Neugründungen von Internetfirmen – meist Kopien von US-Vorbildern was Rocket den Ruf als „Klonfabrik“ einbringt. Schon in den Jahren zuvor haben die Samwer-Brüder angefangen über ihren European Founders Fund Risikokapital in Startups zu stecken. Zu ihren wichtigsten Beteiligungen bis heute zählen Zalando Delivery Hero Hellofresh Home24 Westwing Edarling Groupon und Billpay.

2008

David Schneider und Robert Gentz gründen in Berlin mit finanzieller Hilfe der Samwers den Online-Modehändler Zalando. Im gleichen Jahr wird bekannt dass die Samwer-Brüder sich auch an Facebook beteiligt haben. 2011 werden sie die Anteile am sozialen Netzwerk wieder verkaufen – und Schätzungen zufolge ihren Kapitaleinsatz verdreifachen.

2009

Rocket Internet Philipp Kreibohm und Felix Jahn gründen das Unternehmen FP Commerce besser bekannt unter seinem späteren Namen Home24. Neun Jahre später wird der Möbelshop an die Börse gehen. Ein Misserfolg: Schon kurz nach dem IPO muss Home24 eine Umsatzwarnung herausgeben.

2010

Groupon kauft Citydeal den Rocket-Kandidaten in einer ganzen Reihe von deutschen Kopien der bekannten US-Schnäppchenseite. Keine sechs Monate nach dem Start soll für das Startup eine dreistellige Millionensumme geflossen sein.

„Ich bin der aggressivste Typ im Internet auf dem Planeten.“ – Selbstbeschreibung von Oliver Samwer per E-Mail

Vom „Blitzkrieg“ zur Börse

2011

Dominik Richter Jessica Nilsson und Thomas Griesel gründen in Berlin unter finanzieller Beteiligung von Rocket Internet den Kochboxenversender Hellofresh. In München startet die ehemalige Elle-Redakteurin Delia Fischer (heute Delia Lachance) mit Stefan Smalla Tim Schäfer Matthias Siepe Georg Biersack und Geld der Samwers den Einrichtungs-Onlineshop Westwing. Rocket eröffnet sein erstes Auslandsbüro in Brasilien.

Kurz vor Weihnachten veröffentlicht Techcrunch die berüchtigte „Blitzkrieg“-E-Mail von Oliver Samwer an sein Team. Er schreibt darin von geschäftlichen Plänen die „mit Blut unterschrieben“ werden müssten und schließt mit den legendär gewordenen Worten: „Ich bin der aggressivste Typ im Internet auf dem Planeten. Ich werde sterben um zu gewinnen und ich erwarte das Gleiche von euch!“ Samwer entschuldigt sich später für seine „unangemessene“ Wortwahl.

2012

Maximilian Bittner und Rocket Internet gründen mit Lazada den Amazon-Klon für Südostasien. 2016 übernimmt der chinesische Tech-Konzern Alibaba die Mehrheit an dem Unternehmen das zu einem der führenden E-Commerce-Plattformen der Region aufsteigt.

2013

Die Samwer-Brüder legen den Startup-Fonds Global Founders Capital auf mit dem sie später zum Beispiel in Revolut Homteogo oder Personio investieren. Oli Samwer äußert globale Ambitionen: „Es gibt weltweit nur drei Internetfirmen: Amazon das chinesische Alibaba und uns.“ Neben Lazada in Südostasien hat Rocket bis dahin etwa schon Onlineshops in Brasilien (Dafiti) Nigeria (Jumia) Südafrika (Zando) Russland (Lamoda) und im Nahen Osten (Namshi) gegründet.

2014

Am 1. Oktober geht Zalando an die Börse. Einen Tag später folgt Rocket Internet. Die Samwers locken Anleger mit dem Versprechen Startups am Fließband zu produzieren und groß zu machen. Der Ausgabepreis für die Zalando-Anteile liegt damals deutlich unter dem der Rocket-Aktie – beim heutigen Kurs verhält es sich umgekehrt.

2015

Im Frühjahr steigt Rocket für fast eine halbe Milliarde Euro zu 385 Prozent bei Delivery Hero ein. Im September kauft das Lieferdienstunternehmen den Samwers den Restaurant-Lieferdienst Foodora ab bei dem sie erst wenige Monate zuvor eingestiegen waren. Im gleichen Jahr gründet Alexander Samwer in München mit Picus Capital seinen eigenen Frühphaseninvestor.

„Jetzt können sie mich einen Vollidioten nennen.“ – Oliver Samwer wenn er vor Aktionären zugibt zwar viel Geld aber keine Ideen zu haben

Doch keine „Startups am Fließband“

2016

Im Januar erfolgt das First Closing des Rocket Internet Capital Partners Fund mit 420 Millionen US-Dollar. Der Fonds wird bis zum folgenden Jahr auf eine Milliarde Dollar ausgeweitet. Rocket tritt mittlerweile zunehmend als reiner Investor statt als Inkubator auf. Das Startups-am-Fließband-Verprechen vom Börsengang konnte nicht eingelöst werden davon zeugt auch ein massiver Stellenabbau in der Berliner Zentrale.

2017

Im Juni steigt der Großaktionär Kinnevik komplett bei Rocket aus die Aktie stürzt daraufhin ab. Im Dezember wird bekannt dass Rocket Internet mit Global Growth Capital in London eine Bank für Startup-Kredite aufbaut. Derweil haben Marc und Oliver Samwer Ärger wegen ihrer Immobiliengeschäfte: Ein Berliner Clubbetreiber wirft den beiden vor sein Lokal aus einem ihrer Gebäude im Stadtteil Kreuzberg verdrängen zu wollen.

2018

Im März wird die Rocket-Aktie in den MDax aufgenommen. Zum Jahresende gibt Rockets Airbnb-Klon Wimdu auf 100 Angestellte in Berlin und Lissabon verlieren ihre Jobs. Alexander Samwer baut derweil mit Arvantis einen weiteren eigenen Investor auf.

„Grins.“ – Oliver Samwer (l.) wenn er sich nicht grämt sein Unternehmen von der Börse zu nehmen

Börsenabschied? Ja/nein/vielleicht



2019

Im Sommer kommen Spekulationen auf Oliver Samwer wolle Rocket Internet von der Börse nehmen. Der CEO dementiert befeuert die Gerüchte aber durch Rückkäufe eigener Aktien zum Beispiel von United Internet. Bei der Präsentantion der Zahlen auf der Hauptversammlung im Juni gesteht er: Rocket hat zwar viel Geld aber keine Ideen um es auszugeben. „Ich weiß unsere Pipeline ist etwas dünn. Jetzt können sie mich einen Vollidioten nennen“ sagt Samwer den Aktionären. Wenig später wird berichtet dass für die zweite Auflage des Rocket Internet Capital Partners Fund 900 Millionen Euro zusammengekommen seien.

2020

Im Frühjahr baut Rocket Internet seine Führungsriege um. Alexander Kudlich verlässt den Vorstand und markiert damit die endgültige Abwendung der Berliner vom Inkubator-Dasein für das er maßgeblich stand. Soheil Mirpour rückt ins Spitzengremium nach. Eine eher unspektakuläre Personalie die zeigt dass sich die Macht bei Rocket Internet noch weiter auf Oliver Samwer konzentriert. Aktionärsschützern gefällt das nicht.

Bei der Jahreshauptversammlung Mitte Mai die Corona-bedingt nur digital stattfindet betont Samwer erneut: „Erfolge lassen sich nicht am Fließband produzieren.“ Nachdem es lange still war brütet sein Unternehmen seit dem vergangenen Jahr 20 neue Ventures aus vor allem in Asien und Australien. Ob Rocket darüber hinaus mit den mehr als zwei Milliarden Euro in seiner Kasse neue Projekte ausgründen will bleibt jedoch unklar. Weitere Börsengänge von Beteiligungen schließt das Unternehmen für die kommenden Jahre aus.

Dabei gelingt einer der wichtigsten Rocket-Beteiligungen kurz darauf der Aufstieg in die erste Börsenliga: Delivery Hero beerbt den Skandal-Konzern Wirecard im Dax. Ein holpriger Start der Aktienkurs des Lieferdienstes legt in der ersten Woche ein Minus von zehn Prozent hin die Börsenbewertung bricht um etwa eine Milliarde Euro ein. Finanzchef Emmanuel Thomassin nimmt es gelassen: „Anstatt uns auf kurzfristige Aktienkursbewegungen zu konzentrieren haben wir uns immer dafür eingesetzt in unser langfristiges Wachstum zu investieren.“

Währenddessen hat Rocket Internet offenbar genug vom Parkett: Nach langen Gerüchten und vielen Dementis gibt der Startup-Investor am 1. September seinen Abschied von der Börse bekannt. Durch das Delisting könne bei strategischen Entscheidungen ein längerfristiger Ansatz verfolgt werden begründet das Unternehmen das an der Börse zuletzt mit rund 26 Milliarden Euro bewertet wurde seine Entscheidung. Der Kapitalmarkt habe als Finanzierungsmöglichkeit an Bedeutung verloren. Aktien werden zum gesetzlichen Mindestkurs von 1857 Euro zurückgekauft.

Aktionäre der ersten Stunde die Rocket Internet bis heute treu geblieben sind dürften sich ärgern. Beim Börsengang im Jahr 2014 mussten sie das Papier noch für 4250 Euro erwerben. Ein weiteres Mal in diesem Jahr sind die Aktionärsschützer nicht erfreut.

2021

Rocket Internet muss Vertrauen zurückgewinnen und unter Beweis stellen dass die Startup-Schmiede weiterhin einen guten Riecher für aufstrebende Digitalfirmen hat. Ein neuer Finanzmarkt-Trend hat sich derweil in Europa breit gemacht: Spacs. Rocket Internet springt auf den Zug auf und lotet die Möglichkeiten aus mit einer Firmenhülle an die New Yorker Börse zu gehen.

Im März geht die noch leere Rocket-Firmenhülle unter dem Namen Namen Rocket Internet Growth Opportunities an die Börse. 25 Millionen Einheiten (Units) werden hier für je zehn Dollar unter dem Handelssymbol RKTAU angeboten. Das soll dem Spac umgerechnet 210 Millionen Euro (250 Millionen Dollar) einbringen. Anfänglich waren noch 240 Millionen Euro (2875 Millionen Dollar) angepeilt.

Ende April registriert Oliver Samwer drei weitere Firmenhüllen in Luxemburg. Sie laufen unter den Namen European Growth Opportunities Spac 1 2 und 3. Im Vorstand der Spacs sitzen Chef Oliver Samwer der zweite Rocket-Vorstand Soheil Mirpour Arnd Lodowicks Vice President des Inkubators und Geschäftsführer von Global Founders Capital sowie Julien De Mayer.

Während Rocket durch seine Spacs Kapital an der New Yorker Börse abgreift schwelt der Konflikt mit den alten Aktionären. Obwohl sich das Unternehmen von der Frankfurter Börse verabschiedet hat werden die Aktien mit steigendem Wert weiter gehandelt. Die Minderheitsaktionäre setzen sich durch eine Garantiedividende ausgezahlt zu bekommen. Rocket muss vier Cent je Aktie auszahlen – insgesamt 43 Millionen Euro. Der Hedgefonds Elliott hält weiterhin 15 Prozent an der Aktie. Der nächste finanzielle Eklat für Rocket bahnt sich an.

Investors Paul Singer hält mit Elliott zum Ende des Jahres 20 Prozent der Aktien. Singer ist bekannt dafür mit solchen Strategien höhere Preise herauszuschlagen. Und den bekommt der Großaktionär: Im Dezember stellt Rocket Internet den Rückkauf der verbliebenen Aktien zu je 35 Euro in Aussicht. Elliott stimmt dem Deal zu. Der finale Beschluss für den Rückkauf der verbliebenen Anteilsscheine soll am 31. Januar 2022 bei einer außerordentlichen Hauptversammlung getroffen werden.

Here is the list of 10 best services in USA.

In United States of America mobile SIM network faces problem due vast area and less network coverage. Also many network providers offer pricey services. Now with 4G roll out in the entire country their is an increase in competition to gain more potential customers by offering the best value for money services. In the US you will find a lot of MVNOs and tempting GSM prepaid plans for various categories of customer. Some mobile operators are expensive but provide high speed while some are cheap but have poor services and some others are so-so in terms of speed and customer satisfaction. Even though having such a large network USA faces problems with connectivity and stability. We have come up with the list of best mobile SIM providers in the USA.

The following rankings are based on research polls reviews and surveys. Here is the list of best GSM and CDMA mobile SIM network in the USA:

1. Verizon Wireless

Verizon Wireless is the biggest and most widespread cell phone carrier in America. Verizon Wireless offers some of the fastest 4G mobile internet with speeds reaching up to 11 Mbps download and 3.5 Mbps upload. In peak hours it is even possible to see Full HD videos without any buffering. It offers nationwide coast-to-coast coverage with consistency. According to independent testing and analytic agency RootMetrics Verizon offers the best connectivity strongest reliability and highest average speeds across both urban and rural areas. But its contract service high price ($60-$750) and non-refundable clause may set you back if you have a tighter budget.

Verizon Wireless is the best of the best and their services may be worth paying that little bit extra.

2. T – Mobile

T-Mobiles SIM network used to be weakest of the top four nationwide mobile carriers but with time this underdog carrier has shown its potential. T-Mobile built on GSM provides great value for money. Every T-Mobile prepaid plan comes with unlimited talk text and data with a very high speed. But company’s rural coverage is substandard. If you live in a metropolitan area you’re probably safe but stepping out too far into the suburbs will cause connectivity problems.

With excellent monthly plans aggressive & appealing prices wide device selection offers and superb speed T-Mobile should be your first choice especially if you live in cities.

3. AT&T

AT&T’s network is one of the biggest carriers in the country. AT&T provides good speeds has solid coverage and provides excellent device selection options including tablets hotspots Data cards and all of the latest mobile phones at subsidised prices. Its LTE services in over 650 markets provide fast data rates averaging over 7 Mbps. But on other hands it has the distinction of being the most expensive.

If you are looking for something with high speed and stability with good rural coverage then AT&T is for you. But its high pricing could be a critical factor.

4. Sprint

Sprint operates one of the largest mobile networks in the country and offers features such as unlimited 4G unlike others who restrict the usage. The best thing Sprint has going for it is its pricing which is quite reasonable offering the best bang for your buck. Sprint’s weakest attribute is its network even though it covers more of the United States than T-Mobile (but less as compared to Verizon or AT&T). You may have to deal with dropped calls low signals or other connectivity issues. It provides an average speed of 4.4 Mbps which is much lower as compared to others.

It’s offering of cheap prices and unlimited data are definitely non-arguable but its poor speed and connectivity may point at issues.

5. U.S. Cellular

U.S. Cellular SIM network is one of the oldest in the United States yet the network only covers a fraction of Americans. While you can get 3G coverage across the country thanks to partnerships with other carriers U.S. Cellular’s 4G LTE towers only cover Iowa Nebraska North Carolina and select counties. One of the selling points for U.S. Cellular touts is its reward points program. Noteworthily it is just as expensive as AT&T and Verizon with the infamous contract plan.

U.S. Cellular is only worth if you never need to travel beyond its coverage region. It is a solid alternative to some of the bigger names in the region.

6. Cricket Wireless

Cricket Wireless network acquired by AT&T runs on pair with AT&T’s solid network with fast 4G. Cricket competes with other low-cost prepaid networks. Cricket’s plan includes unlimited talk text and high and unlimited internet data speed. It offers superfast upload speed ranging from 4 to 6 Mbps. Its download speed could be up to 8 Mbps max while basic could be low. The customer care service are not responsive when it comes to switching the devices. Coming to the price they are a bit on the higher side compared to what it offers.

With no disturbance of contract & good unlimited speed and AT&T support it is a good pick for many.

7. MetoPCS

MetroPCS is a prepaid provider offering a plan with unlimited 4G data. It runs on T-Mobile which offers some fastest data speed in the country. MetroPCS offers some competitive data plans starting at around 35$ with unlimited call text and limited data. And for $60 it offers unlimited high-speed data. As it runs on T-Mobile you could expect some very high speed on LTE and good coverage But it has very limited mobile device selection options which mostly include Android phones.

If you are picking a smartphone which is available under their device options then getting MetroPCS SIM is really worth it as it offers exceptional speed at very low and affordable price bracket.

8. Ting

Ting SIM network is an MVNO or mobile virtual network operator. The coverage of ting is substandard which runs on sprints CDMA network. It also doesn’t offer unlimited talk and text. Ting is not suitable for heavy users and it also doesn’t have many latest smartphones to the list. Ting has excellent customer service team.

Ting network is very good for those who have minimum phone usage as you have to pay only for how much you use. It is not suitable for heavy data users. As it runs on sprint CDMA network make sure you have coverage in your area.

9. Consumer cellular

Consumer cellular does not provide unlimited call and text but the limited one is cheap and inexpensive. Consumer Cellular has a lot of attractive plans that are more flexible than some others. The company offers two separate plans in the form of call and data ranging from different price bars. Thanks to AT&T network the consumer cellular provides some good coverage and net speed. Heavy users may not get much much this SIM provider. The customer support is terrible and misleading.

AT&T provides solid coverage but it has its limitations. Consumer cellular is best suited for AARP members and retired family.

10. Boost Mobile

Boost is a prepaid SIM provider and has some of the most affordable price plans under its roof. Boost mobile runs on Sprint’s network so if you have a phone that works on it then you can try Boost’s cheap prepaid plan starting at around 30$. It doesn’t offer many device selection options other than Android and IOS. You may find some issues with call drop or internet connectivity. Customer support is poor.

With the trust of Sprint networks speed & coverage and affordable prepaid plans boost mobile is a good choice for whose having a particular habit of use.

The eight action point are: refresh policies expand connectivity upgrade logistics enable e-payments manage data grow the tech industry coach small business and join forces.

The agenda recognises the importance of the larger ecosystem of digital technology and supporting elements.

Experts who attended the World Economic Forum on Africa said e-commerce has the potential to create as many as 3 million new jobs in Africa by 2025 according to some researchers yet e-commerce start-ups face many obstacles including low consumer digital trust poor infrastructure and low regional integration.

“The scale of the challenges should not hold back effort given that e-commerce could bring jobs for youth new markets for rural communities and empower female entrepreneurship among other benefits” said Dr Elsie Kanza head of the regional agenda Africa and a member of the Executive Committee of World Economic Forum.

Dr Kanza added: “Action by Africa’s leaders and international partners on an agreed set of priorities can ensure e-commerce is a force for sustainable development. With e-commerce policy debate ramping up in the region and new partnerships for capacity-building on the rise now is a critical time to consolidate focus.”

Mr Albert M. Muchanga African Union Commissioner for Trade and Industry said: “E-commerce is the future and Africa will fully leverage it to secure hers.”

Each action item identifies challenges and sets goals to help policymakers navigate the multi-dimension e-commerce landscape. It offers ways to address the challenges – including through public-private collaboration – and calls on the international development community to step up.

It suggests how African economies may best use domestic regional and international policy given the borderless potential of e-commerce.

“The future of trade is digital and a large component of this is e-commerce which has the potential to transform how businesses in Africa produce sell and consume goods and services” ITC Executive Director Mr Arancha González said.

“This eight-point plan sets out the e-commerce ecosystem in which governments and the business community need to invest to harness the power of the digital marketplace” Ms González said.

“Africa’s e-commerce agenda is a thoughtful concrete and actionable work plan to promote inclusive digital trade that benefits individuals with small businesses set to gain most” said Ambassador Demetrios Marantis senior vice president Global Head of Government Engagement Primary Organisation at Visa Inc.

He added: “Visa is proud to be implementing this agenda along with private and public sector partners to realise the promise of e-commerce across the continent.”

Digital strategy

The African Union Commission together with the Economic Commission for Africa and other relevant stakeholders have been tasked by governments in the region to develop a digital trade and digital economy development strategy by February 2020.

Officials said the World Economic Forum and the International Trade Centre stands ready to work with partners to advance progress.

The agenda is the result of consultations at two regional public-private dialogues.",,,,,,,,,

Here is the list and some observations on 2021 in addition to what work will be taking place this week.

“2020 has been a milestone year overall with advertisement and award of the two largest project contracts: Fall River Secondary which will build that branch of the service and the New Bedford Main Line/Middleborough Secondary and Signals contract which will construct these two segments and procure equipment; and install fiber optic cable signals for the entire right-of-way and Positive Train Control (PTC) which is a system that helps improve train safety. Construction has begun on both contracts.”

Early Action work was completed to prepare for construction and operation of the system. Early Action included demolitions mainly on future station sites; culvert repairs and construction; grade crossing improvements; and railroad bridge reconstruction.

“Our contractors are following Massachusetts COVID-19 guidelines and procedures for all construction sites and workers at all public works sites. While the MBTA wants to keep the project on schedule the health of our staff and the contractors’ staff is a priority.”

“Our team met with hundreds of residents business owners state and municipal officials and interested supporters. From March on the meetings were virtual and while we miss our in-person conversations we continued to listen and learn. The numbers are below but more importantly we thank everyone who took the time to meet with us.”

Activity is expected to increase on the project.

“Moving into 2021 you will see more activity as the pace of construction continues to ramp up along the Middleborough Secondary and New Bedford Main Line. Ongoing work along the Fall River Line includes the construction of earth retaining walls and offloading of a “rail train” which involves threading lengths of new continuously welded steel rail along the right-of-way (ROW). A long bright red vehicle moves along the tracks and threads or places new steel lengths next to the old ones in preparation for replacement of the existing rails. Work is also underway to prepare future station overnight layover sites by clearing trees and brush and bringing the sites to future grades. Deliveries of new railroad ties track switches and Other Track Materials (OTM) will continue into 2021 for use as the work progresses. Finally utility improvements and relocations will also continue along the SCR Phase 1 ROW. After more than 30 years of planning SCR is on the move.”

But Helen Larkin admits she has ‘no goodwill’ to Liz Earle Beauty Co after still failing to receive an apology after winning her maternity discrimination and unfair dismissal claim at Southampton Tribunal Court in January.

The Southsea mum-of-two was put through a ‘nightmare 18 months’ by the Isle of Wight firm which made her redundant just a month before she was due to give birth in June 2019.

But despite representing herself during the emotional tribunal Helen won – leaving the company having to fork out £17000.

Helen Larkin and her children

The 39-year-old who lost her digital channel marketing role waived the opportunity to accept nearly twice what she was awarded by the tribunal after Liz Earle Beauty made a last-ditch offer to pay her off.

But Helen refused to be silenced – and is now helping other women who are suffering similar experiences by working as a volunteer mentor for charity Pregnant Then Screwed as well as having spoken at a conference to pregnant mums.

‘I spoke to a mentor from the charity before my tribunal which helped me and now I do the same to help others’ she said. ‘I’m making something positive from something bad.

‘It’s good to be able to help people – that was a big thing for me in not accepting their offer. If I’d accepted it then I wouldn’t have been allowed to speak about my case.

‘(Maternity discrimination) happens to so many people and is now happening four-fold since Covid happened.

‘Most women take an offer and accept a non-disclosure order where you are not allowed to talk about the case. I probably would have done the same if they had made me the offer before the tribunal but by that point it was too late.

‘It is unusual for people to speak out. But other women have found it inspiring and heartening when they are going through similar situations and are worried about pursuing firms.

‘They feel they have the support to do it on their own and stand up for themselves. It is still very rare to represent yourself and win.’

Reflecting on her feelings towards Liz Earle Beauty owned by American pharmaceutical giant Walgreens Boots Alliance which owns Boots Helen said: ‘I’m glad I won and have been able to speak out and help others. I’ve not bought any of their products since!

‘I have no goodwill towards them. They never apologised. They said they had done nothing wrong even after the tribunal – but they were found guilty.

‘I’ve heard of other women in the company say maternity rights have improved since and that’s because of the tribunal so that’s good if true.

A sheriff’s deputy and two civilians are being treated for serious injuries at a hospital after a suspected shoplifter opened fire at a Walmart in Sterling Virginia northwest of Washington D.C. authorities said Saturday.

The incident began when two loss prevention officers at Walmart allegedly observed a man stealing items from the store and attempted to escort him into an office according to a statement from the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office.

Two deputies responded to try to take the man into custody the statement said. During a struggle the suspect pulled a gun from his waistband and allegedly started shooting hitting both loss prevention officers and one of the two deputies according to the sheriff’s office.

Loudoun County Sheriff Michael Chapman spoke to reporters about Saturday's shooting at a Walmart in Sterling Virginia. WJLA

The second deputy returned fire hitting the suspect authorities said.

“I don’t know what the injuries were certainly not severe enough to keep him from running and jumping into a truck and driving away” Loudoun County Sheriff Michael Chapman said.

The truck was parked behind the store with the keys in it according to the sheriff’s office.

A vehicle chase ensued and the Fairfax County Police Department following a lookout alert for a stolen vehicle apprehended the suspect the sheriff’s office said.

The lawsuit was filed in November in Taney County and transferred to federal court on Dec. 29. The defendants are Walmart and Kent International the company that manufactured the tricycle.

According to the lawsuit a woman purchased the tricycle for $149 in December 2015 from the Walmart on Branson Hills Parkway.

The tricycle came partially assembled and the woman had a Walmart employee finish the assembly since Walmart offered ""free in-store bike assembly"" according to the lawsuit.

Four months later — on April 4 2016 — the woman finally got a nice warm day to try out the tricycle.

The lawsuit says the woman walked the tricycle to the bottom of her driveway on Cliff Drive in Branson and hopped on.

According the the lawsuit the woman got going down the hill and her brakes were not stopping the tricycle as she approached an intersection so she had to turn abruptly and crashed. The woman went over the handlebars and crashed face-first into the curb and pavement.

The lawsuit says the woman suffered cuts and bruises as well as a fractured tooth broken nose and traumatic brain injury.

Years later the lawsuit says the brain injury still causes severe headaches and has made it difficult for the woman to learn new things concentrate see clearly create new memories and even speak.

According to the lawsuit the woman incurred more than $40000 in medical bills and has seen her income drop in each of the past three years.

The lawsuit says engineers later examined the tricycle and determined the brakes were not up to government standards. The lawsuit says the Walmart employees were not properly trained on how to assemble bikes and they were under too much pressure to assemble bikes quickly.

Dominguez died on Friday according to the D23 newsletter. No further details were released about his death and no cause of death was given.

Dominguez's family originally owned and lived on the orange grove-covered property that was purchased by Walt Disney for his theme park in 1954.

“Our house was located right about where the entrance to Pirates of the Caribbean and Cafe Orleans are today” he once recalled according to D23. “The day we moved out in August of 1954 we were walking in ditches and holes. Things were popping up around us because construction had to move ahead. They built Disneyland in a year.”

A young Dominguez took a summer job as a ticket taker at the new theme park and later rose through the ranks to hold several managerial positions at Disneyland. In 1970 he was appointed director of operations.

Four years later he was named vice president of Disneyland and chairman of the park operating committee and in 1990 he was named executive vice president Walt Disney Attractions West Coast.

Park officials consider the opening an extension of Downtown Disney. Vikki Vargas reported on NBC4 News on Wednesday Nov. 18 2020.

“We are saddened to have lost a very dear member of our family Ron Dominguez” said Josh D'Amaro chairman of Disney Parks Experiences and Products. “Ron's contributions to Disneyland are nearly incalculable. He was well-known among the cast and community throughout his tenure at the park and continued to show his support long after his retirement guiding and mentoring leaders including me for decades. I am personally grateful for all that he has done for Disney and want to express my deepest condolences to his family on behalf of every Disney Parks cast member around the world.”

Park Hopping is back at Walt Disney World as the resort also is introducing a new ticket discount offer for Florida residents.

Disney had prohibited guests from visiting more than one theme park per day once the parks reopened last July. Guests needed to reserve the dates they wished to visit specific parks using the new Disney Park Pass online reservation tool. Once they picked a park and a day they could not move over to another park later on that day. But starting yesterday annual passholders and other Disney World visitors with Park Hopper tickets could visit additional parks — just not until after 2pm.

That's new rule for Park Hopping at Walt Disney World during the pandemic. You must continue to reserve an initial park visit using Disney Park Pass but after 2pm you are free to visit another Disney World theme park without having to make a reservation. Blockout dates continue to apply for some annual passholders and cast members however.

Park-to-park bus transportation will be available in the afternoons Disney has said that however cast members will verify that you have a Park Hopper ticket or privileges before you will be allowed to board. And once a theme park reaches its capacity no additional Park Hopper admissions into it will be allowed.

As for the new offer Walt Disney World is offering two- three- and four-day Florida Resident Discover Disney tickets for $149 to $199 per ticket starting Monday. Note that these are not Park Hoppers but one-park-per-day tickets. The ticket does not have to be used on consecutive days but the two-day tickets expire March 11 while the three- and four-day tickets expire June 18. Blockout dates apply: January 16 - January 18 February 13 - February 15 March 26 - April 11 and May 28 - 31.

If you choose the four-day ticket that works out to $50 a day — which is pretty much the cheapest Disney World day ticket available right now. The deal ia available starting Monday on the Disney World website.

With the pandemic continuing to limit travel options the Orlando-area theme parks will continue to look for Florida residents to drive traffic for the next several months led by deals such as this one.

You don’t even need to watch the next 30 seconds to confirm it — it’s just a horror movie trope that happens again and again and now is a normalized aspect of a horror movie.

Well when you turn on Disney+ and pick a Disney film to watch you can often assume that the main character’s mom is either suffering dying or dead — and I want to find out why.

From the Walt Disney Company’s inception mothers in Disney films have almost always been dead. From Walt Disney’s first feature film in 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Walt Disney Studios have created mother characters who live the anti-fairy tale. What’s interesting about this trend is that even after Walt’s passing Disney films continue to create mother-less (or parent-less) characters. Also Pixar Animation Studios (acquired by Disney after it was founded) also falls into the dead mom trope fitting in perfectly with its parent company Disney Studios.

That being said this reporter wants to know why from 1937 to 2020 does Disney continuously put out films in which characters’ mothers die or are already dead in so many Disney movies.

One major theory fans have is quite sad and is one that would resonate with Walt Disney deeply. After the major box office success of the Disney princess movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs — which thanks to Guinness World Records we know “took $184925486 (then £37404022) at the US box office equivalent to $1.2 billion (£890 million) as of 2018” — Walt wanted to buy his parents Flora and Elias Disney a home near the Disney Studio in Burbank California. After Flora complained about the gas furnace Disney had repairmen sent to the home but unfortunately the problem was not resolved. Flora ended up dying of asphyxiation in the home Walt bought for her — which became a tragedy Walt would have to carry with him for the rest of his life.

Many Disney fans theorized that this is why Disney characters always lose their moms — because they themselves are a reflection of Walt and his pain. That being said there are a few rebuttals to this theory. Flora passed away on November 6 1938 a year after Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs premiered. It is established that Snow White herself loses her mother prior to the film’s beginning which means the thought of a motherless child was something that Disney was already focusing on prior to Flora’s passing. At this time the Disney Studios were also working on Bambi and Pinocchio another two films that showcase dead mothers prior to Walt having experienced the feeling for himself. And as we mentioned Flora’s passing due to asphyxiation means the death was sudden and Disney had no reason to have any personal connection to motherless characters prior to her passing.

That being said I have a rebuttal for my rebuttal. Many early Disney animated films were derived from fairytales as the source material. If we look at Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Snow White didn’t have a mother in the original story. Gepetto also never had a woman in his life according to the original story and in 1923 when the fairy tale of Bambi was written entitled Bambi in the Woods Bambi has to watch the death of his mother in order to gain the motivation to survive on his own. If there is one thing here that is for sure the original fairy tales are the ones here that pre-determined the death or non-existence for these Disney moms. Source material like fairy tales led to animated features for Disney that were highly successful so it is no surprise that the Disney Studios could have taken on the mantra “If it ain’t broke don’t fix it” carrying on with motherless characters already established in fairy tales.

We should dissect the fact that although the source material may be at times the cause of motherless characters and many Disney films up until now including original storylines such as Lilo & Stitch continue to have characters with mothers who have passed away. But first we need to find out why mothers were dying in the first place.

Jack Zipes author of Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales Children and the Culture Industry mentioned “Historically speaking people did not live very long from the medieval period through the early 20th century. Women died frequently from childbirth. Therefore there were many single parents although men tended to marry quickly after their wives died as in Snow White and Cinderella.”

Women during this time were often seen as expendable with their main purpose being to reproduce. Therefore for the purpose of a story the mother may have been cut out after she served her purpose. So it seems that what fairy tale novelists would do was create fiction but still allow that fiction to be rooted in real life perhaps making it more relatable. This in theory could be a brilliant idea considering giving the story a realistic base allows the readers to connect with the story while also encouraging believability by allowing the reader to develop sympathy.

This isn’t to say that Walt’s experience of “causing” (in his opinion) his mother’s death wouldn’t later transcribe into his films but it’s not where the trope would have originated. So why do modern Disney films still create these motherless characters from Beauty and the Beast to Tarzan to Frozen and the list can truly continue to go on and on Disney characters often lose their moms.

Aside from the fact that Disney is still using classic fairy tales as original source material another possible explanation for it could stem from the reason Bambi had which is the fact that the loss of a mother causes you to grow up and accept responsibility — something nearly every Disney character must often do. As a stereotype mothers are often seen as nurturing and protective. If you have a mom she will always make sure you are okay. Would Elsa have ever become Queen of Arendelle without having no other choice? Would Anna have risked her life to save her sister if her mother was there? Likely not because the person with the highest authority and maternal power would have probably taken over the situation as the leader — plus we know from Frozen 2 that Anna and Elsa’s parents would risk their lives for their children so Anna would never have had the chance to save Elsa as that would have put her in danger. This theory is not without its holes as well but in many cases proves true. The story of Frozen would have been very different if Anna and Elsa had not lost their parents.

Even when the mother doesn’t die but is simply removed or transformed in the story — such as in Brave when Merida’s mother turns into a bear — the character needs to step up and take charge of the situation. Therefore it seems that in order to propel the story forward the loss or suffering of a parent is almost essential.

Disney films like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast also showcase Disney characters who lost their moms. In The Little Mermaid Ariel loses her mother and after a falling out with her father is left to her own devices and that propels the plot forward. If in The Little Mermaid Ariel has a mother she may not have rebelled so much as there would have been 2 parental figures in her life.

The Disney films may also serve as a way to educate kids on the idea of death. Many children begin to watch Disney films at a young age and instead of learning about death in a scary way understanding it through a fairy tale and seeing that things can still turn out alright is a crucial message to help kids understand the circle of life.

In the end there is a clear pattern and formula here that not only Disney and other studios continue to abide by (take Harry Potter for example). That being said the constant use of a dead parent trope at Walt Disney Studios could be due to its success as a formula or it could be a continuation of Walt’s pain — and in turn the pain many people feel when they lose a mother — or even just a good way to propel the plot. The answer here is not clear but if there is one thing that is almost certain it’s that we are definitely not finished with dead moms in Disney movies.

The resort was also in full-speed development for EPCOT Center with the park slated to open on Disney World’s 11th birthday. But with a milestone to celebrate Disney is not a company to sit and let a year go by.

The Magic Kingdom

Always ready for self promotion the EPCOT Center Preview opened on Main Street temporarily replacing the Walt Disney Story area on June 1. The main part of the Preview Center was the 15 Minute “The Dream Called Epcot” video as well as a model of the park. Also on Main Street the Wonderland of Wax became the Holiday Corner. The Fantasyland Art Festival which had already moved from across from the Skyway to near the Mad Tea Party in 1973 now closed completely. A new stage show “Disney World is Your World” premiered at the castle stage. Also worth noting that the guide maps began to feature a new stylized but detailed map of each land. A map with this level of detail had been missing since 1976. These guides were the 8 by 5½ inch versions that had been used since 1977. Prior to that the guides were 8 by 3¾ inches.

Disney published The Dream Called Epcot to YouTube for the park’s 35 Aniversary.

The main part of the Tencennial celebration was the Tencennial Parade. Debuting on the resort’s October 1 birthday the parade would run for a full year. The parade units were designed to reflect the lands of the Magic Kingdom. While the debut kicked off with a 1000-person band the parade generally began with Mickey and Minnie atop a float prominently featuring the stylized number “10” and dragging a float of mounted troubadours. This was followed by the horse drawn trolley and flower carts. Next was a band in a gazebo and bicyclists dressed like the Dapper Dans. This section was the Main Street Unit. Next came the Adventureland floats featuring a large horse-drawn float and a float featuring steel drums. Donald riding a large drum flanked by a fife and drum corps represented Liberty Square. A horse-drawn hay cart mounted by cowfolk and the Country Bears and a mockup of the Diamond Horseshoe stage as a float represented Frontierland. A blue silver and mirrored float with dancing robots signified Tomorrowland. Cinderella’s Coach and Casey Junior pulling a car of presents constituted the Fantasyland unit. The parade ended with a horse-drawn stagecoach and a train of flat castle facades with dancers.

The Resort

In June 1981 the Contemporary saw a major entertainment change at the Top of the World. After nearly a decade of rotating guest acts the supper club was replaced with a Disney-owned show Broadway at the Top. The company had previously announced plans for new hotels but now the Grand Floridian Mediterranean and Cypress Point Lodge resorts were all named and being planned. Along with the under-construction Buena Vista Palace three more third-party resorts were also being added to the Lake Buena Vista area. Negotiations were underway with leases to Marriott Hilton and Lowes.

While many if not all of these locations existed prior to this year 1981 is the first year I have been able to find a directory to the Walt Disney World Village. So here is a long overdue rundown of the shops restaurants and entertainment offerings at the Village in 1981.

Shops: Windjammer Dock Shop; 24KT Precious Adornments; Village Gifts and Sundries; Village Spirits Shoe Time; Plus You; Miss Merrily’s Fashions; Sassy’s; Country Address; It’s A Small World After All; Toys Fantastique; Candy Shoppe; Pooh’s Place; Gourmet Pantry; Captain’s Tower; Sir Edward’s Haberdasher; Sachet In; Bath Parlor; Port of Entry; Great Southern Craft Co.; Toledo Arts; Cristal Arts; 2R’s – Read’n & Rite’n; Chalet Candle Shop; China Crystal & Silver; Pottery Chalet; Christmas Chalet and Village Square.

The area also featured the Village stage the Village Marina for watercraft rentals and a cruise dock.

EPCOT Center

EPCOT Center construction was moving ahead at full speed. In Future World all of the opening day attraction pavilions were in the vertical construction phase. Spaceship Earth Universe of Energy World Of Motion Journey into Imagination and the Land had the majority if not entire show buildings complete as well as their final names. Horizons and the Living Seas had the ground clearing done and CommuniCore was somewhere in between. The monorail loop was also complete.

In World Showcase there was slower progress. The lagoon had been dug but some pavilions do not appear to have gone vertical at all. From the aerial view it looks like the show buildings for American Adventure France and Canada were complete but not the facades. Most of the other pavilions appear to be in different stages of construction with Mexico and China appearing to be the furthest behind.

Offsite effects sets and animatronics were in progress. Filming was underway across China Canada and France. The China film crew was the first western unit to shoot in the country in over thirty years. Some of the show elements including statue work and animatronics began to arrive on site for installation as well.

Much of what 1981 Walt Disney World would be known for was temporary. The Tencennial elements would end with the opening of EPCOT Center. It’s doubtful many people would have considered Walt Disney World to be in its infancy in 1981 but in hindsight it was the last time it would truly be a simple vacation destination. In 1982 everything would change.

PHOENIX — ""The Greatest Show on Grass"" is going to look a lot different this year. Of course the coronavirus is to blame.

""From the standpoint of a normal Saturday during an open week is 200000 people plus. Having 8000 people max on this golf course it’s going to look different"" said Scott Jenkins the tournament's chair.

Gone will be the 4 a.m. lines to snag a spot at the raucous par-three sixteen. Instead fans will find a much more tamed version.

""Normally it’s a three-story structure quite a scene as far as the coliseum but this year is going to be one story with a lower deck called the loge"" Jenkins said.

Gone too will be the droves of fans that head to The Birds Nest to catch music’s stars.

""No one loves The Birds Nest more than I do. But it wasn’t in the cards this year. And again we’re doing this for charity"" Jenkins said.

That’s the good news. Thunderbirds the tournament’s host will still be able to write a check to local charities. Plus some on-course fans who will be required to wear masks and countless viewers will still get to see great golf.

But there seems to be a trend of decoupling between waste production and prosperity beyond a certain income level. High income countries (with average individual incomes above roughly $80000 annually) are trending towards lower volumes of waste production and disposal. Countries such as South Korea for example have introduced financial incentives to reduce waste and recycle more. In 2021 we will have to maintain this trend – and extend it to lower-income countries.

But during the Covid-19 crisis single-use plastics have proliferated. They’re used in packaging to improve safety by food delivery services and in medical equipment. We have also seen a reduction in good waste-management practices. From Miami in the US to the Bantar Gebang landfill in Indonesia recycling has halted to limit workers’ contact with waste – or because of a reduced workforce. Many cities have paused plastic-bag bans or charges. And informal waste picking everywhere has declined as pickers try to avoid Covid-19 exposure during waste collection.

In 2021 the resurgence of single-use plastics will continue with high consumer demand for protective gear and heavily packaged products and food and increased use of plastics in hospitals and public facilities. These plastics have limited recycling capability and will lead to higher contamination of rivers and oceans.

The need to simultaneously address global waste and the pandemic offers an opportunity to decouple growth from waste by putting in place sustainable waste-management systems and moving towards a more circular approach to its reduction. Promising private-sector initiatives are underway through pooled funding and blended financing experimentation across the waste-management value chain and digitisation. Circulate Capital is one of a number of funds investing in sustainable waste-management systems in various countries to improve recycling and support a circular approach.

London-based startup ReCircle is developing ways to reclaim raw materials from waste to go back into manufacturing. In 2021 by considering local organics-management options encouraging use of recyclable materials and increasing the number of schemes across the world that focus on waste prevention governments will help keep cities healthy and safe while also saving money and reducing landfill.

SALT LAKE CITY — With the COVID-19 pandemic driving so many people to the great outdoors in Utah the great outdoors is becoming not so great in some instances.

At Zion National Park’s Narrows a ranger cleared out 14 pounds of debris — of which 9 pounds was human waste.

The ranger said he’d never seen the graffiti so egregious in an area covering just under a mile that was marred with more than 1000 handprints or etchings on the rock walls.

“While it hurts to see such a beautiful and unique place treated like this I feel honored I have the responsibility to protect it” the employee’s report said.

Part of the problem was lack of ranger patrols for the canyon’s Virgin River and people failing to heed signs to avoid the water due to high levels of toxins or cyanobacteria that can sicken people and domestic animals. The visiting public did not heed the signs to stay out and instead decided to leave their own print on the landscape protected under federal law.

The Narrows’ condition was dismaying to leaders of The Zion Forever Project the park’s philanthropic partner.

“This year has challenged all of us and places like Zion are essential to uplifting us in these difficult times. The Zion Forever Project as the park’s official nonprofit partner works side by side with the National Park Service to conserve these lands” said Lyman Hafen the project’s executive director.

“When the land is mistreated or marred with graffiti while devastating we are only strengthened in our resolve to educate the public about responsible land use and to ensure the Zion experience remains intact for future generations.”

National park officials state park managers the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management all have been overwhelmed this year with dramatic increases in visitation while at the same time tasked with caring for the land with flat budgets or even a bottom line that has seen sharp reductions.

Cedar Breaks National Monument as an example saw a 35% increase in visitors from 2019 to 2020 and visitation at Zion National Park has more than doubled in the last decade.

While some land managers or volunteer conservation organizations offer wag bags for people — a zip-lock bag to contain feces for proper disposal later — visitors often ignore them or supplies quickly run out.

Even bathrooms at the base of popular hiking trails in the Wasatch Canyons for example can become quickly overwhelmed with land managers struggling to keep toilet paper supplies on hand.

Like their counterparts at the National Park Service the Bureau of Land Management is seeing similar resource degradation this year due to high visitor counts.

“We do not have any statistics to verify our observations but we have noted that some of the resource issues associated with high visitation such as improperly disposed human waste and litter have been more widespread than normal this year on public lands” said BLM Utah spokeswoman Kimberly Finch.

This fall the agency launched a new social media campaign to help drive awareness of taking better care of public lands.

The campaign uses the hashtag #leaveitbetterUtah to address some of what BLM employees are seeing on the ground.

Multiple social media postings detail dumpsters surrounded by litter on the ground abandoned campsites full of discarded belongings or campfire rings filled to the brim with debris all of which can cost thousands to clean up.

Earlier this year the BLM discovered an abandoned camper vehicle with household trash on public lands in southern Utah.

The federal agency tracked down the owner who was charged with hazardous materials dumping and other related offenses.

The bill for removing the abandoned camper came to approximately $13000 and the suspect was fined and banned from public lands for a year due to being a repeat offender.

The issue of human waste is also a problem for the BLM which discovered an illegal sewage dump on the lands it manages.

Improperly disposed of human waste is a health hazard can contaminate water spread disease and is just plain unsightly for the next visitor to come along.

Finch said fines start at $250 for illegal sewage disposal on BLM lands.

The MUA approved a new fee of $1.92 per 100 cubic feet of water to fund the city’s $15.1 million garbage and recycling contract with Elizabeth-based Regional Industries. Although the fee will cover solid waste pickup it will be assessed based on residents’ water usage.

It’s unclear if the current five-year contract has already been assigned to the MUA or when residents would begin paying the fee. According to a resolution from the MUA’s Board of Commissioners meeting in September the solid waste fee would go into effect Jan. 1 2021 “should the City decide to assign to JCMUA its contract with Regional Industries Inc.”

But a JCMUA study released the same month says that the MUA “is initiating a solid waste collection service municipal utility” that “has accepted assignment effective January 1 2021 of the solid waste collection contract.”

Jersey City spokeswoman Kimberly Wallace-Scalcione did not respond to multiple questions asking if the MUA had taken over the contract from the city but said in an email that the MUA would “carry the solid waste expenses for the city.”

A transfer of the Regional Industries contract had been in the works since before the COVID-19 pandemic. At the MUA’s February meeting Executive Director Jose Cunha noted that “coordination of JCMUA’s takeover of solid waste contracts currently held by Jersey City is ongoing” according to the meeting minutes.

Cunha could not be reached for comment for this story. Board of Commissioners Chair Maureen Hulings referred questions to Wallace-Scalcione.

Garbage and recycling services are typically a line item in the municipal budget funded in part by property taxes.

The city spokeswoman added that the solid waste fee that was approved in September is expected to increase nearly 30% to $2.48 per 100 cubic feet. Although a timeline for the future rate hike was not provided Wallace-Scalcione said the average Jersey City household would pay 81 cents a day or $295.65 a year under the amended rate.

Wallace-Scalcione said the new fee structure creates “more fairness for our residents.”

“Previously buildings with tax abatements didn’t participate in the added annual costs for solid waste collection that regular non tax abated buildings pay every year but now this cost will be balanced more fairly with every building paying their fair share” she said.

The JCMUA has made a number of significant financial moves over the past months. In July citing the city’s “financial difficulty” the MUA voted to pay an $11 million advance franchise payment to the city.

In September the MUA also approved a 9% hike to residents’ water and sewer rates. A month later the agency approved a collective bargaining agreement that gave 85 union employees five-year $1.25-an-hour salary increases.

The rate hikes were the product of the MUA’s annual rate assessment Wallace-Scalcione said which is done “to meet higher operational costs due to inflation and debt service based on the upgrades we are doing citywide to improve functionality and eliminate flooding.”

The salary increases are “in line with inflation” and the $11 million payment was made “to help offset historic deficits incurred so that we wouldn’t have a major tax increase on residents” she said.

But those moves have drawn criticism. In November Jersey City Councilman-at-large Rolando Lavarro a frequent critic of the Fulop administration called for an investigation of what he called “dubious financial decisions” at the utility provider. In a texted statement Thursday Lavarro called the new solid waste fee “a back door tax” imposed with “diversion and sleight of hand.”

“This is all just a shell game” Lavarro said. “It’s the ‘short con’ being played on Jersey City’s hard working families struggling in the most difficult economic time in our nation’s history.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZ29sZndlZWsudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMDMvcGdhLXRvdXItcGhvZW5peC1vcGVuLWNvdmlkLWVhbW9uLWx5bmNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PGA Tour should say no to fans at the Phoenix Open,"It’s safe to assume that William Shakespeare didn’t have the Waste Management Phoenix Open in mind when he wrote the words “Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast” but tournament organizers could do worse than heed the old tragedian’s warning.

Since the PGA Tour returned from a three-month lockdown in June galleries have been as little evidenced as Ted Cruz’s spine. The Vivint Houston Open admitted 2000 spectators in November before the current post-holiday surge in COVID cases. This week’s Sentry Tournament of Champions won’t have many more spectators than competitors while Hawaii’s other event the Sony Open will have none. And this in a state that has recorded just 287 coronavirus deaths. The first two stops on the mainland will also be fan-free: the American Express and the Farmers Insurance Open in California.

Which brings us to the 86th edition of the drunkest spectacle on grass which will be staged February 4-7 at TPC Scottsdale. The WMPO was not among the many events adversely impacted last year. This year the Thunderbirds organization that runs the tournament said it intends to welcome spectators reportedly about 8000 of them in a best-case scenario.

To be fair that’s smaller than a Saturday bathroom queue at a typical Phoenix Open. The WMPO stopped disclosing attendance figures a few years ago but it easily draws the stoutest crowds on Tour. In 2018 it had more than 700000 spectators some of whom even watched the golf. The enormous charitable impact is rightfully the envy of every other tournament on the schedule: more than $14 million in ‘20 and $160 million in total over the years. Like most things in life and commerce 2021 will usher in a gaunt version of what we’re accustomed to. The normally expansive corporate build-out at TPC Scottsdale will be greatly reduced in addition to those minimal spectator numbers.

But minimal might still be too much.

“We have been working closely with the PGA Tour and local health officials and are confident that we can safely host a limited number of fans for ‘The People’s Open’ in 2021” said tournament chairman Scott Jenkins. “We don’t have an exact attendance figure at this time but we will be conservative in all of our decision-making to ensure the health and safety of all involved with the event and our community.”

Jenkins added that he was confident of staging “a safe and responsible” event. Except “safe and responsible” is an elastic term when it comes to the boozy bacchanalia in Scottsdale.

There are two reasons why the WMPO’s plan for fans ought to sound alarm bells in Ponte Vedra.

The PGA Tour has performed a creditable job in conducting tournaments since June thanks to stringent safety protocols and maintaining as best it can a sterile bubble on site. Seven months into a burdensome new reality there is finally faint light at the end of the tunnel as vaccines promise something resembling normalcy. This is not a time to gamble especially not with patrons who have a well-documented record of feckless conduct. Not all of them obviously but enough.

Even in the best of times the WMPO isn’t a model of responsible behavior among spectators many of whom make for the exits staggering like wobbly cowboys freshly dismounted from a day’s ride. So be it. Don’t like it? Stay home. Those who show up—spectators and players—know what to expect and have forfeited the right to complain. One doesn’t go to a brothel then bemoan the disregard for chastity. That febrile atmosphere is what makes the WMPO so successful and generates those charitable dollars.

But it’s also why the event should not welcome fans next month. Arizona is suffering like every other place. Only six states reported more COVID deaths in the last seven days according to the Centers for Disease Control. There were 43332 new cases in Arizona during that period and more than 9000 residents have died since the pandemic began. And that’s before the anticipated post-Christmas surge manifests itself. Inviting people to a sporting event in this worsening environment is unwise.

No matter how often we hear that TPC Scottsdale enables social distancing — 192 acres the organizers have been reminding us — the reality is that spectators will always congregate in more confined areas. Only fans who have passed out remain on the front nine while the leaders battle on the closing holes.

The desire for normalcy is understandable as is the eagerness of the WMPO to generate some revenue in this gloomy economy. But for now normal needs to end at simply staging a tournament limiting the viewing experience to screens and not spectators. The WMPO should take one for the Tour and accept the same sacrifice so many other events have had to make over these last 10 months. And if the organizers don’t want to make the right call then the PGA Tour should exercise its prerogative and make it for them."

Here's what this means,"A new study reveals that roughly one out of three large American rivers have appeared to change color since 1984 with many of the bodies of water seeming to slowly turn yellow and green — and scientists tell Salon that this could mean some very bad things for human health.

Analyzing approximately 15.9 million satellite images taken over a period of more than three decades researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill the University of Pittsburgh and Colorado State University discovered that of the more than 108000 kilometers (roughly 67000 miles) of rivers at least 60 meters (197 feet) wide studied throughout the country 56% appeared predominantly yellow and 38% appeared predominantly green. While rivers often change color based on the seasons and flow regimes the scientists found that one-third of rivers had experienced long-term ""significant color shifts"" between 1984 and 2018. (If you want to see what has happened with your local river there is a handy interactive map here.)

""One thing to remember is that rivers are not necessarily turning 'yellow' or turning 'green'"" Dr. John Gardner a co-author of the study (which was published earlier this month in the scientific journal Geophysical Research Letters) wrote to Salon. ""If you recall to visible light spectrum R-O-Y-G-B-I-V (red orange yellow green blue violet) a significant 'red-shifted' trend simply means that there is a trend towards the red yellow end of the spectrum which could mean a river is changing from green-blue to green. Similarly a 'blue-shifted' trend means a river is trending towards the blue/green end of the spectrum which could mean a river is changing from yellow-orange to yellow or green-yellow to green.""

As Gardner pointed out there are a number of things that can cause these seeming color shifts. When a river appears yellow the likely culprit is suspended sediment; when it appears to green the probable cause is algae; and if a river is blue... well as the cliché goes the chances are that means you're dealing with ""relatively clear waters.""

The end result is that ""if a river changed from green to yellow that would likely be caused by some combination of less algae and more suspended sediment. Potential drivers of such changes are numerous spanning changes to the river channel itself to how entire landscapes are managed."" Gardner observed that increased construction due to urbanization increasing river flows and agriculture can increase suspended sediment and make a river appear more yellow while a decrease in nutrients and light can reduce algae and make a river appear less green.

""A lot of the rivers that are rapidly turning yellow tend to be near the upstream ends of reservoirs"" Dr. Tamlin Pavelsky who also co-authored the paper and works with Gardner in the Global Hydrology Lab wrote to Salon. He cited as one example the upstream end of Lake Mead on the Colorado River which he said has changed color because of sediment being deposited into reservoirs ""building up a 'delta' and making the river extend further into the reservoir. When this happens we transform a relatively blue/green environment (a reservoir) into a relatively yellow environment (a river).""

He added ""What's causing some rivers to become greener is a little less clear. It could be that they are transporting less sediment; there's evidence that this is the case in U.S. rivers overall and we're working on a detailed analysis using satellite imagery. It could also be because they're experiencing increasing growth of algae or both.""

Both scientists cautioned against drawing definitive conclusions about whether these color changes present risks to human health noting that because of the numerous variables which can cause rivers to change color the question of whether a color change indicates danger depends on the specifics of why a specific river has altered its hue.

""Interpreting color changes in terms of human health threats can be tricky because color integrates so many different signals"" Pavelsky explained listing dissolved organic matter alongside algae and sediment as possible causes of rivers changing color. ""In general though some rivers that are becoming greener may be experiencing increased algal growth which can sometimes be harmful to humans."" He also said that rivers which are turning yellow ""may be experiencing increases in how much sediment they're transporting which can be an indication of more erosion of soil from upstream areas or other changes in the characteristics of the river caused by human activities"" such as those connected to dams and reservoirs.

Gardner echoed these observations telling Salon that ""I do not believe there are any immediate threats to human health (due to long-term changes in river color)."" Although nature already has put dissolved organic matter sediment and algae in most rivers ""too much or too little (depending on the river) can be harmful for ecosystem and human health."" He pointed to the Ohio River in 2015 as an example of a situation in which algal blooms ""can decrease oxygen concentrations which fish need to breathe and can also produce toxins."" By contrast ""many pollutants (such as mercury) move attached to suspended sediment but generally in the large rivers included in our study there is too little suspended sediment which is problematic for coastal wetlands which need river sediment to keep pace with sea level rise.""

He emphasized that ""we only measured color which is the combined effect that sediment algae and dissolved organic matter has on how water appears to the human eye. Therefore we cannot exactly say what is changing river color and if it is problematic for human (or ecosystem health).""

Salon also reached out to climate scientists who said that the new study's findings can in certain cases be linked to man-made global warming.

""There are a number of human impacts that are leading to these"" Dr. Michael E. Mann a distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University told Salon by email. ""Runoff pollution in the form of agricultural fertilization can lead to algal blooms (typically cyanobacteria) that turn the water yellow green or red. But climate change is also a factor. Warmer waters lead to anoxic conditions that favor algal blooms. So in short the changes that are reported here are a consequence of multiple environmental insults by human activities including climate change.""

Dr. Kevin Trenberth a Distinguished Senior Scientist in the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research made a similar point to Salon writing that ""no doubt the dominant source of the changes relates to more people in more places doing more things"" like changing how they use land building dams and changes that interfere with nutrient flows into rivers. He said that ""climate change effects are no doubt also in play but are likely somewhat lesser in amount"" citing as examples changes in rainfall patterns the rapidity at which snow melts and the increase in wildfires.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGFpd2FuZW5nbGlzaG5ld3MuY29tL2V2ZXJncmVlbi1tYXJpbmUtY29udGFpbmVyLXNoaXAtbG9zZXMtMzYtY29udGFpbmVycy1hdC1zZWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Evergreen Marine container ship loses 36 containers at sea,"Taiwan shipping company Evergreen Marine Corporation announced today that 36 containers had fallen off its vessel EVER LIBERAL after leaving the Port of Busan en route to Los Angeles on December 30.

According to Evergreen the 8452 TEU container ship encountered strong winds and rough seas 20 nautical miles south of Kyushu Japan causing the collapse of container stacks on the vessel. Twenty-one 40-foot containers fell onto the deck while 36 fell into the sea.

Evergreen said that no personnel were injured in the incident and none of the containers contained dangerous goods. The ship’s captain immediately notified Japan Coast Guard so that ships in adjacent waters could be notified about the drifting containers.

The EVER LIBERAL was diverted to the Port of Taipei to have the damaged cargo taken care of.

Evergreen also said that it is engaged in salvage operations to retrieve the drifting containers.

Just weeks after becoming the highest-ranking woman in franchise history Camillo had been invited to break more ground this time as the first female to join in the hockey team’s annual photo. Now gazing out at the Flyers assembled at center ice she wondered how she was going to get there on stiletto heels.

“I’d been told this would be the first time a woman had ever been in the picture” Camillo recalled recently. “Pretty cool right? So I walked down there trying to be as authentic as I could. I was telling myself ‘Don’t try to act like one of the guys. Just be yourself.’ Then I see I had to go out on this sheet of ice in boots with giant stilettos. I was like ‘Oh my god I’m going to die.’ ”

Fortunately an unlikely Sir Walter Raleigh then-Flyers president Paul Holmgren recognized Camillo’s distress.

“And this was a guy who if you know his history was one of the all-time leaders in penalty minutes” said Camillo. “The toughest of the tough. Old school. A Flyers’ institutional leader. And he literally and figuratively offered his arm to me. Later he introduced me around the building. And I think that helped me immensely. I’ll always be grateful to him. He certainly didn’t have to do that.”

Two years later Camillo has maintained her footing and as the first woman hired to be an NHL team’s president asserted her grip on the Flyers’ business side.

Despite a disruptive pandemic the 47-year-old executive has transformed the once-distinct managements of the Flyers and the arena into a single corporate entity revamped the game-night experience successfully reached out to a younger generation of fans aided the NHL in its quest for more diversity on and off the ice and maybe most impressively avoided the land mines that confront women in one of sport’s most macho outposts.

“With her energy level her style she just really connected from the get-go” said her boss Dave Scott Comcast Spectacor’s chairman and CEO.

Camillo’s arrival in Philadelphia coincided with an ongoing push by a league that’s playing catch-up in gender equality. The NHL has lagged behind its pro sports counterparts in female employment. According to a 2019 survey women who make up an estimated 40 percent of the league’s fan base held less than 5 percent of its hockey operations jobs.

The NHL is also alone among the four major sports with no domestic abuse policy. Each case is handled individually and the decision made by commissioner Gary Bettman and deputy commissioner Bill Daly.

In response the NHL last year formed a Female Hockey Advisory Board to address those issues and to foster the growth of the women’s sport. Like the Flyers several teams recently have added women to high-profile jobs. Canadian Olympic star Hayley Wickenheiser for example is now Toronto’s assistant director of player development. (Camillo is actually the second female president in the NHL but the first Buffalo’s Kim Pegula co-owns that team.)

The movement seems to validate the prediction of Kim Davis who since 2017 has served as an NHL executive vice president:

“The next 100 years” Davis said “will be defined by how our sport creates a more welcoming environment and opens its doors to new audiences.”

Camillo who has completed a hat trick of sports management jobs having worked earlier in the NBA and MLB said the only way to equal the playing field was to get more women into positions of authority.

“Twenty-five years ago when I was first coming into the professional world there was a subtle pressure to look and act like a man whatever that means” she said. “It came across in subtle encouragements like ‘Take up golf because that’s where business gets done.’ Well I don’t like golf. Getting to show my authentic self at work and not having to conform to succeed that’s gender equality.”

As recently as 2018 Camillo was a pioneering baseball executive. As the Washington Nationals’ chief revenue and marketing officer she was working contentedly not only in her favorite sport but in what essentially was her home town. Then late that year a headhunter contacted her about the Flyers opening.

“I definitely wasn’t looking” she said during a recent interview. “But what was so interesting to me was here you had an iconic brand in the Flyers a crazy sports town in Philadelphia and engaged fans. They were doing a $300 million transformation of the arena. And they were part of the Comcast organization. Just to be part of a Fortune 30 company was attractive. Next thing you know I went from taking a phone call to listening to an opportunity to taking the job.”

She had been one of 10 candidates interviewed by Scott who said he wasn’t worried about inserting a female executive into a male fortress.

“Hockey historically probably like all sports had challenges” said Scott. “But we knew what we wanted to do. With Ron Hextall leaving we brought in Chuck Fletcher a very progressive guy. And on the business side I thought Valerie could step into this and get running with the pack. She’s done that and she’s also really emerged as a great leader on the NHL side. Already she’s got a great following among those who work with her men and women.”

Sports as a career

A combination of nerd and jock Camillo grew up in northern Virginia immersed in sports both as a participant and a fan. Even as a youngster her ambition was a front-office job in team sports.

“I always cut a little bit of an unlikely figure” she said. “I was a young woman who knew a lot about sports stats and history. I would regularly test the guys. And somewhere over the years I decided that’s what I wanted to do.”

Her father worked in the defense industry while her homemaker mother was an avid baseball fan. From the start Camillo said she launched herself toward the glass ceilings she’d eventually help shatter.

“I’m a child of the ’70s and Star Wars was a formative part of my youth the toys I played with what engaged me creatively as a kid” she said. “I had a Millennial Falcon and I used to kick Han Solo out and let Princess Leia fly it. The little boy next door was my best friend and he and I would fight about it. So that was probably a sign of things to come.”

Her maternal grandfather a New Yorker turned her into a fan of the Yankees and especially their star catcher Thurman Munson. Vacationing in Wildwood N.J. in August 1979 she learned that that her idol had died in a plane crash.

“I don’t know why I liked him. I just I did” she said of Munson. “He was like my doll my first crush. I was only 6 when he was killed but I wrote his widow a letter to express how sad I was.”

An eager but not particularly gifted athlete Camillo played basketball softball and lacrosse in high school. She was limited to intramurals at the University of Virginia where she earned both an undergrad degree in commerce and her MBA.

“Twenty-five years ago there was a subtle pressure to look and act like a man whatever that means. It came across in subtle encouragements like ‘Take up golf because that’s where business gets done.’ Well I don’t like golf. Getting to show my authentic self at work and not having to conform to succeed that’s gender equality.” Valerie Camillo

For a decade and a half after graduation she worked for consulting firms PricewaterhouseCoopers and Booz Allen Hamilton.

“Before I ever got into sports I had a great foundation in business data analytics and strategy” she said. “Then a little bit into my career I started to try to make the move into sports. Back then it was hard for team sports executives to project exactly how what I did could be applicable to a team.”

Then came “Moneyball” and the analytics explosion both on the field and in front offices. Teams were collecting more customer data and they wanted to know how best to exploit it. That was Camillo’s wheelhouse and in 2010 she began consulting the NBA as part of its Team Marketing and Business Operations Group.

“I Ioved working at the NBA but if you’re passionate about sports a team is where the action is” she said.

Back in the 1990s Camillo with an eye toward one day landing in its front office had been part of a Washington-area group that lobbied MLB for another baseball team. In 2005 the Montreal Expos moved there and became the Nationals. Nine years later Camillo joined them.

“How often does a dream became real?” she said.

For four years Camillo directed the Nationals’ money-making operations from tickets to broadcasting to licensing to concessions. If there’s one regret she said it’s that the team’s first World Series triumph came a year after she departed. Still her tenure cemented her understanding of sports finances.

“The question I’m often asked by young women is ‘How do I get to be president of a team?’” Camillo said. “And what I advise them is stay close to the money. Stay on top of the money.”

When she surprised everyone and left Washington and baseball for Philadelphia and the black-and-blue world of hockey she was warned to prepare for culture shock.

“I listened but it wasn’t my first time at that rodeo being the only women at the table or working in male-centered environments” she said. “During the interview process someone said to me ‘You know you’d be the first woman hired to be a president of an NHL club.’ Someone else said ‘It’s very macho and it may not be super warm.’ But my experience with the Flyers has been pretty opposite of that.”

Married living now in Newtown Square after an initial residence in Center City Camillo helped create some of the many new experiences at Flyers games all of them aimed at broadening an aging fan base.

“During the interview process someone said to me ‘You know you’d be the first woman hired to be a president of an NHL club.’ Someone else said ‘It’s very macho and it may not be super warm.’ But my experience with the Flyers has been pretty opposite of that.” Valerie Camillo

“We’ve got to be mindful of building the next generation of Flyers fans” she said. “We have to be mindful of attracting a diverse set of fans. Our challenge is how to create a customized fan experience.”

She hopes millennials who tend to be more social than older fans will be attracted to the Assembly Room and Revolutionary Row the new casual lofty Wells Fargo Center areas where they can mingle drink and watch hockey; or the Rage Room where they can smash things for a price.

Though 40 percent of Flyers single-game ticket-purchasers are women Camillo thinks that number can grow with new family-friendly amenities like the Sensory Room meant to provide a safe space for fans with autistic children.

“For anyone on the business side being able to take part in a $300 million transformation of the arena was a dream” she said. “Dave Scott told me they wanted a leader who could say what it should look like what it should be. They wanted someone to maximize the fan experience maximize revenue. That’s what was so attractive about this job. And I’ve been allowed the autonomy to lead the transformation.”

The COVID-19 pandemic of course has slowed and altered some of those plans. But the 76ers season is now underway and the Flyers will soon join them. What those seasons will look like in a few months and how the arena will adapt is still anyone’s guess.

“There have been a lot of unexpected and new challenges” Camillo said. “But we’re making the most of the hand we’ve been dealt. For those that are creative there are new opportunities and paths forward.”

And if any of those paths are treacherous Camillo with or without Holmgren’s help and likely in more sensible footwear will figure out a way to navigate them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vcHVja3Byb3NlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzAyL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS1mbHllcnMtc2FtdWVsLW1vcmluLWZvcndhcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philadelphia Flyers: Cross-training Samuel Morin is 'forward'-thinking,Next. 5 best games of the Johnny Gaudreau-era. dark,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vcm9sbGluZ291dC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8wMi9uYXR1cmktbmF1Z2h0b24taXMtZW5nYWdlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Naturi Naughton is engaged,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://rollingout.com/2021/01/02/naturi-naughton-is-engaged/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vcm9sbGluZ291dC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8wMi9uYXR1cmktbmF1Z2h0b24taXMtZW5nYWdlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

A consortium of vendors including Intel Samsung SanDisk Dell and Seagate developed Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) as a communication interface/protocol specifically for solid-state drives (SSDs). The specification defines a register interface command set and features for PCI Express (PCIe)-based SSDs to facilitate high performance and interoperability across all conforming NVM subsystems.

The NVMe specification provides an alternative to the Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) and Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) standards for interfacing between a host system and a peripheral storage device. The SCSI and ATA standards were developed at a time when hard disk drives (HDDs) and tape were the primary storage media. NVMe was designed for use with much faster media such as SSDs.

Other standards such as Serial-Attached SCSI (SAS) and Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) have been adapted to SSDs. However these standards do not convey the main benefits of NVMe-based PCIe SSDs:

Reduced host software stack latency

Higher input/output operations per second (IOPS)

Potential lower power consumption

The NVMe specification supports SSDs that use different types of non-volatile memory including NAND flash and the 3D XPoint technology developed by Intel and Micron Technology. Supported form factors include add-in PCIe cards M.2 SSDs and U.2 2.5-inch SSDs. Figure 1 shows the history of NAND evolvement.

Smaller devices look to M.2

M.2 a form factor specification formerly known as the Next Generation Form Factor (NGFF) is primarily for internally mounted computer expansion cards and associated connectors. Its flexible physical specification allows different module widths and lengths. Together with the availability of more advanced interfacing features this makes the M.2 ideal for solid-state storage applications in general and for use in small devices such as ultrabooks and tablets. Computer bus interfaces compatible to the M.2 connector are PCIe 3.0 Serial ATA 3.0 and USB 3.0. The M.2 connector has different keying notches that denote various purposes and capabilities of M.2 devices preventing inadvertent connection of incompatible devices. In addition to the legacy Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) at the logical interface level the M.2 specification also supports NVMe as the logical device interface for M.2 PCIe SSDs. While the support for AHCI ensures backward compatibility with SATA devices and legacy operating systems (OSs) NVMe is designed to fully utilize the capability of high-speed PCIe storage devices to perform multiple parallel I/O operations.

NVMe SSD applications

The SSD market has been running into some significant hurdles namely legacy storage buses. Serial ATA and SAS offer plenty of bandwidth for hard drives but the increasingly higher performance of SSDs is pushing them beyond their capabilities. For example almost any top-flight SATA SSD will run right up against SATA’s 600Gbps ceiling. Even 12 GBps SAS SSD performance is held back at around 1.5 GBps. SSD technology is capable of much more. Not incidentally a high-bandwidth bus technology was already in place—PCIe. PCIe is the specification for the underlying data transport layer for graphics and other add-in cards as well as Thunderbolt a hardware interface standard developed by Intel (in collaboration with Apple) that allows the connection of external peripherals to a computer. PCIe Gen 2 supports approximately 500 MBps per lane and version 3.x (Gen 3) supports around 985 MBps per lane. Putting a card in an x4 (four-lane) slot will give you 2 GBps of bandwidth with Gen 2 and nearly 4 GBps with Gen 3. That’s a vast improvement. PCIe 3.x provides a wide enough pipe for today’s fastest SSDs.

Intel partnered with Micron to develop a new form of memory technology called 3D XPoint to achieve high reliability. The Intel Optane SSD 905P half-height half-length M.2 format which supports PCIe 3.0×4 and NVMe is able to achieve a high 1.6 million hours of mean time between failure (MTBF) life expectancy. Its memory capacity is up to 1.5 TB (Figure 2).

In February Western Digital announced Ultrastar DC SN630 NVMe SSD a 2.5-inch small form factor (SFF) enterprise-grade NVMe SSD optimized for cloud storage. The Ultrastar DC SN630 SSD can be configured to deliver a capacity up to 7.68 TB. Additionally the company’s CL SN720 NVMe SSD is an NVMe M.2 form factor SSD supporting up to 2 TB. The 1 TB version has a read/write speed of 3400 MBps and 2800 MBps accordingly comparable with the Samsung’s offering with a slightly faster write time (Figure 3).

M.2 adapter selection criteria

Here are some things to consider when choosing M.2 adapters:

Capacity: How many SSDs can the adapter host? A full-height half-length card can host four NVMe SSDs and have a power dissipation limit of 25 W for a PCIe x16 slot. A half-height card can host two SSDs and lower power dissipation.

Support for PCIe x16 or PCIe x8: Say a GPU takes up 16 lanes but you still want to use four SSDs. You can overcome the lane shortage if the adapter you choose includes an onboard switch to provide an x8 connection.

Cooling the SSDs: Can the onboard cooling devices e.g. heat sinks adequately dissipate the heat generated by the SSDs for your application? You may want to consider a cooling fan if your application involves sustained prolonged sequential write operations. But if the write operation is in short bursts lasting seconds or a few minutes then a good heat sink with reliable air flow may suffice.

Signal integrity: The challenge here is that PCIe using high-speed 8-Gbps serial links can suffer from a multitude of physical phenomena such as crosstalk impedance discontinuities resulting in reflections that cause jitter Intersymbol Interference (ISI) and mode conversion due to unbalanced transmission lines—all of which can lead to excessive electromagnetic interference (EMI) emissions in large systems. Manufacturing processes ensuring the high signal integrity of PCIe Gen 3 serial channels are critical if high-speed serial interfaces are to deliver on their promise of greater performance. Signal integrity analysis and compliance testing must be rigorously implemented in production and QA processes to accomplish that goal.

Availability of standard drivers/tools

High-end SSDs had been made using the PCIe bus before NVMe but the interfaces were non-standard. Standardizing the interface of SSDs to the NVMe specification makes it possible for operating systems to use one driver to work with all conforming SSDs. For example Windows 10 has its own driver for NVMe SSDs. Drivers are hardware dependent and operating-system-specific. They usually provide the interrupt handling required for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interface.

One of the best things about NVMe is that you don’t have to worry about driver availability. Linux has had NVMe support since kernel 3.1; Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 R2 both include a native driver and there’s a FreeBSD driver in the works. When Apple decides to support NVMe the latter should make it easy to port. However BIOS support is largely lacking. Without an NVMe-aware BIOS you can’t boot from an NVMe drive although anyone with an x4 PCIe slot or M.2 connector can benefit from employing an NVMe drive as secondary storage. An NVMe BIOS is not a big deal but it does require effort and resources. More abundant and prevalent support has to be there. If you intend to make an SSD boot device you would need:

A recent system such as the Xeon D-1540 or Skylake chipsets (2015 or later).

Modern OSs that have the NVMe driver built in like Windows 8.1/10 or Windows Server 2016. If the OS-provided driver is slow replace it with a vendor-provided driver once OS is installed.

An M.2 PCIe x4 (or higher) slot (as in four lanes key to obtaining the maximum speeds).

BIOS in UEFI boot mode (A nice bonus here is that it allows your bootable device to be larger than 2 TB since Windows will use the GUID Partition Table (GPT) rather than the legacy Master Boot Record (MBR) mode.

Compatibility Support Mode (CSM) to be turned on (as required by some motherboards).

BIOS upgrades and/or BIOS configuration changes (as required by motherboard manufacturer).

Optional M.2 NVMe SSD PCIe adapter card for multiple SSDs.

Newer high-end motherboards will get firmware upgrades to support NVMe so one can boot from the drive.

Samsung offers two models with built-in controllers that support PCIe Gen 3.0 x4 and NVMe 1.3 in a M.2 format. They support storage capacity up to 1 TB (970PRO) and 2 TB (970VRO). The read speed is 3500 MBps for both models while the sequential write speed is 2500 MBps and 2700 MBps accordingly (Figure 4).

Note that NVMe SSDs are nearly seven times faster than SATA SSDs. A single NVMe M.2 SSD can provide read speeds as high as 3500 MBps. To maximize the SSD performance one may want to select a M.2 adapter separately. For example one of Aplicata’s expansion adapters the Quattro 400 PCIe x8 model provides a read speed of 7.2 GBps when combined with four 1 TB Samsung 970PRO NVMe SSDs. At this speed it is close to the PCIe Gen 3 x8. These inexpensive adapter cards will fit in the PCIe slots if the motherboard lacks a M.2 connector (Figure 5).

Conclusion

NVMe is a communication interface/protocol developed specifically for SSDs by a consortium while M.2 is primarily for internally mounted computer expansion cards and associated connectors. SSDs come in pre-configured controllers. To achieve higher read/write performance one may consider the option of integrating SSDs using separate M.2 adapters. In selecting an adapter consider the supported storage capacity whether it supports PCIe x16 or x8 the cooling of the SSDs signal integrity and finally the availability of standard drivers and tools.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vbGVhZGVycy8yMDIxLzAxLzAyL3doeS1yZXRhaWxlcnMtZXZlcnl3aGVyZS1zaG91bGQtbG9vay10by1jaGluYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why retailers everywhere should look to China,"O VER THE past ten months most people in the rich world have participated in the biggest shopping revolution in the West since malls and supermarkets conquered suburbia 50 years ago. The pandemic has led to a surge in online spending speeding up the shift from physical stores by half a decade or so. Forget the chimney; Christmas gifts in 2020 came flying through the letterbox or were dumped on the doorstep. Workers at a handful of firms including Amazon and Walmart have made superhuman efforts to fulfil online orders and their investors have made supernormal profits as Wall Street has bid up their shares on euphoria that Western retailing is at the cutting edge.

Yet as we explain this week (see article) it is in China not the West where the future of e-commerce is being staked out. Its market is far bigger and more creative with tech firms blending e-commerce social media and razzmatazz to become online-shopping emporia for 850m digital consumers. And China is also at the frontier of regulation with the news on December 24th that trustbusters were investigating Alibaba co-founded by Jack Ma China’s most celebrated tycoon and until a few weeks ago its most valuable listed firm.

WEST CHESTER Pennsylvania (WPVI) -- Two people were shot inside a hookah lounge in Chester County Pennsylvania.

It happened around 3 a.m. Saturday on the unit block of Gay Street in downtown West Chester.

Officials say shots were fired inside the Hookah Matata hookah lounge.

Two men were shot and taken to a local hospital for treatment authorities confirm.

""That is the scariest thing ever. I live right down the street on Gay Street so I'm shocked to hear that"" said Kat Donohue.

She says she can't remember the last time there was a shooting on Gay Street as the block is filled with small businesses.

Hours after the early morning shooting business owner Polly Zobel says it was crawling with shoppers.

""My mom lives upstairs is 75. She called me this morning to tell me what had happened"" said Zobel who owns KALY a clothing store two doors away.

She says she's now concerned about safety.

Police are looking into a video posted from the lounge's Instagram page a few hours before the shooting.

Officials say it appears to show a packed house with few masks and little social distancing.

Business owners nearby say they are alarmed for multiple reasons.

""That's scary that we have to think through gun violence right downstairs"" said Zobel.

Ryan Sitler who lives in West Chester said ""I was in there actually probably about six months ago maybe and it was a nice place I never would've expected something like that to happen.""

The conditions of the men have not been released. No other injuries were reported.

Officials have not announced any arrests at this time.

Ted was born in Duluth and spent his childhood in St. Paul graduating from St. Paul Academy in 1949 and Yale University in 1953. After college he married Nancy Lane Neimeyer who he first met in Kindergarten. They were married for 67 years. Ted spent three years as an officer in Naval Intelligence before beginning his career in Cloquet working for the Wood Conversion Co. (later Conwed Corporation). He eventually moved to St. Paul and rose to CEO of Conwed. Later Ted was instrumental in developing and running the Clearwater Management Corporation a registered advisory firm. His business acumen lead to his service on the Boards of Potlatch Corporation Arcata National Corporation Minnesota Mutual Life Insurance Norwest Corporation and Rock Island Company. His values of family faith integrity and compassion were reflected in his dedication to the boards of many local non-profits including the United Way the St. Paul Community Foundation the Union Gospel Mission Boys and Girls Clubs of the Twin Cities the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts Macalester College and the House of Hope Presbyterian Church. Ted will be remembered for his great love of family friends and community. He was always a gentleman and blessed with a dry sense of humor. He brought a level-headedness and sense of responsibility to all that he did providing a calming influence and good advice whether he was in the boardroom working at home or spending time with his children and grandchildren. A leader and mentor his commitment to family was demonstrated in his planning care love and consideration for each one of them. Many family friends and work colleagues have expressed how they will miss his calm steady leadership and kind heart. In addition to Nancy Ted is survived by his children; Rick (Annie Brewster) Cathy Julia (Tim Heidmann) and David; twelve grandchildren and one great grandson. Next summer we will gather with friends and family to celebrate a life well-lived. Well done thou good and gracious servant.

Williams plans to appoint Cea Weaver — campaign coordinator for Housing Justice for All a statewide coalition of tenant groups — to the 13-person commission.

Weaver 32 has called for rent strikes by tenants and an eviction ban due to COVID-19.

“Cea Weaver is one of New York’s leading housing and progressive policy activists who has fought for equity on behalf of individuals and communities alike and our office is proud to have worked with her in these fights” Williams’ spokesman William Gerlich told The Post Saturday.

“The City Planning Commission is an instrument of real power with the ability to shape the future of our city in a progressive direction to create change in this moment of crisis and for years to come.”

Describing evictions as “violent” Weaver successfully pushed for a state law signed by Gov. Cuomo putting a “pause” on evictions amid the pandemic.

She also supported the Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act of 2020 a bill that died last year but is expected to be reintroduced in January by state Sen. Julia Salazar (D-Brooklyn).

The bill would halt evictions and foreclosures until the end of the pandemic — plus one year to give tenants and homeowners time to catch up financially. It would compensate landlords for loss of income but give priority to “small mom and pops” before big companies.

Weaver — a member of the NYC local of the Democratic Socialists of America — has said she believes housing is a right and suggested that landlords “should not be profiting off something people deeply need.”

She endorsed the successful push to stop Amazon from building a second headquarters in Queens.

Weaver said Saturday she is weighing the nomination — which must be approved by the City Council — while undergoing a city background check.

“Ultimately when it comes to matters of land use in New York City my goal is to ensure that public land and public resources are used for the public good” she said.

Supporters hail Weaver’s courage in standing up for the little guy against powerful corporate interests.

Critics contend Weaver is bad for NYC’s comeback after the city lost billions of dollars in revenue due to the pandemic.

“With New York confronting an economic crisis of historic proportion it would be unfortunate if the City Planning Commission became another vehicle to block the creation of good jobs and much-needed housing and investment” James Whelan president of the Real Estate Board of New York said in a statement to The Post.

“It would be a significant setback for the City’s recovery.”

Williams can appoint one of 13 members on the planning commission.

The mayor appoints the chairperson who also serves as city planning director and six other members. The five borough presidents each appoint one member. The chair serves at the mayor’s pleasure while the other 12 commissioners sit for staggered terms of five years.

Many of them pose in studio apartments stretched out on velvet couches and propped up on dressers. Some press against vinyl shower curtains donning the neon underwear in mirror selfies. All of them look effortless.

It is not unusual these days for a brand to take over social media like this — seemingly overnight and all at once in nonprofessional photos posted by nonprofessional models. But these campaigns nearly always leave viewers wondering: Where did this start?

For Mariah Williams 21 it was a direct message from Parade’s Instagram account offering her free samples. When the products arrived she took the day off from her job as a barbershop receptionist to curate a photo shoot to show off her new burnt-orange underwear; in the photo she posted a bamboo planter sits next to her bottom half and her face is just out of the frame.

“Taking these pictures really made me feel good about myself and my body. Especially with seasonal depression I was in a mood” she said.

Williams who has only 2000 followers on Instagram is one of more than 6000 women and nonbinary Instagrammers who received messages from Parade offering free gifts ideally in exchange for social posts.

In addition to mailing samples the company also sent along digital mood boards and a Google Drive of creative direction in the hopes that the recipients would use it as inspiration for their own posts. The gift boxes yielded hundreds of posts across social media and drove interest in Parade’s products.

The pandemic has been devastating for the fashion industry. But not for underwear. Those sales have had a steady uptick since the beginning of the pandemic. According to Allied Market Research the lingerie industry is estimated to be worth $325 billion by 2025.

Parade was founded in 2019 just months before the U.S. economy shut down in March by Cami Téllez and Jack Defuria two friends in their early 20s. As most fashion companies struggled to keep afloat Parade sold over 700000 pairs of underwear and brought in $10 million in revenue according to a company representative.

Téllez the startup’s CEO attributes that success to the strength of the brand’s image.

“Parade has been able to create a groundswell a cultural zeitgeist. I think that we’re changing the way a whole generation of women see themselves and I think that’s why we’ve been so successful” she said. Parade estimates that 1 in 8 customers posts a picture of themselves in the underwear.

Parade is one of many brands that have eschewed paid influencer campaigns in favor of sending products to people who have smaller and more dedicated followings and often aren’t influencers at all.

“They’re just reaching out to normal people who have followers they actually know in real life” Williams said.

“Working with micro-influencers is part of our DNA” Téllez said. “Unlike brands of underwear past we don’t think you need to have hundreds of thousands of followers or be a supermodel to share your underwear story.”

Gifting programs which offer free product in exchange for posts have also become more common. But the tactic has sparked discussions about unpaid labor. “As a small influencer especially as a Black and brown influencer we often get used and not paid” Williams said. She has since reached out to Parade about receiving commission in exchange for promoting a discount code.

Rhea Woods the head of influencer strategy at Praytell Agency encourages brands to offer compensation to influencers no matter how small their following. “It is very standard to pay those folks several hundred dollars” she said. “That shocks brands. But at the same time we’re asking for rights to their name image and likeness” Woods said.

Because of its far reach Parade’s campaign took on a second life sparking an online conversation about who received sponsorships. One Twitter user posted: “Is it just me or does Parade Underwear feel like a Pyramid Scheme?” Another tweeted: “Why didn’t Parade send me underwear am I ugly or something”

“I think those tweets if anything speak to how wide ranging our brand has become” Téllez said.

Dana Donnelly a 25-year-old comedian and writer with 128500 followers posted an image of her Parade underwear in September but after a few months she saw the brand target smaller and smaller accounts and she became more skeptical. She questioned if the entire Parade marketing campaign foundation was founded on stoking feelings of exclusion. “I can’t tell what their objective is besides making the girls they’re sending it to feel cool and the girls they’re not sending it to feel uncool” she said. “It’s almost like high school mean-girl marketing.”

Yamini Nambimadom 22 who received a sponsorship described it as “guerrilla marketing campaign where you watch your friends promote something and you would want to try it.” Nambimadom does not consider herself an influencer and had never been approached by a brand before but was intrigued by Parade’s campaign. “There’s a social psychology of wanting to be a part of something” she said. (Nambimadom has cheekily added “Recipient of Parade Underwear” to her Twitter bio.)

When asked about how people were selected to be included in the campaign Téllez said: “There are hundreds of psychographics” (i.e. many factors she would not name).

In early December Parade released a collaboration with Juicy Couture. The accompanying campaign featured women donning underwear with “JUICY” written across the rear in rhinestones. “I think that most women in America have some sort of emotional connection to Juicy because it was one of the very first self-expression brands” Téllez said. (For what it’s worth the company made its name on $150 tracksuits.)

Gab Landrum 28 an artist who posted about Parade became critical of the brand after the Juicy collaboration. “It didn’t seem to be about normal people anymore.”

Landrum who takes nongendered pronouns noted that in the most recent revival of the Black Lives Matter movement many brands advantageously adopted progressive slogans but rarely invest in meaningful representation.

“You can scroll back to Parade’s Instagram page in March and see the shift in skin tone. And a few months goes by and they go back to being very thin mostly white with very sparse representation of Black and heavy people” they said.

Landrum said that because younger consumers are increasingly politically aware brands have learned to lean into causes. Parade recently told customers it would donate $1 to Feeding America for every post that featured their underwear with the hashtag #ParadeTogether and five friends tagged.

“We really believe in having a Technicolor view on inclusivity as a whole” Téllez said. (When asked if the employees of Parade reflect that commitment to diversity the chief executive declined to comment.)

Because of the popularity of the company’s Instagram campaign Donnelly joked that soon enough everyone would be an influencer. In her own Parade post she is kneeling in crimson red underwear gazing toward the viewer and almost smiling.

“I’ve been influenced!” one of the comments reads.

Joseph Hebert spent New Year’s Eve in a hotel room looking out at the Strip but he couldn’t join the party.

His celebration could come Sunday night if he claims the World Series of Poker Main Event title at the Rio. Hebert who won the U.S. portion of the Main Event on Monday is playing international winner Damian Salas heads-up for $1 million the trophy bracelet and a place in poker history.

So having to stay in his hotel room because of COVID protocols is no problem.

“This is something and a goal that I’ve always tried to attain so it’s worth every isolation possible” Hebert said Friday. “I would isolate myself for a year if I had to to have this opportunity.”

Hebert a 38-year-old poker pro from Metairie Louisiana already guaranteed himself $1553256 by prevailing at the U.S. final table. The heads-up match with Salas was originally scheduled for Wednesday but was delayed because of travel issues caused by coronavirus protocols.

That meant Hebert’s stay at the Rio was extended. He spent a couple of days with his fiancee and son before isolating.

“I got to celebrate New Year’s with them on a video chat” he said.

“You win $1.5 million and you think maybe you can celebrate a little bit” he added. “It’s kind of strange having to hold off but it’s a good thing.”

Hebert said he has spent the time responding to all the text messages and calls he received after his victory which he dedicated to his mother Linda who died unexpectedly in July from a pulmonary embolism.

“All the congrats and feeling all the love is just absolutely amazing especially for my mom” Hebert said. “Everybody’s reaching out and saying ‘What a wonderful story. She’s super happy for you and she’s dancing up there.’”

Hebert said he was also spending his time studying Salas and talking to players who were familiar with his game. The Argentine won the international final table Dec. 15 in Rozvadov Czech Republic. He finished seventh in the 2017 Main Event and drew notice for taking a long time to make his decisions.

“He’s very methodical about his approach to the game” Hebert said. “It’s going to be a duel. It’s going to be a battle.”

Salas was not available for an interview. PokerNews confirmed that he has arrived for the match.

The Main Event the $10000 buy-in No-limit Hold’em Championship was played in a hybrid online/live format this year because of the pandemic. Because of U.S. online poker laws two tournaments had to be held one for U.S. players on WSOP.com and one for international players on GGPoker.

A total of 705 players entered the U.S. portion and the international portion attracted 674 players for a total field of 1379.

The tournaments were played online until the final tables of nine were reached.

“We’ve seen memorable moments you can’t believe and discovered two central characters you can’t help but root for” WSOP executive director Ty Stewart said in a statement. “A dream will be dealt on Jan. 3 and that’s exactly what we need heading into 2021.”

Hebert has been in Las Vegas for nearly a month after arriving to play tournaments leading up to the Main Event. He said he hopes to finally head back to Louisiana to celebrate — with an extra $1 million in tow.

“I changed my flight for the fourth time — which is a good thing” he said laughing. “I’m not complaining.”

""These people won’t put their heads up again while the mainland [Chinese] authorities are as belligerent and antagonistic towards gaming as they now are."" When Packer first proposed the project in 2018 he made it clear having a high-roller members-only casino attached was crucial to its viability and that China was the biggest opportunity. Crown promised the NSW government that Barangaroo would deliver $1 billion in tax revenue in the first 15 years of operation. The casino would triple the value of international VIP gaming business coming into Sydney Packer claimed. But in October while giving evidence to the Bergin inquiry he conceded that would never eventuate. ""Clearly that’s wrong but that’s what I believed at the time"" Packer told the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) inquiry.

The billionaire businessman explained that in the original business case international high rollers would generate a third of Crown Sydney's earnings with local gamblers and its hotel and hospitality operations making up the balance covering the cost of construction. ""The upside in Crown Sydney was from the international VIP business"" Packer said. James Packer during the inquiry hearing. Getting out of Crown could lead to him forfeiting his control premium. Credit: Out of the $2.2 billion construction cost Crown also hopes to recoup $800 million from sales of luxury apartments in the tower. The penthouse is still for sale at a reported asking price of $100 million. Crown's grip on the China market was already slipping following the arrest of 19 Crown employees in China in 2016 for illegally promoting gambling (one of the main focuses of the Bergin inquiry) and Crown's subsequent exit from its Asian joint venture.

Crown then relied on ""junket"" tour partners to bring Chinese VIPs to Australia but that has been put on ice after the Herald and The Age exposed how many of its junkets had links to organised crime which was examined further at the Bergin inquiry. Crown has pledged to never work with junkets again unless state regulators implement a licensing regime for the controversial operators. And just last week the Chinese government passed even harsher criminal penalties for anyone organising Chinese citizens to travel overseas to gamble. Casino industry expert Ben Lee from the consultancy IGamiX Management & Consulting says this effectively closed-off the flow of Chinese high rollers to casinos like Crown Sydney. “It leaves them up the creek without a paddle"" he says. ""The only way they even can try to recover their investment [from Barangaroo] is to go aggressively after the local market.” That will include targeting lower-tier players – not just wealthy VIPs – who currently frequent Crown's Sydney rival The Star says Lee. That's possible because its table game-betting limit is only $25 which far from being ""high-roller"" stakes is what most patrons bet on the main gaming floor at Crown Melbourne.

“When you look at the table limit of $25 that’s a laugh"" he says. ""That’s not even the main hall limit in Macau. So while they were saying one thing they were really aiming for something else."" Green says that Crown could still attract some relative high rollers. But the inability to extend credit to Chinese gamblers here and get around China's tight capital controls – which was a key function of junkets – would limit the earning potential. ""It’s going to be a lot harder for them to carve much out of gaming itself"" Green says. Green thinks Crown will eventually be allowed to operate in Sydney but may face a long delay in opening the facility and stricter reporting conditions. There may also be some issues replacing its board. The Victorian government last month fast-tracked by two years its review of Crown's licence to this year in light of the evidence the NSW inquiry uncovered about what was happening at the Southbank complex. Credit: Scott McNaughton

Some industry watchers say the Bergin inquiry has jeopardised not just Crown Sydney but also the group's most important asset: Crown Melbourne. The Victorian government last month fast-tracked its next five-yearly review of Crown's licence due in 2023 to this year in light of the evidence the NSW inquiry uncovered about what was happening under its nose at the sprawling Southbank complex. Loading But another outcome which could address Crown's licensing issues is for it to be taken over by another operator. Australian market analysts have recently crunched the numbers on a possible merger between Crown and Star Entertainment to create a $14 billion gambling behemoth with casinos in Australia's four largest capitals. Packer for his part has shown himself to be a willing seller. He negotiated a full Crown takeover with US casino giant Wynn in April 2019 but that fell apart when details leaked to the press.",,,,,,,,,

From countless postponements to outright cancelations to even events held without any fans few things were worth celebrating this past year when it came to sports.

But we here at the Brainerd Dispatch sports department did find a few things worth remembering. Here are the top 10 sports stories for the year 2020:

No. 1: A world series first

Don’t worry we’ll mention COVID-19 soon enough but we decided to start with something good and unforgettable.

Oct. 21 marked the first time a Brainerd High School graduate appeared in a World Series game. Nick Anderson Major League Baseball’s top middle reliever entered Game Two in the bottom of the fifth inning and struck out Los Angeles Dodgers’ third baseman Justin Turner to end the inning.

The Tampa Bay Rays pitcher went 1 1/3 innings and allowed one hit one earned run and two strikeouts to earn the win to even the series at one game apiece.

In the bottom of the sixth after retiring the leadoff hitter Max Muncy he gave up a solo home run to Dodgers’ catcher Will Smith which trimmed the Rays’ lead to 6-3.

Anderson retired the next two batters including a strikeout of Edwin Rios to end the inning.

The Dodgers would go on to win the World Series and Anderson admittedly struggled during the postseason compared to his almost unhittable regular season.

That didn't stop MLB from honoring Anderson as one of the most dominant relievers in the game in just his second season in the league.

His stellar 2020 regular season earned him a spot on the All-MLB first team as one of the two relief pitchers. The All-MLB winners are selected with 50% coming from a fan vote and 50% coming from a panel of experts. It’s the second season MLB has announced an All-MLB team.

Anderson posted a 0.55 ERA in 16 1/3 innings in the 19 games he played in 2020. He struck out 26 and walked three.

He allowed one earned run all regular season and it came in his 15th appearance and 13th inning pitched.

For his two-year career Anderson is 7-5 with seven saves 22 holds and a 2.77 ERA. He’s appeared in 87 games with 12 games finished. He’s pitched 81.1 innings and allowed 25 earned runs on 57 hits and 21 walks -- four intentional. He owns 136 strikeouts.

When asked what it was like to pitch in the World Series despite few fans being allowed because of the pandemic Anderson said: “Man it was a lot of fun. I wish everything would have been normal but it was still a great experience. We'll see what happens this next year maybe be back there.”

No. 2: COVID cancels sports

It started March 12 and never got better.

The first remedy for COVID-19 was to limit spectators at the boys and girls state basketball tournaments.

“In a press release before 1 p.m. Thursday March 12 the Minnesota State High School League wrote that attendance at tournaments will be limited to rostered participants coaches event staff TV network partners credentialed media and a small number of school-approved spectators of each participating teams.

Starting Friday consolation and third-place games for state girls basketball and adapted floor hockey have been canceled.”

It went from bad to worse in a day.

“Due to the Coronavirus pandemic The Minnesota State High School League announced Friday that effective immediately the state high school girls basketball tournaments the boys’ high school section tournament games and next week’s boys’ state tournament have been canceled.”

Then the news turned to spring sports and the speculation and wait might have been worse than the actual announcement that spring sports would be canceled.

“The Minnesota State High School League announced Thursday April 23 that all activities and athletics that occur during the spring season are canceled for the 2019-20 school year.

This announcement comes from the MSHSL board of directors and comes on the same day Governor Tim Walz announced distance learning would continue for the rest of the school year.”

Restrictions were put in place for offseason contact and workouts. Gyms and weight rooms and pools remained closed. Speculation quickly turned to the fall sports season.

And the craziness ensued.

“The Minnesota State High School League announced Tuesday Aug. 4 that fall sports like boys and girls cross-country boys and girls soccer girls tennis and girls swimming and diving will go as scheduled while football and volleyball will be moved to spring.”

That decision didn’t last long however as mounting pressure from parent groups forced the MSHSL to change course mid-fall.

“Football and volleyball are happening earlier than expected in the 2020-21 school year.

The Minnesota State High School League announced Monday Sept. 21 after a meeting that volleyball and football will return in the fall and not play in the spring as initially decided in August.

ADVERTISEMENT

Both sports will begin practice Monday Sept. 28 with first games being possible Thursday Oct. 8 for volleyball and Friday Oct. 9 for football. Volleyball and football have already been holding practice which was deemed OK by the previous plan laid out by the MSHSL in August.”

And while most got in a regular season teams like the Brainerd Warriors and Pine River-Backus Tigers struggled to get in the allowed number of games. Brainerd couldn’t play its first game because of a COVID-19 outbreak in the school. The Warriors also failed to suit up for their final regular-season game because of a positive test on the team. The Warriors played in just four games last fall.

PR-B played in just two regular-season games but did get in one postseason game where they upset Walker-Hackensack-Akeley in the quarterfinals.

The victory should have allowed PR-B to play at least one more game but then COVID-19 made sure to add insult to injury by forcing all fall sports to end Friday Nov. 20. It also postponed the start of all winter sports.

Some sections choose to forgo the section semifinal round and push the top two seeds into a section title game. That’s why PR-B’s season ended with them winning their last game. Pierz and Pequot Lakes were pushed into their respective section title games. Unfortunately Aitkin which enjoyed a 6-1 season and was the top seed in Section 7-3A didn’t get that luxury. They were forced to end their season with a 56-6 section semifinal victory over Virginia.

The area did see one section title as the No. 3 seeded Crosby-Ironton Rangers topped the only other two teams left in its Section 7-2A tournament to win the program’s first section title.

No. 3: The end of a winning era

In any other normal year this news would have been No. 1 in sports and even on some news lists. But 2020 was far from normal and it started out that way.

“For the first time since 1975 a head coach other than Ron Stolski will be pacing the Brainerd Warriors sideline at Adamson Field in 2020.

Stolski a head coach for 58 total seasons the last 45 in Brainerd informed the 2019 team of his decision to resign in a meeting Wednesday Jan. 22 at Brainerd High School South Campus.”

Stolski retired at 80 years old and as the second-winningest football coach in Minnesota State High School League history.

On the day of his retirement Stolski talked about why he coached for so many years.

“One of the lines I use in my speaking across the country is ‘When you choose a life in teaching/coaching you choose to try to make a difference in the lives you touch’ Stolski said. “My fervent hope is that we have in some way accomplished that goal.”

Stolski finished with 389 career victories a few highlights were:

A 12-10 win over third-ranked Cretin-Derham Hall in the 1990 Class 2A state quarterfinals. A 36-35 regular-season win over Grand Rapids in 1992 when the Warriors rallied from a 20-point deficit halftime deficit. A 14-10 win in the final 65 seconds of the 2007 Class 5A state quarterfinals over sixth-ranked Wayzata. A 34-28 overtime win over sixth-ranked Centennial in the 2009 5A state quarterfinals scoring 14 straight points in the final seven minutes of regulation. The biggest gem of them all might have been a 13-10 win over third-ranked Eden Prairie in the 2010 5A state quarterfinals.

Thanks to COVID-19 the Brainerd community has not been allowed to give Stolski a retirement party. The committee organizing the event which was last scheduled for Sept. 19 at Cragun’s Resort will meet later this month to pick an appropriate date and place.

Before COVID-19 ruined everything the Brainerd lakes area did enjoy some athletic success.

For just the second time in program history Brainerd advanced to the Class 3A state jazz finals and then posted a program-best fifth-place finish Friday Feb. 14 at Target Center in Minneapolis.

“Our girls did great” Brainerd head coach Cindy Clough said after the event. “We were really proud of them. Oh my gosh everybody in the finals was fabulous. There were kind of three teams vying for that fifth and sixth place spot and Lakeville North was the one that didn’t make it in. They were close.”

Brainerd finished fifth after the opening-round qualifying to advance to finals. Clough said Brainerd was ranked sixth going in but topped Prior Lake which finished sixth and Lakeville North.

Brainerd also improved its score by 10 points in the finals.

A day later Brainerd was dancing in the Class 3A state kick finals and placed fourth.

“We performed way better at finals than we did at prelims” Clough said at the time. “Our scores went way up. We performed way better in the evening and we were pleased with that.

“We placed fourth which we are proud of. I think our kids were a little disappointed because they were so set on medaling. But with time they will look back and think it’s amazing what they accomplished.”

Prior to the state tournament Brainerd repeated as double section champions in both jazz and kick Feb. 1 in Forest Lake.

Brainerd scored four rank points in both categories. They beat Anoka by four rank points in jazz and Blaine by six rank points in kick.

No. 5: 2 collect state titles in the nick of time

Owen Bjerga of Staples-Motley celebrates being named Class 1A state champion at 160-pounds Saturday Feb. 29 at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul. Bill Johnson / Picture Day Pro!

Owen Bjerga waited a whole year for redemption. Craig Orlando marked his place as one of the best to ever wrestle for the Raiders.

Staples-Motley Cardinals’ Bjerga and Bertha-Hewitt/Verndale’s Orlando captured Class 1A state wrestling titles before COVID-19 shutdown prep athletics.

“Bjerga at 160 pounds pinned Max Ehrich of Blue Earth in 1:58 in the semifinals to reach the finals. He then pinned Anthony Maher of BOLD in 1:55 to claim the title.

The state championship is extra special for Bjerga who was the No. 1 seed for the 160 Class 1A bracket since last season he finished second in heartbreaking fashion.

“It has not quite set in yet” Bjerga said. “It felt pretty good to do it like that. It’s hard to explain the feeling. For all the years of hard work to pay off. It’s pretty cool.”

Bjerga finished his senior season with a 45-1 record.

Orlando came in with two state titles at 285 pounds. Seeded No. 1 in the 285 Class 1A bracket Orlando pinned both of his opponents to reach the semifinals.

In the semifinals he won by a 1-0 decision over Dylan Nick of Westfield. Orlando pinned Scot Edwards of Adrian in 3:07 in the finals to finish the season 50-0 and as a three-time state champion.

Aitkin’s Marshall Larson and Crosby-Ironton’s John Paul Fitzpatrick each wrestled back to earn third-place finishes.

No. 6: Silence not a good thing at BIR

It was inevitable with spectators not being allowed but like all things in 2020 Brainerd International Raceway was holding out hope.

That hope didn’t materialize as the NHRA canceled the Lucas Oil NHRA Nationals annually held Sept. 3 at BIR.

Originally scheduled for Aug. 13-16 the Lucas Oil NHRA Nationals was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The NHRA and BIR hoped to reschedule it this month but BIR’s location and climate this time of year presented scheduling challenges.

“We feel horrible having to deliver this news today because we have thousands of loyal fans who look forward to Nationals every year and plan their entire summer around it” BIR Owner Kristi Copham said in a press release at the time. “We also feel for local businesses that rely on the added revenue from Nationals weekend. It’s been a difficult summer for everyone but we appreciate everyone’s support and we hope to see everyone at next year’s Nationals.”

The one silver lining is that the NHRA is already scheduled to return next season.

Nitro-fueled NHRA drag racing returns to Brainerd International Raceway for the 39th Annual Lucas Oil NHRA Nationals on Aug. 19-22 2021 the NHRA announced Wednesday Oct. 7.

“We can’t wait for August 19th and I know our fans will be really amped up for the race after having to take this year off” Copham said. “We can’t thank our fans enough for being patient and understanding during last season. We felt horrible for having to cancel the race because our fans are the best drag racing fans in the world and deserve to get their annual dose of Nitro each year not to mention some quality time in The Zoo. We’re looking forward to putting on a great event next summer as we welcome everyone back.”

In an interview last summer Copham said the NHRA event accounts for 75% of BIR’s annual income.

No. 7: The beginning of the Jason Freed era

It probably wasn’t the start any first-year head coach would want especially one replacing a coaching legend.

COVID-19 created multiple complications for new Brainerd Warriors head football coach Jason Freed -- from a canceled opening-season game to the premature ending to the season.

Jason Freed.

The long-time defensive coordinator for the Warriors was promoted to head coach Friday March 6.

The Brainerd activities department received 12 applications and interviewed four candidates.

“This wasn’t a hard decision because we went through the process and Jason clearly separated himself from the rest of the pool” Brainerd activities director Charlie Campbell said about the hiring. “His previous experience as a head coach winning a state championship but beyond that success Jason really articulated a great vision for continuing on and advancing the foundations of a really strong Warrior football tradition that coach Stolski created.”

After having to cancel its opening game with Cambridge-Isanti Freed and the Warriors finally took to the field against St. Cloud Apollo Saturday Oct. 17.

The Warriors handed Freed his first victory as head coach of the Warriors with a 35-30 win over the Eagles.

Brainerd struggled against top competition the rest of the season before another case of COVID-19 forced the Warriors to end the season Thursday Nov. 12. Brainerd was to host Sartell and then head into the playoffs.

“It’s a tough thing to swallow” Freed said after informing his players of the news. “I told the kids that you all have things in life we think we can control but there are some things that we can’t control. We’ve been talking with the kids since this summer about ‘You control the controllables.’ This is one of those things where we can do our best to try and prevent but when it comes to it you can’t control it. It’s tough and it’s hard to let it set in.

“Our mantra all year has been Warrior Pride and our core values of purpose and maintaining relationships improving daily and discipline and effort. We just talked about those things and how they correlate with life and how it shows that we are a team.”

Brainerd finished the year 1-3.

No. 8: Running away from the pack

The abbreviated fall season wasn’t all bad.

In fact it displayed some dominating performances in cross-country with both the Staples-Motley Cardinals and Pequot Lakes Patriots sweeping their sections.

S-M’s Emmet Anderson won the Section 6-1A individual title with a time of 15:51.1 as the Cardinals boys claimed the section championship Tuesday Oct. 13.

On the same day Ethan Johnson’s fourth-place finish paced the Patriots boys to the Section 7-1A championship in Cloquet.

S-M beat West Central by two points. Behind Anderson were Issiah Tabatt (fifth in 16:59.4) Lyle Brownell (9th in 17:32) Logan Robben (10th in 17:33.3) Luke Brownell (13th in 18:00.3) Tanner Robben (18th in 18:15.7) and Grant Johnson (19th in 18:22.4).

The Patriot boys topped defending state champion Geno Uhbrom’s Greenway/Nashwauk-Keewatin team by four points.

After Johnson’s fourth-place finish was Jesse Clausen (7th in 17:30.5) Dawsin Ackerman (15th in 17:54.5) Collin Yahn (18th in 17:59.1) Charlie Schiessl (23rd in 18:24.4) and Isaak Geroy (30th in 18:33.4).

Calia Chaney and the Pequot Lakes Patriots girls showed the boys team how it’s done Monday Oct. 12 by winning the Section 7-1A title.

Chaney won the individual section title in 18:48.6 and the Patriots bettered Proctor by four points for the team title.

Following Chaney were Rian Zutter (4th in 20:01.8) Carly Chaney (6th in 20:28.7) Isabel Larson (43rd in 22:35.8) Emma Flaws (48th in 22:45.8) Lilix Gustafson (64th in 23:27.6) and Elisa Flaws (67th in 23:33.7).

The biggest winning margin belonged to the S-M girls team which captured the Section 6-1A title by 45 points over second-place West Central Thursday Oct. 15 in New London. It is the third-straight section title for the S-M girls.

Kyanna Burton’s third-place time of 19:15.8 paced S-M. She was followed by Aften Robinson (4th in 19:28.1) Auddrey Brownell (7th in 20:22.2) Ashley Robben (9th in 20:54.8) Naila Mikhaeil (14th in 21:22.0) Addisyn Cichos (45th in 22:44.6) and Arabella Moore (109th in 24:41.4).

No. 9: Winners of their final match

Continuing with the theme that it wasn’t such a terrible fall sports season the Pequot Lakes Patriots girls tennis team repeated as Section 7-1A winners.

Top-seeded Pequot swept the singles portion of the section final to defeat No. 4 Pine City 5-2 Monday Oct. 12.

The Patriots’ other victory came at No. 1 singles where Afton Crocker and Morgan Lueck rallied from a first-set loss to win 1-6 7-5 7-6 (7-3) to help Pequot finish the season 13-0.

Pequot dispatched Duluth Marshall 7-0 in the section semifinals and ousted Aitkin 7-0 in the quarterfinals.

Pequot posted a perfect 10-0 regular-season record to help them win the Mid-State Conference title.

There was no individual tournament nor state tournament this season.

No. 10: Haeg signs on for a Super Bowl ring

Here’s hoping next year’s top story is the first Brainerd High School graduate to play in a Super Bowl.

Brainerd grad and former Indianapolis Colts offensive lineman Joe Haeg signed a one-year $2.3 million deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Friday March 20.

“I think a lot of things came into play with Tampa” Haeg said following the signing. “My former O-line coach Joe Gilbert who was with me for two years in Indianapolis he’s there now. They also provided an opportunity that I was excited about. Going into it I know they were interested in me. It all piled up with a perfect storm and I was very happy to end up with the Bucs.”

Joe Haeg

Haeg and the Bucs are 10-5 heading into the final week of the regular season. The Bucs have already clinched a Wild Card spot in the upcoming NFL postseason.

Haeg has played in 11 games for the Bucs and started three of those. In Tampa’s 47-7 victory over Detroit Dec. 26 Haeg played 17 offensive snaps and eight special teams plays.

In his five-year career the former North Dakota State University grad has played in 66 games with 38 starts.

You must have seen the black-and-white zebra stripes on everything from sugar packets to stationery and the readers that are used to detect them. But have you ever stopped to think how they work?

If you run a busy store you need to keep track of all the things you sell so you can make sure the ones your customers want to buy are at all times in stock. The simplest way of doing that is to walk around the shelves looking for empty spaces and simply restock where you need to.

Alternatively you could write down what people buy at the checkout make a list of all the purchases and then simply use that to record your stock. That’s fine for a small store but what if you’re running a big store with thousands of items on sale? If you mark all your items with their prices and you need to change the prices before you sell the goods you have to re-price everything. And what about shoplifting? If you see a lot of deodorant sprays missing from the shelves can you really be certain you’ve sold them all? How do you know if some have been stolen?

Using barcode technology in stores can help to solve all these problems. It lets you keep a centralised record on a computer system that tracks products prices and stock levels.

You can change prices as often as you like without having to put new price tags on all your bottles and boxes. This is why you see prices on the shelves rather than on the items in places like Game Uchumi or Shoprite. You can instantly see when stock levels of certain items are running low and reorder. Because barcode technology is very accurate you can be reasonably confident that any items that are missing (and don’t appear to have been sold) have probably been stolen or otherwise.

Question is how does this system work? Well there are three main parts including a central computer running a database (record system) that keeps a tally of all the products you’re selling who makes it what each one costs and how many you have in stock. Second there are the barcodes printed on all the products. Finally there are one or more checkout scanners that can read the barcodes.

A barcode is a really simple idea; give every item that you want to classify its own unique number and then simply print the number on the item so an electronic scanning device can read it.

You could simply print the number itself but the trouble with numbers is that they make it easy to make mistakes for instance a “6” could be a “9” when turned upside down. Barcodes solve this problem by having reliable way of printing numbers so that they can be read very accurately at high speeds.

Of course when you look at a barcode you probably can’t make head or tail of it but it’s simple. Each digit in the product number is given the same amount of horizontal space that is exactly seven units.

Then to represent any of the numbers from zero through nine each of the seven units is either white or black giving different patterns of black and white stripes. For example number one is represented by colouring in two white stripes two black stripes two white stripes and one black stripe while the number two is represented by two white stripes one black stripe two white stripes and two final black stripes and so on.

The process involved

When the barcode scanner reads the bar code using laser technology which is most popular it translates the bars into numbers or letters. It then sends that information into the computer or terminal or whatever device it is attached to.

In the case of a supermarket it would send the numbers to the central computer in the back office and ask the computer to send back the price and description information that corresponds to the code.

Barcode scanners may be completely handheld in which case they usually look almost like a science-fiction gun complete with a trigger to turn the scanner on or off. Game store does use this variety. Others may also be built into a surface such as a counter so that barcodes can be read by swiping them across.

Nakumatt and Uchumi use this type. Everything comes with its challenges for instance when you don’t have an emergency power plan in case of a power outage making a sale might become a huge task. Pricing issues can arise if a wrong price is input into the central database. Damaged labels are also problematic. the upfront cost might be prohibitive for some smaller businesses.

Nonetheless thanks to barcodes even tiny “supermarkets” can run as smoothly as the bigger stores these days.

Alternatives to the barcodes

RFID

Radio frequency identification (RFID) tags are microscopic programmable transponder tags that become activated when they come within range of an antenna that emits radio frequency signals. Active RFID tags require batteries for power.

Bokode

Bokodes are a barcode alternative designed by a team of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). With a diameter of a mere three millimeters bokodes work by placing an LED (Light-emitting diode) light behind a lens and a printed photomask. The desired information is printed on the photomask and readable with a standard cell phone camera from up to 12 feet away. Bokodes hold several thousand times the amount of information that a traditional barcode holds.

QR Codes

Quick response codes or QR Codes began in Japan where they have become popular. A QR code is a square image made of pixels. A cell phone loaded with a QR reader application can take a picture of the code and retrieve the embedded information. The information can include a web link contact information and can automatically send a free text message or dial an embedded phone number.

QR codes took another step forward with the release of Microsoft Tag. The Tag systems allows for customizable pixellated images to reflect the user’s personal style. Tag also allows business users to track analytic data about accesses to the business’ code.",,,,,,,,,,,,
