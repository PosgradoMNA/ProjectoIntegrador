ERLING HAALAND would already be a Manchester United player but for a mix up of time zones according to a new report.

The Borussia Dortmund striker is the most-sought after striker in Europe after a blistering year with the German giants.

The Red Devils Chelsea and Man City are just three of the big boys chasing his signature this summer - with suggestions the striker’s price tag has rocketed to £150m.

And that figure is reportedly an incredible 50 TIMES more than Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side could have got him for.

Everton are also one of the clubs that missed out on the Norwegian following a recommendation from Scandinavian scout and former Millwall keeper Bryan King.

But it will be United who are kicking themselves the most at not snapping up the ace two years ago when he joined Austrians Red Bull Salzburg.

Especially since boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer took Haaland from his hometown club Bryne and helped nurture his talents at Molde.

According to The Mirror ‘it had been arranged for a United representative to ring Haaland’s agent Jim Solbakken at 9am’ one day in order to finalise a £3m deal back in 2019.

However they claim Molde believed it would be 9am Norwegian time and when it did arrive it was 10am their time.

But by that time they had agreed a transfer fee with Salzburg who had rung at the agreed slot.

King told The Mirror: “It was just simply a lack of communication – a freak situation with no one to blame.

“Obviously looking back Everton will also be disappointed now.

“It’s going to cost anyone around £100m to buy him now.”

He added: “Over the last three years he has made tremendous strides. His finishing power is a lot like Harry Kane.

“When he gets it around the box Harry makes sure he rifles into the net. Erling is the same.

“He is an old fashioned centre forward who loves to score goals.

“I was surprised that no English club went in for him even at that young age. He looked an old English type centre-forward very powerful.”

New teaching and sports facilities for Amesbury secondary

Author: Henrietta Creasey Published 1st Mar 2021



An 'ambitious project' at the Stonehenge School has been given the green light after Wiltshire Council agreed to invest £3m into the scheme.

The major build at the Amesbury secondary will create a main assembly and exam hall activity studio drama classroom two music classrooms as well as several music practice rooms special educational needs (SEN) teaching and group rooms changing rooms and toilets.

The existing lower school block which is in poor condition and beyond economical repair will then be demolished.

The vacant space will then become an additional outdoor sports provision.

The project is in its second phase. Planning permission was secured in 2017 to replace the lower school block with two new blocks; the first was completed and occupied in 2019.

HRH Princess Anne officially opened the first extension which provided 24 new classrooms along with state of the art sporting facilities including a new 3G pitch.

COST OF SECOND PHASE

The total cost of new block and demolition of old one is £4.545m of which £1.545m comes from a Department for Education grant and £3m is council capital funding. Council leaders agreed the £3m investment at Full Council last week..

The new build will ensure the 920 pupil school will have a fit for purpose block accessible to all.

Work on the block could start early next year with completion by the summer of 2023.

Head Teacher Nigel Roper said:

“This is excellent news for the Amesbury community. The new build will complement our recent extension beautifully and create a highly cohesive school campus. The lower school block is in urgent need of replacement and once removed it will open up a large area for playing fields and sports facilities. The timing is perfect as the school will grow in size to more than 1000 pupils in the next two years.”

Cllr Laura Mayes Cabinet Member for Children Education and Skills said:

“We agreed to this important investment as we want our pupils to learn and play in an exciting stimulating school environment that complements great teaching and helps them to achieve their potential. I am so pleased the school can move forward with this important scheme for students.”

The president received private briefings from emergency officials and toured the Houston Food Bank with first lady Jill Biden before ending his roughly six-hour visit at NRG Stadium where a federal-state COVID-19 mass vaccination site opened this week with the goal of administering 6000 shots a day over the next two months via an 11-lane drive-thru clinic.

""Jill and I wanted to visit Texas today for a couple of reasons first and foremost to let Texas know our prayers are with you in the aftermath of this winter storm"" Biden said from a lectern set up in the stadium parking lot with a Federal Emergency Management Agency truck as the backdrop.

""We will be true partners to help you recover and rebuild from the storms and this pandemic and the economic crisis. We're in it for the long haul"" he said.

Biden said he wanted to see first-hand how Texas is recovering from powerful winter storms that left more than 4 million Texans without electricity many for days as temperatures plummeted into the single digits and wind chills fell below zero. More than 14 million Texas customers also lost water or were told to boil water for safe drinking.

""When a crisis hits our states like the one that hit Texas it's not a Republican or a Democrat who's hurting it's our fellow Americans who are hurting and it's our job to help everyone in need"" Biden said.

Biden also used the massive vaccination effort in Houston to encourage people to get COVID-19 shots. ""The vaccines are safe I promise you. They are safe and effective"" he said.

Fist bump with Abbott

Air Force One arrived at Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base shortly after noon. Exiting the plane holding the first lady's hand Biden headed straight to Gov. Greg Abbott sharing a fist bump and a few words while Texas first lady Cecilia Abbott handed a bouquet to Jill Biden.

The president then walked down the line to greet two Houston Democrats — sharing an elbow bump with U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee before moving on to U.S. Rep. Al Green who pulled out a cellphone to snap a photo of the president with Air Force One in the background.

Biden's first stop was the Harris County Emergency Operations Center for a private briefing with Abbott from federal state and county emergency officials in the wake of the disaster in which more than 1.4 million Houston residents lost power and 3.5 million customers were placed under boil water notices with 57000 still having to boil.

Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo welcomed Biden saying his support ""means the world to us.""

""This has been our home away from home for five months"" through a pandemic and then last week’s weather disaster Hidalgo said of the emergency operations center. ""These folks have been the tip of the spear when it comes to fighting for our community. They have been sleeping in the stairwells. … They were here every night last week.""

Biden offered praise. ""Hell of an operation here. It’s probably the best one in the country"" he said. ""You’re saving peoples’ lives. As my mother would say you’re doing God’s work.""

U.S. Sen John Cornyn R-Texas met Biden at the operations center telling reporters beforehand that he was pleased to welcome the president. ""The governor and Sen. Cruz and I asked for a declaration from the federal government which provides access to public and private assistance through FEMA. That’s going to be important for our recovery” Cornyn said.

U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz R-Texas was not in Houston speaking instead to the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando Fla.

Disaster declaration

Before Biden's arrival the White House added an additional 18 Texas counties to the president's disaster declaration raising the total to 126 counties where federal assistance can begin flowing to individuals.

Abbott said he will continue pressing to add all 254 counties to the disaster declaration and urged Texans to help in that effort by completing an assessment form available through the Texas Division of Emergency Management detailing winter storm damage.

Federal emergency officials said they are open to adding additional counties to the disaster declaration but Nim Kidd chief of the state emergency division said the ongoing recovery has kept many counties from collecting and reporting the necessary information.

""We have a lot of families and businesses and importantly schools that have not yet been able to submit their damage assessments to us"" Kidd said. ""We've got a long way to go. Mr. President I know we can get through this together and we've just got to keep going.""

Meantime Jill Biden's first stop was the Houston Food Bank where she arrived with Cecilia Abbott to applause from assembled volunteers and workers.

""We're here to help so put us to work"" Jill Biden shouted above the clapping.

Donning gloves behind a long row of metal tables Jill Biden was given instructions on how to bag food milk and other supplies for the food bank's federally funded senior box program before pitching in. Cecilia Abbott also filled boxes nearby.

The Bidens later reunited at the food bank where the president walked down aisles of towering shelves filled with food spoke individually with several volunteers and proclaimed the operation ""incredible.""

""It's absolutely amazing and we could do so much more"" President Biden told reporters standing nearby.

Deputy National Security Adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall said federal government assistance to Texans thus far has topped $9 million.

""Although we're encouraged by the progress that has been made and we're seeing the numbers come down dramatically right now in terms of who needs to still boil water in Texas we'll continue to look for ways to help through this next phase of recovery"" Sherwood-Randall said adding that the visit was intended to focus on the federal response to the crisis.

""Today is mostly going to be focused on hearing from the emergency responders in the FEMA operations center about what worked and take lessons away for future responses"" she told reporters aboard Air Force One while en route to Texas.

Sherwood-Randall added that the greatest immediate need for Texans is help in the recovery particularly for those who lack insurance.

According to White House press secretary Jen Psaki Biden had first conferred with FEMA officials about when it would be appropriate to visit Texas given that presidential trips are typically disruptive.

""It's important to him to hear directly from people on what their needs are"" Psaki said. ""He likes to see the details and likes to see things in person and he wants to see how the public is engaging and have those conversations.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzI3L2FtZXJpY2FzLXBvd2VyLWdyaWQtaXMtYnJva2VuLWhlcmVzLWhvdy10by1maXgtaXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,America's power grid is broken. Here's how to fix it,"Last week Texas was struck by a freakish winter storm one that left millions without electricity. Although much of the power grid has been restored there are still ongoing problems with the Texas infrastructure from plumbing issues to people struggling to find necessities like food and water. Yet the most immediate crisis was that Texas a state not accustomed to wintery weather left millions of people without heat in freezing temperatures. Texas public utilities at one point were less than five minutes away from a blackout that could have lasted weeks or months. Experts believe it will take months to fully calculate the death toll although so far nearly 80 deaths connected to the storm have been confirmed.

Republicans like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott have argued not surprisingly that the massive power outage somehow discredits left-wing policies. ""This shows how the Green New Deal would be a deadly deal for the United States of America"" Abbott told Fox News on Tuesday later adding that the problem was with ""[o]ur wind and our solar"" and claiming that it ""just shows that fossil fuel is necessary.""

Yet the reality about what went wrong and what can be done to prevent this kind of crisis experts agree is much more complicated. And it starts with understanding how our electricity grid works.

The American electrical grid which The Wall Street Journal described in 2016 as ""one of the engineering marvels of modern history"" can be traced back to the modern concept of power grid designs. Those in turn originated in the late 1800s according to Dr. Alexis Kwasinksi an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Pittsburgh's Swanson School of Engineering. The goal was to provide electricity to as many people as possible at the lowest possible cost.

""The solution for such a design problem led to the power grid concept in which a few large power plants provide electricity to many more but much smaller loads located sometimes hundred of miles away from the power plants"" Kwasinski told Salon by email. ""One of the solutions to maintain system stability was to interconnect power plants and loads so they operate at an aggregated level."" As a result of this interconnected approach the United States developed long transmission lines across the various states so that power could be transmitted across great distances with low losses.

One problem with this approach Kwasinski explained is that because everything is interconnected all of the different loads receive the same quality of power. As a result it is expensive to alter power grids so that power can be allocated according to the needs of individual locations in ways that can prevent power outages or prioritize regions that have more urgent needs.

Kwasinski says that resilience was not an objective in designing power grids — at least not until now. ""It is only recently that society [has] started to demand higher power grid resilience"" he rued.

The problem is originally power grids were designed to meet the needs of the early 1900s. Even more modern power systems are planned decades in advance meaning that Texas' existing power grid is the result of planning processes made decades ago Kwasinski says.

""At that time (let's say in 2011) no planner knew that in February 2021 the state's power grid would be subject to such cold conditions even when there were brownouts during the winter of 2011 because of insufficient power generation"" he added. Texan engineers were thinking understandably that they needed to design with heat waves in mind not the kinds of winter storms you'd be more likely to encounter in the northeast.

Dr. Masoud Barati who is also an assistant professor at Pittsburgh's electrical and computer engineering department broke down for Salon exactly how things went wrong in Texas. He explained it within the context of the HVDC line or high-voltage direct current and what the primary operation of the existing HVDC was in Texas' Electric Reliability Council (ERCOT). He explained that in the Texas blackout there were five HVDC interconnections that ultimately amounted to 1.1 GW of ""tie-line capacity as interconnection with other neighbors states and countries."" This proved insufficient for two reasons: First ""the winter peak load recorded by ERCOT was 69150 MW and 34 GW loss of thermal and renewable generation resources"" meaning that ""the 1.1 GW HVDC cannot support the significant generation loss and load.""

In addition because Texas' neighbors were hit by the same storm and either almost maxed out their ability to generate energy or found that the amount of electricity generated was less than the amount demanded because most Texas homes used that electricity for heating.

Ironically although Gov. Abbott tried to argue that the winter storm and blackout somehow discredited a Green New Deal it in fact illustrated precisely why we need one.

""From a Green New Deal perspective we would want to have public utilities that prioritize public safety and resiliency and disaster readiness over the optimal price in a perfect market equilibrium situation and really nice weather so I think that's an important distinction"" Daniel Aldana Cohen associate professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of ""A Planet to Win: Why We Need a Green Deal"" told Salon. After noting that the Texas power grid is deregulated and therefore undemocratic — ""you don't have a clear line of accountability in the way that you should have with a public system"" — Cohen argued that the solution to issues of energy inefficiency as presented in his book is a national power grid.

""You would have a single national grid very robustly interconnected"" Cohen explained. ""That would mean a grid dominated by renewable energy sources like wind and solar. By virtue of having that full national interconnection when there is less energy or no energy in one region of the country you can shoot energy down there from other regions.""

For instance in the case of events like the winter storm in Texas a national energy grid would have allowed public authorities to divert energy that's been stored elsewhere in the national system so that it could have been diverted where it was most needed. When it comes to disaster resiliency like extreme weather events a national power grid would ""essentially mean that there is like a national solidarity of energy that covers the whole country instead of having a big region that has to fend for itself.""

Cohen also warned that if a Green New Deal is not implemented we could wind up with ""a kind of eco-apartheid situation where largely white largely affluent people can basically hoard solar panels and batteries and resiliency at the expense of a fully egalitarian system where literally every single home and community is guaranteed safety and reliability.""

Barati offered a somewhat different set of suggestions to Salon.

""If only Texas had stronger connections to the rest of the U.S. with HVDC and HVAC [High Voltage Alternating Current] lines they would have been fine"" Barati wrote. He also pointed out that ""if only appropriate reliability planning were performed taking into account the coordinated transmission line expansion and generation planning subject to rare and common-mode events Texas would have had appropriate generation reserves."" In addition he observed that ""Texas has an energy-only market which means that it is vulnerable to rare events. If only Texas had a properly functioning capacity market for both generation and transmission sides they would have had enough spare transmission and generation capacity to deal with the shortages.""

Regardless of what solution you prefer one thing is likely: Because of climate change we should expect to see more extreme weather in areas not accustomed to it from the West Coast wildfires to the Texas winter storm.

""The way is through the changes in the environment that have occurred from climate change"" Dr. Kevin Trenberth a distinguished scholar at the National Center for Atmospheric Research wrote to Salon when asked about the potential role of climate change in the Texas winter storm. ""These include generally warmer conditions including much warmer oceans higher sea surface temperatures reduced sea ice and glaciers and higher water vapor in the atmosphere."" Trenberth noted that the extra available energy accelerated the water cycle leading to more evaporation and heavier rains.

Instead he fell in love with Daytona Beach.

In 1975 Brewer helped his family move their successful jewelry business to the ""World’s Most Famous Beach."" More than 45 years later Brewer and his mother Chris Evans still showcase diamonds gold antique and period treasures at Evans & Son Fine Jewelers a Beach Street fixture for decades.

“I always believed in Daytona Beach for over 50 years now” said Brewer 68 seated behind a glass display case filled with gleaming bracelets rings and other unique trinkets. “I always loved downtown. I always felt that it was an iconic place waiting to happen.”

And although Brewer changed course from his pilot aspirations the jewelry business also has taken the family all over the world in search of unique pieces from Shanghai London Paris Milan Rome and Tibet as well as gem dealer shows in New York Los Angeles Chicago and Miami.

“Our inventory spans the 1800s through the 1930s ‘40s and ‘50s right up to modern things” Brewer said. “It’s all unique and hand-picked which is almost a lost art now. It’s labor intensive to pick out the few things that fit into our look.”

Entering the cozy shop in a two-story building the family owns at 250 S. Beach Street is like stepping into a time capsule. The shop moved to Beach Street in 1983 after its initial years nearby on U.S. Highway 92.

Big-band music of the 1940s offers quiet accompaniment that complements the inventory of antique and period pieces representing Victorian Edwardian Art Nouveau Art Deco and Retro eras from the 1800s to the 1940s.

“I always loved vintage things whether it’s design furniture rugs or jewelry” Brewer said. “We always loved that vintage feel.”

Behind the counter Brewer’s mother beckons a visitor to examine a small Japanese Art Nouveau mirror running her fingers around the gently curved edges to point out a floral design.

“This is from the 1920s” she said. “It’s fabulous.”

'Something that's handmade'

At 90 Evans is still a kinetic presence a gregarious talker about anything from diamonds and gold to the experiences that the business has opened to her.

On a nearby table a Czechoslovakian table lamp from the 1930s emits a soft glow through glass intricately shaped into the design of a brightly colored bird sitting amid clusters of grape vines.

For Evans the piece is a link to her connection with famed designer and socialite Gloria Vanderbilt who used to shop at Evans’ booth at jewelry shows in New York.

“She was a collector of lamps and she said ‘Oh Chris if you ever get one of those lamps I want one'” Evans said. In the back of the shop Evans keeps a treasured memento: Vanderbilt’s hand-written note offering the address to her New York apartment where they visited from time to time.

“That’s how I met Gloria; she came to the booth” Evans said. “She was the nicest woman; she was amazing.”

A moment later she’s pointing out another favorite piece in a display case an ivory and coral charm bracelet made in the 1940s. She puts it on her wrist for a moment where it competes for attention with roughly a dozen gold bracelets already there.

“I don’t like just one little thing” she said chuckling.

Although the shop does handle its share of big-ticket “six-figure” items there’s an emphasis on offering unique pieces starting as low as $25 or $50 Brewer said.

“If you spend $50 on something from Tibet for instance it will be something that’s handmade that you can’t find anywhere else” Brewer said “something that we’ve traveled hundreds of miles to obtain.”

'Something special for you'

That approach has earned the loyalty of customers such as Jeroen Reidel 47 a management consultant from Ormond Beach.

Reidel has been shopping at Evans & Son for nearly 20 years since making his first major purchase of a Rolex watch there.

“They are both very welcoming” he said of the mother-and-son duo. ”They always walked me through every step of the process.”

About two years ago Reidel approached Brewer with a tall order: Replacing a custom bracelet that his father had given him many years ago.

“It was a two-toned yellow and white gold bracelet” he said. “Unfortunately it was stolen and for years I had been looking for something similar. I could never find it. I described it to Al and he called me up a month later and said ‘I have something special for you.’

“He had a custom jeweler in New York that recreated the bracelet that my father gave me. It was completely spot-on and probably something no other jewelry store in town could match.”

For Bonnie Roberts another longtime customer a purchase from Evans & Son has become a ritual for major family milestones.

The list includes her engagement ring her husband’s wedding band and a set of pearl and diamond earrings that their daughter wore at her wedding Roberts said.

“So it’s a bit of a tradition” said Roberts who lives in Port Orange with her husband Kevin Molzahn. “Over the years we’ve bought a number of pieces from Al. I love a lot of the unusual pieces that they bring into the shop.”

Another customer Bonnie Hosey of New Smyrna Beach has bought everything from wedding rings to earrings for her daughter’s 16th birthday at the shop over the past two decades.

“It’s a lot of fun when you go in there” said Hosey 58. “There are always things to look at.”

In the wake of the city’s $4 million streetscape project on Beach Street and the reopening of the Orange Avenue bridge after its $47 million renovation Brewer said that he is seeing more locals in the shop.

“Today seven out of 10 customers are locals and it used to be the other way around” he said. “The combination of the bridge opening and the new wider sidewalk and the park that’s coming is all having an immediate effect.”

Brewer envisions Evans & Sons enduring to enjoy a business revival on Beach Street.

“You have to find your own niche your own working model of what your passion is and then hope your customers want to be a part of it” Brewer said.

“We love being surrounded by design and art and beautiful things constantly and the depth of knowledge that it takes to be in that world. The bonus is that we had friends neighbors and customers who wanted to go on that journey with us.”

DEL MAR Calif. — Another bluff collapsed Sunday in Del Mar about a half of mile from Carmel Valley Road. Fortunately no one was reported injured. This is not something unusual in a coastal area but it is a reminder of just how dangerous walking along the coast can be.

There weren’t very many people on the beach Sunday morning but state park officials still followed their normal procedures to be sure everyone was safe.

Some say the San Diego coastline is one of the most beautiful in the country but experts like Dr. Pat Abbott a geologist says mother nature can also make walking along those beach cliffs dangerous.

“That’s just old sand old muds that are compacted together. Now the sea waves have cut away at it and made a steep cliff. The waves still hit on it gravity pulls on it rainwater irrigation water flows through it. It’s bound to fail” Abbott said.

On Sunday State Park officials say part of this bluff collapsed just after 10 a.m. in Del Mar. Rescue dogs were brought to the area and fortunately they didn’t detect that anyone was trapped underneath.

“We were just walking along and all of sudden we noticed that huge wall of dirt. We realized that’s where that concrete wall used to be” said Joanna Schwend who was walking on the beach.

“When you go for those beach walks do not walk along the cliffs. Walk as close to the water line as you can because had people been caught under that we’d be looking at fatalities now” Abbott said.

Dr. Abbott said this is just a good time to remember that when you’re on the beach to be aware of your surroundings because these bluffs can collapse at any time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9vaGlvL25hbWUvc2ViYXN0aWFuLXNwZW5jZXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NzYzNDY2MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sebastian Spencer Obituary (2000 - 2021) - Green OH - Akron Beacon Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/ohio/name/sebastian-spencer-obituary?id=7634660 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9vaGlvL25hbWUvc2ViYXN0aWFuLXNwZW5jZXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NzYzNDY2MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

February 28 2021

We're catching up with Tepper School alumna Sonia Hingorany.

Hingorany is the founder and creator of myMicrojourney an app that serves as a personalized career masterclass by offering a catalog of videos chronicling professional stories and experiences. She shares about her journey to the Tepper School and the story behind MyMicrojourney.

What brought you to the Tepper School?

After spending half a decade at Accenture and the last two of those five years traveling heavily I decided to pivot my career out of consulting. I had always wanted to go back to school and thought it was the right time to take that step.

As I started to think about the types of problems I really enjoyed working on thus far in my career I realized they all led back to where business technology and operations meet and Tepper was a great fit for that. I was also keen on expanding my network and thought business school would be a great place to do so especially at a world-renowned technical institution.

Please tell us about your path to create the MyMicrojourney app.

I have always been passionate about trying to help individuals navigate their career paths especially in the STEM fields.

Growing up I struggled to navigate my own path. Admittedly I still struggle. I studied Electrical Engineering at UCLA and so many doors opened for me which is a good problem to have but it made it that much harder to narrow down my next steps. As I continue to talk to students and junior professionals I have found they continue to encounter the same challenges: they don't have enough people to seek advice from and they don't know how to connect with people that have explored different career paths and still landed on their feet.

A few years after I graduated from the Tepper School during the summer of 2020 I started to develop a platform to serve as a personalized careers masterclass. MyMicrojourney gives people access to a catalog of videos that chronicle professional stories and experiences.

Users can watch videos of professionals in a given field who share their career path how they have navigated the challenges along the way. For the individuals sharing their experiences it is an opportunity to give back and share their own unique path and brand with the world. I believe in brokering meaningful connections between individuals and I also believe that everyone's microjourney can inspire and influence another.

How does the app work?

MyMicrojourney features a variety of microjourneys which are defined as short videos showcasing the highlights and lowlights of an individual's professional experience giving just the right amount of insight and detail to send a meaningful message to their audience. Users will receive curated microjourneys that align with their unique professional profiles and will have the ability to connect with these individuals to take a conversation further if interested.

What makes it unique?

Hearing not just the highlights of one's career but also how they made it through the challenging times is critical. When we talk about our careers and share resumes we tend to focus on all the positive things and not necessarily on the experiences that ultimately led to those positive outcomes. They can be more important than the actual outcome.

How did your time at Tepper influence your leadership today?

My time at Tepper greatly influenced my leadership today. Learning how to collaborate and lead groups with individuals that had such diverse backgrounds was truly enlightening. I learned one of the most critical skills in becoming an impactful leader during my time at Tepper which was how to get alignment among individuals that bring different perspectives to the table.

Has the pandemic accelerated your business or the opposite?

I attribute starting my business to the pandemic truthfully. I spent a lot of time this summer thinking about how people want to interact in this new normal and that's how I landed on asynchronous communication and content. Users can view the microjourney videos as they wish. There is no pressure or timeline to connect. If they want to take the interaction further they can. It's hard to say for sure but I may have never landed on an idea of short videos to help people connect if it wasn't for the Zoom fatigue we’ve all suffered.

How does your project support diversity and inclusion?

One of the features of MyMicrojourney is that it connects individuals based on their profiles and career aspirations taking into consideration a variety of data points to make these connections. Because of the way the platform is designed it supports diversity and inclusion as it looks to make these connections.

Do you have any advice to share with future business leaders?

My advice is to focus on your journey as much as you focus on the outcome. The journey is what shapes us. It's what builds our confidence it helps round out our thoughts it picks us up after we made the mistake. The more you can do that and enjoy it I believe the more satisfying the outcome ends up being.

Is there anything else you would like readers to know about you/ your app /your time at the Tepper School?

If you're interested in sharing your microjourney please fill out the form! This is an opportunity to share your professional story with the world with the intent of helping students and younger professionals in navigating their first steps as they embark upon their own professional journeys.

I always welcome all and any thoughts about MyMicrojourney.

These con artists found themselves in the dock after they tried to pocket cash by cheating others.

They have all been involved in fraud - some of them were in trusted positions when they carried out their crimes and have been locked up for their antics or are facing a spell behind bars.

Here we have rounded-up a number of court cases covered by ChronicleLive that show how offenders have tried to cheat others out of cash.

They include a team of fraudsters who with the help of a bank insider fleeced businesses in Newcastle and Gateshead and a cruel gang who conned an elderly man twice.

In another case a trusted worker pocketed more than £28000 by fraudulently claiming expenses from his employer.

Team of conmen including bank insider fleeced businesses out of £90000

A bank inside man provided customer account details to a team of conmen who fraudulently obtained thousands of pounds of goods - including a jet ski luxury watches expensive jewellery and a cat suit.

Bilal Abbas betrayed his position of trust at Santander by passing on details of a series of customers to Umair Memon for him and Jordan Hamilton-Thomas to use as part of a sustained scam.

Companies in Newcastle Gateshead and around the country were targeted by the fraudsters who bought items using the card details of unsuspecting bank customers.

(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)

Newcastle Crown Court heard the £90000 fraud left businesses who were later told the transactions had been fraudulent out of pocket and those who had their details stolen were left feeling stressed and inconvenienced.

Police said pictures were seized from fraudster’s phones that showed them enjoying extravagant holidays and showing off expensive jewellery funded by their scam.

The trio who may have been working with others were jailed after admitting conspiracy to defraud between 2017 and 2019.

Abbas was jailed for two years Memon was jailed for 27 months and Hamilton-Thomas was jailed for 26 months. Here's the full story.

Employee pocketed more than £28000 by fraudulently claiming expenses

A trusted worker pocketed more than £28000 by fraudulently claiming expenses from his employer.

Paul Fitch submitted false receipts to claim the expenses from his bosses at technology firm Accenture over a nine-month period.

But the 42-year-old's deceit was finally exposed after an investigation was launched and he was arrested.

(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)

Fitch of Cloverfield in West Allotment is facing a jail sentence after he pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation during a hearing at North Tyneside Magistrates' Court.

The prosecutor said Fitch worked for Accenture in Newcastle at the time of the offences between December 2017 and September 2018.

The defendant is due to attend Newcastle Crown Court for sentence on March 2. Here is the full court report.

Gang fleeced 86-year-old for roofing work then conned him again by posing as trading standards

A cruel gang of conmen fleeced an elderly man twice - first by charging extortionate rates for roofing work then by posing as trading standards investigating the scam.

The 86-year-old needed some work carried out at his home after high winds left it in a dangerous state.

Rogue builders persuaded him to pay significant sums far in excess of the value of the work.

To compound the pensioner's misery a member of the gang then phoned him posing as someone called Inspector Green from trading standards.

He spun a yarn about investigating cowboy builders and tricked the victim into handing over a further £20000.

Connor Hudson 22 of Barnes Road Murton County Durham who allowed the money to be laundered through his bank account has been given a suspended prison sentence.

Hudson who has five previous convictions claimed he acted under duress from the gang but was convicted of being in possession of £395 of criminal property and transferring £20404 of criminal property following a trial by magistrates. Read the full story here.

Rogue builder pocketed customers' deposits but failed to do the work

(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)

Rogue builder David Wilkinson pocketed cash from customers for work then didn't bother carrying it out.

The conman who traded as DM Plastering and Building Supplies accepted deposits for jobs then came up with excuses when frustrated customers asked when the work would be done.

The 29-year-old continued taking victims' cash even after he had been caught once and released on bail.

At Newcastle Crown Court prosecutor Joe Hedworth said when one mum made repeated attempts to get her money back from Wilkinson she was warned she would be ""done for harassment"" if she kept trying.

The court heard victims who said they had trusted the tradesman as he was a ""local lad"" were left feeling ""completely let down"" ""taken advantage of"" ""very angry"" and ""very upset"".

Wilkinson of Prescot Road Sunderland admitted five charges of fraud. He was given seven months imprisonment suspended for 18 months with 150 hours unpaid work and an order to pay back all of the money he took.

The judge said an immediate jail term would impact on Wilkinson's partner and children and he would be given ""one opportunity"" to put his family first.

Helen Towers defending said Wilkinson had been conducting a ""legitimate business"" but had not appreciated the financial and other pressures associated with it.

Miss Towers said Wilkinson did not target any victims but had ""buried his head in the sand"" and wants to pay back all of the money that customers lost. The full story is here.

Mum stole more than £25000 from her motor trade employer in customer refund scam

A scheming mum who stole more than £25000 from her employer in a refund scam was spared prison.

Tracy Griffin abused her trusted position on Vertu Motors Plc's administration team to divert cash so she could pay off debts.

Newcastle Crown Court heard the con was exposed when a customer complained that a refund they had been expecting from a service plan had not appeared in their bank.

Prosecutor Marc Atkins told the court: ""She was asked about this at which point she disclosed she had changed the customer's bank details to those of her eight-year-old son. Following her disclosure all of her transactions were audited.

""On 68 occasions between June 4 2015 and May 2 2017 the defendant had paid refunds totalling £25377 into accounts belonging to herself her children and her ex-husband. She had also paid refunds directly to her bank card.""

Griffin 48 of Centenary Avenue South Shields admitted fraud by false representation.

Judge Advocate Edward Legard sentenced her to 12 months imprisonment suspended for 18 months with 200 hours unpaid work. Here's the full story.

Insurance claims handler exploited system weakness to plunder £136000 to fund gambling habit

(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)

A trusted senior claims handler at an insurance firm exploited weaknesses in the system to systematically plunder £136000 to bankroll his gambling habit.

Damien McMenzie abused his position at Tesco Underwriting to make 51 fraudulent transactions into his own account.

The 36-year-old who had worked there since 2011 was based at Quorum Business Park in North Tyneside dealing with customers who made insurance claims and he was also responsible for training other claims handlers.

But behind the veneer of respectability he had been stealing for years.

Ian West prosecuting told Newcastle Crown Court : ""For about four years between May 2015 and July 2019 days before he resigned his post the defendant engaged in systematic fraud on his employer.""

When he was interviewed by police McMenzie said he got into debt due to his gambling addiction.

McMenzie of Weetslade Crescent Dudley North Tyneside pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of position and was sentenced to two years suspended for two years. Read the full story here.

Builder jailed after scamming thousands of pounds out of customers

(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)

A builder who defrauded customers out of thousands of pounds was jailed for 12 months.

Paul Phillips 64 of Brackenfield Road Framwellgate Moor appeared at Durham Crown Court after Durham County Council’s Trading Standards team took legal action against him.

In June 2019 a customer contacted Phillips about repairs to his shed roof and arranged a date in July that year the court heard.

Phillips contacted the customer and offered to sell them a new shed that had become available and quoted £1250 for the sale and installation.

However on the date the shed was to be delivered the customer received another call to say Phillips’ mother had died overnight and someone else would be organised to deliver and install the shed in his place.

After the shed never arrived the customer requested a refund and they were refused.

In an interview with Trading Standards officers Phillips admitted that he had not ordered a shed and had lied to the customer about this.

In August the same year another customer had contacted Phillips about a single-storey extension to their home in Hartlepool.

Phillips visited the property and quoted £17800 which was reduced to £15000 and a fee of £640 for building control. During the discussion it was agreed that the works be completed by Christmas.

The following September Phillips advised that building control approval had been granted but failed to provide documentation despite a request.

Phillips also did not work on the extension and his son worked on the site in his absence from October 2019.

After it became apparent the work was not progressing as agreed Phillips provided the customer with a number of reasons for the lack of progress but guaranteed the work would be concluded by December 1 2019.

By December 19 the work had still not been completed.

The customer arranged for a building inspector who attended the property on December 23 and advised that the works were not authorised and the structure had to be taken down to damp-proof level.

To mute retweets from an account you'll need to head to that account's profile and click ""Turn off retweets.""

It's easy enough to get lost in an endless scroll through your Twitter feed without having to sift through tweets from people you don't even follow. Yes we're talking about the retweet.

Retweeting lets you repost someone else's tweet onto your own profile. It's great for sharing tweets that you love.

But if someone you follow retweets everything in sight - and not much of it is interesting - you can mute their retweets so you only see original content. Just note that you can't turn off all retweets at once; instead you'll need to mute each account individually.

Here's how to turn off retweets from accounts you follow using Twitter's desktop website or app.

How to turn off Twitter retweets on desktop

Log into Twitter. Navigate to the profile of the account you'd like to stop seeing retweets from. Click the circular icon with three horizontal dots to the right of their profile picture. Select the first option in this menu labeled ""Turn off Retweets.""

The ocean current that brings warm water and shapes weather patterns from the Gulf of Mexico to Europe is slowing down in an unprecedented way say scientists.

Since the 1950s the current has slowed by about 15 percent. Experts warn that by 2100 the Gulf Stream System will weaken further by 34 to 45 percent becoming dangerously close to the tipping point at which the flow becomes unstable. If this happens the U.S. east coast will face dangerously rising sea levels. Western Europe would also be plunged into a deep freeze in winters with brutal ice storms and the average temperature dropping by 10 degrees Celsius. Summers would be scorching hot warn scientists.

For the study researchers from Ireland Britain and Germany mapped the history of the Gulf Stream System also known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) from proxy data like ocean sediments and ice cores.

“The Gulf Stream System works like a giant conveyor belt carrying warm surface water from the equator up north and sending cold low-salinity deep water back down south” says co-author Stefan Rahmstorf a professor from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in a statement. “It moves nearly 20 million cubic meters of water per second almost a hundred times the Amazon flow. For the first time we have combined a range of previous studies and found they provide a consistent picture of the AMOC evolution over the past 1600 years.

“The study results suggest that it has been relatively stable until the late 19th century” he adds. “With the end of the little ice age in about 1850 the ocean currents began to decline with a second more drastic decline following since the mid-20th century.”

Statistician Dr. Niamh Cahill from Maynooth University in Ireland tested the data and found the weakness in the Gulf Stream System to be significant. “Assuming that the processes measured in proxy records reflect changes in AMOC they provide a consistent picture despite the different locations and time scales represented in the data” she explains. “The AMOC has weakened unprecedentedly in over 1000 years.”

So why will a slowing system lead to dangerous sea levels?

“The northward surface flow of the AMOC leads to a deflection of water masses to the right away from the US east coast” explains Dr. Levke Caesar part of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Unit at Maynooth University. “This is due to Earth’s rotation that diverts moving objects such as currents to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. As the current slows down this effect weakens and more water can pile up at the US east coast leading to an enhanced sea-level rise.”

The study is published in Nature Geoscience.

Last year Taylor Swift and her British boyfriend Joe Alwyn had their first real public date night at the 2020 Golden Globes. The private couple then of three years had deliberately avoided being filmed at award show ceremonies together despite Alwyn and Swift nominated for their acting and music work respectively. At most they would attend after-parties together; even then they never posed on the carpet alongside each other.

Will tonight bring Swift and Alwyn's second award show date night? Not this time. Neither Swift nor Alwyn are attending tonight's bicoastal Golden Globes ceremony. Neither are presenters and neither are nominated for their work so they have no reason to be there. (There is no documentary category at the Golden Globes so Netflix's Taylor Swift documentary Miss Americana wasn't eligible for any awards.)

Due to the coronavirus pandemic too this year's Golden Globes are far from typical—and won't have a full celebrity audience. After parties won't be happening anywhere near the scale of previous years so Swift and Alwyn making a surprise appearance at one of those isn't likely either.

The couple instead will maintain the private life they've had for most of the coronavirus pandemic. While their exact whereabouts are currently unknown the couple likely isn't even in Los Angeles or New York. Swift and Alwyn were last seen in London in mid-January 2021. That outing was the first time in nearly a year since Swift and Alwyn were photographed outside together.

Swift recently gave Alwyn a shoutout in a February 2021 interview with Vanity Fair crediting her boyfriend for helping her find the courage to speak up about politics more.

“As a country musician I was always told it’s better to stay out of [politics]” Swift started. “The Trump presidency forced me to lean in and educate myself. I found myself talking about government and the presidency and policy with my boyfriend who supported me in speaking out. I started talking to my family and friends about politics and learning as much as I could about where I stand. I’m proud to have moved past fear and self-doubt and to endorse and support leadership that moves us beyond this divisive heartbreaking moment in time.”

Every year the Golden Globes appoint an ambassador to hand out trophies to the winners and escort them off the stage. Some years they'll appoint more than one (usually siblings). They're almost always young and have famous parents. This year Satchel Lee and her brother Jackson Lee will hold the honor! Their parents are of course award-winning filmmaker Spike Lee and producer Tonya Lewis Lee.

Photo credit: Peter Kramer/NBC - Getty Images

But who is Satchel Lee exactly? Well here's everything you need to know about the ambassador.

She looks up to her parents.

Spike Lee is known for directing and producing films that explore race politics colorism and other social issues. Tonya Lewis Lee is immersed in creating media catered to young people. Satchel spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about her relationship with both of them.

""Our father has always told us to do what we want and not really listen to what anybody else thinks—including him and my mother which then becomes somewhat of a Catch-22 but the advice is still good"" she said. ""And our mom's always been about teaching me to look out for myself which is probably the most important lesson you can teach someone.""

She's an LGBTQ+ activist.

Satchel identifies as bisexual and is passionate about advocating for the LGBTQ+ community. She's also the first openly out Golden Globe Ambassador. She told Out magazine that she partnered with NYC-based organization Callen-Lorde to ""do something that was around healthcare"" for the queer community.

""They provide full comprehensive health care to over 18000 patients a year and that’s done regardless of their ability to pay"" she explained. ""It’s a lifesaving organization. After the year we just had I have so much more respect and understanding for doctors and nurses and healthcare providers."" Callen-Lorde will receive a $25000 grant from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association due to Satchel being an ambassador.

She's close with her brother.

Since Satchel and Jackson will both be Golden Globe Ambassadors this year it only makes sense that they'd be close. Past ambassadors have gone on to act and model and Jackson wants to pursue creative films.

""At first I kind of pigeonholed myself to photography... But having a father who's in multiple mediums—he does film sneakers clothing—showed me I don't have to do just one thing"" he told THR. When it comes to the charity he's supporting as an ambassador he chose Big Brothers Big Sisters ""because of their work mentoring young creatives especially young people of color.""

The 2021 Golden Globes air at 8 p.m. EST on NBC.

Jill Zarin is remembering her late husband Bobby Zarin on what would have been his 75th birthday.

On Saturday the former Real Housewives of New York City star dedicated a touching tribute to Bobby who died on Jan. 13 2018 at the age of 71 following a prolonged cancer battle.

""There is no rule book on what is 'appropriate' when it comes to the heart"" Zarin 57 wrote. ""I asked myself.... is it ok to keep posting about Bobby? Celebrating his birthday? Our anniversary? A particular day he is on my mind?""

""I asked Gary"" she added referring to boyfriend Gary Brody. ""He said 'of course it is. Whatever you feel is right…' Today Bobby would have been 75.""

Alongside the caption Zarin posted a video of Bobby giving a speech to friends at his last birthday celebration — his 70th — in Las Vegas.

""To everybody in this room: my gift is the pleasure of your company. Everybody in this room is really special to me"" Bobby said in the clip. ""I couldn't have picked a better group of fun people to celebrate my birthday.""

In her caption Zarin said that at the time her late husband ""knew his birthdays were numbered.""

""I wanted to celebrate everything for Bobby the last few years and turning 70 was no exception"" the Bravo star wrote. ""He felt great but knew his birthdays were numbered. 2 weeks before I called our friends to celebrate with us in Vegas.""

The mom of one continued ""Bobby's nickname was Bobby Vegas to those who knew him well. He spent many years there from the 1970's and was treated like a king. Wherever we stayed they rolled out the red carpet. Limo suite dinners and shows. He knew how to have fun fun fun. I don't think Vegas will be the same for any of us without him.""

""Happy Birthday Bobby baby"" Zarin concluded. ""In Heaven ... remember you always played 27! I'm with Monique and Brian this weekend for his 50th and we all miss you terribly. I will give him your toast tonight..

But he became one of America's most famous painters – not only for his creativity but for his positivity.

""We don't make mistakes; we have happy accidents"" he told his audience.

It was like watching a magician reveal the secret of his trade.

""Look at that. Isn't that a nice little tree?""

But at the height of his fame at only 52 Bob Ross died of lymphoma. That was 26 years ago. And yet the ""happy little painter"" is perhaps more relevant now than ever.

""We've been in a time when things have been so frantic and people have been so stressed and Bob Ross is the King of Chill"" said Jessica Jenkins.

But what many may not know is that when Ross came into our homes all those years ago he did it from a home in Muncie Indiana.

""Nobody really thinks about where the show was made"" said correspondent Lee Cowan.

""So many people are surprised they walk in and they're like 'This is not a TV studio this is a living room!' Yeah it's a living room!"" laughed Jenkins who is a curator of that living room – what is now the Bob Ross Experience at Muncie's Minnestrisa museum.

This very spot is where for years ""The Joy of Painting"" was taped. His paint brushes his palette and of course his easel are here.

""Every episode he would have a moment where he would beat the devil out of the brush – he would take it and be just thump thump thump thump thump"" said Jenkins. ""People come in and they recognize that [spot where the brushes were beaten] and they know exactly what that is.""

Yes the trees DO look happy. / Credit: Bob Ross

But why Muncie? Because this was the home of the local PBS station WIPB. Traveling through the Midwest on a teaching tour Ross approached the station with the idea of teaching in front of a camera.

Cowan said ""He was an unknown painter though at the time I mean nobody knew who Bob Ross was.""

""They did not know who he was but he had a lot of charm"" Jenkins said.

Jim Needham was WIPB's general manager and he knew Ross had something. ""His mantra was 'I'll never do anything harder than my audience is able also to do.'""

""It really wasn't just about painting; the show was about a lot more than that"" Cowan said.

Needham said ""I think the show was about giving a person agency and doing what they want to do or something they were afraid to do. And I'm not talking about painting. I'm talking about life.""

Ross practiced his TV paintings for days making sure that he could complete them in front of the cameras in less than a half an hour. Jenkins said ""He was very planned out and very methodical.""

""But it sure didn't come off that way"" Cowan said. ""It came off very spontaneous and calm. It wasn't like he was racing through it!""

""That's the thing about Bob: You know that on the inside he was on a speed clock getting through that painting but on the outside he was just so relaxed and made it look so easy.""

Part of the Bob Ross Experience is trying your hand at painting. For certified Bob Ross instructor Doug Hallgren the discovery that anyone can do it is the real joy of painting.

""Sometimes we grab their hand and say 'It's going to be okay we're going to do this together just trust me on this' and they're like 'Oh it worked!'"" Hallgren said.

It was a remarkable ego boost for everyone here. One young guest Elia said ""After sitting down and painting a painting I really believe I could do anything!""

Ross' simplicity though often brought criticism. The art world had mixed reviews of him said Jenkins: ""There were certainly a lot of people who categorized him at kitsch art. But if you look at the canvasses that Bob did on his own time for himself they are complex.""

Like this elaborate seascape that hung in his own home:

Hallgren said ""The later he got on in years those paintings just got sharper and sharper and sharper.""

Ross rarely made a dime off any of his paintings and never expected any of his works to ever hang in a museum. But recently the Smithsonian acquired four Bob Ross paintings to add to its permanent collection.

In that at least the man who just wanted to paint a happy little world has cemented his place in it as well.

Jenkins said ""The message of having self-confidence of trying new things – that doesn't get old. And because of that I think that it just continues to resonate for generation after generation.""

Click to skip ahead and see Chuck Akre's Top 5 Stock Holdings.

Akre Capital Management LLC founded in 1989 by Chuck Akre is an asset management firm with approximately $15.7 billion in private investments mutual funds and separately managed account assets.

Akre Capital Management's investment approach to choosing the potential pick is based on a ""three-legged stool"":

1. Strong business with a sustainable competitive advantage; 2. Exceptional management team; 3. Pattern of disciplined reinvestment.

These three factors qualify companies to be among Akre's investment opportunities and he refers to those companies as ""compounding machines"". Chuck differs from other asset managers in at least two important ways:

First when he buys a security he does not look on the exit point; He looks to compound the capital invested over a long term horizon.

Second Chuck benefits from the opportunity created in Wall Street through what he calls: ""beat by a penny miss by a penny"" syndrome. With a time frame ranged between five to ten years he grab the opportunities created through quarterly ""misses"".

Charles Akre Akre Capital Management

Charles Akre of Akre Capital Management

Akre Capital's Akre Focus Fund managed to outperform the S&P 500 Index by 3.5 percentage points annually between its inception in 2009 and March 2020. So if you are an investor in a dumb passive index fund you should consider investing in Akre's fund instead. As per the latest 13F filing Akre owned 28 stocks spread mainly across the Consumer Discretionary Industrial Financials and Technology sectors.

While Chuck Akre’s reputation remains intact the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 26 2021 our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 197.2% vs. 72.4% for the SPY (see the details here). That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.

Keeping this in mind let's take a look at the Chuck Akre's largest ten holdings for the last quarter. To be noted that no new investments were initiated during this quarter nor any position was fully closed.

Story continues

Akre’s 10th-largest holding is KKR & Co. Inc. (NYSE: KKR) a global investment company specializing in alternative investments. Akre allocates 4.03% of his portfolio to KKR being $596.27 million. He first bought 4.8 million shares during the first quarter of 2018 while its share price was trading at a level near $20 whereas now he owns 14.73 million shares and the company's share price is trading above $47.

Since 2016 AUM and management fees grew at a compounded annual growth rate of 18% and 15% respectively. The company announced an increase in its annual dividend by $0.04 per share to reach $0.58. Here is what Greenhaven Road Capital said about KKR in its 2020 Q4 investor letter:

“In 2021 KKR will close on their purchase of General Atlantic insurance company substantially increasing their permanent capital from 9% to 33% of AUM. 2021 should also see continued asset growth as they are in fundraising mode for their three largest strategies. Historically KKR has been excluded from the S&P 500 for governance reasons but the company will likely make changes to qualify for inclusion which would bring a large forced buyer to the stock. With its ballast of stable locked-up management fees KKR is designed to survive market fluctuations and economic cycles. The desire for pension funds and endowments to have a path to 8% returns in a zero-interest rate world should drive continued demand for KKR’s services. Quite frankly I believe that 2022 2023 and 2024 look rosy for KKR as well. “

9. SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ: SBAC)

The first time Akre initiated a position in SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ: SBAC) was in the first quarter of 2014. The position is currently the ninth-largest holding in the portfolio valued at $ 695.45 million representing 4.7% of the overall fund holdings. The position remained constant over the fourth quarter of 2020.

SBA Communications Corporation founded in 1989 is a real estate investment trust. It owns and operates wireless infrastructure used by mobile carriers and wireless broadband providers in North Central South America and South Africa.

The stock’s price increased by 17.1% in 2020. The company started paying dividends in 2019 and is currently paying $0.465 per share as a quarterly dividend (i.e. $1.86 yearly dividend). As per the company’s President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Stoops an increase in dividends is expected in 2021:

""Next quarter in conjunction with the preparation of our 2021 outlook we anticipate that our Board of Directors will be declaring a materially increased quarterly dividend which as is becoming our practice will remain the same on a quarterly basis through the course of the year.""

SBAC seems to be a recession resistant stock. Here is what Baron Asset Fund said about SBAC last year:

“SBA Communications Corp. which owns and operates towers for wireless communications contributed to performance because of its continued organic growth and its relative immunity from COVID-19 related economic disruption. In addition the merger of two large wireless carriers Sprint and T-Mobile was upheld by the courts. This removed uncertainty around the pace at which the combined entity will invest in infrastructure to upgrade its network benefiting SBA. We retain conviction in our investment because of the ongoing growth in demand for wireless voice data and video; the company’s strong competitive position; and its consistent ability to return capital to shareholders through share buybacks and a recently instituted dividend.”

8. CarMax Inc. (NYSE: KMX)

Ranking 8th on Chuck Acre’s top 10 stock picks list is CarMax Inc. (KMX: NYSE) a retailer of used vehicles in the United States. The company operates two main segments: CarMax Sales Operations which sells domestic imported and luxury vehicles and CarMax Auto Finance which provides financing services.

Akre’s position in CarMax decreased by only 905 shares during the fourth quarter of 2020. The stake is valued at $706.49 million constituting 4.77% of the portfolio.

During 2020 KMX shares showed a 7.74% price appreciation and its price reached an all-time high level in 2021 at $128.53. The rally was attributed to positive data on current sales trends following negative year-over-year growth trends during the last two months of 2020.

CarMax reported a year-over-year increase in revenues of 8.1% during the third quarter of the fiscal year 2020 and its earnings per share increased by 36% compared to the same quarter of 2019 reaching $1.42. Here is why Giverny Capital thinks CarMax is a great investment:

“We’d note our largest holding Carmax continues to generate admirable performance that is heavily discounted by the market which believes Internet-based competitors like Carvana and Vroom have superior business models for selling used cars. For its quarter ended August 31 Carmax reported 28% growth in earnings per share and solid unit growth yet the stock declined after that announcement on concerns that its brick and mortar car lots may soon be obsolete. We’re confident in Carmax’s consumer proposition and in the viability of its omnichannel approach to selling cars whereby it can serve customers in stores or online.""

7. Roper Technologies Inc. (NYSE: ROP)

As of the end of the fourth quarter Akre held 1.91 million shares of Roper Technologies the seventh-largest holding in his portfolio. The position decreased by only 638 shares during the quarter and represented 5.57% of the overall portfolio.

Roper Technologies Inc. (NYSE: ROP) was incorporated in 1981. It is leading diversified technology company operating as a software designer and developer and provides engineered products and solutions for niche markets worldwide. It is considered a dividend aristocrat with growing dividends since 1993 and a current dividend yield of 0.59%.

Last quarter the firm earned $1.51 billion up 8% on a yearly basis. Roper's President and CEO considered that the company had a great 2020 with tremendous operational and capital deployment:

""Against the unprecedented backdrop of COVID we meaningfully enhanced the quality of our enterprise. We saw solid growth in our software recurring revenue while investing for accelerated growth across the broader portfolio. In addition we took advantage of attractive market conditions to successfully deploy $6 billion of capital toward high-quality software acquisitions. Importantly our free cash flow grew 16% in 2020.""

Andvari Associates is also bullish on ROP. Here is what they said recently:

“Another Andvari holding that made a significant acquisition last year is Roper Technologies. We’ve owned Roper since 2015 and it is a company laser-focused on compounding their cash flows. Their objective is to use their excess cash flows to acquire other businesses that improve Roper’s overall financial characteristics. Over the last two decades Roper has evolved from a maker of industrial pumps to a conglomerate that owns dozens of high-tech and software businesses. Roper announced last August they’d be acquiring Vertafore for $5.35 billion the largest acquisition in its history. Vertafore is a leading provider of software-as-a-service solutions for the property and casualty insurance industry. The business seems a great fit for Roper: it has strong cash flows it doesn’t require capital to grow it’s a leader in a niche market and revenues are recurring in nature.”

6. O'Reilly Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: ORLY)

O'Reilly Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: ORLY) shares witnessed a 10.28% appreciation in price during the last twelve months. Chuck Akre is the major shareholder of the company with 1.84 million shares valued at $832.61 million. About 5.63% of the fund's portfolio was allocated to ORLY an automotive aftermarket parts and tools supplier in the United States.

Despite the 2020 disruptive business environment O'Reilly Automotive was able to open 156 new stores successfully. For 2021 capital expenditure is expected to increase by $100 million reaching $650 million and management is committed to a target of 165 to 175 new store openings.

During the fourth quarter earnings per share increased by 27% registering $5.40 compared to $4.25 during the same quarter of 2019. As for the full fiscal year earnings per share reached $23.53 increasing by 32% on a yearly basis. This result represents a record level of revenues and operating income since the company went public in 1993.

O'Reilly announced that its Board of Directors approved to increase its share repurchase program by $1.0 billion reaching an aggregate amount of $15.75 billion. In fact the company has repurchased 81.7 million shares under this buyback program since 2011 estimated at $14.57 billion. In 2020 4.8 million shares were repurchased. Qualivian Investment Partners also likes ORLY. Here is what Aamer Khan said in an interview with Insider Monkey:

Oligopoly in a simple understandable business which is less vulnerable to disruption (auto parts) and has a long growth runway. The small independent local auto parts companies are ceding share to the national players who are consolidating the space and O’Reilly is able to make value-creating acquisitions as well as organically growing store counts in states where it is underrepresented that have secularly increased its market share.

WASHINGTON COUNTY Pa.—In the spring of 2019 after years worrying about exposures from a fracking well about a half mile from her grandkids' school Jane Worthington decided to move them to another school district.

Her granddaughter Lexy* had been sick on and off for years with mysterious symptoms and Jane believed air pollution from the fracking well was to blame. She was embroiled in a legal battle aimed at stopping another well from being drilled near the school. She felt speaking out had turned the community against them.

""It seemed like practically everyone in the district had leased their mineral rights"" Jane told EHN (EHN). ""We couldn't get anywhere with the school board and it seemed like they all had a reason to want us to just shut up and go away.""

The social strain combined with her granddaughter's illness was enough to make her want to leave.

Money was tight for Jane who is a single caregiver but she found a deal on a foreclosure in another school district. The house white with sage green shutters sat on a quiet residential street. It was a bit of a fixer-upper but she didn't mind the work—she just wanted a safe comfortable home for her grandchildren Lexy and Damien who she'd raised since they were babies. At the time Lexy was 15-years old and Damien was 13. The kids fell in love with the house. There were still fracking wells nearby—they're virtually impossible to avoid in Washington County—but there were none within a mile of the school and they didn't see any new wells being drilled close to the house. Soon after moving in though they learned that their new home was within a mile and a half of a well pad with six wells already in production (meaning no longer being ""fracked"" or drilled but producing natural gas and oil) and less than a half mile away from a large metal casting facility. An EHN analysis of the air and water at their new home along with urine samples from the family suggest they're being exposed to higher-than-average levels of many of the chemicals they were concerned about at their old house. ""We don't seem to be able to get away from this"" Jane said.

(Credit: Connor Mulvaney for Environmental Health News) In 2019 EHN collected urine samples along with air and water samples from five families in southwestern Pennsylvania and had them analyzed for chemicals associated with fracking. Read about how we conducted our study Jane and her grandchildren were one of the five families we studied. We collected a total of nine urine samples from the family over a 5-week period and found 18 chemicals known to be commonly emitted from fracking sites in one or more samples including benzene toluene naphthalene and lesser-known compounds—all of which are linked to negative health impacts including respiratory and gastrointestinal problems skin and eye irritation organ damage reproductive harm and increased cancer risk.

Some chemical exposures aren't detectable in urine if the body has already processed them so we also looked for breakdown products or biomarkers for harmful chemicals. Some of these biomarkers show up when people consume certain foods or beverages so to determine whether the levels we saw in Pennsylvania families were normal we compared them against those seen in the average American using U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We found that urine samples for Jane and her grandkids contained biomarkers for fracking chemicals at levels higher than the U.S. 95th percentile—the value that 95 percent of Americans fall below according to that CDC data. All of the family's samples exceeded the U.S. 95th percentile for mandelic acid a biomarker for ethylbenzene and styrene. More than half of the family's samples exceeded the U.S. 95th percentile for phenylglyoxylic acid another biomarker for ethylbenzene and styrene and for trans trans-muconic acid a biomarker for benzene. A third of the family's samples exceeded the 95th percentile for hippuric acid a biomarker for toluene.

(Credit: Kristina Marusic for Environmental Health News) Exposure to these compounds is linked to eye skin respiratory and gastrointestinal irritation; neurological immune kidney cardiovascular blood and developmental disorders; hormone disruption; and increased cancer risk. The family's urine samples also suggested that they had higher-than-average exposures to biomarkers for toluene and xylenes which are linked to skin and eye irritation drowsiness and dizziness and central nervous system damage. There's no way to know for certain whether the family's exposures came from fracking emissions. We visited Jane's home had her complete an extensive survey about other possible sources of exposure and recorded the family's activities around the time of our sampling and did not find other obvious explanations though the metal casting facility near Jane's new home could also contribute to these exposures. The exposures confirm Jane's worst fears—that the children she's tasked with protecting are exposed to harmful chemicals simply because of where they live. But the impacts run deeper. The family seemingly cannot escape the effects of an industry that wields tremendous power in the state and is allowed to operate within 500 feet of schools and homes housing children and other vulnerable residents. Researchers warn the impacts extend to the more out-of-sight aspects of health—people's sleep their social network and their overall mental well being. ""I just wish there was more awareness that it really is dangerous for every family that lives here"" Jane said. ""It isn't as safe as we tend to want to make ourselves feel. This is proof.""

Exposed A fracking well pad in southwestern Pennsylvania. (Credit: Ted Auch FracTracker Alliance 2015) When she was in third grade Lexy became very sick—she developed unusual rashes and had bouts of vomiting. She also developed asthma and started having severe nose bleeds. After years of unknowns Lexy's doctor noticed abnormalities in her growth plates which led him to believe that her symptoms could be the result of a toxic exposure. A toxicologist found that Lexy had been exposed to benzene a volatile organic compound (VOC). Because neither her brother nor grandmother were sick—and seemingly no other kids at her school—her doctor said she likely had a higher than average sensitivity to benzene. Benzene is found in tobacco smoke wood smoke vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions. It's also emitted into the air during both fracking and conventional oil and gas extraction and is often found in fracking wastewater. Research has found that some workers at fracking sites are regularly exposed to high levels of benzene. Exposure is linked to cancer organ damage with repeat exposure fertility issues skin and eye irritation drowsiness and dizziness. Despite having moved to a new neighborhood and a new school district the levels of trans trans-muconic acid—a biomarker for benzene—measured in all nine urine samples EHN collected from Jane Worthington and her grandchildren exceeded the U.S. median.

Two agencies—the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists and its German equivalent the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)— established reference values that reflect people's typical background level exposure for trans trans-muconic acid. The levels of trans trans-muconic acid measured in five of the nine urine samples EHN collected from Jane Worthington and her grandchildren over a 5-week period exceeded both of those reference values by up to 11-fold.** While Jane has frequently fretted over air emissions she didn't previously worry about their water. At both their old home and their new one they used the local municipal service provided by Pennsylvania American Water and at both houses the family consumed unfiltered tap water. ""I've always assumed they'd take care of making sure it's safe"" Jane said. We found benzene in the water at all three locations we sampled at Jane's house—the kitchen tap the bathtub faucet and the outdoor hose spigot. The highest level was in the outdoor hose spigot which contained benzene at a level of 3.46 parts per billion. This was the highest level of benzene detected in the five households in our study. Both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) have a maximum legal threshold of 5 parts per billion for benzene in drinking water but the EPA has set a goal of no detectable benzene in drinking water because it can cause leukemia. The levels of contaminants detected in different faucets at the same house can vary for a number of reasons Chris Kassotis an endocrine toxicologist and assistant professor at Wayne State University's Institute of Environmental Health Sciences who has researched water quality extensively told EHN. He explained that after water enters the home it sometimes sits in pipes or tanks where it can pick up additional contaminants and it sometimes travels through filtration systems that remove contaminants.

""I've always assumed they'd take care of making sure it's safe"" Jane said of her water. (Credit: Kelbv/Flickr)

""Either way"" Kassotis explained ""outside samples from a hose spigot are usually more reflective of what's coming from the water authority or groundwater in your region."" A spokesperson for Pennsylvania American Water who reviewed our findings told EHN in an emailed statement ""We follow a thorough sampling regimen as required by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. Our monitoring continues to determine that levels of benzene are non-detectable."" Lauren Fraley a spokesperson for the DEP told EHN that while they do not require action if benzene levels are below the 5 parts per billion threshold levels at or above 4 parts per billion would trigger quarterly monitoring and follow-up measures. ""I guess maybe this means we should start filtering our water since we know [Lexy] is so sensitive to benzene"" Jane said. The family's exposure to other compounds was higher than average too. For example on August 5 2019 a urine sample from Jane Worthington showed a level of phenylglyoxylic acid a breakdown product of ethylbenzene and styrene more than 17 times as high as that of the average cigarette smoker (Jane does not use any tobacco products). On two of the three days when EHN collected urine samples from the family they also wore personal air monitors for six to eight hours. Lexy's monitor recorded the highest levels of decanal pentadecane heptanal n-octanal and n-nonane seen among the 39 air samples EHN collected last summer on August 6 2019—a day when she stayed home and her only activities were going for a walk and taking a nap.

EHN reporter Kristina Marusic sets up an air monitor for Damien Schaffer. (Credit: Mason Secreti) These chemicals can be found in household products gasoline and emissions from industrial and fracking facilities. Exposure to them is linked to a variety of negative health outcomes including eye and skin irritation and respiratory problems. Only a handful of these chemicals have regulatory limits most of which pertain to short-term workplace exposures. Jane and her grandkids' air samples exceeded one regulatory threshold for three chemicals—the recommended limits on benzene ethylbenzene and naphthalene exposure set by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment to minimize cancer risk. Since her first episodes in elementary school Lexy has had similar symptoms—rashes nose bleeds joint pain and stiffness vomiting and migraines—on and off which Jane said have coincided with the times when active drilling or flaring (the burning off of excess natural gas) was happening at well pads near their home or near Lexy's school.

Lexy. (Credit: Connor Mulvaney for Environmental Health News) Both active drilling and flaring are associated with higher levels of air pollution and more reported health effects than wells in the production phase. The DEP has conducted air monitoring studies near fracking wells but critical data gaps persist. ""When monitoring is done it's often reported based on daily averages or weekly averages or a short monitoring time that might be one day a week and then that value is assigned to the whole week"" Alison Steele executive director of the Southwest Pennsylvania Environmental Health Project† a community health advocacy group told EHN. ""If you look at a 15 minute average readout you can actually see when there are intense spikes in emissions"" she explained. ""But if you take that out to a whole day as an average you completely lose that information and it's not useful at all...you lose the opportunity to identify events that might be causing health impacts."" Jane witnessed the challenges related to air monitoring studies firsthand. In response to public concern about the wells' proximity to Fort Cherry schools—much of which was raised due to Lexy's illness—Range Resources the company that owns the well pad closest to the school commissioned an air monitoring study in 2017. The company hired Gradient a Boston-based environmental consulting firm that has previously published research aimed at discrediting the known links between exposure to asbestos lead and arsenic and negative health effects and has had the scientific validity of its other air emissions research called into question after its test results contradicted EPA findings in Texas. The two-year study found that the wells near Fort Cherry schools ""do not pose any acute or chronic health concerns"" and that the data ""showed no air quality impacts of potential health concern."" But the Southwest Pennsylvania Environmental Health Project issued a public statement calling the report ""highly flawed in its methodology scope and objectivity"" in part because it was not set up to catch sporadic emissions. Jane felt that the whole undertaking was disingenuous and unhelpful—and she felt both validated and left out when in June of 2020 Range Resources pleaded ""no contest"" to charges of environmental crimes filed by the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office over its actions at two other well sites in Washington County.

Ostracized and alienated Jane Worthington left and her granddaughter Lexy. (Credit: Connor Mulvaney for Environmental Health News) For Jane fracking seemed to split her community: Those who got jobs or made money from mineral leases and those whose quality of life was damaged or loved ones got sick. Because their own kids weren't sick many of Jane's neighbors refused to believe that what happened to Lexy could be related to fracking. These issues have caused Lexy to experience depression and anxiety about her symptoms about her alienation from classmates and community members who benefit from the industry and about the feeling that the industry's impacts are inescapable. At her old school things got progressively worse after she became sick. On numerous occasions she got sick and vomited in front of classmates which mortified her. She started wearing an air monitor that made loud noises when air pollution reached an unsafe level for her which was embarrassing. Teachers and students would grill Lexy about her symptoms implying—and sometimes saying outright—that she must be making it all up. ""A lot of kids would ask 'If it's because of fracking why aren't all of us sick like you?' Lexy said. ""That really frustrates me because I don't know the answer."" It wasn't just the kids—adults in the school district were also cruel. Jane said that at several public meetings they were shouted at called liars and told to leave town. She said that a few other parents quietly approached her to share stories about how their own children had also experienced mysterious health symptoms once fracking moved in but that most were too afraid to speak up. The family has been making trips to Harrisburg and Washington D.C. for more than eight years to plead with their representatives and other lawmakers to protect them. The kids have even spoken on the floor of the U.S. Senate.

Damien Shaffer. (Credit: Connor Mulvaney for Environmental Health News) Damien Lexy's easy-going half brother told EHN ""We are feeling that people are starting to listen. Finally."" Lexy cut him off—""No"" she said ""they really aren't. None of it does any good. It's not fair. I just want to be normal and have a normal life like other kids."" She isn't the only one feeling anxious and disempowered. A 2017 literature review that looked at all available studies on the mental health impacts of fracking found that it's common for people in fracked communities to experience ""worry anxiety and depression about lifestyle health safety and financial security"" and that ""entire communities can experience collective trauma as a result of the boom/bust cycle that often occurs when industries impinge on community life."" And similar evidence keeps piling up:

A 2018 study found that stress and depression are higher among Pennsylvanians who live near fracking wells.





A 2020 study of a community in Denton Texas found increased stress and animosity and tension between community members as a result of fracking.



Another 2020 study that surveyed Colorado households found that uncertainty about environmental and health risks of fracking and feelings of political powerlessness led to chronic stress and depression.

The Southwest Pennsylvania Environmental Health Project has been tracking symptoms experienced by people who live near fracking wells in Pennsylvania for the last decade. In the spring of 2020 they published a paper on data collected from 2012-2017 that documented 17 symptoms which increased in severity the closer people lived to a higher volume of fracking wells. The top three were difficulty sleeping anxiety/worry and depressed mood. ""One community member told me that since fracking moved in they now understood why sleep deprivation is used as a torture technique"" Hannah Blinn a former environmental health educator and fellow at the organization and lead author of the 2020 study told EHN. ""That kind of stress creates its own health impacts. When we document that someone has a headache for example is that because of a chemical exposure or because they haven't slept and their neighbors don't trust them anymore?"" Proponents of the industry's economic benefits are quick to point out that being jobless also impacts people's mental health. Democratic Pennsylvania State Representative Robert Matzie has been a vocal supporter of the petrochemical plant being built by Shell adjacent to his district in Beaver County (33 miles northwest of Pittsburgh) which will convert ethane from an estimated 1000 new fracked wells per year into plastic.

(Credit: Ted Auch FracTracker Alliance 2019) He recalled watching the demise of the steel industry and watching people struggle to adapt. ""I went to community college for my first two years in the 80s and I remember having classes with guys in their 40s or 50s who'd been working in a steel mill since the day they left high school struggling with their course load and seeing any other future for themselves"" he told EHN. He worries that without a comprehensive transition plan something similar could occur if the oil and gas industry left the region and he sees the petrochemical industry as an opportunity to help community members who are struggling. ""I know a number of people in my community including my neighbor who is an operating engineer and a steamfitter down the street from me who are doing very well as a result of construction of that plant"" Matzie said. ""While those jobs are temporary these people have been able to keep working and paying the bills during a global pandemic which is a big deal and means a whole lot to them."" Blinn pointed out that feelings of division and alienation can be experienced by community members who benefit from the industry too. ""People who have jobs with oil and gas or who lease their land and are getting yelled at in community meetings or by their neighbors who fear for their health are often distressed too"" she said. ""They feel like they were just trying to take care of their families and now everyone is mad at them for it. It really can cause rifts across the entire community.""

""Safe"" distances Flaring at a compressor station in Ohio. (Credit: Ted Auch FracTracker Alliance 2018) Jane's primary concern with the Fort Cherry School District was how close the wells were to the building where her granddaughter spent her days. In Pennsylvania unless municipalities set more stringent regulations horizontally drilled well pads are required to be at least 500 feet away from the nearest occupied building—including homes schools and daycares. Private property owners can waive this requirement so wells are sometimes even closer to homes and businesses in the state. There are no federal regulations about how far fracking wells should be from schools so states and municipalities are left with a patchwork of different protections. According to the Southwest Pennsylvania Environmental Health Project the closest well to a school in Pennsylvania is in Butler County about 85 miles north of Washington County where a well pad sits about 633 feet from Summit Township Elementary School.

Credit: (Southwest PA Environmental Health Project/Google Maps) Proximity to fracking wells has been linked to higher cases of low birth weights childhood cancers skin problems asthma exacerbations and migraines and fatigue in hundreds of studies since the beginning of the boom. The state of New York banned fracking in 2014 on the basis of 400 studies showing potential health harms from the industry. As of August 2020 there were 2015 studies indicating harm—about five times the amount that prompted New York to ban the practice—according to a literature review conducted by the health advocacy groups Physicians for Social Responsibility and Concerned Health Professionals of New York. ""What makes fracking different from any other industry I've studied in public health is that there's no industrial zone"" Sandra Steingraber a professor of Environmental Studies and Sciences at Ithaca College and co-author of the 2020 literature review told EHN. ""It's taking place literally in our backyards and unfortunately some of the best evidence for both polluting emissions and emerging health crises is coming out of southwestern Pennsylvania."" Children are more vulnerable to harmful effects from environmental pollutants because they breathe about four times more air and drink more water pound for pound than adults and their bodies—not yet fully developed— are less able to filter out pollutants. This makes them more vulnerable to short-term health effects like asthma and stomach problems and also to long-term health effects like heart disease and cancer. ""The thinking is that chemicals get into cells in human bodies and cause changes to genes"" Dr. Philip Landrigan pediatrician epidemiologist and director of the Global Public Health Program and the Global Observatory on Pollution and Health at Boston College told EHN. ""A single hit on a gene won't typically cause cancer...most cancers evolve over a span of many years with multiple hits accumulating over time. If it takes five or six hits to a gene to produce cancer and a child goes through the first two or three hits in early childhood that child is then much closer to developing cancer once they become an adult.""

Damien Shaffer. (Credit: Connor Mulvaney for Environmental Health News) Researchers also warn that many of the chemicals emitted during fracking can be harmful at lower levels than current regulations account for—even the most stringent regulations on the books. At least 21 common fracking chemicals (including many of the ones we found) are also endocrine disruptors meaning they mimic the body's hormones. This can lead to numerous negative impacts on reproductive respiratory metabolic and immune systems and children's development. Carol Kwiatkowski a professor at North Carolina State University and former executive director of the nonprofit research institution The Endocrine Disruption Exchange warned that current regulations don't take this into account because many of these effects occur at very low levels of exposure which traditional toxicology testing doesn't measure. She explained that generally when scientists see adverse health effects at a certain level they keep dropping the exposure lower and lower until they no longer see those effects. Then they set an exposure limit a hundred or a thousand times lower than that. ""They think they're being extra cautious"" Kwiatkowski told EHN ""setting our safe exposure level so much lower than where they saw effects. But they never test that level. It's just an assumption that it will be safe."" Ultimately Kwiatkowski said this means that being exposed to some of these pollutants at any level isn't safe—even if they're seen at levels well below existing legal thresholds. A 2020 study found that doubling the current Pennsylvania setback distance of 500 feet to 1000 feet (a little less than a quarter of a mile) would reduce the number of people who are exposed to emissions greater than the EPA's recommended annual limit for particulate matter pollution by 86 percent.

A drilling rig in Washington County Pennsylvania. (Credit: Ted Auch FracTracker Alliance 2016) ""The science does not say that any distance is safe"" Alison Steele executive director of the Southwest Pennsylvania Environmental Health Project told EHN. Her organization published a 2018 study that recommended a minimum setback of 0.25 miles or about 1320 feet. They're among a number of groups that have unsuccessfully pushed for these changes at the state level. In the summer of 2020 a grand jury report on fracking from the office of Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro which concluded that current regulations aren't protective of residents' health recommended wells be placed at least 5000 feet (just shy of a mile) from schools. ""We have a profound gap between the 'clean air and pure water' promised in our Constitution and the reality that too many Pennsylvanians live with every day"" Shapiro told EHN. ""It is up to us to close that gap to protect the health and safety of every Pennsylvanian."" A spokesperson for Attorney General Shapiro who reviewed highlights from EHN's investigation said our findings are in line with those of the grand jury and ""serve to reinforce the stories that the various Pennsylvania homeowners have been telling for over 14 years now"" which suggest fracking is occurring too close to residents. Many states have similar—or even less stringent—setback regulations. Colorado is a notable exception. In 2019 the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment released a 380-page report on the potential health impacts of oil and gas operations which found that air pollution from wells could impact human health within a 2000-foot radius.

(Credit: John Duffy/flickr) In November 2020 following more than 180 hours of public hearings with industry groups scientific researchers public health officials homeowners associations and environmental advocates the newly revamped Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission announced numerous new oil and gas regulations—many of which are the strongest in the country—including a 2000-foot setback distance (with an option for well operators to apply for exceptions). ""By taking a more cautious approach through increased setback distances we're reducing the likelihood of community exposure to hazardous air pollutants and other emissions"" John Putnam former director of environmental programs at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment told EHN. (Putnam recently left the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to take a position as Deputy General Counsel for the U.S. Department of Transportation.) In Pennsylvania some lawmakers believe current setback regulations are adequate while others are pushing for additional regulations. ""Nobody has complained to me about a health issue"" Republican Pennsylvania Senator Gene Yaw who chairs the state Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee told EHN. ""The purpose of some of the things that have been tried in Pennsylvania regarding setbacks has just been to eliminate the oil and gas industry entirely. I don't know of any significant problem areas that would merit changing setbacks."" When asked about the grand jury report's findings on the need for greater setbacks Yaw said ""The Attorney General's report is truly embarrassing. He relied on witnesses who have been preaching the same story for the past 12 years… It's embarrassing that he fell for it.""

Pennsylvania State Capitol (Kumar Appaiah/flickr) Matzie the Democratic Pennsylvania State Representative who supports the Shell Ethane Cracker—which will require ethane from an estimated 1000 new fracked wells per year—told EHN he doesn't believe current fracking regulations are adequate to protect the health of Pennsylvanians. ""That's one thing that's been hard to reconcile and hard to explain to the general public"" Matzie said. ""I support the plant and the downstream jobs it's expected to create but at the same time we've lacked as policymakers to ensure that we have adequate safeguards in place for physical fracking wells. It's a tough balance."" He said he voted against the state's controversial Act 13 which originally allowed the state to override local municipality regulations on the industry like greater setback rules—one of several portions of the law that were eventually overturned by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Matzie also unsuccessfully introduced legislation that would create greater setbacks from freshwater sources in the state. ""Implementing new oil and gas regulations isn't necessarily at the top of the list of things to get done by Republican-controlled legislatures"" he said.

""We've seen a paradigm shift in how people are searching for travel on Airbnb. It used to be that people knew where they were going. That's why there's a search box [that asks] where are you going? Now 40% of our guests who come on Airbnb either don't have a location in mind or don't have a date in mind"" Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky told Yahoo Finance a day after Airbnb released its first financial results as a public company.

On Tuesday Airbnb launched ""flexible search"" an open-ended way to look for homes or apartments to stay in showing there's pent-up interest to get away — without much of an emphasis on location. Users are booking in shorter windows than ever before many finding a destination within 30 days of the trip according to Airbnb.

""The reality is they are in a house. They are saying 'I feel stuck. I'll go anywhere within a couple hundred mile radius. I want to go in next couple of months.' We're allowing more flexibility"" Chesky said.

Airbnb launched flexible option offering on February 23 2021 as more users requested open-ended stays.

This open-ended search function is ubiquitous across other travel websites including Booking.com (BKNG) Expedia (EXPE) Momondo and Skyscanner. While it's not a helpful tool for say business travelers it's a good one for leisure travelers — especially ones with flexible schedules who can work remotely as many are doing in the pandemic.

""Fewer people are traveling for business. Fewer people have very set destinations and it means they are open minded. We can point travelers and demand to where we have supply"" Chesky said. ""It really helps balance supply and demand. Also I think levels playing field. I think that can benefit Airbnb.""

Airbnb reported better than expected revenue during its first quarter as a public company although gross bookings were down 31% year-over-year. With 4 million hosts on the platform Chesky said the most important area of growth is to recruit more people to open up their homes.

""Many people like to start hosting at the beginning of a life change. As we see more flexibility there’s more empty homes people are leaving behind. In 2019 23% of our hosts were guests first. There are big opportunities to convert guests to become hosts"" he said during the investor call Thursday afternoon.

Currently Airbnb calls its top tier experienced hosts ""superhosts."" Prior to the pandemic the company was iterating on a superuser model akin to a frequent flier program. During the interview with Yahoo Finance Chesky alluded to a future product that would incentivize users to keep booking on the platform.

This product of the pandemic inspired many people to explore new places move to new cities and gave rise to the ""workcation"" model of traveling to work somewhere new just because you can. Entire nations even adopted new visa models to allow travelers to come and experience extended stays. And now Airbnb is getting in on it too with new flexible dates option.

""According to our new travel trends report one-quarter of Americans would consider traveling during off-peak times of the year or the week. And in 2021 to date more than one-third of people searching our platform have been flexible in terms of the date or location of their stay"" Airbnb explained in a blog post. ""At Airbnb we believe these shifts will continue even after the pandemic fades and that for those with new flexibility to choose their dates travel will increasingly become a way of life.""

Airbnb.

As of Feb. 23 travelers can now see a ""Flexible Dates"" feature that allows them to search for homes without a specific check-in or check-out date. So rather than selecting a date guests can search for options like ""weekend getaway"" or ""week-long vacation"" or even a ""months-long stay."" This Airbnb says will allow travelers the ability to browse more options while staying flexible on the exact dates of their trip.

Airbnb

""It's no surprise COVID-19 continues to change the way we travel and in addition to redesigning our platform last year to make nearby and longer-term stays easier to find and book our new Flexible Dates feature aligns with a broader shift in how people will travel in the future"" Airbnb added in a statement. ""The traditional travel industry was built around fixed destinations with fixed dates in mind but that model no longer meets the needs of today's travelers.""

Read more

Neighbors on the 800 block of Wharton Street in South Philadelphia describe packed weekend parties at an Airbnb on their street where over the summer and into the winter guests regularly spilled out onto the sidewalks and streets. Doors slammed. Guests left behind empty bottles and vomit. Music yelling and honking sometimes didn’t fall quiet until 4 a.m.

The owner of the property rents out the rowhouse to tenants not to guests of the short-term rental company. The property is one of nearly 100 Airbnbs that Pad Suites a management company says it lists in four cities. The owner of the home declined to comment and is talking to a lawyer.

A City Council bill introduced this month would end complicated arrangements like this. It would require those who offer their primary residences as short-term rentals to be either owners of the properties or tenants who have written permission from the owner to profit from the use of the properties by others. The city would treat them as businesses and require them to get free commercial activity licenses as well as proposed limited lodging operator licenses for $150 per year. City officials adapted the legislation from similar rules in New York and Boston.

The legislation calls for licenses even if residents rent out their homes for only a few weekends a year. Current city law requires permits for those renting out homes for more than 90 days in a year. Some operators purposefully stay under the threshold to avoid the regulations. If the bill passes everyone — owners and tenants — who rents a home also has to use licensed booking agents and adhere to local zoning requirements.

City officials and police receive complaints from people living in neighborhoods throughout the city about guests hosting parties that disturb quiet residential streets. Neighbors have reported fights drug deals and shootings at sites of short-term rentals.

Gun shots rang out at one rental along Wood Street just outside Old City at the end of May. The house which had been listed on Airbnb for a couple of years “unbeknownst to the rest of us was starting to become a party hub” said Alice Reyes vice president of Franklin Bridge North Neighbors the registered community organization that covers the area from the Ben Franklin Bridge to Callowhill Street and from I-95 to North Sixth Street.

“The neighbor whose house butts up against this house they moved out for six months because they couldn’t take it anymore” Reyes said. The owner of the Airbnb property sold the property but several other party houses in the area are still listed on the platform.

One of the main problems with short-term rentals is that no one knows how to contact the people who are renting out the property said City Councilmember Mark Squilla who introduced the bill. Requiring licenses lets the city know who is operating rentals and whom to contact if there’s an issue he said.

“We believe by doing this we will have more control over the bad operators” said Squilla adding that he’s not trying to get rid of Airbnbs. “We want to make sure they’re not negatively impacting the communities they’re in.”

In a statement an Airbnb spokesperson said the company is reviewing the proposed legislation and “look[s] forward to working with the city to ensure short-term rentals can be an important part of Philadelphia’s post-pandemic recovery.”

A year ago Airbnb started procedures to verify listings. In August the company announced a global ban on parties. In November alone the platform suspended or removed dozens of listings in Philadelphia for violating party policies.

In addition to notifying Airbnb neighbors say they call the police watch as officers tell the occupants to keep it down and see parties continue once officers leave. Enforcement of Squilla’s legislation would be key said the leaders of the Franklin Bridge North Association.

“It’s going to be up to the residents to keep an eye and ear open and document and facilitate that process with the city” Reyes said. “We just hope the city responds to that.”

The landlord association Hapco Philadelphia is working on a lease template for property owners that explicitly states that tenants don’t have the right to rent out their units without their landlords’ permission said Paul Cohen the association’s attorney. Cohen said he has never seen a lease that allows tenants to use their homes this way. When leases don’t mention renting out the unit at all “you’re in the gray area” and open to disputes he said.

Rue Landau a housing-law professor at Temple Law School and former executive director of the city’s Fair Housing Commission said she sees the value in making sure operators of housing are licensed.

“Just like rental housing it’s a good idea for the City of Philadelphia to create a license for limited lodging operators so that the city knows who’s operating these businesses and renting these properties in case of an emergency or to have direct contact with the business operators” she said.

Robert Gurmankin president of Franklin Bridge North Neighbors said he hopes further regulation of Airbnbs can provide relief to neighbors. Over the winter rowdy gatherings in his neighborhood have died down.

But he said “we’re concerned we’ll have the same issue come spring.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmcmljYS5jb20vdGFuemFuaWEtbW92ZXMtdG8tcmVndWxhdGUtcmV2ZW51ZS1mcm9tLWFpcmJuYi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tanzania Moves to Regulate Revenue from Airbnb,"As part of plans to raise more money from tourism in Tanzania its government has announced that it is giving a 50 days ultimatum to short-stay accommodation operators in the country. Government officials will go from ‘house to house’ in the coming days in order to register US-based rental service Airbnb operators in the country. Airbnb is a San-Francisco based company that specializes in the online marketplace and hospitality services. The company was founded 10 years ago by the trio of Brian Pesky Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk and is now worth $2.6 billion. The online company allows residents of a city/country to rent out their apartments hostel beds or hostel rooms temporarily to visitors or tourists who are seeking experiences in tourism or are just in the community for work-related activity. The company is operating in more than 80 cities in 191 countries around the world. The company usually charges the guests between 0-20 percent of the charging fees and the hosts 30 percent of the charging fees. In recent times tourism has become Tanzania’s fastest growing sector with revenue from the sector valued at $2.3 billion in 2017. That number was 25 percent of Tanzania’s total Forex earnings. With this news Tanzania hopes to gain more revenue through giving license fees to Airbnb operators who had before now been under the radar. There have been controversies over how much government is entitled to from the charges and if there should be taxes on them. According to Business Insider the average income for Airbnb hosts vary across the continent. The average income for an Airbnb host in Kenya is under $1000 per annum while it is $2000 in South Africa and #1000 in Morocco.

Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.

While some CDNs target the big business market and others focus on simpler budget solutions 5centsCDN does its very best to provide something for just about everyone.

Looking for power? 5centsCDN offers over 1150 PoPs around the globe including some servers from other top providers (Akamai Gcore Labs). That brings real benefits in some typically poorly-served regions. Many CDNs have only one or two locations in South America for instance; 5centsCDN has seven.

But if that's overkill for what you need the company also offers plans using just a handful of PoPs from as little as $0.0025 per GB (more on those below).

Video features include support for live streaming video on demand and comprehensive transcoding and unusual supporting features including the ability to schedule a video playlist or automatically playing videos on your site for a specific period of time.

Free SSL support is available via shared SSL or a Let's Encrypt option and you can also use your own custom certificate.

Want to try 5centsCDN? Check out the website here

A stack of features ranges from OpenStack-powered cloud storage to secured token protection for your content origin shield support for reducing load on your server and a rich API to help customize operations to suit your needs. And the list goes on – check out 5centsCDN's exceptionally detailed 'All Features' page to find out more.

If you run into problems 5cents provides support via email ticket live chat and Skype. There's an SLA too with the company promising 99.9% uptime for the CDN (there are live uptime figures on a status page here). There's no way for us to tell whether every customer sees that but it's still good to see 5centsCDN making such public commitments.

(Image credit: 5centsCDN)

We also have some issues with the website though which can be confusing or even misleading in some areas. One page writes in glowing terms about the web application firewall saying it 'was designed from scratch to outwit today's real-world threats rather than yesterday's theoretical problems'. Sounds great but there's just one problem; it doesn't exist it's not available in the control panel and it's still listed on the To Do section of the company's roadmap.

We suspect that's a mistake rather than an active attempt to deceive customers (there would be no point in that as a free trial allows everyone to see for themselves) but it's still unacceptable. Customers should be able to trust what's on the website and that's clearly not always the case. We wouldn't necessarily rule out 5centsCDN because of that but if you have priority features make sure you confirm the company delivers what you expect before you hand over any cash.

Pricing

5centsCDN prices are generally great value but as usual with CDNs it might take quite a few calculations to understand exactly what you'll be paying.

The Standard plan charges just $2.50 a month for 1TB of traffic (overage is priced at the same $0.0025 per GB). You're restricted to 10+ PoPs and delivery in North America and Europe only but that still looks good to us. Fastly charges $0.12 for North America and European traffic Amazon CloudFront asks $0.085 CDN77 and many other relatively good value providers are still priced at $0.03-$0.04.

The Volume plan triples in price to $7.50 for the same 1TB traffic but this time you get access to 30+ PoPs and delivery worldwide.

Opting for the Premium plan gets you 1TB traffic and 60+ PoPs for $10 a month while the Enterprise plan supports the full 1150 PoPs for $15 with an overage of $0.015 per GB.

(Image credit: 5centsCDN)

If you're not ready to commit 5centsCDN also has a similar range of Pay As You Go plans. Specs are almost identical but the per GB price typically doubles and minimum top-ups range from $5 for the Standard deal to $200 for the Enterprise plan.

All plans come with 100GB of cloud storage for free (you can add more for $0.05 per GB). There's no extra cost for SSL or requests and your credits don't expire as long as you top up again in the next year. So if you hand over $5 for the Standard PAYG plan today then get distracted for the next 11 months you can come back and your credit balance will still be waiting.

Put it all together and this looks like a nicely balanced set of deals with something for everyone from the beginner to the most demanding business user.

If you're unsure there's a 7-day free trial to help you find out more though it has quite a few restrictions (100GB traffic a maximum of 10 concurrent live viewers video transcoding is limited to 15 minutes and there's a 5centsCDN watermark; find out more here).

Setup

After an easy signup process 5centsCDN directed us to its client portal. CDN services tickets invoices account balance and more are all clearly summarized which is handy as an overview of an account.

The page isn't so clear on what to do next and users are left to browse a sidebar and figure out what they need. The interface makes some effort to help CDN newbies though for example indicating that push zones use cloud storage to store your content and it's likely you'll locate the right area within a few clicks.

Creating your initial zone looks a little complicated at least initially. While some CDNs might just prompt you for one or two settings – origin server name CDN name protocol to use – 5centsCDN's pull zone form includes 11 sections most with several options of their own: origin shield cache settings edge settings SSL geoblocking secure tokens and more.

(Image credit: 5centsCDN)

Read the form in-depth though and you'll see this is a smarter way to do things. Yes there are a lot of settings but 5centsCDN has clear prompts for the most important options and tooltip-like help for everything else. This allows you to see useful features (creating Let's Encrypt SSL) immediately without having to poke around in endless setup panels. And if you don't think you need a particular option the chances are you can ignore it. The default settings are well chosen and for instance creating a pull zone can be as simple as entering your site domain name.

Once the zone is working an Integration pane explains how to change website resource paths to point to the CDN depending on whether you're using a CNAME (<img src=""https://cdn.yourdomain.com/path/to/image.jpg""> or an automatically generated CDN name (<img src=""https://pull-1833.5centscdn.com/path/to/image.jpg"">).

Cache settings include the ability to set a default cache expiry time but only with a few standard settings (1 day 7 days 14 days and so on; some providers give you far more fine-tuned control down to minutes or even seconds). But you can set custom times for individual objects in your site code and there are pluses elsewhere. There's an option to serve stale content for instance if a file has expired but the origin is down.

Other panels follow a similar pattern. Sometimes they look a little basic so for instance the Compression feature supports simple Gzip only no Brotli or other options. But there are also lots of small tweaks which you won't always see elsewhere. You can specify the preferred location of your origin shield for example (often this is left up to the CDN). There is an option to add a robots.txt file to the CDN root directory allowing you to set search engine crawling rules. And an Optimize for WordPress feature avoids caching admin and other pages for users logged into WordPress.

Support

If you run into any technical trouble the Help Center has some useful articles. They're lacking in detail though and don't begin to match the top providers.

We opened the Live Chat window and posted a test question about 5centCDN's Web Application Firewall and the issue we noticed earlier. It's mentioned on the website we wrote but isn't visible in the control panel – how could we access it?

'Thank you for using 5centCDN's live chat service' came the reply only seconds later. 'Is there something in particular we can help you with?'

Well you could read the question we just posted? We asked again for information on using the WAF and got the response: 'We will check your query with our back-end team and get back to you as soon as possible.'

An agent who can't answer a basic question about a supposedly major feature of the service? Or a bot maybe? Neither possibility is encouraging.

(Image credit: 5centsCDN)

After 24 hours with no response we raised two tickets one on the firewall one on a simpler service issue. The easy question got a helpful reply within three hours and eventually we received this response regarding the firewall: 'WAF is not compatible with our partner CDN. So we have disabled this feature for time being. We are working with them to enable this and we have added this to the roadmap. We will add this feature soon!'

Having a firewall which is incompatible with the CDN sounds like someone's made a very major planning error and that doesn't explain why it's still listed on the website as an active feature. But at least we have an official explanation: there is no WAF but it's 'coming soon' apparently.

5centCDN's support isn't a disaster then but it's not great either. The difficulty we had getting an answer on the firewall suggests that if you're asking anything out of the ordinary it might take quite some time to get a reply. If this could be an issue we'd recommend you ask plenty of test questions during your trial and make sure the company can deliver what you need.

Performance

Measuring CDN speeds is a challenge but CDNPerf does a better job than most gathering hundreds of millions of response times every day and using them to compare most of the top providers.

5centsCDN's results couldn't be any better with the company's 26ms average worldwide response time giving it first place out of 20 contenders. That's remarkable considering the price you're paying.

It's always worth checking out a CDN's performance in other regions as providers don't always excel everywhere. But 5centsCDN very lowest score was a still respectable 5th place in Asia and after that it managed 4th place in North America and Africa 3rd place in Europe and 2nd place in Oceania.

There's much more to CDN speed than raw response times of course – like your website platform the CDN's features and how you use them. 5centCDN's excellent results get it off to a great start though and the free trial gives you a chance to see what the service can do for your site.

(Image credit: 5centsCDN)

Final verdict

5centsCDN isn't as powerful or professional as the top providers and for the website to claim it has a web application firewall when it really doesn't is unacceptable. But there is a lot to like here including high speeds and very low prices and if your application isn't too demanding then it's a must-see.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Read this thorough overview of Byte Aligners to help you determine if the best option for your dental needs is to pick Byte.

What Is Byte?

The Byte is a company that specializes in straightening at-home teeth with simple almost invisible custom fit aligners. Your teeth shift into the proper place over time enhancing your smile.

Its straightening treatment process is quicker than its rivals according to Byte and it is much faster than conventional braces. Byte's aligners get results in two to four months instead of wearing braces for years.

In addition to greater affordability and quicker performance Byte also reduces the need for visits to the office. Your care plan is overseen by dental specialists but you never have to see an orthodontist in person.

Pros and Cons of Byte Aligners

Pros:

● Treatment Time: Byte is the first company to deliver HyperByte the exclusive high-frequency vibration system that can drastically minimize the treatment time if used for five minutes a day. This amazing technology is how within as little as two months Byte will produce results.

● Free-extras: Byte's prescription plans include teeth whitening and the original price of the first package of retainers. For retainers and added resources other aligner firms charge extra.

● Lifetime guarantee: The outcomes are ensured for your lifetime with the Byte for Life guarantee. If your smile ever moves out of sync after the conclusion of your treatment plan at no extra expense Byte will supply additional impression kits and alignment treatment plans. It is important to remember that alignment adjustments that occur following an accident or wound are not protected by the guarantee.

● Flexibility: Byte gives you the option of All-Day Aligners (worn 22 hours a day) or Byte At-Night Aligners (worn 10 hours a night when you sleep) so you can fit your lifestyle treatment plan.

Cons:

● For mild or moderate alignment problems only: Byte is only for people with mild or moderate alignment problems. If your problems with teeth alignment are more serious you may not be a candidate and may instead require more conventional orthodontic services.

● Higher monthly payment costs: While Byte has a funding option for monthly payments it costs considerably more than if you paid for everything in advance. Specifically for the monthly payment plan you would end up spending over $800 in additional costs.

● Safety concerns: While at-home aligners are common and convenient safety concerns about them have been raised by some dental professionals. Consumers were warned by the American Association of Orthodontists against using direct-to-consumer teeth straightening procedures saying they could lead to dental health problems such as tooth or gum loss.

Are Byte Aligners Legitimate and Safe?

Yes treatment with Byte is safe and reliable. They have an extensive network of physicians and orthodontists approved by the board who oversee each treatment plan.

The same doctor or orthodontist who designs your aligner plan also records progress from start to finish in the straightening of your teeth. Throughout the recovery process this means you get high-quality personalized care.

Bear in mind that there is remote control of direct-to-consumer clear aligners. There is a marginally greater chance of suffering complications. Without in-person office visits orthodontic care is less predictable. However at-home aligner care is successful and secure when closely supervised by a specialist.

Why Are Byte Aligners So Popular?

Aside from the cost the time commitment to conventional orthodontics is one of the main obstacles to pursuing a more relaxed smile. It might not top your priority list to make time to visit the dentist's office in between all of your other duties. It's not exactly a trip to the beach after all—nevermind taking time off work to see the dentist every month and postponing your ventures.

Traditional orthodontic treatments are not always easy aside from the monthly time commitment. Your changes will not be complete in time if you have a special event coming up this year (not two or three years down the road) and want to finish care ASAP.

By sending the aligners to your home home aligner companies such as Byte make the system more convenient so you spend less time in the patient's chair and more time enjoying life. In half a year most home alignment therapies produce the desired results far quicker than the normal 18 months for braces and 12 months for Invisalign. And with their 2-4 month treatment window Byte brings it to the next level the quickest among home aligner alternatives.

The Byte is unquestionably more comfortable than braces or Invisalign. But how does it match up against other businesses with home alignments? There are several distinctions that make some goods stand out as more or less convenient.

Does Byte Actually Work?

For more than 20 years Simple Aligners have been around. With advances in 3D modeling video conferencing technology and digital cameras it is safer and more convenient than ever to build an at-home clear aligner treatment plan.

It is necessary to note however that not everyone is qualified for direct aligners. For instance if you have any of the following:

● Jaw problems or seriously misaligned teeth

● Gum disease cavities or other disorders of oral health that first need to be managed

● A lifelong retainer from previous treatment with orthodontics

● Dental replacements such as teeth dental implants or a dental bridge.

How Long Are You Going To Wear Byte's Aligners?

Braces will take up to 24 months to make your teeth straighter. With regular use of Hyperbyte byte aligners can straighten your teeth in 3 to 6 months (a teeth movement acceleration device).

Depending on the type of byte aligner that you pick the treatment length can vary:

● All-Day Aligners: These aligners are worn for 22 hours a day. For Byte All-Day Aligners the average treatment period is three months which is around 2x faster than for other direct aligners.

● At-Night Aligners: These aligners straighten your teeth while you sleep and are worn for 10+ hours a day. For Byte's At-Night Aligners the typical treatment period is 5 to 6 months. Aligners at night are licensed only for very mild cases of misalignment.

What Are The Procedures Involved In Using Byte Aligner Treatment Strategy?

In the Byte Aligners method there are three steps:

● Byte's Impression Kit

The first step: on the Byte website order an impression package.

Using the impression tray smile stretcher and putty you can take the teeth impressions after getting the aligner kit in the mail.

Then using the return shipping box given send the impressions back to the orthodontist. Shipping is entirely free.

Note that if you are not a Byte Aligners nominee you will obtain a complete refund for the impression package. There is no requirement to buy the aligners if you are a nominee.

● Aligners and Remote Monitoring

The Smile Science Method is used by Byte which Dr. Jon Marashi a cosmetic dentist in Hollywood developed.

Using five points of review Smile Science integrates cosmetic accuracy which helps evaluate the best tooth positioning for your particular facial structure.

After analyzing your teeth experiences using a completely interactive 3D model and the Smile Science device the orthodontist can create a personalized treatment plan. This appointment is 100% online which ensures that you don't have to go in person to see them.

Byte will send the aligners (with step-by-step instructions) straight to your door after you accept the treatment plan.

The custom set of invisible aligners a little at a time pushes the teeth securely. You'll switch onto the next pair after one set of aligners is worn for a week. When your new smile is reached this cycle continues.

Throughout the care you can still have online check-ins with your orthodontist to ensure your teeth are moving properly.

● HyperByte® Technology

You'll also get the HyperByte® an FDA-cleared dental movement acceleration system as a Byte user.

This system securely straightens teeth 2 times faster than other HFV aligners (high-frequency vibration).

The HyperByte helps minimize pain when used regularly increases the precision of teeth movement and cuts treatment time in half.

What You Get When You Buy Byte Aligners?

While many other companies provide consistent aligner care based on home their dedication to delivering excellent customer service is what distinguishes Byte. Byte has also carried out a range of innovative solutions in the short period they have been in business to make care more convenient and affordable for their patients.

● Single payment: The price for the Byte care package is $1895 if you pay upfront. Your custom treatment plan alignments HyperByte unit a BrightByte bottle and your first retainer are included in the bill.

● BytePay: A monthly funding choice is BytePay. It needs a deposit of $349 and then for 29 months you'll pay $83 per month. In total if you select BytePay you will pay $2756.

The high price tag for braces and Invisalign has traditionally made teeth alignment a major financial burden. And since it's mostly a strictly cosmetic operation it's not covered by certain health insurers and when they do they usually pay only a portion of the bill.

The price point especially compared to conventional treatments is a major advantage of home teeth straightening systems such as bytes. For a significant percentage of individuals the advent of at-home teeth alignment technology has expanded access to orthodontic care. Usually home aligner devices cost $1500 to $2000 much more economical than Invisalign which can cost $3000 to $8000.

While Byte is much cheaper than braces or Invisalign not everyone sits under their mattress or in a sock drawer for $1895. Byte provides a few flexible payment options in an attempt to make care more financially available.

Interested in funding but worried about your loan score? The Byte is one of three providers with an acceptance rate of 100 percent. A $349 down payment followed by $83 per month for 29 months is required by their financing plan called bytepayTM. However pick Byte At-Night and that increases to a down payment of $449 then $99 per month.

Final Verdict On Byte Aligners: Why I Recommend It?

Orthodontic care is an expense so without understanding that it will achieve the desired results you don't want to commit to a specific firm or brand. Read on to see what sort of outcomes you can expect from a procedure with bytes.

The Byte is designed to overcome basic misalignment problems such as slight spacing and crowding like other home-based transparent aligner treatment products. It does not have the potential to achieve substantial motions of the teeth and jaw with more serious conditions such as bite misalignments. This is why the impression kit is so valuable and dentists from Byte will be upfront with you about whether or not their care will deliver the outcomes you want.

Byte's remote dental team can fix most mild to moderate dental misalignments including crowding spacing and slight bite problems safely and efficiently. The company offers a 3D preview of your ""after"" shot to ensure that Byte is a good choice for you how your teeth will look aftercare. If you like what you see they will automatically manufacture and ship your aligners. But there is no requirement to proceed if you have questions.

The use of technology to increase the efficacy of care is something that makes Byte stand out from other businesses including Invisalign. In the industry they are continuously trying to blaze new paths and have built two main innovations that no other business offers: Smile Science and HyperByte.

A big aspect of your facial features is your smile so it's not a separate entity. To build your distinctive and beautiful appearance your teeth nose eyes cheeks and chin all work together and Byte understands this. Separate from your other facial attributes other businesses handle your teeth on their own but bytes do not.

The treatment development program for Smile Science is very special. Rather than just your teeth it analyzes your entire facial structure (like most other companies including Invisalign). Special training techniques that follow the treatment procedures outlined by Dr. John Marashi the byte founder and Chief Cosmetic Dentist are also used.

But how does Byte accomplish these tailored and amazing improvements so quickly? They accomplish such improvements with HyperByte. It might sound like the name of a comic book but HyperByte works and is validated by studies and findings. The HyperByte tool helps move your teeth faster using gentle high-frequency vibrations for five minutes a day while maintaining relaxed better-fitting alignments. The Byte is the only company providing a tool like HyperByte for home alignment.

Shrinkage calculations offer little if any insights into the root causes of loss. As the complexity of retailing continues to accelerate the capacity to assimilate data and the range of risks retail now faces have increased considerably. Relying upon this single measure of loss to guide strategy is increasingly anachronistic.

Championed by the Retail Industry Leaders Association the Total Retail Loss concept offers a much more progressive and inclusive approach to understanding how retail risks impact profitability. This webinar makes the case for why adopting this concept will enable retailers to develop a strategic approach to not only recognizing the true cost of retail loss but also how to return value to the bottom line. However this path includes many challenges through the change needed in retail.

The tech giant had planned to pack Stadia with original content announcing two years ago that it was hiring hundreds of game developers and starting studios in Los Angeles and Montreal.

But those teams barely had time to get started before they were dismissed earlier this month as Google shut down in-house game development.

From the beginning Google’s approach to video games wasn’t very Google-like. The Alphabet company tends to launch bare-bones products and test them as they grow. With Stadia it came out big. Flashy press conferences and ad campaigns promised high-quality games with innovative features playable on Android smartphones or on the TV through Chromecast. Gamers would have access to a library of exclusive titles and well-known favorites like Assassin’s Creed without having to dish out $500 for Sony’s PlayStation or Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox.

So when Stadia launched in 2019 gamers were expecting the complete package not the beta model. While the cloud streaming technology was there playing to Google’s strengths the library of games was underwhelming and many of the promised features nonexistent. Other platforms offer hundreds of games a year but Stadia offers fewer than 80 according to Mat Piscatella an analyst at the NPD Group which tracks video game sales data.

Players also didn’t like Stadia’s business model which required customers to buy games individually rather than subscribe to an all-you-can-play service à la Netflix or the Xbox’s Game Pass. Paying as much as $60 for a single game for it only to exist on Google’s servers rather than on your own PC seemed a stretch to some. After all the hype gamers were disappointed. Stadia missed its targets for sales of controllers and monthly active users by hundreds of thousands according to two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokesperson declined to comment for this story.

“I think it would be fair to say the messaging leading up to and around the launch was inconsistent” with the final product Piscatella says.

Stadia’s struggles are a warning sign for other prospective video game streaming services. Microsoft and Amazon.com both deep-pocketed major technology companies with experience in video games have ambitions in the area with their respective xCloud and Luna offerings. But those products have rolled out gradually rather than promising to be console-killers keeping expectations in check.

It didn’t have to be this way. Google actually had a beta version of Stadia in 2018. Called Project Stream it allowed users to play Ubisoft Entertainment SA’s popular game Assassin’s Creed Odyssey in the tab of a Chrome browser. Fans were impressed.

The following year at the Game Developers Conference Phil Harrison who is in charge of Stadia unveiled what he called the “future of gaming.” He promised that Stadia would be more powerful than PlayStation or Xbox. He showed off innovative features like State Share which would allow users to take snapshots of their games and share them with friends allowing those friends to jump into the same game exactly where they had left off.

The prospects were exciting to fans and pundits who predicted that Stadia could dominate the market offering many of the same games as Xbox and PlayStation without the hefty price tag.

But all the buildup had some developers within Stadia worried according to people familiar with the matter. Their deadline to ship the platform in the fall of 2019 wouldn’t allow them to deliver what players expected they said. They argued that Google should position the launch as another beta test. After all Google’s most successful products had followed a similar approach. Gmail was officially in beta testing for five years for example as the company continued to tweak and refine it.

There was resistance from Harrison and others on the Stadia leadership team many of whom had come from the world of traditional console development and wanted to follow the route they knew.

Harrison had positioned Stadia as a traditional gaming platform full of bells and whistles but that didn’t mesh with Google’s own mantra to “think big but start small” as detailed in a 2011 blog post by longtime Google executive Susan Wojcicki now chief executive officer of YouTube. “Watching users ‘in the wild’ as they use our products is the best way to find out what works then we can act on that feedback” she wrote. “It’s much better to learn these things early and be able to respond than to go too far down the wrong path.”

A British video game industry veteran Harrison was a prominent face at both PlayStation and Xbox during their worst console launches — the overpriced PlayStation 3 and badly managed Xbox One. He joined Google in 2018 as vice president of Stadia.

His team wooed big-name publishers like Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. shelling out tens of millions of dollars to get games like Red Dead Redemption II on Stadia according to two people familiar with the deals. The amount of money Google was willing to spend came as a shock to veteran game developers but even that wasn’t enough. Video game platforms live or die on exclusive content. So Harrison also brought in Jade Raymond a veteran executive who has worked on Assassin’s Creed and Star Wars to start building an in-house development division.

When Stadia officially released on Nov. 19 2019 it left critics scratching their heads. The library of games was small and mostly old with none of Google’s exclusives available yet. Most of the features Harrison promised were not actually there such as the State Share concept. The platform was only available through a $130 kit that included a special controller and Chromecast. Gaming website Kotaku called the marketing “random and terrible” and the platform failed to catch on. In fact the company produced so many more Stadia controllers than it had demand for that last year it gave them away for free.

Despite the tepid launch there was optimism among Stadia’s developers that they could win over fans with exclusive games so long as Google gave them time to thrive. They were excited about game prototypes that could only work on a cloud platform pushing memory limits with computer-driven artificial intelligence. One prototype according to people familiar with the plans was described as a cross between a Google Assistant and a Tamagotchi pet allowing players to interact with smart creatures in all sorts of fun ways.

Then on Feb. 1 Google suddenly pulled the plug on in-house development. Stadia will still exist as a service and continue to offer third-party games that are also available on other platforms. But without exclusives Stadia has little hope of competing with big consoles or building an audience of millions. It seems unlikely to be the “future of gaming” that Harrison had promised.

While Stadia didn’t seem to follow the traditional Google playbook without some drastic changes it could still face a pretty Googley outcome: being added to the long list of products that Google has killed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93aGF0LW1ha2VzLXdhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LXJlYWxseS1zcGVjaWFsLTE1NDE1NjIwMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What makes Warren Buffett really special,"Warren Buffett is still at it. Having received his COVID-19 vaccine recently (two Pfizer shots according to Bloomberg) Buffett 90 isn’t slowing down much (at least mentally) and seems poised to lead his company into the post-pandemic world.

In his highly-anticipated annual letter to shareholders released at 8 a.m. ET on the dot this morning Warren Buffett one of the world’s richest people—equally blessed with wit and sagacity (more on that in a bit)—waxed on about the virtues (and blemishes) of the conglomerate he controls Berkshire Hathaway the nation’s sixth largest company.

Some of us were expecting well more news from Buffett today. A big acquisition. A scathing rebuke of crypto or SPACs. A succession announcement (more on that too.) But none of that.

August 30th 2020 - Warren Buffett celebrates his 90th birthday. He was born in Omaha Nebraska on August 30th 1930. - File Photo by: zz/NPX/STAR MAX/IPx 2008 10/22/08 Warren Buffett at ""The Women's Conference"" held on October 22 2008 in Long Beach CA. (zz/NPX/STAR MAX/IPx)

Instead there was a tour of America through the companies that Berkshire controls. Some extolling of Berkshire’s Apple investment. A $24.7 billion stock buyback. Oh and the Berkshire annual meeting will be in LA this year presumably to spare Buffett’s 97-year-old partner Charlie Munger from having to travel and so Buffett and Munger can appear together unlike last year. But since the meeting is virtual the change in geography isn’t particularly momentous for Berkshire shareholders.

The meeting will be livestreamed by your favorite business news website (AKA Yahoo Finance) for the sixth consecutive year on Saturday May 1st. (Be there!)

It’s been a relatively quiet year for Buffett. I’ve been communicating with him (and some other Berkshire folks) a bit during the pandemic mostly about the Berkshire meeting but that’s been about it. Buffett told me he wouldn’t be doing an interview with me this March before the annual meeting (or any interviews with other news outlets for that matter) as he has done in previous years. I thought that was significant because Buffett is a creature of habit but I guess not.

Buffett suggested that ""...with what I’m writing” there could be a “record-breaking crowd” watching the livestream and that “[CNBC’s] Becky [Quick] will be inundated with questions.” I’m not sure exactly what he was referring to but I do know there will be a boatload of questions for Buffett and Munger because there always are.

'Berkshire doesn’t need me'

Let’s shift gears here and talk about succession at Berkshire because some were anticipating that Buffett would make an announcement in that department today. Instead he made no mention.

Last year the only other person sitting up on the stage with Buffett in the otherwise empty CHI Health Center in Omaha was Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel. (Buffett’s daughter Susie my wife and I were the only audience.) Charlie Munger would have been on the dais too but instead stayed in California because of the pandemic. Ditto for Berkshire Vice Chairman Ajit Jain who lives outside New York City.

Story continues

It will be interesting to see who’s on stage with Buffett this year. It’s almost as fun as checking out the review stand at one of those Soviet Union military parades back in the Cold War (though in this case it may be more a matter of the pandemic inhibiting travel than who’s up or who’s down.)

Discerning whether Abel or Jain will get the nod to succeed Buffett has been a parlor game amongst Berkshire watchers since 2018 when they were both named vice chairmen. Along with many others I think it may be the former because Abel 58 is a decade younger than Jain who turns 70 in July. Also Abel is more well able (really has more experience) when it comes to mergers and acquisitions which is a big part of Berkshire’s M.O. Finally the non-insurance operations which Abel oversees have historically accounted for some 80% of Berkshire’s profit.

Another horse in the race is Berkshire investment manager Todd Combs 50 now also CEO of the company's insurance giant GEICO. Or it could be an outsider who knows.

Buffett has known for a long time that succession would be his most important job—or maybe his second most important after first building Berkshire.

How long?

Well I realize I’ve been bugging Buffett about succession for almost 20 years. Amazingly even then the question was old hat. This is from a story I wrote on Buffett from 2002.

“I ask him the inevitable question of succession. Or put less delicately what happens when he dies? Buffett has been through this a million times and he has a million lines—’I hope the stock doesn't go up too much’ being one of his favorites. But this time he turns serious. ‘Look this company is going to outlast me for years to come’ he says. ‘These businesses are going to run for 50 years. We have a great team of managers. They know how this company works. It's pretty simple really.’”

Buffett was 72 at the time. He turns 91 in August.

In 2012 I interviewed Buffett along with Fortune’s Carol Loomis who edits Buffett’s shareholder letter and asked him about retirement:

“If I die tonight tomorrow morning there will be a CEO named and the board knows exactly who it is. If for some reason that person is unavailable they know another one. I mean it's what we spend the majority of our time on.”

Note the italics I added: (“...what we spend the majority of our time on.”) In 2012. This ladies and gentleman was not a spur of the moment decision. It’s also critical to note that if Buffett had a plan in 2012 and a person in mind to succeed him then it might be a different plan and person nine years later.

Here’s some more thinking on the subject from two years ago:

“The point is that Buffett’s had years and years to consider what happens after he’s no longer here. In fact I can’t think of a single CEO president or even dictator who’s had more time to plan for succession. (Well maybe Fidel Castro but he ended up just picking his brother!)""

""So here you have maybe the smartest executives on the planet acutely aware of the stakes (he has some 389000 employees over a million shareholders and even more fans) with plenty of time to make what will amount to the decision of his lifetime. It’s a big deal his biggest deal and he knows it. I think that makes Berkshire succession a good bet.”

Buffett has been continuously assuring shareholders that he is not indispensable.

“Berkshire doesn’t need me” Buffett told me last March in Omaha. “We’ve got somebody that’s extremely better than I am in many many many respects to succeed me.”

And this to shareholders: “Your company is 100% prepared for our departure.""

And this from last August on Buffett’s 90th birthday where I noted:

“Of course everyone always asks what will happen to Berkshire once Buffett finally does retire or pass on. Buffett has heard this 90 million times and for decades. And he’s been working on succession and for decades. As my colleague Sam Ro points out it’s almost as if Buffett wants us to focus on his succession plan because it draws more attention to Berkshire something Buffett has been unapologetically P.T. Barnumesque about.""

“And who’s to say the torch can’t be passed smoothly? Steve Jobs certainly did right by Apple when he picked Tim Cook a point not lost on Buffett particularly now that he owns $120 billion of Apple stock worth almost 25% of Berkshire’s market value.” [BTW that Apple holding has been reduced a bit but those numbers are still pretty close.]

Significantly though Munger said back in 2018 that “shareholders can probably expect another seven years for Mr. Buffett as CEO.”

Of course things could change but if they don’t that would bring us to 2025. So we might have four more years of speculation!

Buffett’s sagacity

Let’s return to the shareholder letter. For those of us who count ourselves as Warren Buffett freaks reading through his annual letter has become something of a late February tradition. As I said Buffett loves rituals which in this case means a press release has already come out mid-week announcing the coming of the letter which drops like clockwork on Saturday morning. And then….WOOSH (as Tom Wolfe might write) thousands of us pore through it for the takeaways; breaking news and big Berkshire moves as well as manifestos on topics of the day.

Because Buffett has been mum since his four hour and 28 minute straight without a break tour de force annual meeting soliloquy and Q and A last spring there are a number of topics he hasn’t really weighed in on including the election as well as the pandemic and the economic recovery.

Many of us would be curious also to hear from Buffett on Black Lives Matter and systemic racism and Reddit Robinhood and GameStop madness SPACs the resurgence of crypto never mind the underperformance of BRK stock plus buying back his own shares. All of which made this year’s letter and the upcoming meeting that much more anticipated.

We heard Munger’s views on some of these topics just this week when Buffett’s 97-year-old partner answered questions from Yahoo Finance’s Julia LaRoche at the Daily Journal Annual Meeting (VOD here.) Charlie most notably bashed Robinhood saying the brokerage was essentially selling “gambling services” and that its business model is “a dirty way to make money.” Ouch.

Buffett didn’t weigh in much on Robinhood and the like but I expect he will be asked about it on May 1st. Still today’s letter like the 55 that have come before it contains all manner of deep thinking and analysis. And that’s why after speed-reading the letter along with everyone else this morning I go back over it again after the smoke clears for something deeper. Sort of like I come for the news but I stay for the wisdom.

Which brings us back to something I noted in the beginning of this article about Buffett’s sagacity because that’s at the core of what makes him special. It’s worth digging into that a bit particularly as it relates to the rest of us less-wise because wisdom is really what sets Buffett apart from other investors CEOs and business leaders.

It seems to me that wisdom is the intersection of being smart and being right. It goes without saying that all kinds of smart people make the wrong choices. (Enron senior management comes to mind.) Other people do the right thing but not because they are smart. (Like winning the lottery.) Being both smart and making the right decisions and doing so consistently is rare. Which speaks to a third element of wisdom experience which really means being smart and right over time.

Who else besides Buffett has wisdom? Well Buffett’s partner Charlie Munger though it’s a slightly different flavor and perhaps Buffett’s pal Bill Gates. There are others of course maybe like Nobel Prize winner Jennifer Doudna as well as writer Chimamanda Adichie and maybe even National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman—though she’s still pretty young.

While these individuals get their due I sometimes wonder if we in America don’t really revere wise people enough. We love our renegades and rogues entrepreneurs or “the crazy ones” as Steve Jobs called them. There’s a narrative arc here too. Successful people often start off as rebels and we love them. Then once they become successful or too successful—John D. Rockefeller Buffett Gates or Mark Zuckerberg come to mind—we tear them down. Not that in many cases they don’t deserve some tearing. It’s just that it’s become a naive blanket reflex.

Social media now makes it that much easier to berate and belittle folks like Gates and Buffett. Again I’m all for calling out hypocrisy and double-dealing but some of the things trolls say about Gates and Buffett on Twitter reflects poorly on us as a nation and as people.

It’s probably the case that in China that wise people are revered more than rebels even wise businesspeople which may be why Buffett is appreciated in China in a way that I sometimes think he isn’t in the U.S.

Which isn’t to say there aren’t multitudes of Americans who respect and even cherish Warren Buffett. It’s just that I think it’s almost in spite of ourselves we do.

Thomas Tull one-time Hollywood mogul now part owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers is an unabashed fan though. Tull now operates a holding company Tulco structured a bit well like Berkshire Hathaway (though Tull insists he’s not “in the same paragraph” as Buffett and Munger). In any event Tull did get a chance to speak with Buffett not long ago and was on the receiving end of some wisdom.

“I had the privilege of sitting with Warren for almost two hours in his office in Omaha” recalls Tull “and there was a moment where I was describing the business model and how I thought about something and I said ‘we're trying to be smart about…’ and he stopped me and said: ‘I gotta be honest. For years Charlie and I have always asked ‘What's the dumb thing we could do here?’ And I kind of laughed and he said ‘No I'm dead serious. We always ask. We don't want to be in the clever pile. What could we do here? That would be the dumb thing and how do we avoid it?’ Honestly it actually has had a fair amount of impact on the way that I assess and think about situations. It's something that I'll treasure forever.”

And wisdom Tull will never forget.

Here’s hoping that Buffett keeps delivering it. And that we appreciate it. Until 2025 and beyond.

Some of its domestic schemes such as SBI Focused Equity already invest a part of their portfolio in international stocks. The new scheme will feed into the Amundi Funds - US Pioneer Fund which is domiciled in Luxembourg.

According to a presentation from SBI MF the underlying fund has delivered returns of 16.27% (compound annual growth rate) in euro terms beating its benchmark S&P 500 Index return of 16.16% (as of 31 January). The underlying fund has a size of $2.5 billion.

“Typically most investments of Indian investors happen in Indian stocks. Global investments will offer strong diversification benefits. The underlying fund has most of today’s fast-growing tech companies and follows a strict environmental social governance (ESG) philosophy"" said D.P. Singh chief business officer SBI Mutual Fund.

Rupee depreciation against the dollar tends to enhance the returns of international funds.

According to the SBI MF presentation the rupee has depreciated by 3.29% against the dollar per year on average (a rolling three-year CAGR basis). The three-year correlation between the India and US market is relatively low at 0.6 it added. A low correlation means that the two assets perform at different times reducing the fluctuation in an investor’s portfolio.

IT is the largest sector in the underlying fund with a weight of 37.3% followed by consumer discretionary stocks at 15%. The five largest holdings are Microsoft Apple Alphabet Amazon and Visa (as of 31 January). The expense ratio of the underlying fund as well as the feeder fund combined is capped at 2.25% per annum.

Experts asked investors to evaluate all the options for international investing before picking the new launch.

“While geographic diversification is important there are a range of low-cost options available in this area. Investors should consider these including funds with an established track record before making a decision"" said Kirtan Shah chief financial planner at Sykes and Ray Equities (I) Ltd.

A number of actively managed funds as well as passively managed exchange-traded funds in India track the US market. Shah also warned that some of the strong performance of international funds in the recent past may not be repeated. Over the past decade the Nasdaq index has delivered returns of around 25% CAGR in rupee terms.

GOOG,Alphabet Inc,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yNy9nb29nbGUtc3RhZGlhLXZpZGVvLWdhbWUtc3RyZWFtaW5nLXJlYWxpdHktY2hlY2stY29uc29sZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Google's Stadia video game service hit turbulence,"Google’s streaming video game service Stadia had ambitious plans to disrupt the gaming industry which is dominated by consoles. The tech giant had planned to pack Stadia with original content announcing two years ago that it was hiring hundreds of game developers and starting studios in Los Angeles and Montreal.

But those teams barely had time to get started before they were dismissed earlier this month as Google shut down in-house game development.

From the beginning Google’s approach to video games wasn’t very Google-like. The Alphabet company tends to launch bare-bones products and test them as they grow. With Stadia it came out big. Flashy press conferences and ad campaigns promised high-quality games with innovative features playable on Android smartphones or on the TV through Chromecast. Gamers would have access to a library of exclusive titles and well-known favorites like Assassin’s Creed without having to dish out $500 for Sony’s PlayStation or Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox.

So when Stadia launched in 2019 gamers were expecting the complete package not the beta model. While the cloud streaming technology was there playing to Google’s strengths the library of games was underwhelming and many of the promised features nonexistent. Other platforms offer hundreds of games a year but Stadia offers fewer than 80 according to Mat Piscatella an analyst at the NPD Group which tracks video game sales data.

Players also didn’t like Stadia’s business model which required customers to buy games individually rather than subscribe to an all-you-can-play service à la Netflix or the Xbox’s Game Pass. Paying as much as $60 for a single game for it only to exist on Google’s servers rather than on your own PC seemed a stretch to some. After all the hype gamers were disappointed. Stadia missed its targets for sales of controllers and monthly active users by hundreds of thousands according to two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokesperson declined to comment for this story.

“I think it would be fair to say the messaging leading up to and around the launch was inconsistent” with the final product Piscatella says.

Stadia’s struggles are a warning sign for other prospective video game streaming services. Microsoft and Amazon.com both deep-pocketed major technology companies with experience in video games have ambitions in the area with their respective xCloud and Luna offerings. But those products have rolled out gradually rather than promising to be console-killers keeping expectations in check.

It didn’t have to be this way. Google actually had a beta version of Stadia in 2018. Called Project Stream it allowed users to play Ubisoft Entertainment SA’s popular game Assassin’s Creed Odyssey in the tab of a Chrome browser. Fans were impressed.

The following year at the Game Developers Conference Phil Harrison who is in charge of Stadia unveiled what he called the “future of gaming.” He promised that Stadia would be more powerful than PlayStation or Xbox. He showed off innovative features like State Share which would allow users to take snapshots of their games and share them with friends allowing those friends to jump into the same game exactly where they had left off.

The prospects were exciting to fans and pundits who predicted that Stadia could dominate the market offering many of the same games as Xbox and PlayStation without the hefty price tag.

But all the buildup had some developers within Stadia worried according to people familiar with the matter. Their deadline to ship the platform in the fall of 2019 wouldn’t allow them to deliver what players expected they said. They argued that Google should position the launch as another beta test. After all Google’s most successful products had followed a similar approach. Gmail was officially in beta testing for five years for example as the company continued to tweak and refine it.

There was resistance from Harrison and others on the Stadia leadership team many of whom had come from the world of traditional console development and wanted to follow the route they knew.

Harrison had positioned Stadia as a traditional gaming platform full of bells and whistles but that didn’t mesh with Google’s own mantra to “think big but start small” as detailed in a 2011 blog post by longtime Google executive Susan Wojcicki now chief executive officer of YouTube. “Watching users ‘in the wild’ as they use our products is the best way to find out what works then we can act on that feedback” she wrote. “It’s much better to learn these things early and be able to respond than to go too far down the wrong path.”

A British video game industry veteran Harrison was a prominent face at both PlayStation and Xbox during their worst console launches — the overpriced PlayStation 3 and badly managed Xbox One. He joined Google in 2018 as vice president of Stadia.

His team wooed big-name publishers like Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. shelling out tens of millions of dollars to get games like Red Dead Redemption II on Stadia according to two people familiar with the deals. The amount of money Google was willing to spend came as a shock to veteran game developers but even that wasn’t enough. Video game platforms live or die on exclusive content. So Harrison also brought in Jade Raymond a veteran executive who has worked on Assassin’s Creed and Star Wars to start building an in-house development division.

When Stadia officially released on Nov. 19 2019 it left critics scratching their heads. The library of games was small and mostly old with none of Google’s exclusives available yet. Most of the features Harrison promised were not actually there such as the State Share concept. The platform was only available through a $130 kit that included a special controller and Chromecast. Gaming website Kotaku called the marketing “random and terrible” and the platform failed to catch on. In fact the company produced so many more Stadia controllers than it had demand for that last year it gave them away for free.

Despite the tepid launch there was optimism among Stadia’s developers that they could win over fans with exclusive games so long as Google gave them time to thrive. They were excited about game prototypes that could only work on a cloud platform pushing memory limits with computer-driven artificial intelligence. One prototype according to people familiar with the plans was described as a cross between a Google Assistant and a Tamagotchi pet allowing players to interact with smart creatures in all sorts of fun ways.

Then on Feb. 1 Google suddenly pulled the plug on in-house development. Stadia will still exist as a service and continue to offer third-party games that are also available on other platforms. But without exclusives Stadia has little hope of competing with big consoles or building an audience of millions. It seems unlikely to be the “future of gaming” that Harrison had promised.

While Stadia didn’t seem to follow the traditional Google playbook without some drastic changes it could still face a pretty Googley outcome: being added to the long list of products that Google has killed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93aGF0LW1ha2VzLXdhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LXJlYWxseS1zcGVjaWFsLTE1NDE1NjIwMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What makes Warren Buffett really special,"Warren Buffett is still at it. Having received his COVID-19 vaccine recently (two Pfizer shots according to Bloomberg) Buffett 90 isn’t slowing down much (at least mentally) and seems poised to lead his company into the post-pandemic world.

In his highly-anticipated annual letter to shareholders released at 8 a.m. ET on the dot this morning Warren Buffett one of the world’s richest people—equally blessed with wit and sagacity (more on that in a bit)—waxed on about the virtues (and blemishes) of the conglomerate he controls Berkshire Hathaway the nation’s sixth largest company.

Some of us were expecting well more news from Buffett today. A big acquisition. A scathing rebuke of crypto or SPACs. A succession announcement (more on that too.) But none of that.

Instead there was a tour of America through the companies that Berkshire controls. Some extolling of Berkshire’s Apple investment. A $24.7 billion stock buyback. Oh and the Berkshire annual meeting will be in LA this year presumably to spare Buffett’s 97-year-old partner Charlie Munger from having to travel and so Buffett and Munger can appear together unlike last year. But since the meeting is virtual the change in geography isn’t particularly momentous for Berkshire shareholders.

The meeting will be livestreamed by your favorite business news website (AKA Yahoo Finance) for the sixth consecutive year on Saturday May 1st. (Be there!)

It’s been a relatively quiet year for Buffett. I’ve been communicating with him (and some other Berkshire folks) a bit during the pandemic mostly about the Berkshire meeting but that’s been about it. Buffett told me he wouldn’t be doing an interview with me this March before the annual meeting (or any interviews with other news outlets for that matter) as he has done in previous years. I thought that was significant because Buffett is a creature of habit but I guess not.

Buffett suggested that ""...with what I’m writing” there could be a “record-breaking crowd” watching the livestream and that “[CNBC’s] Becky [Quick] will be inundated with questions.” I’m not sure exactly what he was referring to but I do know there will be a boatload of questions for Buffett and Munger because there always are.

'Berkshire doesn’t need me'

Let’s shift gears here and talk about succession at Berkshire because some were anticipating that Buffett would make an announcement in that department today. Instead he made no mention.

Last year the only other person sitting up on the stage with Buffett in the otherwise empty CHI Health Center in Omaha was Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel. (Buffett’s daughter Susie my wife and I were the only audience.) Charlie Munger would have been on the dais too but instead stayed in California because of the pandemic. Ditto for Berkshire Vice Chairman Ajit Jain who lives outside New York City.

Story continues

It will be interesting to see who’s on stage with Buffett this year. It’s almost as fun as checking out the review stand at one of those Soviet Union military parades back in the Cold War (though in this case it may be more a matter of the pandemic inhibiting travel than who’s up or who’s down.)

Discerning whether Abel or Jain will get the nod to succeed Buffett has been a parlor game amongst Berkshire watchers since 2018 when they were both named vice chairmen. Along with many others I think it may be the former because Abel 58 is a decade younger than Jain who turns 70 in July. Also Abel is more well able (really has more experience) when it comes to mergers and acquisitions which is a big part of Berkshire’s M.O. Finally the non-insurance operations which Abel oversees have historically accounted for some 80% of Berkshire’s profit.

Another horse in the race is Berkshire investment manager Todd Combs 50 now also CEO of the company's insurance giant GEICO. Or it could be an outsider who knows.

Buffett has known for a long time that succession would be his most important job—or maybe his second most important after first building Berkshire.

How long?

Well I realize I’ve been bugging Buffett about succession for almost 20 years. Amazingly even then the question was old hat. This is from a story I wrote on Buffett from 2002.

“I ask him the inevitable question of succession. Or put less delicately what happens when he dies? Buffett has been through this a million times and he has a million lines—’I hope the stock doesn't go up too much’ being one of his favorites. But this time he turns serious. ‘Look this company is going to outlast me for years to come’ he says. ‘These businesses are going to run for 50 years. We have a great team of managers. They know how this company works. It's pretty simple really.’”

Buffett was 72 at the time. He turns 91 in August.

In 2012 I interviewed Buffett along with Fortune’s Carol Loomis who edits Buffett’s shareholder letter and asked him about retirement:

“If I die tonight tomorrow morning there will be a CEO named and the board knows exactly who it is. If for some reason that person is unavailable they know another one. I mean it's what we spend the majority of our time on.”

Note the italics I added: (“...what we spend the majority of our time on.”) In 2012. This ladies and gentleman was not a spur of the moment decision. It’s also critical to note that if Buffett had a plan in 2012 and a person in mind to succeed him then it might be a different plan and person nine years later.

Here’s some more thinking on the subject from two years ago:

“The point is that Buffett’s had years and years to consider what happens after he’s no longer here. In fact I can’t think of a single CEO president or even dictator who’s had more time to plan for succession. (Well maybe Fidel Castro but he ended up just picking his brother!)""

""So here you have maybe the smartest executives on the planet acutely aware of the stakes (he has some 389000 employees over a million shareholders and even more fans) with plenty of time to make what will amount to the decision of his lifetime. It’s a big deal his biggest deal and he knows it. I think that makes Berkshire succession a good bet.”

Buffett has been continuously assuring shareholders that he is not indispensable.

“Berkshire doesn’t need me” Buffett told me last March in Omaha. “We’ve got somebody that’s extremely better than I am in many many many respects to succeed me.”

And this to shareholders: “Your company is 100% prepared for our departure.""

And this from last August on Buffett’s 90th birthday where I noted:

“Of course everyone always asks what will happen to Berkshire once Buffett finally does retire or pass on. Buffett has heard this 90 million times and for decades. And he’s been working on succession and for decades. As my colleague Sam Ro points out it’s almost as if Buffett wants us to focus on his succession plan because it draws more attention to Berkshire something Buffett has been unapologetically P.T. Barnumesque about.""

“And who’s to say the torch can’t be passed smoothly? Steve Jobs certainly did right by Apple when he picked Tim Cook a point not lost on Buffett particularly now that he owns $120 billion of Apple stock worth almost 25% of Berkshire’s market value.” [BTW that Apple holding has been reduced a bit but those numbers are still pretty close.]

Significantly though Munger said back in 2018 that “shareholders can probably expect another seven years for Mr. Buffett as CEO.”

Of course things could change but if they don’t that would bring us to 2025. So we might have four more years of speculation!

Buffett’s sagacity

Let’s return to the shareholder letter. For those of us who count ourselves as Warren Buffett freaks reading through his annual letter has become something of a late February tradition. As I said Buffett loves rituals which in this case means a press release has already come out mid-week announcing the coming of the letter which drops like clockwork on Saturday morning. And then….WOOSH (as Tom Wolfe might write) thousands of us pore through it for the takeaways; breaking news and big Berkshire moves as well as manifestos on topics of the day.

Because Buffett has been mum since his four hour and 28 minute straight without a break tour de force annual meeting soliloquy and Q and A last spring there are a number of topics he hasn’t really weighed in on including the election as well as the pandemic and the economic recovery.

Many of us would be curious also to hear from Buffett on Black Lives Matter and systemic racism and Reddit Robinhood and GameStop madness SPACs the resurgence of crypto never mind the underperformance of BRK stock plus buying back his own shares. All of which made this year’s letter and the upcoming meeting that much more anticipated.

We heard Munger’s views on some of these topics just this week when Buffett’s 97-year-old partner answered questions from Yahoo Finance’s Julia LaRoche at the Daily Journal Annual Meeting (VOD here.) Charlie most notably bashed Robinhood saying the brokerage was essentially selling “gambling services” and that its business model is “a dirty way to make money.” Ouch.

Buffett didn’t weigh in much on Robinhood and the like but I expect he will be asked about it on May 1st. Still today’s letter like the 55 that have come before it contains all manner of deep thinking and analysis. And that’s why after speed-reading the letter along with everyone else this morning I go back over it again after the smoke clears for something deeper. Sort of like I come for the news but I stay for the wisdom.

Which brings us back to something I noted in the beginning of this article about Buffett’s sagacity because that’s at the core of what makes him special. It’s worth digging into that a bit particularly as it relates to the rest of us less-wise because wisdom is really what sets Buffett apart from other investors CEOs and business leaders.

It seems to me that wisdom is the intersection of being smart and being right. It goes without saying that all kinds of smart people make the wrong choices. (Enron senior management comes to mind.) Other people do the right thing but not because they are smart. (Like winning the lottery.) Being both smart and making the right decisions and doing so consistently is rare. Which speaks to a third element of wisdom experience which really means being smart and right over time.

Who else besides Buffett has wisdom? Well Buffett’s partner Charlie Munger though it’s a slightly different flavor and perhaps Buffett’s pal Bill Gates. There are others of course maybe like Nobel Prize winner Jennifer Doudna as well as writer Chimamanda Adichie and maybe even National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman—though she’s still pretty young.

While these individuals get their due I sometimes wonder if we in America don’t really revere wise people enough. We love our renegades and rogues entrepreneurs or “the crazy ones” as Steve Jobs called them. There’s a narrative arc here too. Successful people often start off as rebels and we love them. Then once they become successful or too successful—John D. Rockefeller Buffett Gates or Mark Zuckerberg come to mind—we tear them down. Not that in many cases they don’t deserve some tearing. It’s just that it’s become a naive blanket reflex.

Social media now makes it that much easier to berate and belittle folks like Gates and Buffett. Again I’m all for calling out hypocrisy and double-dealing but some of the things trolls say about Gates and Buffett on Twitter reflects poorly on us as a nation and as people.

It’s probably the case that in China that wise people are revered more than rebels even wise businesspeople which may be why Buffett is appreciated in China in a way that I sometimes think he isn’t in the U.S.

Which isn’t to say there aren’t multitudes of Americans who respect and even cherish Warren Buffett. It’s just that I think it’s almost in spite of ourselves we do.

Thomas Tull one-time Hollywood mogul now part owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers is an unabashed fan though. Tull now operates a holding company Tulco structured a bit well like Berkshire Hathaway (though Tull insists he’s not “in the same paragraph” as Buffett and Munger). In any event Tull did get a chance to speak with Buffett not long ago and was on the receiving end of some wisdom.

“I had the privilege of sitting with Warren for almost two hours in his office in Omaha” recalls Tull “and there was a moment where I was describing the business model and how I thought about something and I said ‘we're trying to be smart about…’ and he stopped me and said: ‘I gotta be honest. For years Charlie and I have always asked ‘What's the dumb thing we could do here?’ And I kind of laughed and he said ‘No I'm dead serious. We always ask. We don't want to be in the clever pile. What could we do here? That would be the dumb thing and how do we avoid it?’ Honestly it actually has had a fair amount of impact on the way that I assess and think about situations. It's something that I'll treasure forever.”

And wisdom Tull will never forget.

Here’s hoping that Buffett keeps delivering it. And that we appreciate it. Until 2025 and beyond.

Very nice! Sacha Baron Cohen won best actor in a musical or comedy for his starring role in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm at the 2021 Golden Globes on Sunday night.

This marked Cohen's fifth Golden Globe nomination (he also received a nom this year for his supporting role in The Trial of the Chicago 7) and second win. He beat out fellow nominees James Corden (The Prom) Lin-Manuel Miranda (Hamilton) Dev Patel (The Personal History of David Copperfield) and Andy Samberg (Palm Springs) and accepted the award right after Borat Subsequent Moviefilm won the best motion picture — musical or comedy statue.

Some of its domestic schemes such as SBI Focused Equity already invest a part of their portfolio in international stocks. The new scheme will feed into the Amundi Funds - US Pioneer Fund which is domiciled in Luxembourg.

According to a presentation from SBI MF the underlying fund has delivered returns of 16.27% (compound annual growth rate) in euro terms beating its benchmark S&P 500 Index return of 16.16% (as of 31 January). The underlying fund has a size of $2.5 billion.

“Typically most investments of Indian investors happen in Indian stocks. Global investments will offer strong diversification benefits. The underlying fund has most of today’s fast-growing tech companies and follows a strict environmental social governance (ESG) philosophy"" said D.P. Singh chief business officer SBI Mutual Fund.

Rupee depreciation against the dollar tends to enhance the returns of international funds.

According to the SBI MF presentation the rupee has depreciated by 3.29% against the dollar per year on average (a rolling three-year CAGR basis). The three-year correlation between the India and US market is relatively low at 0.6 it added. A low correlation means that the two assets perform at different times reducing the fluctuation in an investor’s portfolio.

IT is the largest sector in the underlying fund with a weight of 37.3% followed by consumer discretionary stocks at 15%. The five largest holdings are Microsoft Apple Alphabet Amazon and Visa (as of 31 January). The expense ratio of the underlying fund as well as the feeder fund combined is capped at 2.25% per annum.

Experts asked investors to evaluate all the options for international investing before picking the new launch.

“While geographic diversification is important there are a range of low-cost options available in this area. Investors should consider these including funds with an established track record before making a decision"" said Kirtan Shah chief financial planner at Sykes and Ray Equities (I) Ltd.

A number of actively managed funds as well as passively managed exchange-traded funds in India track the US market. Shah also warned that some of the strong performance of international funds in the recent past may not be repeated. Over the past decade the Nasdaq index has delivered returns of around 25% CAGR in rupee terms.

As Amazon lobbies for a higher minimum wage experts say that the company is not making its decisions solely out of the goodness of CEO Jeff Bezos' heart.

""Anyone who says Amazon is supporting the federal $15 minimum wage out of their good will toward workers has to somehow explain the fact that Amazon is dragging its feet every way it can on allowing unions to organize their workers"" Michael Farren an economist at the right-leaning think tank The Mercatus Center told Insider.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""Amazon is acting like a rational economic agent and trying to promote something that is relatively cost-less to it but gives it social street cred so to speak"" Farren added.

As a business Amazon is pushing for a $15 federal minimum wage for a number of strategic reasons. Here are three of the most critical factors that Amazon likely considered before lobbying for a higher minimum wage.

Paying workers more is good for business

Amazon has said that it pays workers $15 per hour because it is good for the company's bottom line.

""We believe $15 an hour is the minimum anyone in the U.S. should be paid for an hour of labor"" Jay Carney Amazon's senior vice president of global corporate affairs wrote in a blog post in late January. ""We also believe it's good for business.""

According to Carney Amazon raising minimum pay to $15 per hour had an immediate positive impact on morale and retention. Applications to hourly positions more than doubled Carney wrote in the post.

""Paying a $15 minimum helps the company to recruit and retain staff which is important for a growing business"" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders told Insider. ""This is probably not so much of an issue right now but before the pandemic hit there was very full employment and hiring staff was sometimes tough.""

However Amazon's success with paying workers more does not fully explain why the company is pushing for regulation that would require other companies to do the same. (Amazon did not respond to Insider's request for comment.)

Higher federal minimum wage would hurt Amazon's rivals including Walmart

A higher minimum wage won't hurt Amazon but it will impact the company's competitors.

""Amazon has already implemented a $15 minimum wage so it has little to fear from this becoming a federal minimum"" Saunders said. ""In fact it is to Amazon's commercial advantage if rival retailers also have to pay more – particularly Walmart.""

Farren said that consciously or unconsciously it makes sense that Amazon would push for regulation that would hurt competitors.

""It may sound a little cynical but it's probably pretty accurate that Amazon sees this as a tool to help it essentially drive a wedge against competitors — specifically against smaller competitors but also against Walmart itself who arguably is Amazon's largest competitor"" Farren said.

Amazon's reputation could use the boost

Progressive activists have criticized Amazon for its anti-union campaign as workers at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer Alabama attempt to unionize.

""Amazon is keen to show that it is treating workers fairly and well"" Saunders said. The company is often criticized for its working conditions and ""not all of that criticism is justified"" he added. ""So where it has a worker-friendly policy it is keen to showcase it.""

Farren said he believes that Amazon's aggressive advertising around raising the minimum wage and its anti-union campaign are closely linked.

""I'm sure Amazon is trying to make as much Amazon news in the press be about their support for the federal minimum wage rather than their reluctance to have unions start organizing their workforce"" Farren said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvYW1hem9uLXVuZGVyLWZpcmUtZm9yLXJlbW92aW5nLXRyYW5zZ2VuZGVyLXN0dWR5LTEyMzQ3MDI1MDcv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi9hbWF6b24tdW5kZXItZmlyZS1mb3ItcmVtb3ZpbmctdHJhbnNnZW5kZXItc3R1ZHktMTIzNDcwMjUwNy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Under Fire For Erasing From Its Sales Site Book Critical Of Transgender Movement,"Dear Mr. Bezos:

We write regarding Amazon’s recent political censorship activities particularly the decision to remove the book When Harry Became Sally by conservative scholar Ryan Anderson from the Amazon website Kindle and Audible platforms. Over the past 72 hours Amazon has been unable to provide a sufficient explanation as to how Anderson’s book which reached the top of two of Amazon’s best-seller lists before it was even released in 2018 supposedly violated a vague undefined ‘offensive content’ standard.

When Harry Became Sally prompted important discussions in the national media and among policymakers in 2018 and remains one of the most rigorously researched and compassionately argued books on this subject. By removing this book from its marketplaces and services Amazon has unabashedly wielded its outsized market share to silence an important voice merely for the crime of violating woke groupthink.

The internet is at its best when it is an open marketplace of ideas that brings people together to share learn from one another and engage in a range of commercial activities. Many Americans have come to rely on online retail more than ever before to meet their basic needs particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. In its decision to remove Mr. Anderson’s book from its platforms Amazon has openly signaled to conservative Americans that their views are not welcome on its platforms. Amazon’s shortsighted censorship of this well-researched and thoughtful contribution to modern American discourse is not just a decision made in poor taste but an assault on free speech that carries weighty implications for the future of open discourse in the digital age.

In its decision to remove Mr. Anderson’s book from its platforms Amazon neglected this duty and openly signaled to conservative Americans that their views are not welcome on its platforms. We request answers along with supporting documentation including communication with other technology companies and members of the Biden Administration to the following questions to clarify the intentions and extent of the actions taken by Amazon to censor speech:

Did Amazon have any discussions in 2018 before When Harry Became Sally was first published regarding the content as it related to your community standards? If so please provided documentation that explains why the book was allowed on the platform at the time.

What was the motivating factor behind Amazon’s decision to remove access to this book after hosting it for sale for over three years? Is this action part of a broader campaign against conservative material and voices on Amazon’s platforms?

Did the book violate an Amazon policy? If so please provide documentation related to the policy which passages Amazon identified as ‘offensive content’ and the step by step process under which the determination to remove the book was made.Did the policy change between 2018 and now? If so please provide documentation that led to the change and how publishers and sellers were notified of the change.

Was the author or the publisher of the book or given advance warning of the book’s removal from Amazon’s platforms? Were they provided with a reason for the removal or a form of recourse?

Amazon Web Services hosts countless websites related to religious politically conservative classically liberal and other content that falls outside the realm of acceptable woke groupthink. Are these sites at risk of being denied service by Amazon? How does the determination of which site to host compare to that of which books to remove from Amazon’s platforms?

We would appreciate a reply no later than March 9 2021. Thank you for your attention to this critical matter.

Amazon Kids — previously known as Amazon FreeTime — is a free suite of parental controls that lets parents set age filters educational goals and screen time limits by content type on Amazon Fire tablets.

With the new setting kids can explore on their own but their internet access is still filtered with built-in controls that block mature content and social media sites. The feature is optional and only works in the Amazon Kids browser; parents can still choose to limit browsing only to permitted sites view browsing history and turn off the browser altogether.

With the new browser setting in the Amazon Parent Dashboard Amazon is giving kids access to potentially the entire internet. Amazon envisions kids using the feature to do things like self-directed research for a school project. The company is betting the setting will be particularly useful while many children are still learning virtually and need access to more of the web for school content.

Amazon says kids’ browsing history is automatically deleted after 90 days.

Amazon Kids also includes an optional browser for kids that features tens of thousands of kid-safe websites and videos. To get more kid-friendly books movies TV shows educational apps Audible books and games parents can subscribe to Amazon Kids+ previously known as FreeTime Unlimited.

(CBSNewYork) -- A driver on Long Island who found undelivered Amazon packages left on the side of a road was hoping to get them to their rightful owners.

Kevin Harrington told CBS2's Carolyn Gusoff he was shocked by what Amazon told him to do.

Harrington a landscaper made the strange discovery in Huntington on Feb. 22.

""It's 20 odd undelivered Amazon Prime packages. So I try to do the right thing and I put it in my car. I take it to the 2nd [police] precinct"" he said.

Harrington said Suffolk Police advised him to contact Amazon. He did and was surprised by the company's response.

Amazon would not pick them up and told Harrington to ""dispose of the packages as you see fit.""

""They basically told me to keep the stuff and I just thought that that was an outrage. It's not my stuff to keep"" said Harrington.

Harrington said it posed a moral dilemma. He wasn't comfortable opening what other people were waiting for.

""Somebody ordered masks. They're waiting for it. I opened three packages and by the time I got to the third package I didn't want to open any more. It's not my stuff man"" he said.

The public weighed in with hundreds of comments on social media.

""Why isn't Amazon concerned the packages were not delivered?"" one user wrote.

Amazon replaced her order. But the original which was left on the side of a road was marked as delivered.

CBS2 reached out to Amazon which said it's investigating and customer service teams are in the process of retrieving the packages.

An Amazon spokesperson sent the following statement to CBS2:

We have high standards for delivery service partners and expect every package to be handled with care. We've notified the right teams internally and will work with the customer(s) directly on matters related to their package delivery.

The U.S. Postal Service confirmed the packages that were dumped were not theirs.

""If you're going to get into this business act like the post office. The post office would have had postal police here by now investigating this"" said Harrington.

Suffolk Police are investigating. On Friday afternoon Harrington was directed to return the packages to the precinct.

Harrington also pointed out opening someone else's mail is a crime and wondered why no one seemed to care about the privacy of the packages until now."

While global air travel shows only slow signs of recovery flights to Cozumel from the USA are booming with 153% increase in the number of direct flights in just 3 months.

In the first week of December there were 17 nonstop flights from US airports to the island. Next week no fewer than 43 are expected an increase of 153%. This is back to the same number of flights as a year ago albeit from different airports and with different frequencies.

Popular flight routes such as Dallas Houston and Miami have steadily increased in frequency over the 2020/2021 winter season but 3 new routes to Cozumel were also launched in February with Frontier Airlines beginning new nonstop flights to the island from Denver and Chicago and American Airlines starting a new direct route from Philadelphia.

Although not all flights are arriving full and there are currently no flights from Canada the number of people traveling through Cozumel airport has remained robust with 27723 passengers in December and 24643 January according to figures released earlier this month by ASUR the company that owns and operates the island's air terminal.

The island's position as a leader in Safe Travel standards; relatively low numbers of COVID cases; easy access to COVID tests for passengers returning to the USA; and the chance to enjoy the island while it is quiet without cruise ships have all been highlighted as reasons so many people still want to fly to Cozumel. Not to mention the usual attractions of great weather friendly people amazing beaches and delicious food and drink of course.

In addition with the suspension of Caribbean cruises many tourists that planned to visit Cozumel for one day on a ship have chosen to fly in and vacation on the island for longer instead. This week one such visitor from Virginia told This is Cozumel ""I’m excited to visit for an extended time not just on a cruise ship!""

And the island is not just proving popular with Americans local media have reported that Spanish airline Evelop part of the Barceló hotel group will start new direct flights from Madrid to Cozumel in June or July when it is hoped European tourists will start to travel more again too.

Flightradar24 suggested the flight had flown 11+ hours nonstop from Honolulu and the reader wanted to know if that was even possible.

That’s not quite what happened it seems but there’s a pretty cool story behind this nonetheless.

Embraer E190 flies from Costa Rica to Australia

An Embraer E190 needed to be repositioned from Central America to Australia. Specifically until March 2020 the plane flew for Panama’s COPA Airlines and after being in storage for about a year in Costa Rica the plane will now join the fleet of Australia’s Alliance Airlines.

So how does an E190 fly from Central America to Australia? The plane with the registration code N998QQ completed the ~10200 mile journey in four segments:

The plane flew the ~2600 mile flight from San Jose to San Diego in a flight time of 4hr57min

The plane flew the ~2600 mile flight from San Diego to Honolulu in a flight time of 5hr19min

The plane flew the ~2300 mile flight from Honolulu to theMarshall Islands and the ~2700 mile flight from the Marshall Islands to Brisbane in a flight time of 11hr28min (the reader’s confusion stemmed from the fact that Flightradar24 was showing this as a nonstop flight when in fact it stopped to refuel)

Altogether the plane spent around 22hr in the air. It’s worth noting that there were some stops along the way — the plane was in San Diego for three nights then in Honolulu for one night and then just refueled in the Marshall Islands (I suspect the Honolulu stop was for crew rest while there might have been another reason for the San Diego stop since three days is longer than you’d usually need for crew rest).

An E190’s range is around 2800 miles though that assumes a significant payload. Given how empty the E190 likely was it could have flown significantly longer distances nonstop. Nonetheless given that this routing was primarily over water it makes sense that the pilots didn’t push the limits of the plane too much.

Alliance Airlines’ huge E190 plans

Brisbane-based Alliance Airlines has historically operated a fleet of up to 46 Fokker aircraft. However the airline is significantly increasing its fleet size with the acquisition of some used Embraer 190s. The airline is taking delivery of up to 30 of these including:

14 former COPA Airlines E190s

16 former American Airlines E190s

These are all still reasonably new planes — COPA took delivery of its E190s between 2005 and 2009 while American took delivery of its E190s between 2006 and 2013. So these planes are between eight and 16 years old. This is significantly younger than Alliance’s average fleet age otherwise which is around 28 years.

Alliance will use these planes both to bolster its own network and to increase its operations on behalf of other airlines. Historically Alliance has operated flights on behalf of both Qantas and Virgin Australia with Qantas even owning a 20% stake in Alliance.

Bottom line

Alliance Airlines is taking delivery of 30 Embraer E190s all of which are coming from the Americas. These planes have quite a journey to Brisbane — as you can see one plane stopped in San Diego Honolulu and the Marshall Islands and you can expect similar stops for future deliveries.

It’s always fascinating to see how aircraft are delivered around the world. An E190 is hardly logistically the most challenging plane to deliver since there are much shorter range aircraft.

Still pretty cool eh?"

In January 2014 power plants owned by Texas’ largest electricity producer buckled under frigid temperatures. Its generators failed more than a dozen times in 12 hours helping to bring the state’s electric grid to the brink of collapse.

The incident was the second in three years for North Texas-based Luminant whose equipment malfunctions during a more severe storm in 2011 resulted in a $750000 fine from state energy regulators for failing to deliver promised power to the grid.

In the earlier cold snap the grid was pushed to the limit and rolling blackouts swept the state spurring an angry legislature to order a study of what went wrong.

Experts hired by the Texas Public Utility Commission which oversees the state’s electric and water utilities concluded that power-generating companies like Luminant had failed to understand the “critical failure points” that could cause equipment to stop working in cold weather.

In May 2014 the PUC sought changes that would require energy companies to identify and address all potential failure points including any effects of “weather design limits.”

Luminant argued against the proposal.

In comments to the commission the company said the requirement was unnecessary and “may or may not identify the ‘weak links’ in protections against extreme temperatures.”

To support our nonprofit environmental journalism please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How

“Each weather event [is] dynamic” company representatives told regulators. “Any engineering analysis that attempted to identify a specific weather design limit would be rendered meaningless.”

By the end of the process the PUC agreed to soften the proposed changes. Instead of identifying all possible failure points in their equipment power companies would need only to address any that were previously known.

The change which experts say has left Texas power plants more susceptible to the kind of extreme and deadly weather events that bore down on the state last week is one in a series of cascading failures to shield the state’s electric grid from winter storms ProPublica and The Texas Tribune found.

Lawmakers and regulators including the PUC and the industry-friendly Texas Railroad Commission which regulates the oil and gas industry have repeatedly ignored dismissed or watered down efforts to address weaknesses in the state’s sprawling electric grid which is isolated from the rest of the country.

About 46000 megawatts of power — enough to provide electricity to 9 million homes on a high-demand day — were taken off the grid last week due to power-generating failures stemming from winter storms that battered the state for nearly seven consecutive days. Dozens of deaths including that of an 11-year-old boy have been tied to the weather. At the height of the crisis more than 4.5 million customers across the state were without power.

As millions of Texans endured days without power and water experts and news organizations pointed to unheeded warnings in a federal report that examined the 2011 winter storm and offered recommendations for preventing future problems. The report by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation concluded among other things that power companies and natural gas producers hadn’t properly readied their facilities for cold weather including failing to install extra insulation wind breaks and heaters.

Another federal report released three years later made similar recommendations with few results. Lawmakers also failed to pass measures over the past two decades that would have required the operator of the state’s main power grid to ensure adequate reserves to shield against blackouts provided better representation for residential and small commercial consumers on the board that oversees that agency and allowed the state’s top emergency-planning agency to make sure power plants were adequately “hardened” against disaster.

Experts and consumer advocates say the challenge to the 2014 proposal by Luminant and other companies which hasn’t been previously reported is an example of the industry’s outsize influence over the regulatory bodies that oversee them.

“Too often power companies get exactly what they want out of the PUC” said Tim Morstad associate director of AARP Texas. “Even well-intentioned PUC staff are outgunned by armies of power company lawyers and their experts. The sad truth is that if power companies object to something in this case simply providing information about the durability of certain equipment they are extremely likely to get what they want.”

Luminant representatives declined to answer questions about the company’s opposition to the weatherization proposal. PUC officials also declined to comment.

Michael Webber an energy expert and mechanical engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin said the original proposal could have helped in identifying trouble spots within the state’s power plants.

“Good engineering requires detailed understanding of the performance limits of each individual component that goes into a system” Webber said. “Even if 99.9 percent of the equipment is properly rated for the operational temperatures that one part out of 1000 can bring the whole thing down.”

Luminant defended its performance during last week’s deep freeze saying it produced about 25 percent to 30 percent of the power on the grid Monday and Tuesday compared with its typical market share of about 18 percent.

In a public statement officials said the company executed a “significant winter preparedness strategy to keep the electricity flowing during this unprecedented extended weather event.” They declined to disclose whether any of the company’s generating units failed during last week’s winter storms.

State officials are again promising reforms. Lawmakers have called on officials with the PUC and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas which operates the power grid that spans most of the state to testify at hearings later this week. Governor Greg Abbott has called on lawmakers to mandate the winterization of generators and power plants and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said he was launching an investigation into ERCOT and almost a dozen power companies including Luminant. Separately the PUC announced its own investigation into ERCOT.

Texas is the only state in the contiguous U.S. that operates its own electric grid making it difficult for other regions to send excess power in times of crisis especially when they are facing their own shortages as they were last week. All other states in the Lower 48 as well as peripheral areas of Texas are connected to one of two grids that span the eastern and western halves of the country.

Because Texas operates its own grid the state isn’t subject to federal oversight by FERC which can investigate power outages but can’t mandate reforms. Many energy experts say the very nature of the state’s deregulated electric market is perhaps most to blame for last week’s power crisis.

In Texas a handful of mega-utilities controlled the distribution and pricing of the power they produced until two decades ago when the legislature shifted to a system where companies would compete for customers on the open market. Lawmakers said the change would result in lower power bills and better service a promise that some experts and advocates say hasn’t been kept.

But under this system power companies aren’t required to produce enough electricity to get the state through crises like the one last week. In fact they are incentivized to ramp up generation only when dwindling power supplies have driven up prices.

Other states with deregulated power markets including California have made reforms and added additional safeguards after experiencing similar catastrophes.

“The fault on this one is at the feet of the legislature and the regulators for their failure to protect the people rather than profits the utility companies rather than investing millions of dollars in weatherization that had been recommended in review after review of these kinds of incidents” said Tom “Smitty” Smith a longtime Texas consumer advocate and environmental activist. “They have chosen not to do that because it would be too expensive for the utilities and ultimately to the consumers.”

‘We’ll be opportunistic’

Three years after the 2011 storms the Texas electric grid faced another major cold weather test when a polar vortex swept across the state. Freezing temperatures helped to knock out nearly 50 generating units at Texas power plants in the first week of 2014 bringing ERCOT perilously close to ordering rotating outages.

The event quickly faded from public attention because it was a near-miss that didn’t actually leave people without electricity or heat. But because the state had come so close to blackouts the North American Electric Reliability Corporation which has some authority to regulate power companies in the country launched an investigation. The probe found similar problems to those that dogged the state after the 2011 storms primarily equipment that failed to stand up to the freezing temperatures.

Despite the equipment failures that brought the electric grid to the brink of disaster the polar vortex was a financial windfall for power-generation companies. In the months that followed the storm some of the companies stressed to investors the financial benefits of the two days of cold weather and accompanying high energy prices.

“This business benefited significantly from increased basis and storage spreads during the polar vortex earlier this year” Joe McGoldrick an executive with Houston-based CenterPoint Energy said in a November 2014 earnings call. “To the extent that we get another polar vortex or whatever absolutely we’ll be opportunistic and take advantage of those conditions.”

A CenterPoint spokesperson said McGoldrick was the head of the company’s gas marketing division but has since left the company. She said that division was sold last year and had no role in responding to last week’s storms.

“The remarks made in 2014 do not reflect the core values of CenterPoint Energy” Natalie Hedde communications director said.

Texas has relied on the principle that higher prices will spur greater power generation when the state needs it most a structure that helps explain the persistence of blackouts said Ed Hirs a University of Houston energy expert.

In extreme weather events like last week’s freeze prices per megawatt hour jumped from an average of around $35 to ERCOT’s maximum of $9000.

Hirs said it’s in the power generators’ interest to “push ERCOT into a tight situation where price goes up dramatically.”

“They are giving generators incentive to withdraw service” he added. “How else do you get the price to go up?”

Texans have already been hit with sky-high bills since last week’s event with some climbing as high as $16000 according to The New York Times. At an emergency meeting Sunday the three-member PUC ordered electric companies to suspend disconnections for nonpayment and delay sending invoices or bill estimates.

Power companies weren’t the only ones that saw the 2014 event more as a success story than a sign of weakness.

ERCOT concluded that operators “handled a difficult situation well” and took “prompt and decisive actions” that had prevented system wide blackouts. In the “lessons learned” section of its final report the agency promoted the continuation of its winterization site visits which are not mandatory.

Winterization efforts were paying dividends in the form of fewer generating units falling victim to cold weather the report stated.

Federal regulators agreed. During a meeting of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners in February 2014 a month after the storm a top-ranking official from NERC stated that the response showed “industry is learning [and] using the resources and tools available to improve their preparations and operations of the grid during a significant weather event.”

But NERC’s investigation exposed problems that would bring Texas to a crisis point last week.

In the 2014 report NERC methodically laid out how power-generating equipment failed during the cold snap detailing 62 examples that included frozen circulating water that caused a supply loss and moisture in the air causing valves to freeze. In all those cold-related failures were responsible for the vast majority of lost power during the event the agency found.

The incident also highlighted the need to improve winter performance of natural gas pipelines which NERC found hampered the ability of gas-fired power plants to generate electricity. The agency declined to comment saying it doesn’t discuss investigations.

Natural gas and power generation are highly dependent on each other: Natural gas processing requires electricity which may be produced in turn by burning natural gas.

Citing preliminary figures from ERCOT that show natural-gas-fired power plants performed worse than those fueled by other types of energy during this year’s power crisis energy experts say producers and distributors of that fossil fuel played a major role in the catastrophe.

Natural gas producers and pipeline companies in Texas are regulated by the Railroad Commission.

R.J. DeSilva a spokesperson for the agency declined to say whether it requires natural gas producers and pipeline companies to weatherize wellheads or pipelines. He noted that poor road conditions made it impossible for crews from natural gas companies to inspect wells and said some producers reported “the inability to produce gas because they did not have power.”

Because so many homes are heated with natural gas fossil fuel plays a much more central role in the winter than it does in the hot summer months.

“When all this began millions of Texans wrapped their pipes to keep them from freezing and the Railroad Commission didn’t order — has never ordered — the gas companies the gas producers and gas pipeline companies … to wrap their pipes to protect them from freezing” said Smith the consumer advocate.

Failed legislation

After days of scrambling to address the myriad crises that pummeled his city last week former longtime state Representative Sylvester Turner — now mayor of Houston the state’s largest city — had a message for his former colleagues.

“You need to dust off my bill and you need to refile it” the Democrat said during a press conference Friday referring to legislation he filed in 2011 that would have required the PUC to ensure ERCOT maintained adequate reserve power to prevent blackouts. “Because it’s not about just holding hearings.”

The state’s deregulated market is to blame for the crisis according to some experts who say the catastrophe shows that the system ultimately prizes profits over people. But some of the architects of the system are doubling down.

In a blog post published last week on the website of U.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy former Texas Governor Rick Perry suggested that the current disaster was worth it if it keeps rates low and federal regulators from requiring changes to the system.

“Texans would be without electricity for longer than three days to keep the federal government out of their business” said Perry who was governor from 2000-15 and presided over the early days of energy deregulation in Texas. “Try not to let whatever the crisis of the day is take your eye off of having a resilient grid that keeps America safe personally economically and strategically.”

Perry who returned to his job on the board of Dallas-based pipeline giant Energy Transfer LP after serving as energy secretary in the Trump administration received at least $141000 in campaign contributions from Luminant’s former parent company TXU Corp. between 2002 and 2009 when he was governor.

On Saturday Turner warned about the soaring residential utility bills that Texans would be getting in the coming weeks. In 2012 when Turner was still a state representative he wrote a letter to the then-chairman of the House State Affairs Committee raising concerns about PUC rule changes that increased the price caps companies could charge for power to $9000 per megawatt hour.

Those price caps remain the same today.

This time Turner called on lawmakers to pursue substantive reforms that don’t simply “scapegoat” ERCOT referring to the increasing calls for an investigation into the council including by Abbott. “You must include the Public Utility Commission in these reforms because they provide direct oversight over ERCOT and all of those commissioners are appointed by the governor” Turner said.

In 2013 Turner attempted unsuccessfully to pass a measure that would have replaced the governor’s appointees on the PUC with an elected commissioner. The same year he tried to salvage a measure that would have increased the administrative penalty for electric industry participants that violate state law or PUC rules.

The Texas Sunset Advisory Commission which audits state agencies every 12 years to determine how they can better function or if they should be abolished recommended in 2013 that the PUC exercise additional oversight of ERCOT including a review and approval of annual budgets and annual review of “PUC-approved performance measures tracking ERCOT’s operations.”

One of the recommendations called on the PUC to increase the administrative penalty to $100000 a day per violation stating that the $25000 daily penalty “may not be sufficient for violations that affect grid reliability which can cause serious grid failures such as blackouts.”

Lawmakers passed a bill during that year’s legislative session that adopted many of those recommendations but the change in penalties was left out. An amendment by Turner to restore the higher fee in the bill failed.

Another former Democratic lawmaker who now leads a major Texas city similarly tried and failed to pass legislation that would bring greater accountability to the state.

In 2015 Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson then a state representative authored a bill that would have required state agencies including the PUC to plan and budget for severe weather using state climatologist data.

“It would have forced state agencies to prepare for an event like what just happened and to account for that in their agency plans” Johnson said during a Thursday press conference addressing the crisis. “It was quite unfortunate because we can’t say that it would have prevented this situation but certainly may have.”

Then two years ago facilities owned or controlled by utilities regulated by the PUC were exempted from legislation that requires the Texas Division of Emergency Management to “identify methods for hardening utility facilities and critical infrastructure in order to maintain essential services during disasters.”

The bill’s author Republican state Representative Dennis Paul declined to comment. State Senator Eddie Lucio Jr. who co-sponsored the measure said he did not know why the PUC was exempted.

‘Demanding answers’

For the past two decades consumer groups have fought without success for a larger role in how the state manages its power grid. Giving residents a stronger presence on the ERCOT board would have forced the agency to take the lessons of extreme winter storms in 2011 and 2014 more seriously said Randall Chapman a ratepayer attorney and longtime consumer advocate.

“It would have changed things entirely” Chapman said. “Residential consumers are the ones who have been through outages before. They are the ones with the broken water pipes the ones freezing in their homes. They would be demanding answers.”

Chapman said the groups were stymied when the legislature agreed to reserve only a single seat on the ERCOT board for a representative of residential consumers. In comparison eight seats including alternates are filled by representatives of energy retailers power generators and investor-owned utility companies.

“Residential consumers need a stronger voice over at ERCOT” Morstad of AARP Texas said. “Decisions are made every week that affect the health and safety of millions of Texans. You need a strong voice there to call B.S. when companies aren’t following through on winterizing or other things that are critical to reliability of the electric system.”

In 2011 Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar co-authored a bill while serving in the state legislature that would have increased the size of the ERCOT board and allowed for more consumer representation. It didn’t pass.

Hegar said the failures displayed in the last week once again bring the significance of representation to the forefront.

“As a result of this extremely unfortunate event where so many people were out of power and now have damage to their homes and their businesses there needs to be a broader range of representation on the board and to bring those voices as we move forward in trying to decide what we want our electric grid to be” Hegar said.

The nation’s most deregulated energy economy was supposed to be a win for consumers and for energy companies nimble enough to do business in a bustling cacophonous market. But the cold snap — rare but by no means unprecedented — shattered it last week plunging consumers into misery and leaving a badly prepared and dislocated energy sector in pieces.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzI3L2FtZXJpY2FzLXBvd2VyLWdyaWQtaXMtYnJva2VuLWhlcmVzLWhvdy10by1maXgtaXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,America's power grid is broken. Here's how to fix it,"Last week Texas was struck by a freakish winter storm one that left millions without electricity. Although much of the power grid has been restored there are still ongoing problems with the Texas infrastructure from plumbing issues to people struggling to find necessities like food and water. Yet the most immediate crisis was that Texas a state not accustomed to wintery weather left millions of people without heat in freezing temperatures. Texas public utilities at one point were less than five minutes away from a blackout that could have lasted weeks or months. Experts believe it will take months to fully calculate the death toll although so far nearly 80 deaths connected to the storm have been confirmed.

Republicans like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott have argued not surprisingly that the massive power outage somehow discredits left-wing policies. ""This shows how the Green New Deal would be a deadly deal for the United States of America"" Abbott told Fox News on Tuesday later adding that the problem was with ""[o]ur wind and our solar"" and claiming that it ""just shows that fossil fuel is necessary.""

Yet the reality about what went wrong and what can be done to prevent this kind of crisis experts agree is much more complicated. And it starts with understanding how our electricity grid works.

The American electrical grid which The Wall Street Journal described in 2016 as ""one of the engineering marvels of modern history"" can be traced back to the modern concept of power grid designs. Those in turn originated in the late 1800s according to Dr. Alexis Kwasinksi an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Pittsburgh's Swanson School of Engineering. The goal was to provide electricity to as many people as possible at the lowest possible cost.

""The solution for such a design problem led to the power grid concept in which a few large power plants provide electricity to many more but much smaller loads located sometimes hundred of miles away from the power plants"" Kwasinski told Salon by email. ""One of the solutions to maintain system stability was to interconnect power plants and loads so they operate at an aggregated level."" As a result of this interconnected approach the United States developed long transmission lines across the various states so that power could be transmitted across great distances with low losses.

One problem with this approach Kwasinski explained is that because everything is interconnected all of the different loads receive the same quality of power. As a result it is expensive to alter power grids so that power can be allocated according to the needs of individual locations in ways that can prevent power outages or prioritize regions that have more urgent needs.

Kwasinski says that resilience was not an objective in designing power grids — at least not until now. ""It is only recently that society [has] started to demand higher power grid resilience"" he rued.

The problem is originally power grids were designed to meet the needs of the early 1900s. Even more modern power systems are planned decades in advance meaning that Texas' existing power grid is the result of planning processes made decades ago Kwasinski says.

""At that time (let's say in 2011) no planner knew that in February 2021 the state's power grid would be subject to such cold conditions even when there were brownouts during the winter of 2011 because of insufficient power generation"" he added. Texan engineers were thinking understandably that they needed to design with heat waves in mind not the kinds of winter storms you'd be more likely to encounter in the northeast.

Dr. Masoud Barati who is also an assistant professor at Pittsburgh's electrical and computer engineering department broke down for Salon exactly how things went wrong in Texas. He explained it within the context of the HVDC line or high-voltage direct current and what the primary operation of the existing HVDC was in Texas' Electric Reliability Council (ERCOT). He explained that in the Texas blackout there were five HVDC interconnections that ultimately amounted to 1.1 GW of ""tie-line capacity as interconnection with other neighbors states and countries."" This proved insufficient for two reasons: First ""the winter peak load recorded by ERCOT was 69150 MW and 34 GW loss of thermal and renewable generation resources"" meaning that ""the 1.1 GW HVDC cannot support the significant generation loss and load.""

In addition because Texas' neighbors were hit by the same storm and either almost maxed out their ability to generate energy or found that the amount of electricity generated was less than the amount demanded because most Texas homes used that electricity for heating.

Ironically although Gov. Abbott tried to argue that the winter storm and blackout somehow discredited a Green New Deal it in fact illustrated precisely why we need one.

""From a Green New Deal perspective we would want to have public utilities that prioritize public safety and resiliency and disaster readiness over the optimal price in a perfect market equilibrium situation and really nice weather so I think that's an important distinction"" Daniel Aldana Cohen associate professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of ""A Planet to Win: Why We Need a Green Deal"" told Salon. After noting that the Texas power grid is deregulated and therefore undemocratic — ""you don't have a clear line of accountability in the way that you should have with a public system"" — Cohen argued that the solution to issues of energy inefficiency as presented in his book is a national power grid.

""You would have a single national grid very robustly interconnected"" Cohen explained. ""That would mean a grid dominated by renewable energy sources like wind and solar. By virtue of having that full national interconnection when there is less energy or no energy in one region of the country you can shoot energy down there from other regions.""

For instance in the case of events like the winter storm in Texas a national energy grid would have allowed public authorities to divert energy that's been stored elsewhere in the national system so that it could have been diverted where it was most needed. When it comes to disaster resiliency like extreme weather events a national power grid would ""essentially mean that there is like a national solidarity of energy that covers the whole country instead of having a big region that has to fend for itself.""

Cohen also warned that if a Green New Deal is not implemented we could wind up with ""a kind of eco-apartheid situation where largely white largely affluent people can basically hoard solar panels and batteries and resiliency at the expense of a fully egalitarian system where literally every single home and community is guaranteed safety and reliability.""

Barati offered a somewhat different set of suggestions to Salon.

""If only Texas had stronger connections to the rest of the U.S. with HVDC and HVAC [High Voltage Alternating Current] lines they would have been fine"" Barati wrote. He also pointed out that ""if only appropriate reliability planning were performed taking into account the coordinated transmission line expansion and generation planning subject to rare and common-mode events Texas would have had appropriate generation reserves."" In addition he observed that ""Texas has an energy-only market which means that it is vulnerable to rare events. If only Texas had a properly functioning capacity market for both generation and transmission sides they would have had enough spare transmission and generation capacity to deal with the shortages.""

Regardless of what solution you prefer one thing is likely: Because of climate change we should expect to see more extreme weather in areas not accustomed to it from the West Coast wildfires to the Texas winter storm.

""The way is through the changes in the environment that have occurred from climate change"" Dr. Kevin Trenberth a distinguished scholar at the National Center for Atmospheric Research wrote to Salon when asked about the potential role of climate change in the Texas winter storm. ""These include generally warmer conditions including much warmer oceans higher sea surface temperatures reduced sea ice and glaciers and higher water vapor in the atmosphere."" Trenberth noted that the extra available energy accelerated the water cycle leading to more evaporation and heavier rains.

Yet there are sensible reasons for the grid’s relative isolation from the rest of the nation—beyond an instinctive aversion to federal meddling. And while Texans freezing in their homes in mid-February would have welcomed any relief they could get having a grid that could have drawn more power from other states would have done little to ease the crisis.

Texas lost 46000 megawatts in the early days of the storm—roughly enough to power 9.2 million homes. Texas has a small interconnect only about 600 megawatts with the grid that serves most of the western U.S. but no power was coming across that line. With most of the country also facing bitterly cold temperatures the rest of the U.S. wouldn’t have had much to spare anyway said Bill White the former Houston mayor and former deputy U.S. energy secretary who also once served on the board of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation a nonprofit that oversees grid reliability and security for the United States Canada and parts of Mexico.

Back in the early days of electrification—the early twentieth century—Texas power companies “interconnected in every direction” said Julie Cohn a historian with the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University’s Baker Institute and author of The Grid: Biography of an American Technology. Those interconnections helped fledgling utilities expand to new markets and conserve generating fuels. With little state or federal regulation at the time utilities could do what they wanted. Then in 1935 Congress passed the first federal regulation of utilities limiting the geographic areas in which they could operate. Texas companies decided to connect mainly with one another rather than submit to the feds. “After that infrastructure development focused more on strengthening and taking advantage of the ties within the state” Cohn said.

Texas developed many of the same benefits that it had enjoyed when utilities were connected to more out-of-state generators but the new grid gave the state sole authority over rates and operations. In the late sixties when the federal government set up the two grids that serve the rest of the country (as well as a few areas in Texas) the Lone Star State decided to continue going it alone creating its own grid operator the Electric Reliability Council of Texas or ERCOT.

While that kept the feds from regulating power sales it also meant that the state had few places to turn if it faced sudden shortages or potential outages. The main benefit of interconnections is that they enhance reliability because your neighbor essentially has your back. In smaller states interconnections also facilitate the sharing of generating resources which lowers costs. This is less of a benefit in a state as big and energy-rich as Texas.

Greater interconnection to other states also would have raised an array of complicated operational and economic issues. It would have for example required building more interstate transmission lines which no one wants in their backyards. Once it was hooked up to more neighboring states Texas would have to consider the needs of those states and they along with the feds would have a say in decisions about how much power was transferred where and under what conditions. That doesn’t even address who pays for the interconnection. Should it be only Texas customers? Are customers in other grids going to want to pay more to bring Texas on board? “It becomes a pretty complicated operating problem” Cohn said. “It’s not a simple economic equation either.”

The rest of the nation may roll its eyes and say “of course Texas has its own grid” but other grids have problems too. In August 2003 for example overgrown tree branches in northern Ohio blew into a high-voltage line. An alarm that should have sounded in the control room of FirstEnergy the local utility failed. As other lines picked up the slack to take on this additional demand they tripped offline resulting in a cascading failure that spread through eight northeastern states and southeastern Canada. Some 50 million people were left without power for two days—the biggest blackout in American history. Eleven people died for reasons tied to the blackout and the damage cost an estimated $6 billion. Unlike ERCOT the Eastern interconnection that serves this region has several grid operators. During those sorts of cascading power failures each operator must decide how to respond—how much power to turn off to how many customers and when to manage the crisis.

That kind of widespread blackout has never happened in Texas although ERCOT acknowledged it got within minutes of one during last week’s freeze. “When you have one operator that’s an advantage because you have more control over what to do in an emergency with all the component parts of your system” Cohn said. ERCOT instituted rolling outages to keep the grid functioning so that full service could be restored more quickly. Customers who experienced longer outages were likely on circuits where equipment such as transformers failed or power lines came down because of ice and high wind.

But there are other benefits to an isolated grid that have nothing to do with reliability. Texas became the biggest U.S. wind energy producer at least in part because our grid is self-contained. The state Legislature set standards for the technology and those rules were implemented more quickly than if they’d required federal approval or needed to pass muster with grid participants in other states. “People love to put wind and solar in Texas because of the ease” White said. “You don’t have obstacles that you have on say the West Coast.”

When Texas decided to build high-voltage transmission lines to capture wind-generated power mainly in West Texas and transmit it to the state’s major cities those lines were paid for by Texans for the benefit of Texans. Wind projects elsewhere have been hampered by a lack of adequate transmission. “There are all these proposals for big transmission projects all around the country that cross multiple state lines and they’re basically languishing because there’s so many different regulatory authorities who have a say over whether the line can go there” Cohn said.

Finally perhaps the most obvious reason for Texas needing its own grid is the simple fact that it’s so big. The state spans two time zones. It produces coal natural gas and uranium and has access to hydropower strong winds and plentiful sunshine.

With that abundance state leaders have chosen not to be obligated to ship power out of state when Texans might need it most. Our isolated grid didn’t cause the February freeze-out. There were multiple reasons for the disaster including the state Legislature’s failure to require generators and fuel providers to winterize their lines and facilities—something done in other states that got through the same winter storm without widespread outages. But interconnecting more with other states wouldn’t have solved our grid’s problems. It could have made them worse.

In February Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen Ed Markey (D-Mass.) introduced a resolution aimed at recognizing “the duty of the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal“. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said there will be a vote on the nonbinding resolution.

The resolution is a response to both a United Nations group and a federal program known as the U.S. Global Change Research Program that describe economic and environmental issues that would worsen if global temperatures continue to rise.

At the center of the Green New Deal is a move to rebuild American infrastructure “by eliminating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as much as technologically feasible” and “meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean renewable and zero-emission energy sources.”

Here’s where the United States stands on both of the power and emissions fronts.

Emissions by state

According to the Environmental Protection Agency the United States was responsible for 15 percent of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide compared with China which was responsible for 30 percent.

In 2007 American carbon dioxide emissions peaked at 5.9 billion metric tons the equivalent of 1.2 billion passenger cars in a given year.

That number dropped to 5.2 billion a 12.8 percent drop in 2017 largely driven by a decrease in emissions related to electric power. While electric power was the sector most responsible for emissions through 2015 as of 2016 the transportation sector is the leading driver of emissions in the US.

The graph below shows data collected by the Department of Energy between 1980 to 2016 breaking down CO2 emissions by sector: residential commercial industrial transportation and electric power."

My wife received an email from American Express this evening offering her 40000 Membership Rewards for upgrading her Amex EveryDay card to the EveryDay Preferred and spending $2000 in three months. I ignored the email because she’s never had the EveryDay Preferred card before so I thought it would be better for her to apply for it brand new at some point to get the welcome bonus then hopefully get a similar upgrade offer in the future with no lifetime language thereby earning a bonus on the same card twice.

Nick subsequently pointed out that 40000 Membership Rewards is the highest offer we’ve seen on the EveryDay Preferred card (albeit this increased offer is targeted) as the previous high was 30000 points. He therefore figured it could be worth forgoing the opportunity to earn a welcome bonus for a new signup and jump on this upgrade offer instead especially seeing as it means you wouldn’t be burning a 5/24 slot.

Those were great points; I’ve never tracked the welcome bonus on the EveryDay Preferred card and so hadn’t realized that it hadn’t gone above 30000 points in the past. If getting or staying under 5/24 is important to you this upgrade offer is a good opportunity to earn a bunch of Membership Rewards without having an impact on your 5/24 status.

If you’re lol/24 and are in two player mode you could potentially do better though. For example my Amex Gold card is offering me 30000 Membership Rewards when referring someone to a new Amex card (it doesn’t have to be the Gold card). The welcome bonus on the EveryDay Preferred card when using that referral link is 15000 Membership Rewards so between us we’d pick up 45000 points – 5000 more than the upgrade offer. We’re not planning on doing that right now; it’s just to point out that a couple could potentially come out even further ahead than this already generous upgrade offer.

Differing Offers

The reason for this post though is that reader Josh noticed something interesting. His wife also received the 40000 point upgrade offer but when logging in to her Amex account her EveryDay card only showed a 15000 point upgrade offer.

Curious I logged in to my wife’s account and a similar thing happened. When viewing the Amex Offers listed under her Amex EveryDay card Amex was offering her fewer points to upgrade compared to the email upgrade offer. In my wife’s case she was being offered 25000 bonus points to upgrade compared to the 15000 points Josh’s wife was being offered when logged in to her account but 25000 points is still small fry compared to the email offer.

It’s therefore worth keeping an eye out for email upgrade offers from American Express because in some cases they’re better than the upgrade offer you’ll receive when logged in to your account.

This isn't the usual private equity playbook.

Tripadvisor acknowledges that it is building its new subscription program Tripadvisor Plus with wholesale rates from “aggregators” — that it refuses to identify — covering 100000 hotels. Skift has learned however that most of these hotel discounts and perks are coming from an unconventional source — travel agency brands within private equity firm Certares’ portfolio.

Travel agencies within Certares’ wide array of travel holdings are providing Tripadvisor with the bulk of the wholesale hotel inventory according to a source close to Tripadvisor.

That’s a twist on standard industry practice on several fronts. Hotels regularly give wholesale rates to traditional travel agencies including discounts and perks and not with the expectation that these traditional travel agencies will pass the inventory along to online travel companies for use in standalone hotel sales. One would have also thought that Tripadvisor would turn to bed banks to scale its wholesale program and not offline travel agencies.

In addition it is atypical in travel for a private equity firm to share its assets in the way Certares is doing it.

Tripadvisor’s sales force has also started to sign direct contracts with hotels for wholesale inventory.

The source close to Tripadvisor did not identify which Certares-affiliated brands are providing the inventory. But Certares owns Internova Travel Group formerly called Travel Leaders which counts travel agency brands within its ranks such as Tzell Travel Group Altour Protravel International and more than a dozen more for example.

Certares also is a leading shareholder and joint venture partner with American Express in American Express Global Business Travel which acquired Ovation Travel Group in January. It also has airline and cruise investments.

Tripadvisor could also be working with other travel agencies which commonly strike deals with wholesalers and hotels for net rates and amenities.

Tripadvisor spokesman Brian Hoyt didn’t comment about whether travel agencies were providing the company with wholesale inventory but said: “We’ve been public that we’ve engaged aggregators and hotels directly to help us scale quickly and test an offering like Tripadvisor Plus. Both groups will continue to have a role in the future of this membership subscription service as they seek to engage high value travelers bookings vacations.”

Tripadvisor Plus is currently available on desktop and mobile Web to a limited number of users. It isn’t yet included in Tripadvisor’s app.

Hotelbeds the largest global bedbank provider of wholesale rates is not apparently working with Tripadvisor at this point. Hotelbeds didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment and a spokesman for another leading bed bank Webbeds said: “We don’t make public comment on who we work with except in some unique circumstances.”

A source at a private equity firm — not at Certares — said it is “atypical” for a private equity firm to leverage its holdings the way Certares is doing with Tripadvisor although it could have significant upside for Certares’ various holdings.

In March Certares purchased $325 million of preferred stock in Tripadvisor’s parent company Liberty Tripadvisor and became a strategic investor. Certares founder Greg O’Hara became vice chair of Liberty Tripadvisor and a Tripadvisor board member.

Wholesale Controversy

Tripadvisor’s use of wholesale inventory to pass along discounts and perks to travelers for hotel stays and experiences could prove controversial. Wholesalers traditionally provide online travel agencies with deeply discounted rates that are used on an opaque basis because they are supposed to be assembled in vacation packages. In that way the hotelier isn’t revealing that the room it is offering on its website for $300 per night is actually being sold elsewhere for $150.

Tripadvisor though is not using the wholesale inventory in packages but in standalone hotel bookings.

One Tripadvisor rival believes that Tripadvisor’s use of wholesale rates for its subscription program will add confusion to the already wild world of wholesale rates which often show up without authorization on metasearch sites.

The Tripadvisor competitor believes that Tripadvisor Plus’ use of wholesale rates will be unsustainable.

The source close to Tripadvisor rebuffed that type of thinking saying the rates will be offered behind a subscription paywall and they will not be “advertised.” Advertised in this sense broadly speaking the source close to Tripadvisor said means that Web scrapers will not be able to access these wholesale rates on Tripadvisor.

Luxury Play?

The company touts Tripadvisor Plus which is in beta and sells for a $99 annual subscription as offering discounts on unlimited bookings and perks at 100000 hotels. Many of the Tripadvisor Plus offerings will be for longer stays and that’s why Tripadvisor can claim that subscribers will be saving at least $200 per booking.

But it is the perk side of the equation in luxury hotels that could become a sweet spot for the program the source close to Tripadvisor said.

There are numerous types of travel agency wholesale programs that Tripadvisor may be working with. In one type of program for example travel agencies and consortia — or agency groups — have private commissionable rates that they offer to their customers.

“Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts or Virtuoso or Signature all have these at select super-upscale hotels” said a former hotelier. “They offer their clients usually an upgrade free breakfast and/or other amenities and are generally priced at parity with their website but they throw in goodies for these key agency partners. The agency receives the same 10% commission after the stay (sometimes more sometimes less) and there is often an override or other kicker paid to the consortia.”

The source close to Tripadvisor said ultimately cruise and car rentals may be more scalable for Tripadvisor Plus than hotels. If it’s peak season in Paris there aren’t an infinite number of upgrades that the program could provide to program members the source close to Tripadvisor said.

Why would hotels want to join Tripadvisor Plus? Tripadvisor is telling them that in exchange for providing discounts and perks to Tripadvisor the company will offer them preferred placement on Tripadvisor and bookings at zero or greatly reduced commission. The bookings would take place on Tripadvisor but the hotels would service them.

Tripadvisor if everything works out would forego its usual commissions and make its money on the subscription revenue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbGxhaGFzc2VlLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAyLzI3L3N0ZXZlLXVobGZlbGRlci10aHJvdWdoLXllYXJzLXBob3Rvcy82ODI1NTA1MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steve Uhlfelder through the years | Photos,"Steve Uhlfelder through the years | Photos

The failure of the last round of United Nations-led talks between the Syrian regime and the opposition in Geneva last month has left diplomats and analysts pondering how to redirect diplomatic efforts in the face of Damascus’s staunch refusal to engage in any negotiated process.

The inability of the two sides to achieve any meaningful developments in the fifth meeting of the constitutional talks pushed the UN special envoy Geir Pedersen to suspend the negotiations indefinitely.

The Norwegian diplomat implicitly put the blame on representatives of the Syrian government for rejecting any proposal put before them.

After 15 months and five meetings since its inception the committee has not yet agreed on basic procedural matters and does not have a plan forward. The discussion of substantial constitutional points and the beginning of a drafting process thus cannot commence.

The impasse has prompted the opposition represented by the Syrian National Coalition (SNC) to declare the constitutional committee is past rescuing.

“We cannot tolerate any further waste of time” its president Nasr al-Hariri told journalists recently speaking from Azaz in northern Syria.

Al-Hariri said the government’s refusal to engage is leaving the international community with no other option but to circumvent Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and impose “the transitional process called for by relevant UN resolutions without giving Damascus any further opportunity to be disruptive”.

The collapse of the Geneva process did not come as a surprise but rather as a fresh realisation that neither the Syrians nor the helpless UN envoy can achieve any progress without a clear commitment in support of a political settlement by the international community.

But are foreign players with a stake in Syria interested in achieving a settlement?

The UN alone cannot mastermind a political process that would take into account the aspirations of the Syrian people the survival instinct of the Syrian government the ambitions of a fragmented political opposition and the conflicting agendas of at least seven regional and international powers let alone the militia groups on their payroll.

Astana limited scope

The Astana process launched in 2017 by Russia Turkey and Iran has proved a useful mechanism to de-escalate the conflict militarily but has not turned into an alternative forum for a political settlement despite fears it would have eventually disrupted and replaced the UN efforts.

“Astana has a limited scope and we should not have too high expectations about what it can achieve” said Andrey Kortunov director of the Russian International Affairs Council.

Through Astana Russia has further divided a fragmented Syrian opposition by bringing in new figures who did not ask for al-Assad’s removal.

It has lured Turkey into a bilateral relationship with Moscow away from its NATO allies and has succeeded in excluding the already reluctant American administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump from playing a decisive role in drawing the future outcome of the conflict.

Russia has used the Astana process to set short term and limited military objectives that mainly suited Moscow’s tactical goals and in so doing it assisted the regime in chipping away territory from the opposition and armed groups.

But apart from formal declarations of support for the UN process Moscow and Ankara have stood clear from delving further into divisive political issues such as the removal of al-Assad or the drafting of a new constitution.

“There is a misreading of Astana [process]. It is a channel for dialogue between three countries with very different agendas” said Murat Aslan a security researcher at SETA a policy think-tank close to the Turkish presidency.

“They meet while they check and balance the other actors.”

If Astana is not the venue for a political agreement despite bringing together the three main sponsors of the conflict questions arise over Russia’s inability or unwillingness to exert any political concessions from al-Assad’s government.

Analysts agree the Kremlin would like to see a unified and more stable Syria and are growing impatient with its president.

But in the eyes of Moscow the factions within the opposition are hostage of their foreign sponsors and do not represent a credible alternative.

The main bloc the SNC is divided Kurdish interests are underrepresented or absent and the influence of Salafism on parts of the Syrian opposition and leniency towards armed groups is worrying Syrian secularists.

In the absence of an alternative the Kremlin will continue to maintain the status quo as the most economical and the least disruptive of all solutions analysts say.

Moscow is not yet ready to tip the scale of a fragile balance of power between its strategic interests and those of its regional competitors – Iran Turkey Israel and to some extent the United States.

“I don’t see a clear exit strategy for Russia right now” said Kortunov. “After five years the Syrian operation has been routinised and the current situation is something Moscow can live with both financially and militarily. It is not perfect but it is affordable.”

Russia’s expenditure in Syria amounts to between $1bn to $2bn a year according to government figures a modest amount if compared to US expenditures in Iraq.

The country has lost some 200 men in five years of war and while every life matters said Kortunov figures are far from the 15000 losses of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

Meanwhile Syrians are turning with hope to the Biden administration for a more active policy than that of its predecessors.

Opposition leader al-Hariri told Al Jazeera he was hopeful to pay a visit to Washington in March to discuss a way out of the deadlock.

“The time is ripe for a US re-engagement to balance out the Russian and Iranian agendas in Syria” said Aslan. He said the US should talk to Turkey and Moscow to find a compromise on the minimum acceptable terms.

“A format similar to Astana would be desirable without Iran because it is ultimately Russia who has the upper hand in Syria” said the Turkish analyst.

One sticking point will be Washington’s posture towards the Kurds. Biden was critical of the US withdrawal from northeastern Syria that opened the door to the Turkish military operation against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a close ally of the US in the fight against the armed group ISIL (ISIS).

The SDF is controlled by the People’s Protection Units (YPG) the main Kurdish armed group in Syria that has links to the PKK which Turkey and the US consider a “terrorist” organisation.

“The support of the YPG is a red line for Turkey” said Aslan. “Ankara does not have any problems with the Kurds but will not accept any territorialisation of the YPG and other Kurdish groups.”

Biden’s appointment of Brett McGurk as National Security Council coordinator for the Middle East does not prelude an easy relationship with Turkey.

McGurk a staunch critic of Turkey played a central role in strengthening the US alliance with the Kurdish forces against ISIL during the Obama presidency.

In 2018 he quit his position over Trump’s decision to withdraw American troops from northern Syria.

In 2019 McGurk suggested in the absence of a US military presence the Kurds should seek a compromise with the al-Assad regime and Russia in exchange for some form of political autonomy.

However McGurk’s recommendation the US intervention in Syria should be limited to protecting Israel from Iranian attacks and keeping at bay a possible ISIL revival may indicate a desire not to meddle further into Syrian affairs.

The US has lost considerable leverage in Syria over the past few years and some diplomats argue rather than trying to catch up with its regional competitors Washington should accept playing a marginal role or none at all.

An opinion piece by former US ambassador to Syria Robert Ford triggered debate for his proposal that the US accepts “it has lost in Syria”.

A way out of the deadlock

It is not clear yet which strategy President Biden will adopt and probably a better indication will emerge upon the appointment of the US envoy to Syria a position still vacant.

However Syria is not considered a priority in Washington as the administration grapples with other emergencies starting with the COVID-19 pandemic.

China and the Iranian nuclear deal are more pressing issues than Syria analysts say.

But one approach under consideration is that of the Atlanta-based Carter Center which suggests the engagement of the Syrian government on a limited set of meaningful reforms in return for a package of incentives such as targeted reconstruction assistance and sanctions relief.

Hrair Balian director of the conflict resolution programme at the Carter Center suggests the US and its European allies abandon maximalist requests such as regime change in Syria one of the items of UN resolution 2254.

“We should be realistic and acknowledge that the hardline approach of the past 10 years has not worked” said Balian. “Sanctions haven’t changed the regime behaviour. Isolation and punishment rarely achieve the wanted results … It is time to try another way.”

In June 2020 the US imposed the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act a broad range of sanctions that have blocked foreign investments in Syria without affecting the regime’s attitude. Reconstruction plans have been put on hold depriving Syrians of any possibility of rebuilding the country’s infrastructure.

Balian said the US could count on Russia’s wish to improve Syria’s financial and economic conditions a position confirmed by Russian analysts close to the presidency who say Moscow fears inheriting a failed state.

There is a risk that Damascus may not comply said Balian but sanctions would be swiftly reimposed in such a case.

The approach that Balian suggests has been endorsed by Jeffrey Feltman a respected American diplomat who has been cited as a possible candidate for the position of US negotiator for Syria.

UN officials have also called for a lifting of US sanctions with their legitimacy under international law in question. They say the Caesar Act is depriving Syrians of the essential means for reconstruction and deepening the humanitarian crisis.

Countering this approach are analysts such as Carmit Valensi and Itamar Rabinovich co-authors of the book Syrian Requiem. They argue the US should not waver and sanctions remain the only suitable alternative to military intervention.

“The US should bring the regime to its knees and refuse any funding for reconstruction as long as there is no reform or resettlement of refugees” said Rabinovich a Distinguished Brookings Fellow and former Israeli diplomat. “It’s a long-term strategy but it will eventually work”.

Rabinovich and Valensi say the US should keep a presence in defence of Israel’s borders to deter Iran from creating a land bridge from Iran to Syria via Iraq.

Tehran would like to replicate the Lebanon scenario by establishing a permanent military presence in Syria through its proxies.

Since Damascus will not be able or willing to push back the Iranians Israel and the US will have to work with Moscow and contain Iranian expansionism.

Deepening humanitarian crisis

Meanwhile the population is bearing the brunt of a US policy that besides sanctions offers no prospect for a political settlement.

Despite a period of relative calm if compared with previous years violence and clashes continue in the area of Idlib in the northeast and along the southern border with Iraq.

Some 13.4 million people are estimated to require humanitarian assistance this year up from 11 million last year.

Two million Syrians live in extreme poverty according to UN figures. Bread and fuel are scarce in a country that used to export wheat to neighbours and now cannot feed its own population.

The collapse of the Lebanese banking sector has added to the crisis. Billions of Syrian dollars are frozen in Lebanese banks and sanctions further aggravate the conditions of the Syrian middle class which has been decimated by the war.

Government corruption and mismanagement are rampant and are widely blamed for the crisis.

Ten years into the war – with an estimated 600000 deaths and 11 million displaced – Syria has no viable peace process in place and the country’s prospects for a resolution of the conflict have never been gloomier.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2Evc291dGgtY2VudHJhbC1hc2lhX3RhbGliYW4td2Fybi10dXJuaW5nLWF3YXktYWZnaGFuLXBlYWNlLWRlYWwtZG9vbWVkLWZhaWx1cmUvNjIwMjY2NS5odG1s0gF2aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3NvdXRoLWNlbnRyYWwtYXNpYV90YWxpYmFuLXdhcm4tdHVybmluZy1hd2F5LWFmZ2hhbi1wZWFjZS1kZWFsLWRvb21lZC1mYWlsdXJlLzYyMDI2NjUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taliban Warn Turning Away from Afghan Peace Deal ‘Doomed to Failure’,"The Taliban demanded Sunday that the United States and its foreign military allies leave Afghanistan by May 1 in line with a peace agreement the insurgent group signed with Washington a year ago warning any attempt to change the path “is already doomed to failure.”



In a statement released to journalists and on its website marking the first anniversary of the February 2020 accord sealed in Doha Qatar the Taliban claimed they have fully adhered to and remain committed to the understanding aimed at ending two decades of Afghan war. It called on Washington to honor its part of what the group described as a “historic” deal.



U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration is currently reviewing the deal his predecessor former President Donald Trump sealed with the Afghan insurgency and deciding whether to pull the remaining 2500 American soldiers from Afghanistan to close America’s longest war. NATO-led U.S. allies have fewer than 10000 troops left in the country.



The U.S. review process has stemmed from widespread allegations the Taliban have not lived up to their commitments including those of cutting ties with al-Qaida and other terrorist groups that threaten the U.S. and the security of its allies.



“The Doha agreement has created a practical framework for bringing peace and security to Afghanistan. If any other pathway is pursued as a replacement then it is already doomed to failure” the Taliban statement warned.



It said that Washington has committed itself in the agreement that within 14 months of signing all U.S.-led international forces and their nondiplomatic personnel private contractors advisers trainers and service providers will withdraw from Afghanistan.



“In line with this agreement a large part of foreign forces specifically American forces have withdrawn from our country while the rest must also withdraw within the specified date” the statement stressed.



The Taliban said Qatar and the United Nations Security Council along with all other countries and international observers that attended the Doha signing ceremony “have an obligation in the complete implementation of the agreement that must be fulfilled.”



The insurgents under the deal agreed to stop attacking international forces in Afghanistan and to open direct peace talks with representatives of the U.S.-backed Afghan government to try to negotiate a political settlement to the country’s long conflict.



Washington acknowledges the U.S. military has not suffered any casualties since signing the Doha agreement. Before then the Afghan military mission had claimed the lives of more than 2400 American soldiers and injured thousands of others.



The Taliban rejected terror link charges and allegations they have intensified the conflict as propaganda by some Afghan and “foreign actors” who the group said are attempting to disrupt the peace process.



Edmund Fitton-Brown coordinator of the United Nations monitoring team for Islamic State al-Qaida and the Taliban told an online event at the Middle East Institute on Thursday that the Taliban have failed to cut ties with al-Qaida.



“As yet we have not seen any evidence” he said.



The so-called intra-Afghan negotiations started in September six months later than scheduled in the U.S.-Taliban deal because of a rift between the Afghan government and the Taliban over the release of 5000 insurgent prisoners.

Kabul was unhappy with the Doha accord because it was kept out of it.



Meanwhile the United Nations has reported the Afghan violence has also intensified since the start of the talks with civilians bearing the brunt of it.



More than 3000 civilians were killed and 5800 were injured in Afghanistan in 2020 the U.N office in Kabul said last week. The annual report said civilian casualties rose 45% after the start of the intra-Afghan negotiations.



Afghan leaders allege the Trump administration’s decision to leave Kabul out of the February 2020 agreement has only emboldened the Taliban to intensify military assaults and drag their feet in the peace talks.



The insurgents dismiss Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s government as an illegitimate entity they say stemmed from the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan.



Ghani’s special envoy for neighboring Pakistan Mohammed Umer Daudzai said Biden’s review of Afghan peace deal with the Taliban has ended the “unpredictability” that was plaguing the process from the outset about whether the arrangement will promote peace in Afghanistan.



“Now with the Biden administration we see an increase in predictability” Daudzai told VOA in an interview.



The Afghan presidential envoy said his government has left it entirely for Washington to decide whether they withdraw or leave some troops in Afghanistan while reviewing the document.



“We don’t seek that Americans should get back into the war should get involved in the war. What we are seeking from them is that the process of state building that they together with us started 19 years ago they continue with that” said Daudzai.

The Taliban say their deal with the U.S. required the release of another 7500 insurgent prisoners from Afghan jails and the removal of names of top Taliban leaders from a U.N. sanctions list by now but those terms have not been fulfilled by the opposing side.

The insurgents also dismiss Kabul’s demand for a ceasefire saying they have reduced battlefield attacks as part of the deal with Washington but a complete cessation of hostilities they insist is linked to a political agreement the warring parties intend to reach in the ongoing intra-Afghan negotiations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vcmVhc29uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzI3L3RoZS1hbGwtYW1lcmljYW4tYXJtcy1kZWFsZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The All-American Arms Dealer,"There are more than a few antique shops in historic Old Town Alexandria Virginia a short walk from my suburban neighborhood. Antiquing is normally of interest only if my mother-in-law is visiting but some years back a friend messaged me to let me know one of the shops had something I should see. On the back wall shunted behind a variety of well-preserved 19th century furniture were two large Soviet propaganda paintings.

The first was a portrait of three strapping Russian sailors wearing bandoleers across their chests in front of the Aurora—the infamous ship that fired the first shot on the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg launching the Russian Revolution. The second painting of soldiers smoking in a field in Afghanistan was less dramatic but a better and more impressionistic piece of art. Both paintings were done by well-known graduates of the Kharkov Art Institute and were fine examples of Soviet socialist realism—insofar as one can take any art movement that began under Stalin seriously. I inquired about the paintings and all the clerk was able to tell me was that they originally came from the estate of a man named Samuel Cummings.

If you know anything about Samuel Cummings you may suspect the two Soviet paintings were some of his more prosaic possessions. When the billionaire died in 1998 he owned among many other things the sword Napoleon carried at Waterloo. For years he tried to open a museum in Alexandria to exhibit his collection of exotic and historic weaponry though that never came to fruition.

As interesting as that sounds Cummings' collection is in some respects less interesting than the manner in which he acquired it. For nearly 50 years he was the largest arms dealer in the world.

In recent years the waterfront in Old Town Alexandria along the Potomac River has been redeveloped. Some of the land was seized by eminent domain the area turned into parks and boardwalks and otherwise made an inviting spot for tourists looking to schlep around the same streets once haunted by George Washington. But when I moved to the area a decade ago there was also a small wooden building on the water where you could still make out a sign that said Interarms—the name of Cummings' company. The building is now gone and it's hard to imagine that through the 1980s the same waterfront now littered with restaurants and boutiques was an industrial port where Cummings owned a series of converted tobacco warehouses stacked to the rafters with guns.

""At one point we had 700000 rifles machine guns pistols and submachine guns stored in our warehouses in Alexandria"" Cummings told The Washington Post in 1986. ""We could have instantly overwhelmed the American armed forces. We could have armed 700000 mercenaries that could have goose-stepped right over the [Arlington] Memorial Bridge….We also had 150 pieces of artillery ranging from 25 mm to 150 mm….So if I didn't like a particular piece of legislation in the Congress I could have phoned up the speaker and I could have said 'My armies will be rolling over to the Capitol if you don't do something about that.'""

Fortunately Cummings was clearly joking. Well aware that such quotes were catnip to reporters he was famously candid with the press a remarkable trait for an arms dealer.

By the 1980s the intrigue surrounding the Cold War's many proxy conflicts had made arms dealers figures of notable interest even in popular culture: The 1983 Chevy Chase comedy Deal of the Century was a satirical take on the arms trade and the band Queen even wrote a song ""Khashoggi's Ship"" about partying on the yacht of notorious Saudi Arabian arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi. (Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi notoriously dismembered in a Saudi consulate in Turkey in 2018 was Adnan's nephew.)

But among arms dealers no one was more intriguing than the straight-talking former CIA employee Cummings who was born in Philadelphia and raised in D.C. but died a British citizen living in Monte Carlo.

An Education in Arms

Cummings was born in Philadelphia in 1927 to parents so wealthy they had never worked. Soon thereafter they lost everything in the Great Depression. His father died when Cummings was 8 from the stress of having to do actual labor for the first time in his life.

When Cummings was 5 he found a World War I German machine gun abandoned outside an American Legion post. An adult helped him carry the 40-pound weapon back to his house where the boy learned to take it apart and reassemble it sparking a lifelong fascination with guns.

After Cummings' father died his enterprising mother found a way to make one of her primary skills as a rich woman—good taste—profitable. She convinced a local bank to let her move into a repossessed house and renovate it in exchange for a share of the sale profits. Cummings' mother proved quite adept at flipping houses this way. It eventually brought the family to D.C. where the housing market during the Depression was stronger. This unusual occupation necessitated moving the family every six months or so into a new home but Cummings' mother was thrifty enough to put her children through some of D.C.'s better private schools.

Cummings enlisted immediately after high school just as World War II was ending. As a teenager he headed off to Fort Lee for basic training with his burgeoning collection of 50 guns packed into the trunk of his car. Cummings excelled in his cadet program in high school and when he got to the Army he was so familiar with weapons and drills he was immediately made an acting corporal. He spent his hitch instructing other recruits on close-order drills and weapons handling. His 18-month service was uneventful—he never left Virginia—and in 1947 he enrolled in George Washington University on the GI Bill earning a degree in political science and economics in just two years. While in school Cummings pursued his hobby and supplemented his income by buying and selling guns. He even made a tidy profit after uncovering a cache of German World War II helmets in a Virginia scrapyard.

It was his time out of school during this period that proved to be the most fateful however. Cummings headed off to Oxford for a term abroad during summer 1948. While in England he and two friends pooled their money to buy the cheapest car they could find and toured the continent. For a young man obsessed with the military the trip was a revelation.

Even though it had been over for years the scale of World War II was so enormous that everywhere they went the young men were surrounded by abandoned military equipment and fortifications. Cummings and his friends slept in bunkers poked into arms caches and drove around with a machine gun strapped to the roof of their car for fun. Anyone with a can of gasoline and a new battery could have driven away in one of the many vehicles abandoned on the side of the road. In the Falaise Pocket in France six divisions of German soldiers had abandoned all of their supplies and equipment near the end of the war never to return. European governments had resorted to gathering up mass quantities of leftover materiel and dumping it in the sea to get rid of it.

In Deadly Business: Sam Cummings Interarms and the Arms Trade a 1983 biography by journalists Patrick Brogan and Albert Zarca that's long been out of print Cummings recounts that the trip made an indelible impression. ""The roads of rural England were lined with open-ended containers filled with ammunition"" he said. ""I couldn't get over it because they were standard-caliber small arms as well as artillery and typical of law-abiding England no one ever bothered with the stuff. To me it was astonishing.""

After getting his undergraduate degree Cummings' interest in guns was so consuming that he applied for jobs at the FBI CIA and National Rifle Association (NRA) thinking one of them might have use for a small arms expert. They all turned him down at least initially. Cummings was working his way through law school when the CIA came calling. By then the Korean War was underway and the agency was looking for people who could help identify the provenance of more exotic weapons that were turning up in the conflict. Cummings' old résumé was pulled out of the pile.

Unsurprisingly Cummings proved particularly good at the work. He spent much of his time utilizing the CIA archives to enhance his already prodigious knowledge of weaponry.

Then one day a CIA report came across his desk prepared in collaboration with U.S. military attachés in Europe inquiring as to whether large quantities of German weapons still remained on the continent. The report concluded there was nothing noteworthy left. Cummings possessed considerable firsthand knowledge that the report was flat wrong and he dashed off a memo saying so.

What Cummings didn't know was that the CIA had a specific reason for inquiring about surplus German arms. The agency was contemplating arming Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan to launch a new invasion of mainland China in the hopes that such an invasion would distract the Chinese military and alleviate some of the pressure in the Korean conflict. In order for the plan to work however the CIA needed a supply of arms that couldn't be readily traced back to the U.S.

Cummings soon found himself summoned to a personal meeting with the then–deputy director of the CIA Allen Dulles. The legendary spymaster quickly sized up the young Cummings as being more capable than many of his more experienced superiors and soon Cummings was off on a clandestine mission for the ages: Dulles sent him to Europe with an unlimited budget to buy as many surplus World War II arms as he could obtain. Along for the ride was another man Leo Lippe a director of photography from Hollywood. Their cover story was that they were buying props for the steady stream of war films that American studios were pumping out. The two men spent months traveling to Europe's most exotic locales doing deals with heads of state and top military leaders.

Though the plan to arm Chiang Kai-shek was never put in motion the trip was a smashing success with Lippe and Cummings uncovering and obtaining massive stashes of arms from Scandinavia to Italy some of which were completely unused.

Cummings returned to the U.S. in 1952 and the agency soon dispatched him on another mission. Costa Rica was disposing of 10000 guns and in excess of a million rounds of ammunition. Given the volatile politics of Central America the agency didn't want the weapons to fall into the wrong hands. Cummings arranged for the munitions to be sold to Western Arms a California-based company.

The CIA offered Cummings a permanent position. He declined. His two missions weren't just successful for the CIA—they proved to be excellent on-the-job training in dealing arms.

The Founding of Interarms

In February 1953 when he was just 26 years old Cummings founded the International Armament Corporation. Interarms as it later came to be known started with no tangible assets. Cummings worked out of his modest house in Georgetown and the company address was a P.O. box. He did however have a valuable list of contacts. Cummings composed a letter announcing he was interested in purchasing arms and fired it off to dozens of heads of state and military officials.

The first few months were disconcertingly quiet until a letter from a colonel in the national guard of Panama arrived. The country had a relatively small weapons surplus it was looking to get rid of. Cummings flew down to inspect the lot—a mix of small arms machine guns and mortars—and offered $25000 on the spot provided Panama wouldn't expect payment until the arms arrived in the United States. Cummings quickly brokered a deal with Western Arms whom he'd worked with in Costa Rica to purchase the Panamanian shipment from him. He made $20000 on the deal even after the considerable shipping costs.

That provided enough seed capital to cover travel expenses and Cummings was off to the races. Like a lot of wildly successful ventures the growth of Interarms was about 50 percent luck and 50 percent grit. Cummings traveled so much for the rest of the decade that he calculated he'd spent six months' worth of hours on planes. His constant absence cost him his first marriage. But his hard work confident salesmanship and unusual combination of discretion and blunt honesty ensured that deals started falling into his lap. Soon he had full warehouses of arms in Brooklyn and Alexandria. Many of his most notable successes involved profiting off the chaos created by energetic U.S. efforts to destabilize unfriendly governments in Latin America. Cummings soon became a Cold War Zelig—but where other historical figures got caught in the crossfire Cummings was the crossfire.

The Panamanians referred Cummings back to Costa Rica where he did more arms deals. The Costa Ricans in turn referred him to neighboring Nicaragua. In 1955 Nicaragua's U.S.-backed right-wing Somoza government invaded Costa Rica. Cummings had armed both sides of the conflict.

Cummings' success was also a result of his brazen willingness to put profits over taking sides. When Cuban President Fulgencio Batista fled the country in late 1958 a shipment of AR-10 rifles the leader had ordered from Cummings was already en route to the island. Rather than chalk up a loss Cummings dashed down to Cuba to demonstrate the rifles in person for Fidel Castro the newly installed head of state and his right-hand man Che Guevara. Castro gladly paid for the guns meant for Batista. This deal went sideways six months later in 1959 when Cummings was again in the Caribbean visiting with one of his biggest customers Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo. Castro chose that moment to launch his first of many foreign escapades by sending a ragtag group of soldiers to invade the beaches of Hispaniola in an effort presumably to foment socialist revolution.

The assault was abruptly stymied but Trujillo's men picked up AR-10 rifles from the Cuban expeditionary force that were identical to weapons Cummings had sold Trujillo. The dictator was furious. Cummings calmed him down by pointing out that the Cuban invasion was stopped by strafing the beaches with a handful of Swedish Vampire jets Cummings had sold Trujillo. (It was the only time Cummings who mostly dealt in small arms was involved in the sale of airplanes.)

Despite the hazards of dealing with such unstable leaders Cummings famously told George Thayer author of the seminal 1969 book on the modern arms trade The War Business that he liked working with dictators because ""they have a sense of order and pay their bills promptly.""

At the same time Cummings rigorously observed any arms embargo imposed by the U.S. or British governments. He quickly stopped dealing with Cuba after that first sale to Castro and shut down an office in Pretoria in the early '60s when arms embargoes were imposed in South Africa.

Then there were the questions of his ongoing ties to the CIA. Arms used in the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion came from Cummings. That same year a massive quantity of Soviet ammunition—22 boxcars' worth—was unloaded off trains in Brownsville Texas triggering a Senate investigation into the shell companies behind the shipment. It led back to Cummings. The ammo may have been meant to support CIA operations in Indochina where the conflicts were just heating up.

Regarding the CIA's ill-advised actions abroad during the Cold War Cummings would dryly tell Brogan and Zarca that an agency starting wars without Congress' involvement wasn't exactly what he'd learned was in the Constitution during law school.

The American Market

Cummings didn't make a massive fortune just by shuffling arms from one conflict zone to another. His real innovation was discovering there was a massive market among Americans for military surplus guns.

In the 1960s American manufacturers such as Winchester and Remington made fine rifles—but at $100–$150 new they were comparatively expensive. Interarms started a mail-order catalog Hunters Lodge that sold some military surplus rifles for as little as $9.95 (about $80 today adjusting for inflation). They were literally marketed as ""throwaway guns"" a hunter could abandon in the woods after bagging his deer. It was the domestic demand for guns that caused his warehouses in Alexandria to reach peak capacity.

Also of interest is how his guns arrived in Alexandria in the first place. When Cummings started buying up warehouses in the only non-union port on the East Coast there was just one other major company using the port: The Washington Post. Cummings struck a deal with the same Finnish shipping line that brought the paper its newsprint to also pick up his arms shipments. For years the Post subsidized an unholy percentage of the world's small arms traffic.

Interarms' commercial peak ended in 1968 when Congress prodded by domestic gun manufacturers upset over their lost market share passed a law prohibiting the import of military surplus guns. (It didn't help that Lee Harvey Oswald had assassinated JFK with a cheap mail-order Italian rifle.)

Fortunately for Cummings by then he also had a firm grip on the international arms trade. He was eagerly sought out for his ability to seemingly conjure weapons out of thin air. When the Sudanese ceremonial camel corps needed new lances he just happened to have some World War I–era German lances made of blue steel in an Alexandria warehouse.

Governments the world over owed Cummings favors big and small. Oddly he was trusted by nearly everyone. When the Falklands War broke out Argentina as one of Cummings' biggest customers approached him for weapons. Cummings—by then a British citizen—flatly refused to do business with the country even as he cheerfully advised its leaders on where they might obtain what they needed. After the brief conflict ended the British Ministry of Defense held a symposium on the war and wanted to get the Argentine military to participate as well. The diplomatic niceties could not be resolved in time for the event so Cummings represented the Argentine position to the satisfaction of everyone involved.

Aside from his regular dealings with the press—he received major coverage in The New York Times and was the subject of an Esquire profile in the magazine's '70s heyday—Cummings made his political influence felt in surprising ways. He had surrendered his U.S. citizenship not for any business or legal reason but for his family. By the early 1970s he was remarried with two daughters and living full-time in Monte Carlo and Geneva. In 1971 the Supreme Court ruled that children born to Americans abroad could not become U.S. citizens unless they lived in the United States for three consecutive years before they turned 18. Both Monaco and Switzerland had restrictive citizenship laws so his children were destined to be stateless. Cummings applied for and received British citizenship surrendering his status as an American so his children could get a passport.

Still surrendering his birthright chafed him quite a bit. Instead of making good on sending soldiers from Alexandria over the Memorial Bridge to threaten Congress Cummings hired a lobbyist to change the law like everyone else. In 1980 thanks in part to his efforts Congress passed legislation invalidating the Supreme Court ruling and allowing his daughters to claim U.S. citizenship.

The final noteworthy episode of Cummings' life was a tragedy—but an ironic one considering how much he both doted on his children and courted press attention. In 1997 his daughter Susan shot and killed her unfaithful Argentine polo player husband on the lavish estate in Virginia's horse country that her father had given her. She claimed the husband was abusive and had threatened her with a knife. She was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and spent 57 days in jail.

The episode was irresistible to the gossip rags. Cummings died of a series of strokes in April 1998 the same month a lurid Vanity Fair story about his daughter's crime was on newsstands. He was 71.

At the time of Cummings' death the industrial Alexandria waterfront was already largely redeveloped. He would be unsurprised to see tourists eating ice cream where his lethal empire once stood. But while Interarms' warehouses may be gone the news that Americans bought 5 million new guns this year would certainly bring a smile to Cummings' face.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvMjAyMS8wMi8yNy9tYWtpbmctbWFkaXNvbi1jYXd0aG9ybi1ob3ctZmFsc2Vob29kcy1oZWxwZWQtcHJvcGVsLWNhcmVlci1uZXctcHJvLXRydW1wLXN0YXItZmFyLXJpZ2h0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The making of Madison Cawthorn: How falsehoods helped propel the career of a new pro-Trump star of the far right,"Madison Cawthorn was a 21-year-old freshman at a conservative Christian college when he spoke at chapel testifying about his relationship with God.

Key parts of Cawthorn’s talk however were not true. The friend Bradley Ledford who has not previously spoken publicly about the chapel speech said in an interview that Cawthorn’s account was false and that he pulled Cawthorn from the wreckage. An accident report obtained by The Washington Post said Cawthorn was “incapacitated” not that he was declared dead. Cawthorn himself said in a lawsuit deposition first reported by the news outlet AVL Watchdog that he had been rejected by the Naval Academy before the crash.

Shortly after the speech Cawthorn dropped out of the college after a single semester of mostly D’s he said in the deposition which was taken as part of a court case regarding insurance. Later more than 150 former students signed a letter accusing him of being a sexual predator which Cawthorn has denied.

Yet four years after Cawthorn spoke at the chapel the portrait he sketched of his life provided the framework for his election in November as the youngest member of the U.S. House at the minimum age of 25 years old. A campaign video ad repeated his false claim that the car wreck had derailed his plans to attend the Naval Academy.

He promptly used his newfound fame to push baseless allegations about voting fraud on Twitter in a video viewed 4 million times which President Donald Trump retweeted saying “Thank you Madison!” Then Cawthorn spoke at the Jan. 6 rally where a mob was incited to storm the U.S. Capitol again alleging fraud and extolling the crowd’s courage in comparison with the “cowards” in Congress. He returned to the Capitol where he falsely claimed that insurrectionists had been “paid by the Democratic machine.”

Today less than two months after being sworn in Cawthorn has emerged as one of the most visible figures among newly arrived publicity-hungry House Republicans including Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia who have promoted baseless assertions and pushed a radicalized ideology that has become a driving force in the GOP.

The story of Cawthorn’s rise is by any measure an extraordinary accomplishment at a young age by a man who suffered a horrific injury. But an examination by The Post of how he ascended so quickly shows how even one of the most neophyte elected Republicans is adopting the Trump playbook making false statements about his background issuing baseless allegations about voter fraud and demonizing his political opponents.

Cawthorn won his campaign with a brief résumé that included working at a Chick-fil-A a part-time role in a congressional office the single semester of college and fledgling work as a real estate investor. He was boosted by a last-minute $500000 blitz by a political action committee that trashed his primary opponent as a “Never Trumper” which the opponent said was false. Cawthorn’s campaign website said Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) who is Black wanted to “ruin” White males running for office an assertion Booker denounced as “rank racism.”

Cawthorn’s election also came despite an extraordinary effort by former classmates and other alumni of Patrick Henry College urging that the voters of North Carolina’s 11th Congressional District reject him on grounds of alleged sexual misconduct. Three women told The Post in on-the-record interviews that they objected to Cawthorn’s behavior with one saying he tried forcibly to kiss her after she rejected his advance.

Cawthorn declined an interview request. His press secretary Micah Bock who went to college with him declined to respond directly to a list of questions that he had asked The Post to send to the congressman. Instead Bock said that voters responded to such questions by electing Cawthorn although some of the events — such as his speech before the storming of the U.S. Capitol — happened after the election.

The young North Carolinian now presents himself as the future of his party brashly proclaiming that “I will put the Republican establishment on my shoulders and drag them kicking and screaming back to the Constitution.” Cawthorn was a featured speaker Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando attacking “vicious” opponents who are “trying to take away all of our rights” and “are trying to turn this country into a communist ash heap.”

A crash in Florida

By his account Cawthorn led a charmed life growing up in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina. Handsome and athletic he was home-schooled and played high school football. He sought admission to the U.S. Naval Academy under a process that enables a local member of Congress to recommend candidates.

That led Cawthorn to seek help from then-Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C) a conservative co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus. As it happened Cawthorn was friends with Meadows’s son Blake. The senior Meadows agreed in December 2013 to nominate Cawthorn to the Naval Academy but Cawthorn’s acceptance depended on his grades test scores and other measures.

After the Naval Academy rejected Cawthorn’s application he said in the deposition he went on a spring break trip in Florida with his friend Ledford.

During the 2014 trip Cawthorn then 18 and Ledford then 17 traded positions between the driver and passenger seats while the vehicle was moving on the highway Cawthorn said in his deposition. At the time Cawthorn said he thought he was invincible “didn’t see any danger in it” and did it to save time.

The two were traveling back to North Carolina when Ledford nodded off while driving on Interstate 4 in Florida and crashed into a concrete construction barrier Ledford said in a deposition. Ledford said Cawthorn while wearing a seat belt harness had been sleeping in a “laid back position” in a manner that the harness did not touch Cawthorn’s body and with “his feet being on the dash[board].”

Ledford said in his deposition that when the van crashed he saw Cawthorn was unconscious. The doors were jammed and the vehicle began to be enveloped in flames. Ledford said he exited through a window “unbuckled Madison and proceeded to pull him out while a bystander came in and helped me.”

In his chapel address however Cawthorn told it this way: “He was my brother my best friend. And he leaves me in a car to die in a fiery tomb. He runs to safety deep in the woods and just leaves me in a burning car as the flames start to lick my legs and curl up and burn my left side. Fortunately there was several bystanders who come by and they break the window open that they pulled me out to safety and they sat me down. The paramedics arrive and decided that I’m gone and I have no pulse I have no breath. And I was I was declared dead on the scene. For whatever reason may it be adrenaline or divine intervention I definitely believe it’s the latter I had a deep inhale of breath.""

Ledford said in an interview with The Post that he raced to save his friend’s life.

“That statement he made was false” Ledford said. “It hurt very badly that he would say something as false as that. That is not at all what happened. I pulled him out of the car the second that I was able to get out of the car.”

Ledford said the two didn’t talk for a couple of years. He said pressure regarding insurance claims caused Cawthorn to say “crazy things.” Ledford said he has reconnected with Cawthorn and “he told me that he didn’t believe those things anymore.”

In his deposition Cawthorn did not say his friend left him for dead. Instead he said “I have no memory from the accident.” An accident report and other records from the Florida Highway Patrol say Cawthorn was incapacitated and in critical condition not that he was declared dead.

As a result of the accident Cawthorn has limited use of his legs uses a wheelchair and received a $3 million settlement from an insurance company as well as other payments and is seeking $30 million more according to court records from several lawsuits related to the case.

Cawthorn attributed his poor grades in college to “suffering from a brain injury after the accident definitely — I think it slowed my brain down a little bit” he said in the deposition. “Made me less intelligent. And the pain also made reading and studying very difficult.”

‘I told him no’

Cawthorn underwent multiple surgeries. Eventually with a modified car he was able to drive again and he soon began asking young women to go on what they say he called “fun drives.”

Katrina Krulikas who was part of a home-schooling network that included Cawthorn said she was 17 years old and he was 19 when they agreed to go on a date. She said in an interview that she got into his car and he drove to a “deserted part of town and he took me to the woods.”

They got out of the car and Cawthorn talked about sex which made her feel uncomfortable. “All these very intimate pressing questions that at the time for someone that grew up in a very conservative community and hadn’t really talked about sex I didn’t really know anyone having sex. … It was a very religious community.”

Cawthorn then made his move from his wheelchair Krulikas said.

“He tries to kiss me and I say no and I don’t let him kiss me” she said. “We talk for like a little bit longer like a few minutes. And then suddenly” he moved forward “as if to try to kiss me so quickly that I wouldn’t have a choice to say no or push him away. And at this point I’m so startled that I fall back. My hair gets stuck in his chair. I’m ripping my hair out trying to get out of the situation.”

Returning home Krulikas said she texted a friend that she would never feel comfortable being alone with Cawthorn again. At the time she didn’t complain because she felt she had “put myself in that situation.” But as she grew older she said she believed Cawthorn deserved blame and “I definitely would classify it as sexual assault because he knew I said no.”

Krulikas first told of the encounter last August in World Magazine a publication based in Asheville N.C. that describes itself as “grounded in facts and biblical truth.”

Cawthorn whose work experience had mainly been at a Chick-fil-A got a part-time job working at the district office of Meadows.

Cawthorn told the Asheville Citizen-Times that he had worked “full time” for Meadows in 2015 and 2016. Congressional records show Cawthorn was listed as a part-time employee in 2015 and was paid about $15000. In 2016 he received about $3000 for part-time work.

Cawthorn said in an earlier deposition he was accepted to Princeton and an online program at Harvard along with other universities. He later revised his statements to say that he had not been admitted to Princeton and Harvard and that some of his statements about college admissions were “not accurate.”

Cawthorn eventually followed his friend Blake Meadows to become a student at Patrick Henry College where the motto is “For Christ and Liberty.” In this conservative environment in Purcellville Va. some female students said Cawthorn asked them to go on drives in his Dodge Challenger.

“He asked me to go on a ‘fun drive’ ” said one classmate Leah Petree. When she asked what that meant Cawthorn “insinuated some sexual activity.” Petree said “I had a boyfriend so I was not going in the car with him. I told him no.”

Nonetheless Cawthorn continued to “pressure me and badger me.” One day in October 2016 she said she was in the cafeteria with other students when Cawthorn arrived with some of his friends. Petree said Cawthorn began asking another female student questions about sex that Petree deemed inappropriate and she tried to defuse the situation.

“He got really angry and looked at me and screamed at me with a lot of anger” Petree said. She recalled he said she was “ ‘just a little blond slutty American girl.’ And I remember that quote very well. … I remember at the time my eyes stinging with tears the whole table going quiet.”

Petree sent The Post a screenshot of a text conversation she later had with Cawthorn in which he complained that a man approached him and “said I called you a slut.” She texted back that she didn’t know the person’s identity and he responded that “I have some old friends who would love to meet him.”

Some former students said in interviews that they were advised by classmates not to go on a drive with Cawthorn. But a student named Caitlin Coulter said in an interview that she was not aware of those concerns when Cawthorn asked her to ride with him in that fall semester of 2016. She accepted.

Cawthorn took Coulter to “somewhere very rural” she said.

“There was a specific point in which he grew frustrated and I shut him down basically — by not responding to some of the advances he was making. And he got upset and he turned the car around and drove very like violently is the best way I can think of to describe it. Violently back to campus. It was very scary. … It seemed it was very clearly because he was upset that I had turned him down or refused his advances.”

After hurtling down back roads at speeds she said reached 70 or 80 miles an hour they returned to campus and she never heard from him again.

Cawthorn addressed the allegations this way during the campaign: “If I have a daughter I want her to grow up in a world where people know to explicitly ask before touching her. If I had a son I want him to be able to grow up in a world where he would not be called a sexual predator for trying to kiss someone.”

It was shortly after Coulter went on the ride with Cawthorn that he testified at chapel about his relationship with God. The semester was over. Cawthorn never returned and did not attend college elsewhere.

Before Cawthorn was elected a group of his former college classmates urged voters to reject him on several grounds including alleged sexual misconduct. (Gabriella Demczuk)

Running for Congress

Three years after Cawthorn dropped out of Patrick Henry College Cawthorn learned Meadows planned to resign his seat to become chief of staff for President Donald Trump. Meadows and his wife Debra who was executive director of a political action committee called Right Women backed their friend Lynda Bennett a real estate agent in the Republican primary.

Cawthorn announced his candidacy. The 24-year-old was given little chance because of his youth and short résumé.

A campaign video ad said Cawthorn had planned to serve in the Navy “with a nomination to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. But all that changed in the spring of 2014 when tragedy struck.” His campaign website made a similar statement.

By his own admission however that was not true. He had been asked in his deposition whether the rejection by the Naval Academy “was before the accident?”

“It was sir” Cawthorn replied. That acknowledgment was not publicly known until after Cawthorn became the Republican nominee.

Bennett seemed the prohibitive favorite given her backing by Mark and Debra Meadows. But Cawthorn said in a Facebook post in February 2020 that his campaign was thriving thanks to their son. He thanked “one of my closest friends Blake Meadows” for helping with the campaign. Blake Meadows did not respond to a request for comment.

Cawthorn also received crucial help from George Erwin Jr. a former sheriff of Henderson County and former executive director of the North Carolina Association of Chiefs of Police. Erwin helped the candidate gain endorsements from key law enforcement and political figures. He wrote on Facebook in February 2020 that “Congressman Cawthorn just has a sweet sound to it. I will do whatever I need to do to make this happen.”

Then came an extraordinary moment that turned the campaign in Cawthorn’s favor. Someone released an edited audio clip of Bennett saying forcefully “I’m a Never Trump person. I don’t want Trump. I’m Never Trump not going to vote for him.”

Bennett promptly denied that she was a Never Trumper and soon a fuller audio clip was released that seemed to back her assertion that she had been mimicking someone who would never vote for Trump. She led the primary field but state law required that she exceed 30 percent of the vote. That led to a runoff between her and the runner-up Cawthorn.

Bennett again was the favorite. But Cawthorn got an extraordinary boost from an outside group a Georgia-based political action committee called Protect Freedom that sought to elect candidates in the mold of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). The group’s largest contributor is Jeff Yass a co-founder of the Pennsylvania-based investment company Susquehanna International Group who gave the PAC a total of $8.5 million in 2019 and 2020 according to federal election records. Yass declined to comment.

The committee poured $500000 into the race to support Cawthorn in the days before the runoff. The money was mainly spent on mailers and television ads that renewed the charge that Bennett was a Never Trumper.

Bennett said in an interview that the last-minute spending on what she called a “lie” devastated her campaign and she ran an ad blaming “Madison Cawthorn’s DC friends.” She said it proved impossible to convince many people that she had been mocking a Never Trumper even when Trump endorsed her just before the election.

Michael Biundo a spokesman for Protect Freedom said in an interview that he believed the committee’s advertising “played a big role in the race.” He said the committee was aware that an audio clip had been released in which Bennett said she was not a Never Trumper but nonetheless decided to air that charge.

“We stand by what we put out there” he said.

With the committee’s help Cawthorn beat Bennett by 31 points. He vowed to be the most pro-Trump member of Congress and the president soon backed him effusively saying he’s “a terrific young man. … He’s going to be one of the greats.”

Embraced by Trump

After Cawthorn became the Republican nominee for the 11th District seat his background was scrutinized by AVL Watchdog the local news outlet that first reported on the deposition in which Cawthorn acknowledged that he was rejected by the Naval Academy before the accident.

Cawthorn attacked one of the outlet’s reporters Tom Fiedler who previously had been editor in chief of the Miami Herald and dean of Boston University’s College of Communication. Fiedler who had a home in Asheville had volunteered for Booker’s 2020 Democratic presidential campaign.

Cawthorn responded to Fiedler’s reporting by attacking his association with Booker. Fiedler “quit his academia job in Boston to work for non-white males like Cory Booker who aims to ruin white males running for office” a Cawthorn campaign website alleged as first reported by the Bulwark. Booker denounced the comment.

Cawthorn responded by saying “The syntax of our language was unclear and unfairly implied I was criticizing Cory Booker.”

As Cawthorn headed to the general election former classmates and other alumni at Patrick Henry College circulated the letter that leveled accusations against him.

“Cawthorn’s time at PHC was marked by gross misconduct towards our female peers public misrepresentation of his past disorderly conduct that was against the school’s student honor code and self-admitted academic failings” the letter said. “During his brief time at the college Cawthorn established a reputation for predatory behavior. … We urge the voters of North Carolina to seriously reevaluate Madison Cawthorn’s candidacy in light of who he really is.”

After more than 150 alumni signed the letter the organizers hoped it would lead to Cawthorn’s defeat in the general election. He faced Democrat Moe Davis a former director of the Air Force Judiciary.

Cawthorn meanwhile traveled to the Texas border on July 30 and echoing the views of a radicalized far-right ideology alleged that there was “a large group of cartels kidnapping our American children and then taking them to sell them on a slave market a sex slave market.” He said that “tens of thousands of our children” were taken in what he called “one of the greatest atrocities I can imagine” blaming the media for failing to focus on the matter.

There’s no evidence that cartels have kidnapped large numbers of U.S. children and sold them on a slave market.

The Republican Party meanwhile saw Cawthorn as a star and gave him a coveted slot speaking on the third night of its national convention. Seeking to combat questions about his youth Cawthorn said that if viewers didn’t think young people could change the world “you don’t know American history.” He said that “my personal favorite James Madison was just 25 years old when he signed the Declaration of Independence.”

In fact Madison never signed the Declaration of Independence. He was known as the Father of the Constitution which he signed.

‘It’s time to fight’

Running in a heavily Republican district Cawthorn won by a 12-point margin against Davis who said in an interview that his opponent “has got to be the least qualified member of Congress.”

Cawthorn became one of the most loyal defenders of Trump who claimed falsely that the 2020 election had been stolen from him. In a six-minute video posted to Twitter on Dec. 31 Cawthorn said “My first act as a member of Congress will be to object to the electoral college certification of the 2020 election.”

To justify his decision he repeated a host of false and misleading claims about the election accusing various state election officials of violating the law even though courts across the country and Trump’s own attorney general William P. Barr rejected these allegations.

“Voter fraud is common in America. Those who tell you otherwise are lying” Cawthorn said in the video.

Cawthorn alleged that a number of states had violated the Constitution and their own laws. Cawthorn said “ballots were shoved into duffel bags and left in parks and gas stations.” He said Nevada “allowed dead people and out-of-state voters to flood the electoral system” a baseless assertion. He said mail-in ballots “are wildly susceptible to fraud.”

“Fact-check that” Cawthorn said adding “Do not let your vote be canceled by these bastards.”

In fact voter fraud is rare mail-in ballots have been almost entirely free of fraud for decades no widespread fraud was found in the fall election and courts across the country dismissed more than 60 legal challenges filed by the Trump campaign.

Cawthorn’s video however made an impression on one person in particular. Trump gleefully retweeted it on Jan. 1. (The Post asked Twitter whether Cawthorn’s tweet met its civic integrity standards. After the inquiry on Feb. 11 Twitter attached the following statement to Cawthorn’s tweet: “This claim of election fraud is disputed and this Tweet can’t be replied to Retweeted or liked due to a risk of violence.”)

Cawthorn was sworn in on Jan. 3 and he amped up his rhetoric tweeting the following day that “the future of this Republic hinges on the actions of a solitary few. … It’s time to fight.” He was invited to speak at the Jan. 6 rally and derided members of both parties.

“The Democrats with all the fraud they have done in this election the Republicans hiding and not fighting they are trying to silence your voice” Cawthorn said castigating members of his own party who “have no backbone” and deriding “the cowards of Washington D.C. that I serve with.”

He urged the crowd to be part of a new Republican Party “that will go and fight. … Make your voice heard because do we love Donald Trump? But my friends we’re not just doing this for Donald Trump we are doing this for the Constitution. Our Constitution was violated.”

Cawthorn then went to the Capitol and after taking refuge from some of the same people who had listened to his address called into the Charlie Kirk radio show and made an incendiary baseless claim that Democrats were behind the insurrection.

“I believe this was agitators strategically placed inside of this group” Cawthorn said. “You can call them ‘antifa’ you can call them people paid by the Democratic machine but to make the Trump campaign the Trump movement look bad and to make this look like it was a violent outrage when really the battle is being fought by people like myself and other great patriots who were standing up against the establishment standing up against this tyranny in our country.” He said the storming of the Capitol was “disgusting impermissible.”

No evidence has emerged that Democrats or antifa the anti-fascist protest movement were behind the insurrection.

Cawthorn was among the 139 House Republicans who voted to object to the certification of some presidential election results. The Democratic Party of North Carolina’s 11th District which covers western parts of the state has called for an investigation into what it calls Cawthorn’s “seditious behavior.”

As the blowback mounted Cawthorn defended his actions but changed his tone. Asked about his rally speech during an interview on OZY he said: “If I could go back I wouldn’t have changed any words that I did say but I probably would have added some lines. I probably would have encouraged more peace.”

Without any mention of his video baselessly alleging massive voting irregularities he said that he hadn’t promoted theories about fraudulent voting machines or “U-Hauls being backed up with tons of ballots and they were fraudulently marked. I couldn’t have personally proved that … so I definitely didn’t try and feed into that narrative.”

Erwin the former sheriff who helped Cawthorn get endorsements said in an interview that he increasingly is regretful for playing a crucial role in the election.

Erwin went on Facebook after the Capitol riot and wrote: “I apologize to all of my law enforcement friends other politicians family and friends — I was wrong I misled you. When I saw [Cawthorn’s] speech to the crowd in Washington I thought this is not good. … Your words can incite or calm. I saw no calming words and people died and were injured.”

Erwin confirmed that he wrote the post and expressed profound remorse. “I was filled with hope for him” Erwin said. “And that hope was dashed and it was crushed. And that’s on me. That’s why I had to apologize to folks.”

Republican House leaders meanwhile rewarded Cawthorn with assignments that belied his background of a single college semester of mostly D’s and rejection by the Naval Academy. He now serves on the Education Committee and the Veterans’ Affairs Committee.

The fine particles clump loosely together to form “floc” and giant paddles stir the mix so it’s smooth enough to drink.

Softening is one step among many in getting 39 million gallons of clean drinking water each day into the homes and businesses of more than 425000 paying customers throughout the east metro. But these particular two-story basins stand idle and empty.

A century ago explains the longtime general manager of St. Paul Regional Water Services Schneider’s early predecessors had the foresight to build redundant flocculators among other water-treatment machinery that has outlived the 20th century.

Soon those tools will be retired and Schneider is leaving with them after a 30-year career tending to the tap water distributed to St. Paul and 13 other east-metro communities.

As one of his last orders of business Schneider in January signed the first of a two-part contract with Jacobs Engineering that will impact every business and household across his service area. It’s time he said to erect a new water-treatment plant for the east metro.

“We’re in the forever business” Schneider said. “We have to be here. Every community needs a clean reliable supply of drinking water.”

RATE INCREASES

To pay for the new plant and some much smaller projects rates will gradually increase. By 2024 the average water customer will pay $392 a year up from $313 today.

“It is going to be tough for the community to swallow. It will be about a 25 percent increase in their bill by year four when the construction is complete. We’re working really hard to keep taxes at bay in the city” West St. Paul Mayor Dave Napier said.

“But I think our community will understand” he added. “The importance of having quality water in our community is critical. Technology has changed. The plant 100 percent of their operation is funded by the users. It’s not like they’re a for-profit business or tax-funded so they have to spread the cost among the users.”

Replacing the massive McCarrons facility likely will be the most expensive water-treatment plant project in the history of Minnesota Schneider said and the most elaborate since McCarrons construction began in 1910 and was fully online by 1925.

“It has been serving us really well but it’s getting up there in age” said Will Menkhaus civil engineer and project manager with the water utility.

RELATED: St. Paul Regional Water Services fast facts

Though there’s no sign of imminent danger massive water tank footings dating back to 1910 give everyone pause said assistant general manager Patrick Shea.

Not everything must go but the flocculators are not long for this world. The design-build project — which by present estimates carries a price tag of $160 million — will replace two-thirds of the McCarrons plant from its water tanks to its water clarification and re-carbonation equipment. Construction of a new plant directly next to the McCarrons facility and demolition of the old one could be complete by fall 2025.

Even some communities that own their own billing and distribution systems such as the University of Minnesota Roseville and Arden Hills buy water wholesale from the utility and will be impacted by cost increases.

Board president Mara Humphrey called the project a “proactive investment allowing us to replace the facility in a manner that ensures a seamless transition from our current process to a modern facility with the flexibility to address any future regulatory challenges that may arise. This project will ensure we are able to continue that quality service for several generations to come.”

WHAT ABOUT THE OLD PLANT?

In Maplewood some discussion likely will concern how to document the history of the plant repurpose portions of it or otherwise take advantage of the newly bare land. The new more efficient plant will have a much smaller footprint than the existing one even accounting for projected regional population growth.

Utility officials have said there’s no plan to sell off real estate or repurpose the existing facility which largely will be demolished freeing up space for potential future improvements and new technologies.

Bob Cardinal a former Water Services board member who sits on the city of Maplewood’s Heritage Preservation Commission hopes the utility will rethink that approach given that the campus pays no property taxes.

“The city of Maplewood needs … additional tax base maybe affordable housing” Cardinal said. “That would help the (housing) shortage.”

The commission’s vice chair Richard Currie recalled a time decades ago when the land immediately adjacent to the treatment plant was a public park before security concerns made that impractical. He’d like to see that land return to the public.

As for preserving its history Currie said “That facility has got to change with the growth of the city but they could leave the main building that was there from practically day one.”

NO IMMEDIATE NEED

How urgent is building a new plant? Not at all Schneider acknowledges.

The century-old plant was built to last and the water utility consistently wins annual recognition from the Partnership for Safe Water a drinking water optimization program sponsored by the American Water Works Association the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other water-quality organizations.

“This isn’t a project where we’re going from poor water quality to better water quality” Menkhaus said. “But if we can improve reliability and maintain ourselves as one of the top 20 or 30 water-treatment plants in the country that’s a plus.”

Still recent infrastructure disasters in Texas and Flint Mich. illustrate what happens when communities are caught unaware about threats to their drinking water.

Meanwhile interest rates for capital improvement projects have never been better said Schneider and St. Paul Regional Water is working closely on cost and quality issues with the Environmental Protection Agency’s Revolving Loan Fund the Minnesota Department of Health and the state’s Public Facilities Authority which will handle bond sales to finance the project.

Rather than hire one firm to design a new treatment plant and then find the lowest bidder on construction the utility took the unusual step of issuing a request for proposals and hiring a single company — Jacobs Engineering of Dallas Texas — to oversee both design and construction. Jacobs was chosen over responses from CDM Smith and McCarrons Constructors — a joint venture that included Rice Lake Construction Group and Black & Veatch.

Design-build delivery systems are more common for major transportation projects such as state bridge installations and required special permission from the state Legislature in 2018.

The goal said Schneider is to hold one company accountable for the finished product. Given the sensitivity of the project officials hoped to avoid three-way finger-pointing between the utility designers and construction contractors over change orders. The two-part contract is structured in such a way that the utility still can seek a different construction partner if it sees fit.

WASHINGTON COUNTY Pa.—In the summer of 2019 13-year-old Gunnar Bjornson spent most days banging on his drums playing video games antagonizing his siblings wandering outdoors and scrounging for junk food in his home's mostly healthy kitchen.

Gunnar is tan and blond with bright blue eyes and all the charisma required to survive being the younger of two middle children in a big family. He's the household entertainer constantly cracking jokes and falling into contagious giggling fits.

Gunnar lives with his mom dad older brothers and younger sister about 35 miles south of Pittsburgh in the aptly-named community of Scenery Hill where narrow country roads wind through shady woods that open up onto hilltop vistas of rolling fields. The hills are peppered with farmhouses fruit orchards and fields of corn and squash. The roadsides are punctuated by little white churches farm stands and dirt driveways marked with hand-painted signs like ""The Jones's"" and ""Hidden Family Farm.""

Scenery Hill is in Washington County the most heavily fracked county in Pennsylvania with about 1584 wells in its 861 square miles so the idyllic country roads are also flanked with signs directing oil and gas well traffic: ""No well traffic beyond this point"" ""Staging area ---->"" ""Truck traffic: No engine breaks"" and ads that read ""We buy mineral rights!"" August 19 2019 was a typical day for Gunnar—he played drums took the dog outside and argued and joked with his siblings. But unbeknownst to him and his family Gunnar had a number of harmful chemicals coursing through his body. A urine sample taken from Gunnar that day contained 11 harmful industrial chemicals including benzene toluene naphthalene and lesser-known chemicals linked to a range of health effects including respiratory and gastrointestinal problems skin and eye irritation organ damage reproductive harm and increased cancer risk. These chemicals are found in things like gasoline pesticides industrial solvents and glues varnishes paints car exhaust industrial emissions and tobacco smoke. They're also commonly detected in air emissions from fracking wells.

Gunnar Bjornson in his family's Scenery Hill Pennsylvania home. (Credit: Connor Mulvaney for Environmental Health News) Fracking another name for hydraulic fracturing is the process of extracting oil and gas from the Earth by drilling deep wells and injecting liquid at high pressure. Over the last decade fracking has transformed the U.S. energy industry—total crude oil production more than doubled from 2010 to 2020 and natural gas once in short supply is now so over-abundant it's exported overseas. But in that same time period concerns about the health effects of fracking have escalated. In Texas researchers found that babies born near frequent flaring—the burning off of excess natural gas from fracking wells—are 50 percent more likely to be premature. In Colorado the state Department of Health found that people living near fracking sites face elevated risk of nosebleeds headaches breathing trouble and dizziness. In Pennsylvania researchers found that people living near fracking face increased rates of infant mortality depression and hospitalizations for skin and urinary issues. Studies of fracking communities throughout the country have found that living near fracking wells increases the risk of premature births high-risk pregnancies asthma migraines fatigue nasal and sinus symptoms skin disorders and heart failure; and laboratory studies have linked chemicals used in fracking fluid to endocrine disruption—which can cause hormone imbalance reproductive harm early puberty brain and behavior problems improper immune function and cancer. ""We have enough evidence at this point that these health impacts should be of serious concern to policymakers interested in protecting public health"" Irena Gorski Steiner an environmental epidemiology doctoral candidate at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health told EHN (EHN). EHN has reported on this increasing evidence of fracking's impacts on human health for years. But we saw a gap in the science—almost no one was checking to see if harmful fracking chemicals were actually in the bodies of people living near wells. In 2019 EHN collected urine samples along with air and water samples from five families in southwestern Pennsylvania including the Bower-Bjornsons and had them analyzed for chemicals associated with fracking. We found:

Chemicals in water air and urine samples that are linked to a wide range of harmful health impacts

Cancer-causing chemicals in air samples at levels that exceeded recommended safety thresholds

Biomarkers (also referred to as breakdown products or metabolites) for harmful chemicals like ethylbenzene styrene and toluene in the bodies of southwestern Pennsylvanians at levels significantly higher than the average American. For example we found a biomarker for toluene in a 9 year-old boy living near fracking wells at a level 91 times as high as the level seen in the average American

Families that live closer to fracking wells had higher levels of chemicals like 123-trimethylbenzene 2-heptanone and naphthalene in their urine than families that live further away. Exposure to these compounds is linked to skin eye and respiratory issues gastrointestinal illness liver problems neurological issues immune system and kidney damage developmental issues hormone disruption and increased cancer risk. Read about how we conducted our study

We collected a total of 17 urine samples from Gunnar and his family during the summer of 2019. Some chemical exposures aren't detectable in urine if the body has already broken them down so we also looked for breakdown products or biomarkers of harmful chemicals. The presence of these chemicals and their biomarkers in urine generally reflect exposures that occurred within a few days of sampling. Some of these biomarkers have sources other than these chemicals. For example trans trans-muconic acid is a biomarker for benzene but eating sorbic acid (a common food preservative) also produces trans trans-muconic acid. Hippuric acid is a biomarker for toluene which can damage the nervous system or kidneys but it's also formed when the body processes tea wine and certain fruit juices. As a result we expect everyone to have a certain level of these compounds in their bodies. To determine whether the levels we saw in Pennsylvania families were normal we compared the levels of these biomarkers in the families we tested to the levels seen in the average American using U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. More than half of the family's samples exceeded the U.S. 95th percentile for phenylglyoxylic acid a biomarker for ethylbenzene and styrene and 41 percent of the family's samples exceeded the U.S. 95th percentile for hippuric acid and trans trans-muconic acid—biomarkers for toluene and benzene respectively. Exposure to these compounds is linked to skin lung and eye irritation; central nervous system liver and kidney damage; and cancer.



Gunnar's urine sample contained a level of mandelic acid a biomarker for ethylbenzene and styrene 55 times as high as the average American (according to CDC data) and higher than levels typically seen in the average adult cigarette smoker. Mandelic acid isn't itself harmful—it's used in small amounts in some medicines and skincare products—but exposure to ethylbenzene and styrene is linked to skin eye and respiratory tract irritation reproductive harm endocrine disruption and increased cancer risk. A few years ago when drilling began simultaneously at three of the fracking well pads within a few miles of the Bower-Bjornson home Gunnar frequently got nosebleeds that lasted up to 20 minutes and drained all the color from his face. Sometimes he'd cough up blood clots afterwards. Once he recalled this happened at school and he asked his teacher not to tell his mom about it knowing it worried her. Gunnar still gets nosebleeds but they're less frequent now that all three of those wells are in production—meaning they're no longer actively drilled and fracked but are producing oil and gas. They aren't the only three wells nearby. The family's home is within five miles of at least 25 active well pads many of which contain multiple wells. The nearest pad owned by Pittsburgh-headquartered EQT Corporation—the largest producer of natural gas in the country—is home to 10 operational wells.

There's no way to know for certain whether Gunnar and his family's exposures came from fracking emissions. We looked for other potential sources of exposure by visiting their home asking them to complete an extensive survey and recording their activities around the time of our sampling. On the days we collected samples the family generally engaged in normal summer activities—running errands working in the garden and lounging around the house. When we observed other potential sources of exposure they're noted in our reporting. To our knowledge the Bower-Bjornsons did not smoke cigarettes spend hours in traffic or consume vast enough quantities of foods or products containing these compounds to entirely explain why their levels for these compounds were so much higher than they are in most Americans. The biggest difference between this family and the average American: their home's proximity to fracking wells. ""I sort of knew we were being exposed here"" Gunnar's mom Lois Bower-Bjornson told EHN ""but I had no idea it was at this level. Seeing this on paper was a real eye opener."" We found harmful chemicals in Lois's urine samples too—on July 23 2019 her sample contained the highest level of naphthalene detected in our study. There isn't any national data available to compare her level against but the level of naphthalene detected in Lois's urine sample that day was more than 15 times higher than the median level we detected in other southwestern Pennsylvania residents.

(Credit: Connor Mulvaney for Environmental Health News) ""When we do air samples and we do urine samples we don't usually find naphthalene unless there's an industrial source releasing naphthalene very close by"" Wilma Subra an environmental scientist and founder of the environmental consulting firm the Subra Company told EHN. Through her firm Subra has spent decades conducting studies similar to EHN's in communities facing toxic exposures. She also previously served as vice-chair of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Advisory Council for Environmental Policy and received a MacArthur fellowship for her work related to environmental exposures. We all face myriad exposures to toxic chemicals every day—a byproduct of living in a modern world replete with vehicles heavy industry plastics and pesticides. EHN's pilot study was small and more research is needed to tease out fracking exposures and trends. Still the exposures we found in Gunnar his family and four other southwestern Pennsylvania households suggest that the approximately 18 million Americans who live within a mile of an active oil and gas well might face above-average levels of exposure to chemicals that are harming them. For many of those families including the Bower-Bjornsons the industry's proximity to their homes has not only led to anxiety about their health but also damaged their quality of life and made them feel disempowered and neglected by the federal and state agencies that are supposed to protect them.

A dream that became a nightmare Lois Bower-Bjornson at her Scenery Hill Pennsylvania home. (Credit: Connor Mulvaney for Environmental Health News) Washington County is about 93 percent White and mostly rural dotted with aging mining towns. The exception is the county seat a small city of the same name as the county that's home to Washington & Jefferson College and about 7 percent of the county's approximately 207298 residents. Most of the county is middle class. The poverty rate is about 10 percent a few points lower than the state poverty rate of 12 percent. The Bower-Bjornson's picturesque white farmhouse built in 1830 was originally the town general store. The walls of the large living room are shelved floor to ceiling and on one shelf left unpainted for posterity there are lists of goods quantities and prices and tallies for what appear to be family tabs scratched in faded pencil. The rest of the shelves are filled with books a musically diverse record collection and childhood memorabilia like school dioramas and lego houses. As a young couple Lois and her husband Dave lived in Pittsburgh's North Side on the historic Mexican War Streets but after the arrival of their second child they started looking for more space. They saw this house in Scenery Hill and fell in love with the idea of an idyllic country life. They moved in and enrolled the kids in a one-room elementary school where they spent their days practicing yoga growing a garden and helping prepare shared meals. Odessa the youngest of the four Bower-Bjornson children told EHN ""It's the best school in the world.""

(Credit: Connor Mulvaney for Environmental Health News) When fracking companies arrived in 2011 the Bower-Bjornson's weren't worried—they saw an opportunity for economic growth. They granted one company permission to run natural gas transmission lines beneath their property for $12500 (though they haven't leased their mineral rights). But over the next few years the family's quiet country life morphed into something else. Their property was surrounded by voluminous truck traffic large flames shooting into the sky bad smells bright lights loud noises and an expensive ruptured gas line they chalked up to the increased traffic. They soon began to feel overwhelmed—and they're not alone. In fracking towns across the country residents have found themselves at odds over whether to lease their land and cash in or fight back against the industry. When formerly rural and suburban areas are suddenly industrialized by the fracking industry research has found that residents' sense of place and identity are disrupted and that living amidst fracking can increase worry anxiety and depression. Concerns about water contamination have also persisted since the beginning of the fracking boom when footage of tap water from homes near well pads catching on fire due to its high methane content went viral.

(Credit: Ted Auch FracTracker Alliance 2019) Researchers have documented drinking water contamination from fracking in Pennsylvania Ohio North Dakota and Wyoming at various points in time and in 2016 the EPA concluded the industry posed a threat to the U.S. water supply. A literature review published in 2020 looked at a decade of research on the impacts of just fracking wastewater disposal and found that drinking water in fracking communities has higher levels of total dissolved solids (like calcium magnesium chlorides and sulfates) salt and methane. Kathleen Sgamma president of the Western Energy Alliance an industry group representing 200 unconventional oil and gas companies that operate in the Western U.S. told EHN that while companies have always worked to minimize the chance of water contamination occurring they've made some additional improvements in recent years. ""Wellbore integrity has been improving for decades and almost every state with a major oil and gas presence has tightened up its fracturing rules so the risk of groundwater contamination continues to be managed to a very low level"" Sgamma said. ""When we look at surface handling of water that's generally where spills can occur. It's rare for surface water to be contaminated but when that happens it has to be remediated and companies are held liable for that."" ""Nobody wants to have a spill for several reasons"" she added. ""One because it takes a lot more money to clean up a spill than it does to just prevent it in the first place and two because it can harm a company's reputation."" She added that companies have improved their ability to recycle wastewater resulting in less freshwater use and helping to account for some of the wastewater disposal issues that have occurred. The Bower-Bjornson's water comes from the local municipal system Tri County Joint Municipal Authority which serves more than 10000 customers in southeastern Washington County. For the last several years the Bower-Bjornson family has received The Bower-Bjornson's water comes from the local municipal system Tri County Joint Municipal Authority which serves more than 10000 customers in southeastern Washington County. For the last several years the Bower-Bjornson family has received notices from the municipal water authority and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) Bureau of Safe Drinking Water stating that the municipal water contains unregulated chemical contaminants including haloacetic acids total trihalomethanes nitrates and inorganic compounds among others. The notices advise anyone who is pregnant has an infant has a compromised immune system or is elderly should consult with a physician before drinking their tap water.

Brothers Kylan Bjornson and Nels Bjornson in their home in Scenery Hill Pennsylvania. (Credit: Connor Mulvaney for Environmental Health News) The oil and gas industry is one likely source of these contaminants along with mining and other heavy industries. Some contaminants such as trihalomethanes are formed when contaminants in source water interact with chemicals used for treatment. Sydney Evans a science analyst at the Environmental Working Group a public health advocacy nonprofit told EHN that few federal or state water regulations have been updated in the last 20 years so there's a gap between what's legal and what's safe. ""People tend to take the safety of their tap water for granted because it's being monitored tested and treated"" Evans said. ""But it's important for people to realize that legal doesn't necessarily mean safe."" Most public drinking water in the region comes from the Monongahela River (or ""the Mon"" in local parlance). In 2014 the DEP found radioactive chemicals at levels 60 times higher than what federal drinking standards allow in Ten Mile Creek near the Bower-Bjornson's home which feeds into the Mon and many locals feel certain fracking wastewater is the source. Last year it was discovered that a municipal sewage plant in nearby Belle Vernon was unknowingly accepting and releasing untreated fracking leachate from a nearby landfill containing high levels of chlorides barium and radium at higher levels than federal drinking water standards allow into the Mon—one of many similar instances across the state.

(Credit: Connor Mulvaney for Environmental Health News) At the beginning of the summer of 2019 EHN collected water samples from three locations in the Bower-Bjornson's family's home: The reverse osmosis-filtered kitchen tap the bathtub faucet and the outside hose spigot. We found detectable levels of 20 of the 40 chemicals commonly used in fracking that we looked for in samples from at least one of those locations including benzene which is known to increase cancer risk and naphthalene which is listed as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"" by the EPA. Federal regulatory limits exist for just five of the 40 chemicals we looked at and the family's water samples did not exceed those limits. Some states set health advisory limits for chemicals that aren't officially regulated. Vermont recommends no more than 0.5 micrograms per liter of naphthalene in drinking water to avoid health effects including increased cancer risk. The Bower-Bjornsons had 5.83 micrograms per liter of naphthalene in their water—nearly 12 times as high as Vermont's health advisory limit. Tri-County Joint Municipal Authority declined to comment on these findings.

Lois who has been tracking the kids' symptoms since the drilling began said that seeing these test results confirmed what she already feared. ""[Fracking] just completely encompasses us"" she said. ""It's not like we can look to our right or left and say it's not there. And everywhere that they go school or wherever it's there too.""

Economic gains in question A hydraulic fracturing drilling rig in western Pennsylvania at night. (Credit: Ted Auch FracTracker Alliance 2015) Fracking does bring economic benefits—at least temporarily. A 2019 paper in American Economic Journal: Applied Economics found that in the initial three years of a boom fracked communities typically see total incomes increase by around 3-6 percent employment increase by about 4-6 percent and salaries increase by about 5-11 percent. Housing prices increase about 6 percent while local governments see about a 16 percent increase in revenue. Taking into account both increased incomes and decreased quality of life (from things like increased crime rates truck traffic and pollution) the authors of that study concluded that in regions where fracking occurs across all U.S. shale plays the industry resulted in an average net gain of approximately $2500 per household in the first three years—though some communities saw much higher gains and others saw none. Over time these impacts on local economies are diminished. A study published in February 2021 by the Ohio River Valley Institute a nonprofit think tank revealed that while economic output in Appalachian fracking counties grew by 60 percent from 2008-2019 the counties' share of the nation's personal income jobs and population levels all declined. The study looked at the 22 counties in Ohio Pennsylvania and West Virginia that produce more than 90 percent of the region's natural gas. In 2008 those counties were responsible for $2.46 of every $1000 of national economic output. By 2019 the counties were generating $3.31 of every $1000 generated nationally—an increase more than triple the rate of national growth. But over the same period those counties' share of the nation's personal income fell by 6.3 percent their share of jobs fell by 7.5 percent and their share of the nation's population fell by 9.7 percent. The analysis concluded that about 90 percent of the wealth created from shale gas extraction leaves local communities. Related: Appalachia's fracking boom has done little for local economies Among the three states the report looked at Pennsylvania's showed the best prosperity measures and some Pennsylvania counties performed better than others—Washington County fared the best with a personal income growth rate that slightly exceeded national growth and job growth equal to the national rate while five of the other seven Pennsylvania counties either gained very few jobs or experienced a loss. Diana Irey Vaughan chair of the Washington County Board of Commissioners said the industry has transformed the local economy. ""The oil and gas industry has had a tremendous positive impact on our economy"" Vaughan told EHN. ""For example from 2000 to 2018 our median income grew from $47287 to $78895."" She also pointed to a U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics report that ranked Washington County third in the nation in job growth from 2010-2011 right at the beginning of the region's fracking boom. Vaughan said that Washington County has been able to maintain low property taxes in part due to fees the county receives from the oil and gas industry. Since 2012 the industry has had to pay an ""impact fee"" for each well pad in Pennsylvania to help cover its negative impacts. Those fees are distributed to the state and local governments which typically use them for infrastructure projects public safety and emergency preparedness. Environmental advocates say the fees are too low to address all of the environmental issues the industry causes. But many local governments rely on the fees. The money collected from impact fees in Pennsylvania dropped in 2019 but Washington County still collected $6.6 million—more than any other county in the state. ""This has allowed us to advance capital projects without taking money from our general funds or tax dollars"" Vaughan said. She added that the county has also sold mineral leases on county-owned properties including parks airports and fairgrounds and used the lease and royalty payments to make improvements to those properties.

(Credit: Ted Auch FracTracker Alliance 2019) Unlike many other states Pennsylvania does not collect a severance fee from oil and gas operators. In Texas for example the state collected $1.69 billion in taxes and fees from natural gas production—more than eight times as much as the approximately $200 million Pennsylvania collected in impact fees the same year. Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf has repeatedly attempted to enact a severance tax on the natural gas industry but those efforts have been thwarted by the Republican-controlled legislature whose members say it will hinder the growth of the industry and harm local economies. Many state lawmakers still believe the industry has been good for Pennsylvania. ""It's the biggest industry to come to Pennsylvania in the last 50 years"" Republican Senator Gene Yaw who chairs the state Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee told EHN. ""We tried to get Amazon to come to Pittsburgh or Philadelphia and we were putting together programs that totaled billions of dollars in subsidies. The gas industry has already come here and they've asked for very little."" Yaw has advanced numerous pieces of legislation aimed at helping the industry expand in Pennsylvania and has also attempted to block states with fracking bans from buying Pennsylvania's natural gas. He also leases his own mineral rights—his 2018 financial disclosure showed that he received income from five drilling companies through leases on land he owns (but does not live on). When it comes to job creation Kathy Hipple a financial analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and finance professor at Bard College said numerous studies have shown the industry often over-promises the number of permanent jobs it will create. ""In the Pittsburgh region especially there's been an almost desperate search for the next steel industry because that's remembered as a really great time in Pittsburgh's history"" Hipple told EHN. ""But the reality of the fracking business is that it's a lot of jobs at the beginning for construction that are often filled by people who aren't from the local area. Due to the technological advances—which the industry should be applauded for in a sense as it's become quite proficient at producing oil and gas—the later stages don't require very much of the labor force at all whether local or out of town."" The American Petroleum Institute has claimed that the industry supports nearly 500000 jobs in Pennsylvania but data from state and federal labor departments show there are actually about 26000 fracking-related jobs in the state. Statewide this means the industry isn't even among the top 50 sectors that employ Pennsylvanians.

(Credit: Ted Auch FracTracker Alliance 2016) ""The nearly 500000 jobs which is taken from an analysis conducted by PwC [PricewaterhouseCoopers] represents total industry jobs supported in Pennsylvania including refining transportation and distribution not just drilling production and development jobs"" Emily Smith a spokesperson for the American Petroleum Institute told EHN in an email adding that data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics data only includes salaried jobs which excludes private contractors. ""According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis salaried jobs only represent approximately 30 percent of the oil and gas extraction sector...on a national basis."" Some research suggests that the ultimate cost-benefit ratio of the industry may actually skew negative. A 2019 study by researchers at Princeton Carnegie Mellon and Stanford Universities estimated that air pollution from the fracking industry caused between 1200 and 4600 premature deaths in the Marcellus and Utica shale plays spanning Pennsylvania Ohio and West Virginia from 2004-2016. During the same time period the industry created a regional economic boost of approximately $21 billion dollars but those gains were overshadowed by $23 billion in public healthcare costs related to those premature deaths. Meanwhile as a result of the recession spurred by COVID-19 pandemic the oil and gas industry nationally lost more than 100000 jobs last year.

In the air Lois Bower-Bjornson stands in front of an under-construction fracking well pad in Washington County Pennsylvania. (Credit: Kristina Marusic for Environmental Health News) Lois who is tall and willowy with dark hair pale skin and large luminous eyes worked as a model and professional dancer before having kids. She still moves through the world like a dancer—she's often in motion and is prone to standing on one leg with the opposite foot casually propped up against her knee like a flamingo. In addition to teaching several dance and yoga classes a week in her barn-turned-dance-studio Lois also runs a residential green cleaning business and works as a paid part-time organizer for the Clean Air Council—something she felt compelled to do after growing increasingly alarmed about the apparent impact that fracking was having on the region's air quality. The fracking process typically involves as many as 1000 chemicals including solvents surfactants detergents and biocides and air monitoring studies have detected more than 100 chemicals in air emissions from the sites including benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene and mercury. A 2019 study found that air pollution from fracking wells specifically killed an estimated 20 people in Pennsylvania from 2010-2017 and that higher-than-average levels of air pollution can be detected as far as six miles downwind of a well pad. During the summer of 2019 when EHN collected urine samples from the Bower-Bjornsons we also had them wear personal air monitors. Each family member wore an air monitor attached to a pump that mimics breathing by pulling in air for six to eight hours leading up to the collection of their first two urine samples. (On a third date we collected one additional urine sample without any air monitoring.) The samples were analyzed for the presence of 40 chemicals that air monitoring studies have reported as frequently emitted during fracking.

Odessa Bjornson and Damien Shaffer play at the Bower-Bjornson home in Scenery Hill Pennsylvania. (Credit: Connor Mulvaney for Environmental Health News) On August 6 2019 Gunnar's air monitor recorded the highest levels of both n-propylbenzene and 135-trimethylbenzene detected among 39 total air samples EHN collected from five southwestern Pennsylvania households. Gunnar helped his dad paint and scrape vinyl flooring at his sound studio in Pittsburgh that day which could have contributed to these exposures. On the same day Lois's air monitor recorded the highest levels of hexanal ethylcyclohexane and octane seen in our study. She cleaned two houses using ""green"" cleaning products that day which could have contributed to these exposures. Only a handful of these chemicals have legal limits or even non-enforceable health-based guidelines most of which pertain to short-term workplace exposures. The Bower-Bjornson family's air samples exceeded one state guideline for three chemicals—the recommended limits on benzene ethylbenzene and naphthalene exposure set by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment to keep cancer risk below one in a million. ""It's always a little hard to interpret what's meant by 'excess cancer risk'"" James Fabisiak a toxicologist at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health told EHN. ""One in a million is sometimes used as a benchmark for negligible risk but most of us don't have a risk that low. I don't think you would see EPA take or recommend action until risks were in the range of one in 10000 to one in 100000. There's some gray area between what amounts to 'no risk' and what amounts to 'actionable risk.'""

Bjornson kids on the move. (Credit: Connor Mulvaney for Environmental Health News) Fabisiak also compared EHN's air monitoring findings against those of two large surveys that measured volatile organic compounds in average homes in the U.S. and found that most of the levels detected in the Bower-Bjornson's air monitors fell within the ranges found in those studies though some compounds were near the high end. ""If I knew these concentrations were there all the time in my own home"" he said ""I might think about how I could get them back closer to the average."" Fabisiak added that while the risk associated with the level of each individual compound may not be a problem high levels of numerous compounds within the same household have an additive effect—combining with one another and interacting with lifestyle and genetic factors in unpredictable ways that amplify overall risk. ""That's especially true of those air pollutants that affect common diseases like asthma and cancer"" Fabisiak explained. The Bower-Bjornsons and other residents of Washington County have also worried that the increased air pollution from fracking makes them more vulnerable to COVID-19. In the spring of 2020 nonprofit community health advocacy organization the Southwest Pennsylvania Environmental Health Project* (which helped connect EHN with families that were interested in participating in our research) conducted an informal literature review on air pollution and respiratory infections to help educate southwestern Pennsylvania residents about the links between the two. ""Based on what we saw in numerous studies that have dealt with diseases similar to COVID-19 we know that increased exposure to particulate matter pollution makes the symptoms of infectious lung diseases worse"" Alison Steele executive director of the Southwestern Pennsylvania Environmental Health Project told EHN.

Lessons learned An activist wears a face mask to protest poor air quality caused by fracking pre-COVID-19 at a 2019 community meeting in Braddock Pennsylvania. (Credit: Kristina Marusic for Environmental Health News) Lois is no stranger to the region's history of industrial extraction. She grew up in Fredericktown a nearby coal mining town splitting her time between the hotel her grandparents built and the former apple distillery her great-great-great-great grandparents built. She and the neighborhood kids used to watch coal barges float down the river and ride dune buggies on slag dumps—piles of toxic rubbly waste generated by coal processing. They also swam in the river even though it was sometimes oily from industrial residue raw sewage poured in from the municipal pipes and river rats abounded. ""We knew it might be harmful but so many people's parents were coal miners that potential for harm just seemed like a normal part of life"" she said. She sees those same attitudes persisting when it comes to fracking—and especially when it comes to the impending petrochemical boom in the region. In 2016 Royal Dutch Shell began construction on a massive ethane cracker in Beaver County about 33 miles northwest of Pittsburgh and 57 miles north of Scenery Hill. The plant which is now nearly complete will eventually convert a massive volume of natural gas and liquids into 1.8 million tons of polyethylene every year for use in plastics manufacturing. It's one of up to five such facilities that have been proposed in the Appalachian basin region spanning Pennsylvania Ohio and West Virginia—though all but the Shell project have been indefinitely put on hold due to unfavorable market conditions.

Construction site of the Shell ethane cracker in Beaver County Pennsylvania. (Credit: Ted Auch FracTracker Alliance 2019) Four of the proposed locations sit directly alongside the Ohio River or one of its tributaries and each facility will demand natural gas liquids from an estimated 1000 new fracking wells per year according to researchers at Duquesne University. A similar petrochemical corridor in Louisiana has some of the worst air pollution and highest cancer rates in the country resulting in the region being dubbed ""Cancer Alley."" Southwestern Pennsylvania already has cancer problems. The region has higher than average rates of the types of cancer associated with air pollution and in 2019 the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette documented 27 cases of Ewing sarcoma—a one-in-a-million bone and soft tissue cancer—in Washington Greene Fayette and Westmoreland counties over the last decade. These counties combined have a population of about 750000 and are where a majority of the state's fracking occurs and amid concerns about radioactive waste from the oil and gas industry being mishandled residents have demanded answers from elected officials. Investigations are ongoing but so far no link between the rare cancers and the oil and gas industry has been confirmed. Shell applied for air pollution permits that were approved back in 2015 but submitted a new permit application in February 2020 that seeks lower emissions levels for some pollutants but much higher levels of others including greenhouse gases. For years local environmentalists community members and Indigenous groups have fought to stop the petrochemical buildout but despite their efforts—and warnings from financial analysts that the industry isn't a viable long-term investment—many local policymakers have welcomed the jobs the industry promises. ""In the 70s and early 80s we saw the demise of the steel industry and what it did to our economy—we saw our friends and family members move away because the jobs were gone"" Democratic Pennsylvania State Representative Robert Matzie told EHN. Matzie's district is adjacent to the site of the Shell ethane cracker and Matzie was one of a handful of Pennsylvania Democrats to support the project from its outset. ""As policymakers we have to weigh and balance both protecting the environment and having good jobs that take advantage of our natural resources and I believe we can have both.""

Construction site of the Shell ethane cracker in Beaver County Pennsylvania at night. (Credit: Ted Auch FracTracker Alliance 2019) Matzie said the plant is projected to create 10000 to 15000 jobs in a 50-mile radius. At the same time he said some of his constituents fear becoming another ""Cancer Alley."" ""I live a stone's throw from the site"" Matzie said. ""Me and my family have to drink that water and breathe that air too."" He added that he believes this plant will be different because it's newer than the ones in Louisiana and will use the best available technology to minimize environmental impacts. In the past Matzie has also introduced legislation aimed at keeping fracking wells at least 4000 feet away from dams and reservoirs in an attempt to protect his own district's water reservoir. So far he has been unsuccessful. ""Right now you can drill right in the middle of a freshwater source"" he said. ""I have a problem with that. You can show me all the technology that says it's safe—I still don't want to see it."" In lieu of that legislation Matzie says he helped negotiate additional protections for the reservoir from the natural gas pipeline that will feed the Shell ethane cracker—things like a thicker steel lining and easier access to emergency shutoff valves—by working directly with the company. ""Shell stepped up and went above and beyond current policy and statutes for the pipeline"" he said adding that he has also championed solar energy projects serves as co-chair of the state's nuclear energy caucus and welcomes any industry that would bring jobs to his district.

Finding good dividend stocks among the thousands of publicly listed dividend-paying companies can get so overwhelming that income investors often pick the easy route and buy popular stocks.

In doing so investors often miss some great dividend stocks with impeccable track records and solid dividend growth potential. Here are three such little-known but amazing dividend stocks that may have flown under your radar.

Look beyond the yield

If you look up RPM International's (RPM 0.99%) website one line stands out: ""Our brands pay dividends."" The company clearly prides itself on its dividends and rightly so. RPM International has increased dividends every year since 1973. The company has come a long way since growing its revenue from only around $25 million back then to $5.5 billion in 2020.

That's really impressive growth for a company operating in a boring industry like specialty chemicals. Part of the credit goes to RPM's aggressive acquisitive growth strategy -- it made 70 acquisitions in just the past decade. In doing so RPM grew its portfolio of specialty coatings sealants and building materials manifold and now owns more than a hundred brands including well-known global names like Rust-Oleum Zinsser and DAP.

RPM has kicked off fiscal 2021 on a solid note. In early January it delivered record sales earnings and cash from operations for the second quarter. Meanwhile RPM's cost-cutting efforts could save it $290 million this fiscal year. Importantly RPM's cash flows are now at record highs so another dividend hike is almost assured. RPM's small yield of 1.9% is perhaps why income investors often overlook the stock but its dividend growth makes up when it comes to shareholder returns -- the stock's total returns in the past decade was 360% -- and that's exactly what makes RPM an amazing dividend stock.

A 1.7% yield surely wouldn't excite you but what if I tell you the stock is a proven multibagger and could multiply your wealth in the years to come? Check out the returns you could've made had you invested in American Water Works (AWK 1.21%) shares 10 years ago and reinvested the dividends it paid all along:

That's the power of owning a resilient business and allowing compounding to work its magic. American Water has increased dividends every year since it went public in 2008 thanks to a regulated water business that serves 15 million customers today.

The best part is the company's commitment to dividend growth. After increasing dividend by 10% in 2020 American Water aims to grow annual dividend at the higher end of 7% to 10% through 2024 as it expects billions of dollars worth of spending on infrastructure to drive earnings growth. I bet it will achieve its targets which means I'm pretty sure this world-class dividend stock -- also among the best in the utility sector -- will generate some big returns for investors in the years to come.

A blistering dividend growth stock

Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP -0.86%) is turning out to be an incredible dividend stock with blistering growth prospects. The stock has shot up nearly 700% since going public in 2008 with dividends accounting for nearly half of those jaw-dropping returns.

How has Brookfield Infrastructure pulled that streak off? Several factors are at play. The company for instance generates most of its cash flows from regulated or long-term contracted assets in sectors like utilities transportation energy and data. Also it regularly sizes up assets to sell mature ones and reinvest proceeds into more lucrative projects. Brookfield's track record of turning assets into cash-cow machines is incredible. For example it is selling Enwave -- a business it acquired in 2012 for only 480 million Canadian dollars -- for a whopping $4.1 billion. Lately Brookfield has been eyeing growth markets like India and has made big investments in upcoming technologies like 5G.

Operating a largely regulated portfolio while investing in growth opportunities has worked incredibly well in Brookfield's favor and should continue doing so. In fact management is so confident about its business that it's targeting 5% to 9% growth in annual dividends hoping to generate shareholder returns of 12% to 15% in the long run. Add a dividend yield of 3.8% to that and you could proudly say you own a winning dividend stock in Brookfield Infrastructure.

The key to earning good dividends

By now it's evident that dividend yield isn't everything. You can build great wealth if you can scratch the surface and find stocks that are as serious about paying out regular rising dividends as they are about growing their businesses."

Ark Invest dipped once again into Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE: PLTR) with the fund adding 3365400 shares to its portfolio according to data on Benzinga Pro.

Palantir makes big data analytics software used by the United States government among other customers. In 2008 Palantir released Gotham a data analytics platform for the U.S. government’s intelligence and defense sectors.

Other Ark Moves: Ark also added 497050 shares of social media giant Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) on Friday.

Twitter shares were trading higher following the company's Thursday analyst day event in which it shared a bullish three-year forecast. Multiple analysts on Friday raised their price targets on the stock. Additionally the stock may be reacting to a new paid Super Follow feature.

Shares of Twitter ended main trading hours on Friday up roughly 3% at $77.06 per share and then rose to 77.25 in the after-hours session.

Meanwhile Ark went in the opposite direction for the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Facebook Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ: FB) with the fund selling 551131 and 71281 shares respectively.

Shares of several technology companies were trading lower this week along with the overall market as higher bond yields put pressure on growth stocks and other equities.

Coinciding with the release of the Apple TV+ documentary ""Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry"" Apple is offering a limited-edition version of its gift card themed to represent the musical artist.

The Billie Eilish Limited Edition Apple Gift Card is listed in the online Apple Store alongside Apple's other designs. The new option is both the top listing and the default for the page and is one of nine designs users can choose from.

The Billie Eilish-themed Apple logo is green on a blue background with gradients on each of the sides to give a form of glowing effect. The logo matches the aesthetic of the documentary's promotional images as well as Eilish's signature green hair coloring.

Other than the logo the gift card spotted by 9to5Mac functions the same as all the other options including the ability to personalize it and to vary the value. It can be sent as either an email or as a physical gift card with the latter including a collectible sticker.

The page draws attention to the logo's limited-edition nature though doesn't state how long it will be available to purchase. Further down the page a graphic explains it is to ""celebrate the launch of the new film.""

For years chip industry executives and U.S. government officials have been concerned about the slow drift of costly chip factories to Taiwan and Korea. While major American companies such as Qualcomm Inc. and Nvidia Corp. dominate their fields they depend on factories abroad to build the chips they design.

As tensions with China heated up last year U.S. lawmakers authorized manufacturing subsidies as part of an annual military spending bill due to concerns that depending on foreign factories for advanced chips posed national security risks.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Le programme lancé en 1998 à l’échelle planétaire récompense de jeunes femmes chercheuses dans les domaines suivants: science de la terre et de l’environnement sciences informatiques et techniques biotechnologie médicale et science biologique.

Au titre de cette 14ème édition au Maroc et la 7ème au niveau du Maghreb les 5 lauréates recevront ainsi une dotation d’une valeur de 10.000 euros chacune qui leur permettra de mener à bien leurs projets post-doctorat.

En raison de la situation sanitaire actuelle liée à la pandémie du nouveau coronavirus la cérémonie officielle de remise des bourses a été reportée à l’année 2021 si la situation le permet indique un communiqué des organisateurs.

La première lauréate marocaine est Jihane Ouchrif (Faculté des sciences et techniques de Mohammedia) dont la recherche porte sur la conception de prototypes de photodétecteurs à base du phototransistor pour les systèmes de télécommunications par fibre optique.

L’objectif de cette étude est d’améliorer la performance des systèmes de télécommunications par fibre optique tout en assurant une haute qualité de photo-détection ce qui garantit par la suite une meilleure transmission des données dans ces systèmes avec la moindre erreur d’interprétation.

Sa compatriote Najlaa Fathi (Université Cadi Ayyad Marrakech) a travaillé sur la question de « l’îlot de chaleur urbain » qui est devenu l’un des problèmes majeurs des grandes villes induisant un réchauffement local souvent intolérable en saison de l’été en plus de ses effets négatifs sur la santé publique la qualité de vie et la consommation d’énergie.

L’étude se focalise sur les stratégies de réduction de l’ilot de chaleur et permettra d’améliorer la qualité de l’air et de limiter les maladies respiratoires ce qui est encore plus pertinent dans le contexte des changements climatiques

Les deux Tunisiennes sont Aida Lahmer (Université de Monastir) dont la recherche concerne la conception de substituts dermiques à base de collagène marin et d’une plante médicinale et Raoudha Dziri (Université de Tunis El Manar) dont le travail s’attaque à l’inefficacité des remèdes existants face à l’évolution continue et rapide du monde à l’image des antibiotiques qui ne sont plus actifs sur les bactéries multi-résistantes.

La lauréate algérienne Sarra Benlheifa (Université des Sciences et de la Technologie Houari Boumediene) consacre ses recherches à l’identification de nouveaux biomarqueurs pronostiques et prédictifs de l’efficacité thérapeutique dans le cas du cancer colorectal (CCR) et ce afin de proposer un traitement spécifique et adapté selon le type de CCR.

La Fondation L’Oréal et l’UNESCO assurent que leur partenariat a permis à ce jour d’accompagner plus de 3.500 femmes scientifiques dans 117 parmi lesquelles 5 ont reçu un Prix Nobel.

Elles estiment que « pour que les femmes puissent vraiment s’épanouir dans les sciences l’excellence en recherche n’est qu’un premier pas » du fait que « la question du leadership est essentielle pour venir à bout des discriminations qui empêchent trop souvent les femmes de gravir les échelons ».

« C’est pourquoi en plus d’un financement et d’une reconnaissance essentiels elles s’engagent à offrir aux lauréates et boursières du programme la possibilité d’acquérir de solides compétences en leadership et d’établir des contacts et des liens avec d’autres femmes scientifiques » souligne-t-on.

À Périgueux deux détenus de nationalité moldave se sont évadés dans la nuit de vendredi à samedi de la maison d'arrêt en sciant les barreaux de leur cellule.

Les détenus qui partageaient la même cellule ont scié les barreaux de leur fenêtre avant de passer par les toits et de descendre et monter le long de plusieurs murs a relaté le syndicat FO Pénitentiaire confirmant une information de Sud-Ouest. Une enquête a été ouverte.

Une fois sortis par la fenêtre les deux hommes ont descendu en rappel le mur de leur bâtiment haut de quatre mètres avant d'en remonter un second similaire jusqu'à atteindre la cour d'honneur et des vestiaires. Dans cette partie de la prison ils sont parvenus à forcer les barreaux d'une fenêtre donnant sur l'extérieur où ils ont descendu un dernier mur de quatre mètres qui les séparait de la rue.

Les deux hommes incarcérés provisoirement depuis ""un certain temps"" dans l'attente de leur jugement dans une affaire de banditisme ont profité d'un créneau entre deux rondes de surveillance pour se faire la belle selon Thierry Dumonteil le délégué FO Pénitentiaire en Dordogne . ""Ce sont des gars bien préparés physiquement (...) qui doivent être très doués en varappe""  a commenté le syndicaliste sur la radio France Bleu Périgord.

Les surveillants ont constaté leur absence lors de la ronde de 5h du matin la précédente ayant eu lieu à 3 heures. Les codétenus ont un temps été en charge du ménage dans cette prison qui accueille notamment des personnes en détention provisoire. Ils s'étaient fait remarquer récemment lorsqu'un téléphone avait été retrouvé sur eux a expliqué Thierry Dumonteil. ""Nous ne sommes pas taillés pour garder du grand banditisme""  a fait valoir le syndicaliste en assurant que ""les agents ont fait leur travail"".

""Même si à un certain moment ils sont passés devant une zone de caméras c'est la nuit et ce ne sont pas des caméras thermiques. Rien n'est parfait mais il va falloir qu'on se mette autour d'une table qu'on regarde les failles et qu'on rajoute un peu de sécurité là où il en manquait""  a ajouté le syndicaliste en critiquant l'état ""vieillissant"" des caméras. Selon France Bleu Périgord de mémoire de surveillants cette évasion par escalade est une première pour la maison d'arrêt mise en service en 1863. L'établissement comptait au 1er janvier 119 détenus pour 81 places selon l'Observatoire international des prisons (OIP)."

The entrepreneur and reality TV star was one of the celebrities who roasted the NFL legend on the Netflix special but was greeted with boos from the audience in attendance Sunday at the Kia Forum near Los Angeles.

Host Kevin Hart introduced Kardashian and as the Kardashians star took the podium she thanked the comedian and paused after the initial cheers. The cheers then turned to boos prompting Kardashian to say “All right all right all right.”

Kardashian concentrated her jokes on Brady who she was once rumored to be dating.

“I’m really here tonight for Tom. I wasn’t going to come tonight but since I’m not here as Tom’s date there’s still a good chance I might” she joked.

Kardashian delivered another joke likening Brady’s appearance to her stepdad Caitlyn Jenner.

“I do know it would’ve never worked out” Kardashian said of a relationship with Brady. “An ex-athlete high cheekbones silky hair. … You remind me too much of my stepdad now.”

A meme showing “the evolution of Tom Brady” appeared on screen showing the transformation of Brady’s physical appearance and ending up looking like Jenner.

Kardashian continued: “Part of me thinks you would want to entrust me just to try on my clothes. I know the transition from the NFL must’ve been really hard but I think my stepdad is a great example for you. She’s one of the best athletes in the world who proved you could do anything in this next chapter in your life.

BOSTON (CN) — The First Circuit struggled at oral arguments Tuesday with a claim that it is unconstitutional for the Boston City Council to bar a group of Satanists from offering an invocation at its meetings.

“Suppose this was 1920s Boston and Jewish temples weren’t invited to speak” U.S. Circuit Judge William Kayatta said.

“I think you’d have a problem” the city’s lawyer Edward Whitesell conceded.

“So why not here?” Kayatta asked.

“Because the record shows that a lot of other religions were invited” to give invocations Whitesell answered.

Kayatta pressed on. “But there might have been a lot of other religions back then” he said. “Methodists. Lutherans. Isn’t this the exact same thing except we’re substituting Jews for Satanists?”

The lawsuit was brought by the Satanic Temple which was founded in 2013 and boasts that it’s the only Satanic organization that’s officially recognized as a religion by the IRS. It doesn’t believe in a literal Satan and operates in a gray area between a community of faith and a spoof of traditional religions drawing many members from the LGBTQ community. Last year it attracted some 800 attendees to SatanCon a gathering at the Boston Marriott.

The Boston City Council meets about three dozen times a year and typically begins meetings with a prayer poem or other introduction usually from a local religious leader. City councilors have absolute discretion as to whom to invite. From 2016 to 2018 the Satanic Temple repeatedly requested to speak and was rejected.

The invocations date from the 1800s and for years the city offered speakers a small stipend (a practice the temple calls “pray-for-pay”). But in 2017 the city abolished the payments at the suggestion of then-councilor Michelle Wu now Boston's mayor.

The temple claims the invitations favor some religions over others and thus violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment. It lost in the trial court.

One city councilor stated that it would be “absurd” to invite the temple to speak because it’s headquartered not in Boston but in nearby Salem (home of the witch trials). Another called the temple’s request a “publicity stunt” and added “I would not consider anyone that doesn’t have a positive impact on my community my constituents my family and me personally.”

In 2014 the U.S. Supreme Court held 5-4 that it's OK to start an official town meeting with a prayer. But in that case the town had compiled a list of local organizations and invited anyone who wanted to participate on a first-come-first-served basis including the chairman of a Baha’i temple and a Wiccan priestess.

By contrast Boston’s practice is “whim-based and politically motivated” said the Satanic Temple’s attorney Matthew Kezhaya of Minneapolis. “One councilor testified that this is a political reward. That’s a problem.”

Boston’s policy has “the potential for serious establishment clause concerns” agreed U.S. Circuit Judge Sandra Lynch a Bill Clinton appointee. “The system is designed to further the political careers of the Boston city councilors by permitting them to invite whoever is politically advantageous. Let’s assume … there is a consistent pattern of councilors choosing the majoritarian religion of their district and going on with effusive praise. Could there be an as-applied establishment clause problem?”

Whitesell said the temple would have to prove an intent to discriminate not just an intent to further a political career. “But that’s not the only route to an establishment clause issue” said U.S. Circuit Chief Judge David Barron a Barack Obama appointee. “If the selection criteria are whoever has the largest congregation” he said that would raise “very serious problems.”

Whitesell responded by insisting that the criteria aren’t merely political but also included recognizing civic leaders who had contributed to the welfare of the community. Kayatta also an Obama appointee then pressed Kezhaya on whether contributing to the community could be a valid selection criterion.

Kezhaya conceded that it could but he argued that in practice it’s impossible to separate that from the religious aspect and that the test isn’t applied neutrally because who benefits the community is determined by “whatever the councilor feels like.” He also said that the city had gone further and endorsed particular religions with “two to three minutes of gushing praise” for specific ministers which he called “religious gerrymandering.”

Before the Satanic Temple got involved 94% of invocations were given by Christians and the council president often told everyone in attendance to stand for prayers Kezhaya said.

Lynch asked if the Temple had contributed to Boston’s community welfare and Kezhaya answered that it had participated in the city’s pride parade and distributed free tampons to the needy.

“I’m confused as to the criteria” Kayatta complained. “Is it politics or who did good deeds?”

“They go hand-in-hand” Whitesell answered but Kayatta wasn’t satisfied: “On a Venn diagram they would overlap but not completely” he noted.

Barron closed out the argument by asking Kezhaya what he wanted as a remedy — did he want the judges to strike down Boston’s prayer practice altogether or did he want them merely to require the city to let the temple participate?

“We want in” Kezhaya answered.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vbGEvYXJ0aWNsZS9zZi1ob3VzZS1vZi1wcmltZS1yaWItbGEtbGF3cnlzLXJldmlldy1jb21wYXJpc29uLTE5NDMxMTk5LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I ate at SF's HOPR and LA's Lawry's.

Costco chief executive Craig Jelinek announced the increase Thursday at a Senate Budget Committee hearing led by Sen. Bernie Sanders to examine wages at major companies. Jelinek said the starting wage for Costco employees would rise to $16 next week up from $15 the company instituted two year ago.

The starting wage scale puts Costco above competitors including Amazon Target and Best Buy which have $15 minimum wages. Walmart's starting pay is $11 an hour.

Jelinek said that the higher pay would bolster worker retention and productivity.

""I want to note: This isn't altruism"" Jelinek said. ""At Costco we know that paying employees good wages and providing affordable benefits makes sense for our business and constitutes a significant competitive advantage for us.""

Workers from Walmart and McDonald's testified at the hearing to demand those companies raise their minimum pay.

The federal minimum wage is a $7.25. Democrats are trying to push through a $1.9 trillion covid-19 relief bill that would include a provision raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour over five years a policy strongly opposed by Republicans.

That effort suffered a serious blow Thursday when the Senate parliamentarian decided the minimum wage provision must be dropped from the bill.

A growing number of states already have raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

Costco's announcement also was made as labor groups are demanding hazard pay for grocery employees and other essential workers which some companies offered at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and later ended.

Costco has continued to pay a $2 hourly premium to its workers since March. Jelinek said Costco would end the premium as the one-year mark approaches but would convert some of it through increases in wages across pay scales.

Costco has 180000 employees in the U.S. Jelinek said more than half make $25 an hour or more.",,,,,,,,,

Alleviating traffic congestion. Accommodating growing populations. Addressing safety issues. Enhancing local economies.

Those are just a few of the reasons why road construction projects are so important and they all equate to helping improve the quality of life for residents and permitting industries to continue to move the American economy forward. Today there are a variety of ambitious major road construction projects underway on some of the country's most traveled highways. The long-term result will be more than worth it for the people vehicles and communities they're designed to serve.

Here's a look at some of these transformative major road construction projects and why they're poised to continue to drive America forward.

5 Transformative Road Construction Projects

1. Florida's I-4 Project

Dubbed the ""Ultimate Improvement Project"" this 21-mile stretch of Central Florida's most heavily trafficked highway is intended to connect communities better improve economies and take the quality of life to a new level. Four new express lanes widened bridges bridge replacements new lighting enhanced landscaping and more are included in this project with substantial completion expected by the end of 2021. Also underway is the I-4 extension project which aims to improve highways 40 additional miles to the east and west of I-4.

2. California's I-405 Widening Project

One of SoCal's most important highways is getting a major overhaul to ease traffic congestion and make way for shorter overall commute times. Specifically the I-405 widening project will include work across 16 miles of the highway an area spanning from Long Beach to Costa Mesa. It will include the addition of general purpose lanes and tolled express lanes in each direction the addition of auxiliary lanes ramp improvements interchange reconfigurations upgraded utilities modified overhead railroad crossings and more. The total project is expected to cost $1.2 billion. It's estimated that about 300000 vehicles travel the highway each day and traffic volume is expected to increase significantly in 20 years.

3. California's I-5 North Coast Corridor Project

Another big SoCal infrastructure project workers are improving 27 miles worth of highway along San Diego's northern coastal area. It's a range that encompasses cities that include Oceanside Carlsbad Encinitas and Del Mar among others. As an essential throughway to Mexico and Canada and an important part of the country's highway transportation system – for tourists commuters and trucking alike -- the I-5 project will include the addition of high occupancy vehicle lanes interchange improvements truck-specific lanes pavement replacement and more to help improve safety and reduce congestion. The project is expected to cost $1.3 billion.

4. Virginia's Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel Expansion Project

The $3.3-billion Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel (or HRBT) expansion is the biggest project in the history of the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT). The project will consist of the construction of a four-lane tunnel and a widening from four to eight lanes on I-64 in an area between Hampton and Norfolk. It's a massive undertaking that's expected to greatly enhance travel through one of Virginia's significant through-routes. But Virginia motorists will need to exercise patience as the project isn't expected to be completed until 2024.

5. Texas' I-635 LBJ East Project

The Dallas area isn't just one of the largest metropolises in the nation but also among the most congested and in need of improvement. The $1.7 billion I-635 LBJ East Project aims to ease congestion via the widening and rebuilding of about 11 miles worth of highway. Intersection improvements the addition of a bridge and other general improvements are expected when the work is completed. The project is expected to be substantially completed at some point in 2024.

How to Improve Road Construction

The above projects are just a snapshot of the transformative projects that are helping to drive America forward. And as is the case with any construction project teams should always be looking for ways to improve efficiency and productivity to minimize disruption and deliver roads faster. This is applicable not just in the United States but worldwide -- especially as the world's population continues to increase year over year.

Here's a closer look at three winning strategies that improve road and highway construction:

1. Bring Innovation on Faster

Are you using the right technology on your jobsite? Whether you're looking to further adopt and embrace new technologies or if your firm is just looking to take its efforts to the next level there are few tips that you should abide by for best results:

Easy to deploy adopt and use: Aside from any upfront cost in new technology there's also a time commitment to train workers on how to use it properly. We suggest adopting tools that are accessible on mobile devices in the field and are easy to learn and train large teams on. This is especially relevant on road construction projects where crews are likely spread out across miles of workspace and communication and collaboration are essential for keeping all trades on track.

Secure cloud collaboration: Cloud computing enables a higher level of collaboration in the field. However you also need to make sure that any platform you're using is secure. Look for ISO and SOC compliance to ensure enterprise-grade security.

Supportive of the end-to-end project lifecycle: Look for software that can help your teams work better and more efficiently across every phase of the project. These connected construction platforms don't just support all aspects of the project but data can also be reviewed to spearhead continuous improvement efforts on future projects.

Partner networks : If any software you're using supports a connected ecosystem of technology it will enhance your team's efforts and productivity by reducing data disconnect and loss.

2. Standardize Processes and Innovation

For any technology to serve any project to the max it needs to be standardized across all project teams. When projects involve large disperse teams standardization is essential for keeping everyone on the same page.

Teams should start by outlining the processes in the planning and execution phases on infrastructure projects that they use or expect to use. From there these processes should be measured and preliminary standards should be set for teams and stakeholders to define benchmarks to meet. As processes are adhered to over time teams should continue to measure mark and refine processes to better align with the standards they've set. A few areas you can get started with pertaining to standardization include:

Checklist templates: Standardize and digitize quality and safety programs to keep everyone involved and perform inspections on mobile devices. This also permits teams to report problems in real-time thereby allowing them to be addressed immediately.

Tasks and punch lists: Take punch list items to your mobile devices.

Efficient RFIs: Create and upload templates for creating reviewing and approving RFIs .

Daily activities log: Project progress and performance can be a challenge to track on large infrastructure jobs but a standard daily activities log can help your team track labor information issues incidents and even weather conditions.

Personalized daily views: By standardizing priority action items and identifying teams that need attention you can keep all workers up to speed on project status.

Fillable and custom forms from the field: Stay organized and avoid driving back to the office to fill out paperwork. Complete and submit reports directly from the jobsite.

3. Become More Data-Centric

We talk a lot about becoming more data-centric and infrastructure projects are no exception. Any road and highway project should rely heavily on mass coordination communication and the most up to date plan. Otherwise it's going to be challenging to track progress and assess work quality. The only way to enhance any type of construction – regardless of whether it's infrastructure work or in another market – is to take your data collection and analysis to the next level.

Research indicates that poor technology implementation is potentially costing more than $175 billion total in lost productivity. Infrastructure projects are particularly at risk of lost productivity due to the amount of time projects take to complete and how spread out crews typically are on jobsites. Every missed detail or vacant data point can lead to a ripple effect that can impact the entire project.

The good news is there are ways to avoid these mistakes and lost productivity – and it starts with becoming more data-centric. Start by connecting the design and construction teams through a common data environment. Get rid of the dated clunky process of sharing files via email – store all data in a single location to streamline productivity and efficiency by boosting collaboration. By starting early and connecting everyone in all phases of the project you'll be able to anticipate delays and other issues better before they arise.

Hit the Gas Pedal to New Infrastructure Opportunities

The importance of road construction and infrastructure projects are only going to increase. For road and highway construction teams now is the time to reassess workflows and adopt the right technology and strategies to take your firm's efforts to the next level.",,,,,,,,,,,,

II. FROM BEAUSOLEIL TO THE MOON

As history has shown us if you peel back the layers of the pastoral and the genteel in the American South you sometimes find shameful haunting reminders of the past. Murders secrets lies. All buried in a world gone by. As I would learn St. Martinville is a whole different world.” — Gilbert King The Execution of Willie Francis: Race Murder and the Search for Justice in the American South

FOUR IT’S FUN TO LOSE AND TO PRETEND

Jeffery Martin Landry is a native son of St. Martinville le petit Paris a small town on the banks of Bayou Teche in between Breaux Bridge and New Iberia the Mecca of Acadiana and the site of the Evangeline Oak where the eponymous heroine of Longfellow’s classic poem awaits the return of her lover Gabriel.

Like most people who were born and raised along the shores of Bayou Teche Landry speaks with a distinctly Cajun dialect: Emphasis is placed on the second or third syllable; vowels are often nasal-sounding; consonants like “h” at the beginning of a word or “r” at the end of one are not pronounced at all.

When the opportunity presents itself especially on the campaign trail he will weave in a few conversational phrases in French. Comment ça se plume? Several years ago the American Community Survey estimated that 27.4% of St. Martin Parish residents speak French the highest proportion of any county (in Louisiana they’re parishes) in the nation.

Through his maternal grandmother Rhena Landry is a descendant of François Brossard (now spelled “Broussard”) the Genghis Khan and progenitor of the most prolific of all Cajun families father of the legendary brothers Joseph and Alexandre Brossard dit Beausoleil the Great Sun leaders of the Acadian people during the Grand Dérangement resistance fighters who had battled to protect their homeland from British occupation and ultimately sailed into exile to their new home deep within the swamps of South Louisiana. Both brothers were called by the name Beausoleil in their time but history would stick the name with the younger brother Joseph; Landry’s family descends from Alexandre’s branch. (Incidentally this makes Landry a sixth cousin of Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter. Recently Shane Guidry a GOP mega-donor and Landry’s most generous supporter claimed rather absurdly that Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z offered him $16 million for his chateau-du-nouveau-riche in Metairie).

Today Landry lives in the town of Broussard a suburb of Lafayette purchasing a “plantation-inspired home” (a compound really) inside of the gated community of Vintage Park— a neighborhood featuring streets with names like Opus One Drive Reidel Private Road Petrus Drive— for $1.325 million in 2013 (the sixth most expensive home sale that year in Acadiana).

Through his maternal grandfather Marcel “Blackie” Bienvenu Landry belongs to one of Louisiana’s most notable families of newspapermen the only to ever have three of its members serve as president of the Louisiana Press Association. His great-uncle Ralph Bienvenu ran the the paper in Abbeville the Meridional; another great-uncle Louis Bienvenu “Uncle Shorty” to his family worked as a part-time correspondent for the Times-Picayune and the Beaumont Enterprise. And his grandfather Blackie published his hometown newspaper St. Martinville’s Teche News which was founded in 1886 by Landry’s maternal great-granduncle Albert and Albert’s younger brother—Landry’s maternal great-grandfather— Laizaire Bienvenu. Then known as The Weekly Messenger the Bienvenu brothers affixed the paper’s motto at the bottom of its masthead: “Justice to All.”

Much of the future attorney general’s childhood was chronicled in the editorial pages of Teche News by his doting grandfather: Christmas presents and hunting trips the time he finished in third place at the Children’s Carnival “Spirits of ’76” costume contest or when he served as a page in the royal court of the local Rotary Club’s Mardi Gras Ball. Occasionally Blackie would publish short columns about the latest news from the local elementary school under the byline “Jeff Landry Student Reporter.” By the time he turned nine his name had appeared on at least 25 different occasions in the pages of his grandfather’s paper.

During his 2010 campaign for Congress every time he was handed a microphone he made sure to mention that his first job after high school had been working in the sugarcane fields of St. Martin Parish; it’s included in his biographies on both his PAC and his campaign websites. One of four children his family was decidedly middle-class; his mother Edna was a school teacher and his father Al worked as the architect and buildings coordinator for the local Catholic diocese.

While the St. Martinville of Landry’s childhood may have been idyllic for him and although the town of around 7000 people has promoted a romanticized retelling of its past the full story of St. Martinville is one of racial terror as chronicled by Gilbert King in his book The Execution of Willie Francis: Race Murder and the Search for Justice in the American South.

“The Cajuns have a word for it” King writes of St. Martinville. “Corrompre. Corrupt. ‘It was a dirty town’ I’d been told.”

In truth the slogan “Justice to All” didn’t apply to the town’s Black residents. It still doesn’t. Although in recent years the politics of Acadiana have plunged into a deep red abyss there was a time in the not-so-distant past when the region was decidedly more liberal.

Not St. Martin Parish though. Sure everyone may have been registered Democrats but don’t let that fool you.

When he was 31 Landry married Sharon LeBlanc daughter of Tommy LeBlanc a multi-millionaire entrepreneur and founder of Service Tool Company the nation’s largest distributor of hand tools. The LeBlancs also own Regal Developers and Harrier Enterprises a real estate holding company that in the past has purchased tax delinquent homes in Orleans Parish at auction a controversial practice many believe to be particularly predatory in cities like New Orleans. “Frequently the properties at auction are the homes of elderly African Americans that after their deaths are passed down to their elderly children many of whom simply do not have the financial wherewithal to settle the tax debt” explained an Orleans Parish lawyer who works on cases involving tax auction disputes.

The LeBlancs would help underwrite their son-in-law’s start in politics and subsidize his livelihood for more than a decade according to campaign finance and personal financial disclosure documents filed by Landry.

Incidentally the Landry LeBlanc and Broussard families have been marrying into each other since at least the mid-18th century and the three surnames are among the most common in Louisiana’s Cajun Country.

According to his 2010 financial disclosure report which covers the year during which he campaigned for Congress Landry arrived on Capitol Hill saddled with between $15000 to $50000 in credit card debt which he had carried since 1999 and between $80000 to $200000 in student loan debt.

That year he reported that his spouse who he listed as a “housewife” earned between $100001 to $1000000 from her father’s company. As for the newly-elected congressman? He claimed to have earned a grand total of $12000 from the consulting company he later used to apply for a trademark that conflated the celebration of Jesus’ birth with a politician who promised to ban Muslims and make Mexico pay for a border wall.

Notably in Landry’s long-winded response to The Advocate‘s report about his company’s alleged exploitation of a federal visa program he claims that his financial disclosure reports date back to 2011. In fact while this report may have been filed in 2011 it actually covers his earnings in 2010.

U.S. Rep. Jeffrey Martin Landry Personal Financial Disclosure 2010. Filed May 2011. Later in the document Landry lists income from Service Tool Co. as between $100001-$1000000.

There’s no question Landry’s station in life was dramatically improved after becoming Sharon LeBlanc’s husband and Tommy LeBlanc’s son-in-law but it’s worth recalling who Landry’s longtime friend identified as his three most important political mentors and how they more than anyone else helped to shape his public persona.

Charles Fuselier the longtime sheriff of St. Martin Parish and a family friend of Landry’s parents was the first to take an interest in mentoring the young Landry. After graduating from St. Martinville High School in 1988 Landry had been an intermittent college student; it’d take him 11 years before he earned his degree from University of Southwestern Louisiana (now the University of Louisiana at Lafayette). Partly this is because he’d signed up for the National Guard when he was 17 and spent much of 1990 and 1991 away in Texas on active duty but it’s also because Landry enrolled as a part-time student while working as a law enforcement officer first as a policeman in the tiny village of Parks and then as a deputy under Sheriff Fuselier.

Fuselier who would later abruptly resign from office in the midst of a federal investigation into allegations of civil rights abuses gave Landry an unusual and arguably unethical assignment. Hoping to give the local state senator Craig Romero of Iberville Parish a boost among voters in St. Martin Parish during his reelection campaign Fuselier told his young deputy to drive over to the state senator’s home.

“The funniest thing that happened in my political life was when Jeff knocked on my door” Romero recalled to The Daily Iberian in 2018. “I go to the door and I see a St. Martin Parish Sheriff’s car in my driveway in Iberia Parish and there is a uniformed deputy. He said ‘Mr. Romero I am Jeff Landry and the sheriff told me to come here and take you around St. Martin Parish.’ I said ‘I tell you what Mr. Landry. You go back home and put some street clothes and find an unmarked police car and we will go ride then.'”

Prior to enrolling in law school Landry spent a year working for the St. Martin Parish Economic Development Authority. During his tenure parish and state officials gave millions of tax incentives and abatements to convince Baker Hughes to build a new regional headquarters on the edge of the border between St. Martin and Lafayette Parishes. The project became mired in a dispute with the Town of Broussard which paid to extend water and sewerage lines to the property.

If Fuselier Romero or Landry ever had concerns that the use of public funds in support of a politician’s reelection may have violated state campaign finance and ethics laws they never expressed them in public.

During his final year of college Landry was hired as the Executive Director of the newly-created St. Martin Parish Economic Development Authority. At the same time he continued to serve as an aide to state Sen. Romero who would become perhaps his most significant political mentor. The two worked together to lure the oil and gas conglomerate Baker Hughes to build its new regional headquarters in St. Martin Parish by cobbling together millions of dollars in tax incentives and abatements. Shortly after the deal was finalized Landry then in his late twenties announced he was resigning from his taxpayer-funded job to pursue work in the private sector. Around the same time he enrolled in Southern University Law Center’s part-time program.

He was 33 when he graduated from law school in 2004* after transferring into Loyola Law in New Orleans. By then though he’d decided he wasn’t interested in actually practicing law. He only took the bar examination he’d later recall because of his wife’s insistence.

That said even after he was admitted to the Louisiana Bar Landry didn’t seem to be exactly enthusiastic about lawyering for a living.

He would later claim that he worked for one of the state’s “top ten law firms” from 2005 to 2015 both before and after his term in Congress but according to financial disclosure reports filed with the Clerk of Congress in 2010 2011 and 2012 and with the Louisiana Ethics Administration in 2015 Landry claimed no affiliation or income from the firm later identified as Galloway Johnson Tompkins Burr and Smith. Indeed there appears to be only one contemporaneous reference to Landry’s work with Galloway: Minutes from a meeting of the St. Mary Parish Police Jury in which Landry and another Galloway attorney appeared as representatives of the firm when it competed for a professional services contract.

He seemed far more interested in politics. In 2002 and then again in 2004 he managed Romero’s two unsuccessful campaigns for Congress and when term limits prevented Romero from running again for the state senate in 2007 Landry his heir apparent ran for the seat himself.

And despite being hobbled by rumors involving Romero’s work as an insurance agent he almost won.

DALLAS — Many banks choose not to make home loans to residents in low-income areas government statistics show even though federal law prevents discrimination in lending. But that doesn’t mean bank money isn’t flowing into these same neighborhoods. It is – but in the form of low-income apartment complexes built in areas of slum and blight.

A WFAA investigation found that banks own or have owned at least 50 low-income housing developments in Dallas. They buy into these projects in order to get billions of dollars in government tax credits on them and to prove to bank regulators that they are reinvesting in low-income communities.

Our investigation also found that regulators are failing to enforce laws that require these apartment complexes to provide a safe affordable place for families to live rather than merely be a tax boon for their owners.

A need for housing

Like most American cities Dallas has a shortage of housing that lower-income families can afford.

When affordable housing does get built it’s generally apartment complexes. And too often developers construct them in high-crime high-poverty neighborhoods located below Interstate 30.

Last year we showed you how I-30 divides Dallas’ wealthier and whiter neighborhoods to the north from the largely Black and Hispanic residents to the south and how many banks continue to “redline” or purposely underserve southern Dallas.

So who’s the money behind all these low-income apartment complexes?

Sterlingshire

Let’s look at one – Sterlingshire formerly called the Bruton Road Apartments. It’s at Bruton Road and North St. Augustine Drive in the heart of Dallas’ Pleasant Grove neighborhood.

From the outside they’re nice. Residents we talked to said they’re also nice on the inside.

But crime is high according to residents. The complex is inside one of the Dallas Police Department’s “Targeted Area Action Grids.” These TAAG areas as they’re known get extra police attention because of high crime and are scattered mostly in southern Dallas.

Sterlingshire “should never have been [built] there to begin with” said Terrance Perkins a community activist and pastor of the nearby Abundance Grace Church.

“We need affordable housing” he said. “But apartment complexes [are] something we need less of especially here in Southeast Dallas. When you take a population of people and put them in one place and no resources you lead them to a dead end.”

So who owns Sterlingshire? WFAA research of court filings state housing records and public corporate documents shows that Bank of America owns 99.9% of the corporate entity that owns the complex.

And it’s not alone.

Too much crime too many apartments

We’ve identified 50 affordable-housing apartment complexes in Dallas that are owned or have been owned by big national banks. In addition to Bank of America these include American Express Chase Truist and Wells Fargo

We reached out to all of them. Those that responded said they are proud to invest in housing that serves low-income and minority families. But none wanted to be interviewed about it.

A roof over your head is indeed a good thing housing advocates say. But if you look closer frequently these buildings are clustered together in the poorest parts of the city. They are in deserts with few jobs under-performing schools lacking retail fresh groceries or reliable transportation.

FROM 2019: New center brings fresh food options to southern Dallas community

Half of the bank-financed apartments we’re talking about are located inside DPD’s TAAG areas or crime hotspots.

State law says a neighborhood shouldn’t have more than 20% of its housing – apartment units or single-family homes – be government-subsidized rental properties. In other words no clusters of low-income housing.

But we found several groupings of low-income housing complexes. One is near Southwest Center Mall formerly known as Red Bird Mall where we found banks own or have owned three apartment buildings. The concentration of subsidized housing there is 63%.

Farther east near C.F. Hawn Freeway and Great Trinity Forest Way is another high-crime high-poverty low-opportunity neighborhood. There you will find three apartment complexes including Rosemont at Pemberton Hill which was formerly owned by Chase Bank. The concentration of subsidized housing there is 43%.

In a statement Chase Bank said: “We believe affordable housing is a critical need in our communities.”

“Where you live really matters” said Ann Lott a fair housing advocate at the Inclusive Communities Project in Dallas.

Her nonprofit has sued suburban communities over their refusal to allow affordable housing. Those refusals are one reason housing is continually built in the same inner-city neighborhoods. “We have to stop a system that consistently puts poor people in areas where they cannot thrive"" she said.

“The people that live in the community need access to credit"" she said. ""They need access to loans so they can buy their homes. Banks are contributing to the slum and blight of the communities and one could argue that they have become the new slumlord.”

Bank report cards

So why do national banks invest hundreds of millions of dollars in apartments in high-crime high-poverty neighborhoods? That’s a two-part answer.

The first part has to do with bank exams.

First a little history.

For decades through a practice called redlining banks denied loans to the Black and Hispanic communities.

To address the problem Congress passed The Community Reinvestment Act in 1977 also known as the CRA. Every few years the government grades banks on how well they follow the CRA; in other words how good a job they are doing loaning money directly to lower-income businesses and homebuyers.

By the ’80s and ’90s though regulators changed the rules so banks don’t just get credit for making loans directly to individuals. They also give them what you might call ""extra credit"" for investments in affordable housing.

Today the CRA “motivates the vast majority of these investments” according to the Affordable Housing Tax Credit Coalition trade group.

Consider the CRA exam for Bank of America for its operations in North Texas. It says “...the bank has an excellent level of community development investments” totaling $813.9 million around Dallas-Fort Worth. That includes a $15.5 million dollar investment in Sterlingshire.

Corporate records show Bank of America is a 99.9% ""silent partner"" in Sterlingshire. That means the bank is a majority corporate owner but doesn’t make decisions about where an apartment complex is built and it doesn’t run day-to-day operations.

In addition to Sterlingshire Bank of America is also the 99.9% corporate owner of a low-income apartment complex across the street and another two miles to the north.

In all we found Bank of America has current or past investments in 13 low-income complexes in Dallas. All generate positive CRA scores for the bank.

Using public records we estimate Bank of America has invested $50 million in the area around Sterlingshire alone.

But how much money is the bank lending to homebuyers in this same neighborhood? The government tracks that and analysis provided by the advocacy group the National Community Reinvestment Coalition or NCRC shows Bank of America made two mortgage loans in that area in 2019.

We reached out to Bank of America about our findings.

""There is a tremendous need for affordable housing nationwide"" said Bill Halldin Bank of America spokesperson in a written statement.

""Bank of America is committed to supporting our clients and communities by providing upfront financing that is a critical component for organizations to be able to expand housing opportunities"" Halldin said.

Bank of America is not alone in its lending patterns.

Further analysis of government lending data by the NCRC shows that banks make a lot of loans north of I-30. To the south banks make very few loans – but have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in affordable housing apartment complexes helping them get passing grades on their CRA exams.

What does all this say about the effectiveness of the CRA?

“To allow tax credit housing to substitute for real loans home loans -- it’s perverted the entire meaning of the Community Reinvestment Act"" said Laura Beshara a Dallas civil rights lawyer. She along with law partner Michael Daniel have filed a number of lawsuits over affordable housing policy including for the Inclusive Communities Project whose case went all the way to the Supreme Court.

""It’s furthered the racial concentration of the area its furthered the poverty concentration"" she said. ""It’s added more residents to an area of high crime that didn’t need to be there. And at the same time they’re not making any loans to the people that live there.”

Tax credits

Aside from favorable CRA bank exam ratings another reason banks buy into low-income apartment complexes is tax credits.

The government says ""Hey Bank if you buy in with $15 million to cover the cost of building XYZ apartments the United States promises to pay you back."" The bank then claims the tax credit over a 10-year period until it gets all its money back.

We're not talking about hundreds or thousands of dollars of these low-income housing tax credits. Each year the United States gives about $8 billion in tax breaks to the corporate owners of these apartment complexes. And almost all of those tax breaks go to banks.

For the banks “it’s a no-fail system” Beshara said. With government support she said these apartment investments generate a steady return for banks with almost no risk.

“It’s very safe from an investment point of view and a sure thing” she said

But there are rules. To get that tax credit the government says a project has to be part of a “concerted community revitalization plan.” What does that mean?

It means to be eligible for a tax credit apartments have to be located in parts of town where there is a focused plan to improve struggling neighborhoods. Typically that means they have to be accompanied by things like health clinics community centers infrastructure educational and economic opportunities.

Dallas has designated revitalization plans in five neighborhoods. All of them are south of I-30 and one is in West Dallas. Banks have financed a total of six affordable housing projects inside those zones. All of them get tax breaks.

But we found 44 apartment complexes in Dallas that were all built outside revitalization areas. And they got tax breaks too.

“I don’t think they should be eligible for the tax credit” Beshara said.

So who’s letting this happen? First off it is developers who conceive of the projects pick the location and get all the state and local approvals. Developers get fees from the projects and other revenue. Banks then buy into the projects as “limited partners” and usually become 99.9% corporate owners.

By law banks typically cannot own property so they have to get special permission from the government to do so. That permission is granted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or OCC. They regulate banks among other things and give them permission to own a controlling interest in these apartment complexes. They also grade big national banks on how well they comply with the CRA.

We asked the OCC about its own rules that allow banks to buy into these low-income housing tax credit projects or LIHTCs only if they are “designed primarily to promote public welfare"" and whether what we found is of concern to them.

""The OCC’s CRA rule does not require a (low-income housing tax credit) project to be in a revitalization area to receive CRA credit"" said Bryan Hubbard an OCC spokesman. ""The OCC doesn’t regulate all individuals nor entities that may invest in LIHTC projects and isn’t involved in selecting which projects receive LIHTCs.""

Banks we contacted bristled at being called “owner” of these apartment complexes. They point out that they do not select the sites where they’re built and do not run any of the day-to-day operations. All of which is true.

But federal law says they have to be an owner in order to use the tax credits to lower their tax bill.

“Under federal income tax law (low-income housing tax credits) may be claimed only by property owners who have the benefits and burdens of ownership” according to a 2014 OCC information sheet outlining how the program works. “This includes all partnerships (LPs LLCs and other equity investors) in the properties. For example if a bank holds a 99.99 percent interest in a partnership it receives 99.99 percent of the tax credits and real estate losses which include but are not limited to depreciation and interest expenses.”

The tax credits themselves are granted by the Internal Revenue Service. But government investigations have found that the IRS does a poor job of overseeing the program.

In 2015 the U.S. General Accounting Office found “IRS oversight... has been minimal” and records “were not sufficiently reliable to determine if basic requirements for the LIHTC program were being achieved.”

“They don’t care where these projects go – at all” Beshara said. “And they don’t care who it affects.”

We asked the IRS why it gives banks tax breaks on apartments that are outside revitalization areas. “Since your story involves a specific group of taxpayers in a certain area the IRS will decline any comment due to disclosure laws and regulations” a spokesperson replied in an email.

“The program has operated for over 30 years without any requirements of where the housing should be located” Beshara said. “As a result the housing has become concentrated in high minority areas of high poverty. Many of them with very distressed neighborhood conditions with high crime.”

Sterlingshire revisited

In 2015 before Sterlingshire was built Beshara and her law partner sent a warning letter to regulators. They said Sterlingshire’s paperwork “failed to disclose” that there was “significant criminal activity” in the area and that the project should not be eligible for tax breaks.

“This false representation can be the subject of a suit by any future tenants of the project for the consequences including harm from the high crime in the area” they wrote.

That harm came in 2019. In June 13-year-old Malik Tyler a resident of Sterlingshire was walking near his home when he was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting.

The company that manages Sterlingshire declined to talk to us for this story.

Not far from where Malik was killed across the street from Sterlingshire neighbors later noticed activity on a large vacant lot. When Terrance Perkins inquired he learned what developers had planned for the site – another low-income housing complex.

He gathered neighbors for a fight. They won that battle – at least for now. But another neighborhood might not be so lucky.

“What the builders end up doing or the investors they’ll come to a community that’s not going to fight it and put the apartment complex there” Perkins said. “And then [they’ll] say ‘Hey look we’ve done something great.’ But in reality you’re only crippling us.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY292aWQtdGVzdGluZy1iYW5rcy1vZmZpY2UtY29yb25hdmlydXMtZGV1dHNjaGUtY2l0aWJhbmstYmFuay1vZi1hbWVyaWNhLTIwMjEtMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Deutsche Wells Fargo JPMorgan Banks Test Staff for COVID-19,"By clicking “Sign Up” you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy .

Major banks worldwide have launched COVID-19 testing programs in order to enable a return to work for some employees during the pandemic.

Some banks are offering their staff lab-based PCR tests which are considered the most accurate way of detecting coronavirus but they can cost around $100 to process per The New York Times. Results of PCR tests usually come back within a couple of days.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Other banks are providing antigen tests also known as lateral flow tests which give results in about 15 to 30 minutes. Both antigen and PCR tests require swabbing the nose or throat.

""I have been back at work since the start of the year and have been asked to produce three negative test results every week"" a source who works in a bank in London told Insider on the condition of anonymity. ""It's a bit stressful but the antigen tests are quick and I have got into a nice routine now. It's also nice to be able to go back to work although I miss the pre-COVID office environment"" they said.

However a number of other banks are asking employees to fill out questionnaires about possible symptoms and exposure to the virus before they come into the workplace.

JPMorgan

JPMorgan told Insider that employees coming into the workplace in all locations are required to take a daily health check before entering an office. The health check is a survey that can be completed via mobile or laptop and asks if you've been exposed or in close contact with someone who is infected with COVID-19 or showing related symptoms.

The bank said the daily health checks had been in place since the pandemic began in March.

On top of this JPMorgan is also sending at-home testing kits to staff if they want one. Employees are also able to book a PCR COVID-19 test at one of the bank's on-site health and wellness centers.

Wells Fargo

A Wells Fargo spokesperson confirmed to Insider that all workers who go into the bank are required to complete a self-screening assessment which involves filling out a questionnaire about whether they have symptoms or have been exposed to COVID-19. They must complete this every day before entering the workplace the spokesperson said.

In its largest US locations the bank has an on-site nurse to check staff for COVID-19 symptoms and refer them for testing.

It began with an attempted robbery at the Bank of America branch in North Hollywood. Forty-four minutes later hundreds of rounds had been fired by the robbers carrying AK-47s and LAPD officers most of whom were armed only with their handguns.

The two bank robbers Larry Eugene Phillips Jr. 26 and Emil Matasareanu 30 were killed.

After a bystander reported the robbery to authorities responding officers were met with a barrage of gunfire from Phillips as he casually walked out of the bank and into the parking lot. Realizing how badly they were outgunned some of the officers got rifles at nearby gun stores.

Matasareanu shot twice in the bank parking lot took cover in a getaway car and slowly drove toward Phillips who continued walking and shooting.

Phillips was shot nearly a dozen times. His gun jammed when he was pinned down behind a car. He shot himself in the head but an autopsy report noted the coroner could not determine whether he or police fired the fatal shot.

Matasareanu shot several times in the legs bled to death a short time later. His family later sued two police officers and the city claiming the officers were indifferent to Matasareanu’s wounds at the scene and let him die. The case was declared a mistrial in 2000 and later dismissed.

Eleven officers and seven bystanders were injured .

Investors are suddenly obsessed with them in commodities trading,"A surge in commodity prices has Wall Street banks gearing up for the arrival of what may be a new—an extended period during which demand drives prices well above their long-run trend. A major impetus is the massive stimulus spending by governments as they juice up their economies following pandemic lockdowns. The evidence includes surging copper and agricultural prices and oil back at pre-COVID-19 levels. One theory is that this could be just the start of a yearslong rally in appetite for raw materials across the board but the reality is more complicated.

1. What is a supercycle?

A sustained spell of abnormally strong demand growth that producers struggle to match sparking a rally in prices that can last years or in some cases a decade or more. For some analysts the current rally is rekindling memories of the supercycle seen during China’s rise to economic heavyweight status beginning in the early 2000s. Commodities have experienced three other comparable cycles since the start of the 20th century. U.S. industrialization sparked the first in the early 1900s global rearmament fueled another in the 1930s and the reindustrialization and reconstruction of Europe and Japan following the Second World War drove a third during the 1950s and 1960s.

2. What did the last one look like?

From around 2002 China entered a phase of roaring economic growth fueled by a rollout of modern infrastructure and cities on an unprecedented scale. Suppliers struggled to fulfill surging demand for natural resources. In commodities there’s often a time lag to get the product where it’s wanted since adding capacity such as opening a new mine doesn’t happen overnight. For more than a decade materials including iron ore were in tight supply. Copper priced below $2000 a ton for much of the 1990s broke $10000 and oil jumped from $20 a barrel to $140.

3. Who says this is another supercycle?

Among the bulls are analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The commodities rally will be a story of a “roaring 20s” post-pandemic economic recovery as well as ultra-loose monetary and fiscal policies according to JPMorgan. Commodities may also jump as an unintended consequence of the fight against climate change which threatens to constrain oil supplies while boosting demand for metals needed to build renewable energy infrastructure and manufacture batteries and electric vehicles it said. Those include cobalt and lithium. Furthermore commodities are typically viewed as a hedge against inflation which has become more of a concern among investors.Play Video

4. Why might this not be one?

Longer-term trends point to a cooling down for some materials. For example the energy transition that heralds a bright new age for green metals such as copper would be built on the decline of oil. Even producers of iron ore the biggest market of mined commodities expect prices to weaken over time as Chinese demand starts to decline and new supply comes online. It’s an even bleaker outlook for coal with producers looking to exit the market altogether as the world switches away from the heavy-polluting fuel. Iron ore coal and oil were the chief beneficiaries of China’s industrial expansion. Those markets dwarf copper in scale.

5. What’s been happening with oil?

Prices collapsed in 2020 even turning negative at one point but have recovered as demand rebounded more strongly than many had expected. Early in 2021 the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies were holding back crude equivalent to about 10% of current global supply. Market fundamentals have shifted especially in the U.S. with the emergence of shale oil. Haunting traditional producers is the prospect that a prolonged period of high prices would trigger a new flood of supply beyond OPEC’s control. Even so some oil bulls aren’t ruling out the eventual return of prices above $100 a barrel.

6. Which other commodities are rising?

Copper was on a tear in early 2021 thanks to rapidly tightening physical markets as governments plow cash into electric-vehicle infrastructure and renewables. Goldman Sachs BlackRock Inc. Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. saw the metal moving toward all-time highs. While agricultural commodities have their own particular dynamics soybeans and corn have rallied to multiyear highs driven by relentless buying from China as it rebuilds its hog herd following a devastating pig disease. Agricultural prices are more dependent on global economic and population growth rather than the decarbonization trend underpinning excitement in metal",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvYWZyaWNhX3NvbWFsaWEtaXNzdWVzLWZpcnN0LWxpY2Vuc2UtbW9iaWxlLW1vbmV5LXNlcnZpY2UvNjIwMjY0NC5odG1s0gFhaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL2FmcmljYV9zb21hbGlhLWlzc3Vlcy1maXJzdC1saWNlbnNlLW1vYmlsZS1tb25leS1zZXJ2aWNlLzYyMDI2NDQuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Somalia Issues First License to Mobile Money Service,"Somali officials on Saturday issued the country's first license to a mobile money service bringing regulation to the widely used digital payment process for the first time.

The Central Bank of Somalia awarded the license to the country's largest telecommunications provider Hormuud Telecom which runs the Electronic Voucher Card or EVCPlus a free mobile money service used by 3 million of its 3.6 million subscribers in the Horn of Africa country.

The use and circulation of Somali banknotes has been dwindling because of the absence of central monetary policies and because little new paper currency has been printed. But private businesses have nonetheless flourished in Somalia where unregulated mobile money is extensively used for most buying selling and transfers.

Mobile money services emerged 10 years ago but were never regulated. The new regulation formalizes digital transactions as the primary payment method within the country and will enable further integration of the Somali financial system with the international financial system officials said.

The license was issued by the governor of the Central Bank of Somalia Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi on Saturday in Mogadishu.

“We have developed a robust regulation and based on that we have issued the first license of its kind in the country today” Abdullahi told VOA Somali.

“This has huge significance. I cannot express in words how important this is.”

Easy to access

Abdullahi said the mobile money service is the preferred choice of Somalis because there is a low bar for accessing it.

“For the mobile money you can actually buy a mobile phone SIM card and then register yourself and start using right away starting from one dollar or half a dollar or whatever amount you want whether you want to deposit it make payments from the convenience of your home or transfer money” he said.

Hormuud Telecom said it was delighted to receive the first license.

“The news today cements what we’ve known for a long time — that Somalia is moving towards being the world’s first truly cashless economy” said company CEO Ahmed Mohamud Yusuf. “This issuing of a mobile money license for the first time is arguably one of the most important steps taken by Somalia since the end of the war.”

An estimated 155 million mobile money transactions amounting to about $2.7 billion a month in Somalia were reported by the World Bank in 2018. At the time the World Bank praised mobile money platforms for “immensely” easing transactions and providing opportunities for economic growth but raised red flags about “plausible fiscal risks” in the event of disruption to mobile money platforms. It also said the platform’s lack of regulation caused serious macroeconomic effects.

The Somali shilling has had severe devaluation over past decades because administrations and businesses increasingly preferred using U.S. dollars. Today one U.S. dollar is worth 25000 Somali shillings about the value of one kilogram of rice.

EVCPlus recognizes both Somali and U.S. dollars but operates on dollars only because the economy of Somalia is being dollarized due to devaluation. This devaluation hits the poorest Somalis hardest particularly those who don’t receive dollar earnings or remittances from relatives living abroad."

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

The redeveloped complex at the corner of Front and Summer streets called The Uptown after a movie theater that was once there will be reserved for residents who are 55 and older. In total it will add 50 rental units to 10 that were in the structure before it was redeveloped.

Forty-two of them will be for low-income renters according to the project’s developer The Szanton Company.

The housing shortage that’s affecting all Maine communities is particularly serious in the midcoast making it harder for workers in the region to find places to live. Among other communities trying to build more housing is St. George where voters will decide next week whether to give away town-owned land to build new homes.

The new development in Bath which will have a grand opening on Wednesday joins another project that Bath Housing has been working to develop at 520 Centre St. in recent years.

The first phase of the Bath Housing project will bring 18 rental units for low-income residents and the second phase is expected to include an additional 24 units of single-bedroom rentals for a range of incomes according to Executive Director Debora Keller.

Any additional housing will go a long way to easing the crisis Keller said.

She noted that The Uptown will help preserve the historic Moses and Columbia Block buildings which were constructed in 1893 and redeveloped for the project after Bath Housing acquired the properties in 2019 and sold them in 2022 to The Szanton Company.

The buildings have also hosted shops the movie theater and a YMCA over the years and they will continue to maintain six retail spaces now that they’ve been redeveloped. Keller says the new housing option will make it easier for residents to live within walking distance of a number of downtown amenities.

“I just think this is one of the neatest housing projects I’ve seen in years” Keller said.

Rental prices on the apartments will range from $794 to $1495 per month depending on residents’ income according to The Szanton Company. Most of the units are one-bedroom apartments while six of them are two-bedrooms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbml0eXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jdC8yMDI0L2FwcmlsLXdlYi1vbmx5L2phenptZW4tbG91aXMtYXJtc3Ryb25nLWR1a2UtZWxsaW5ndG9uLWNvdW50LWJhc2llLXR5ZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Duke Ellington Read His Bible in the Bath,"“Does Jazz Put the Sin in Syncopation?” asked a 1921 Ladies Home Journal article. Whimsical wordplay aside the question would become a serious one for mid-century America as parsons and priests blamed jazz for soaring juvenile crime rates drugs and extramarital sex. A 1960 poll found that among Black preachers just 1 in 5 wanted to let jazz or blues into their services. Decades before a religion editor at the Pittsburgh Courier had denounced Louis Armstrong’s “sacrilegious desecration of Spirituals.” Duke Ellington’s music was “considered worldly” counseled the Rev. John D. Bussey explaining why the local 1966 Baptist Ministers Conference had unanimously passed his resolution opposing a performance.

But whatever commandments they were breaking—and there were plenty from slighting the Sabbath to serial adultery—Duke Louis and king of swing Count Basie all seemed to take the Christian faith they’d been raised in seriously. And that faith found its way into their music.

For Louis Armstrong the connection was there from the very beginning when he learned to sing in his mother’s Sanctified church. “The ‘whole ‘Congregation would be “Wailing—‘Singing like ‘mad and ‘sound so ‘beautiful” he wrote with his characteristic expressive idiosyncratic punctuation. “I’d have myself a ‘Ball in ‘Church especially when those ‘Sisters ‘would get ‘So ‘Carried away while ‘Rev’ would be ‘right in the ‘Middle of his ‘Sermon. ‘Man those ‘Church ‘Sisters would ‘begin ‘Shouting ‘So—until their ‘petticoats would ‘fall off. … My heart went into every hymn I sang” he added. “I am still a great believer and I go to church whenever I get the chance.”

With Saturday night performances that stretched into Sundays that wasn’t often. But nearly half a century later Armstrong released an album the church sisters would have loved Louis and the Good Book with gassed-up versions of spirituals including “Go Down Moses” and “Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen.” He recorded “When the Saints” the anthem of the Big Easy more than 100 times.

Count Basie was raised in the Black church too. Two of his uncles were ministers; his father was a founder and pillar of Pilgrim Baptist Church in Red Bank New Jersey. In oral histories and writings fellow musicians and friends use the word spiritual to describe what Basie brought to the band. Sideman Harry “Sweets” Edison compared their group to church organists and singers who inspire congregants to “get up to shout.” Basie was a spiritual presence offstage too. “Prior to eating he would do this elaborate silent prayer” recalls tenor saxophonist Eric Schneider. If the food came before he was finished “it was understood that we should go ahead and eat.”

Duke Ellington was perhaps the most pious of the three maestros. Growing up he attended two services each Sunday: African Methodist Episcopal Zion with his father Baptist with his mother. As a young man he consulted the Bible twice a day sometimes taking the book into the bathtub and reading until the water got cold. Though he shunned most jewelry he wore a gold crucifix around his neck and carried a St. Christopher medal in his hip pocket. His Christmas card bore a simple message in gold lettering: LOVE GOD.

In the last ten years of his life Ellington devoted himself to a series of sacred concerts performances that brought together jazz and classical music spirituals gospel and the blues. Suddenly he was getting more invitations to play in churches than in dance halls. Synagogues too. “These are things people don’t know about him” said singer-songwriter Herb Jeffries. “He had a great ministry. It was hidden in his music. … He was practicing his ministry moving about here and there making people happy!” When a reporter asked how he “as a religious man” could “play in dark dingy places where depravity and drunkenness reign” Ellington whispered “Isn’t that exactly what Christ did—went into the places where people were bringing light into darkness?”

He also pushed back against preachers who accused him of defiling their churches with his concerts. “Some people ask me what prompted me to write the music for the sacred concerts. I have done so not as a matter of career but in response to a growing understanding of my own vocation” Ellington wrote in his memoir. “I think of myself as a messenger boy one who tries to bring messages to people not people who have never heard of God but those who were more or less raised with the guidance of the church.” The sacred concerts this most accomplished of composers and bandleaders added were “the most important thing I have ever done.” They were important to audiences too. Take the girl who approached Ellington after one performance telling him “You know Duke you made me put my cross back on!”

Sacrilegious then isn’t the word to describe these jazzmen. Yes their faith was unorthodox and imperfect. But it also was warmly ecumenical and personally sustaining. You can hear it not just in their Christmas tunes but in all of their jazz music rooted in the gospels and Negro spirituals they grew up with. Their abiding belief in God all three maestros made clear is what emboldened and empowered them to write the soundtrack to the Civil Rights revolution to shape the soul of America.

According to his son Mercer Duke Ellington “was quite taken with the story of the ‘Juggler of Notre Dame.’” It’s a parable that applies to Armstrong and Basie too. “The man was a great juggler who would sneak into the church and juggle before the altar. As the story goes the priests found out about it and kicked him out. God intervened and told the priests to leave him alone. The man was celebrating His presence by using the gifts that He gave him.”

“Berkshire is often labeled a conglomerate a negative term applied to holding companies that own a hodge-podge of unrelated businesses. And yes that describes Berkshire – but only in part” Buffett wrote in his widely-read annual letter.

The 90-year-old investor pointed out that historically conglomerates limited themselves to buying businesses in their entirety a strategy with “two major problems.”

“One was unsolvable: Most of the truly great businesses had no interest in having anyone take them over. Consequently deal-hungry conglomerateurs had to focus on so-so companies that lacked important and durable competitive strengths. That was not a great pond in which to fish. Beyond that as conglomerateurs dipped into this universe of mediocre businesses they often found themselves required to pay staggering ‘control’ premiums to snare their quarry” Buffett wrote.

What's more to fund these overpriced deals conglomerates would use “promotional techniques and ‘imaginative’ accounting maneuvers that were at best deceptive and that sometimes crossed the line into fraud” to boost their own overvalued stock for the transaction.

Buffett added that this “investing illusion” could continue for a long time as Wall Street banks collected fees and the press shared stories of the “colorful promoters” and the soaring stock price that reinforced the narrative.

“Eventually of course the party ends and many business ‘emperors’ are found to have no clothes"" he said. ""Financial history is replete with the names of famous conglomerateurs who were initially lionized as business geniuses by journalists analysts and investment bankers but whose creations ended up as business junkyards. Conglomerates earned their terrible reputation.”

Buffett and Munger's vision for Berkshire is to ""own all or part of a diverse group of businesses with good economic characteristics and good managers.""

""Whether Berkshire controls these businesses however is unimportant to us” Buffett added.

More enjoyable and profitable but with far less work

Berkshire Hathaway today looks vastly different from the New England textile company Buffett took over in May 1965. In fact Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B BRK-A) was built on Munger's blueprint of moving beyond so-called ""cigar-butt"" investing to buying ""wonderful businesses"" at fair prices both controlling and non-controlling stakes.

Story continues

“It took me a while to wise up. But Charlie – and also my 20-year struggle with the textile operation I inherited at Berkshire – finally convinced me that owning a non-controlling portion of a wonderful business is more profitable more enjoyable and far less work than struggling with 100% of a marginal enterprise. For those reasons our conglomerate will remain a collection of controlled and non-controlled businesses"" Buffett wrote.

Buffett said the pair will put capital to work where it makes the most sense “based on a company’s durable competitive strengths the capabilities and character of its management and price.”

“If that strategy requires little or no effort on our part so much the better. In contrast to the scoring system utilized in diving competitions you are awarded no points in business endeavors for ‘degree of difficulty.’ Furthermore as Ronald Reagan cautioned: ‘It’s said that hard work never killed anyone but I say why take the chance?’”

In its stock portfolio Berkshire owns large stakes in companies like Apple (AAPL) Bank of America (BAC) Coca-Cola (KO) American Express (AXP) Kraft-Heinz (KHC) Verizon (VZ) Moodys Corp (MCO) U.S. Bancorp (USB) Chevron (CVX) and DaVita (DVA). In addition to the equity portfolio Berkshire Hathaway owns businesses across industries and sectors including railroads insurance energy services retail food and manufacturing. Among the businesses Berkshire owns include See’s Candies BNSF Railway Fruit of The Loom GEICO and Benjamin Moore Paints to name a few.

A year ago the reinsurance business of the Warren Buffett owned conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group fell to an underwriting loss of -$1.472 billion for 2019 worse than 2018’s -$1.109 billion.

For 2020 the overall reinsurance underwriting loss widened significantly to -$2.7 billion but the costs of COVID-19 and significant catastrophe events were the major contributor to this.

Berkshire Hathaway’s property and casualty reinsurance division saw its underwriting earnings dented as losses and loss adjustment expenses rose 35.3% to $2.6 billion for the full-year 2020.

The leading contributor was the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic which drove $964 million of losses to the Berkshire Hathaway P&C reinsurance unit while estimated losses from significant catastrophe events amounted to $667 million for the year with the main loss events being Hurricanes Laura and Sally and the U.S. wildfires.

Adding to the loss impacts were unfavourable reserve adjustments to prior years of $162 million in 2020 which was largely due to legacy environmental asbestos and other latent injury claims.

As a result the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group loss ratio hit 81% in 2020 up 73.8% in 2019 and 77.6% in 2018.

Underwriting expenses were another hit to profit as they rose by $533 million (20.6%) over 2019 to $3.115 billion.

Driving the higher expenses though was the fact that Warren Buffett’s P&C reinsurance business has been expansive in 2020 with premiums written increasing by 28% during the year to almost $13.3 billion.

The result for the P&C reinsurance business was an underwriting loss of -$799 million for the year.

The life and health reinsurance unit fell to an -$18 million underwriting loss for 2020 while the retroactive reinsurance unit reported pre-tax underwriting losses of -$1.1 billion in 2020 and the company experienced a pre-tax underwriting loss from periodic payment annuity contracts of -$550 million and another -$18 million from variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts.

More positively the Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group reported positive underwriting earnings of $110 million for 2020 and the auto insurance unit GEICO saw a bumper year thanks to lower claims factors related to the pandemic with underwriting earnings of $3.428 billion significantly higher than 2019’s $1.506 billion.

All of which goes to show the value of a massively diverse and capital rich underwriting business as well as the value of the investment side of the insurance and reinsurance business at Berkshire Hathaway which has always been such a profit driver for Warren Buffett

The fourth-quarter of 2020 saw Warren Buffett’s insurance and reinsurance businesses overall deliver an underwriting loss of -$299 million but for the full-year the underwriting managed to profit at $657 million of positive income thanks to the contribution of the GEICO auto unit and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group.

Insurance investment income was down on the prior year at $5.039 billion for 2020 compared to $5.53 billion in 2019.

However the all-important insurance float the pool of premiums that are investable by Berkshire Hathaway still grew by $9 billion during 2020 to end the year at a new high of $138 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjcvYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhdGhhd2F5LWVhcm5pbmdzLXE0LTIwMjAuaHRtbNIBTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzAyLzI3L2JlcmtzaGlyZS1oYXRoYXdheS1lYXJuaW5ncy1xNC0yMDIwLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buffett is buying back more Berkshire stock this year after record $25 billion repurchase in 2020,"Warren Buffett during an interview with CNBC's Becky Quick on February 24 2020. It turned out to be another year during which the billionaire investor shied away from game-changing acquisitions.

As the coronavirus pandemic roiled markets during 2020 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought back a record amount of company stock. And the buying spree has continued into 2021 according to the conglomerate's annual letter that was released Saturday morning.

During the fourth quarter the company bought back around $9 billion of Berkshire shares bringing the total 2020 repurchase to a record $24.7 billion.

""Berkshire has repurchased more shares since year-end and is likely to further reduce its share count in the future"" his annual letter stated.

During the third quarter the conglomerate bought back $9 billion of its own stock up from $5.1 billion during the second quarter. The figures compare to the $5 billion total the company spent on buybacks in 2019.

Buffett emphasized that the company only engages in share repurchase programs when it believes shares are trading below their intrinsic value.

""In no way do we think that Berkshire shares should be repurchased at simply any price"" Buffett said in the annual letter. ""I emphasize that point because American CEOs have an embarrassing record of devoting more company funds to repurchases when prices have risen than when they have tanked. Our approach is exactly the reverse.""

Berkshire's operating income which Buffett urges shareholders to concentrate on came in at $5.02 billion during the fourth quarter up from $4.42 billion during the same period a year earlier. For the full year operating earnings dipped 9% to $21.922 billion as the pandemic hit Berkshire's conglomerate of businesses.

The company's net earnings — which account for Berkshire's big investments in the public market — jumped 23% on a year-over-year basis to $35.835 billion. For the full year however net earnings slid 48% to $42.521 billion.

Berkshire Hathaway's class A shares hit a new all-time high on Thursday after bouncing 52% from the March 23 low. For the year the stock is up about 5% outperforming the S&P 500's 2% gain.

Even after Berkshire's record 2020 buyback the firm still has a sizable cash pile at $138 billion. The figure is down from $145.7 billion at the end of the third quarter.

“Today many people forge similar miracles throughout the world creating a spread of prosperity that benefits all of humanity” Buffett wrote. “In its brief 232 years of existence however there has been no incubator for unleashing human potential like America. Despite some severe interruptions our country’s economic progress has been breathtaking. Beyond that we retain our constitutional aspiration of becoming “a more perfect union.” Progress on that front has been slow uneven and often discouraging. We have however moved forward and will continue to do so. Our unwavering conclusion: Never bet against America.”

The letter also discussed Buffett’s ownership of Apple shares. Apple is now the second most valuable piece of BH’s portfolio behind his BNSF railroad holdings.

“Berkshire’s investment in Apple vividly illustrates the power of repurchases. We began buying Apple stock late in 2016 and by early July 2018 owned slightly more than one billion Apple shares (split-adjusted)” he wrote. “Saying that I’m referencing the investment held in Berkshire’s general account and am excluding a very small and separately-managed holding of Apple shares that was subsequently sold. When we finished our purchases in mid-2018 Berkshire’s general account owned 5.2% of Apple.”

Berkshire earned $42.5 billion in 2020 according to generally accepted accounting principles the letter stated. The four components of that figure are $21.9 billion of operating earnings $4.9 billion of realized capital gains a $26.7 billion gain from an increase in the amount of net unrealized capital gains that exist in the stocks the conglomerate holds and an $11 billion loss from a write-down in the value of a few subsidiary and affiliate businesses that BH owns.

BBY,Best Buy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9iZXN0LWJ1eS1sYWlkLW9mZi01MDAwLWVtcGxveWVlcy1pbi1yZXNwb25zZS10by10aGUtb25saW5lLXNob3BwaW5nLWJvb23SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Buy Laid Off 5000 Employees in Response to the Online Shopping Boom,"Fry’s Electronics wasn’t the only electronics retailer affected by COVID-19. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Best Buy laid off 5000 employees of its 102000 employees in response to the pandemic-hastened rise of online shopping.

Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said in an earnings report that “online sales grew almost 90% to a record $6.7 billion and made up 43% of our total Domestic sales” in the 13-week fourth quarter of 2021 that ended on January 30.

But that doesn’t mean the company’s brick-and-mortar stores were obsolete. Quite the opposite: Barry said “almost two-thirds of our online revenue was either picked up in store or curbside shipped from a store or delivered by a store employee.”

So why did Best Buy lay off 5000 of its employees and say that it plans to close some of its stores this year? According to CNN Business it’s because Barry thinks the company has “too many full-time and not enough part-time employees.”

That makes sense from an economic perspective. Many states offer protections to full-time workers that guarantee them some form of paid time off healthcare and other benefits. Part-time employees aren’t eligible for those so-called perks.

Best Buy also said that it expected the sales growth it experienced in 2020—it turns out that people buy a lot of new electronics when they’re stuck inside for a year—to slow in the first half of 2021. Reducing its sales staff can help it maintain margins.

It’s a balancing act. One side has Best Buy offering employees cash bonuses for risking exposure to COVID-19 and giving them paid time off to get vaccinated; the other has the company laying off those same employees for greater flexibility.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzIvMjgvMjIzMDU3NjMvc2Ftc3VuZy1nYWxheHktY2hyb21lYm9vay0yLW5vdy1hdmFpbGFibGUtYmVzdC1idXktcHJpY2Utc3BlY3MtZmVhdHVyZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung’s Galaxy Chromebook 2 is now available to purchase at Best Buy,"Samsung’s latest Chrome OS laptop the Galaxy Chromebook 2 is now available for purchase at Best Buy. The Chromebook 2 was first announced at CES in January and features a new QLED display 360-degree hinge and a striking red paint job. It starts at $549.99 for a Celeron model and goes up to $699.99 for a Core i3 version putting it at the higher end of Chromebooks.

That price is the most significant thing about the Chromebook 2 because it’s considerably less than the Galaxy Chromebook that debuted a year ago. The older Chromebook had an 4K OLED screen and came with a stylus — neither of which you’ll fine with the new model — but it also cost just under $1000 when it came out. In our review we found despite the gorgeous screen and striking paint job the original Galaxy Chromebook didn’t justify its cost particularly thanks to abysmal battery life.

Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 $ 550 The Galaxy Chromebook 2 is Samsung’s flagship Chrome OS laptop for 2021. It has a new QLED screen either Intel Celeron or Core i3 processors and comes in a striking red paint job. $550 at Best Buy

We’ve yet to put the new Chromebook 2 through its paces but we did get to see the machine in person back in January and it certainly seems like it will be competent. The QLED screen isn’t quite up to the marks of the OLED panel but you’d be hard-pressed to notice without putting them side-by-side and the rest of the Chromebook 2’s fit and finish are appropriate for the price Samsung is asking. Importantly it still comes in that amazing red color as well. You might notice the extra weight — the Chromebook 2 is about half a pound heavier — but it still falls under three pounds total and should be easily portable.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvZmViLzI3L2Nvc3Rjby1zdGFydGluZy1wYXktMTYtdG9wcGluZy1yaXZhbHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco starting pay $16 topping rivals | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"NEW YORK -- Costco will increase its starting wage to $16 an hour surpassing most of its main competitors.

Costco chief executive Craig Jelinek announced the increase Thursday at a Senate Budget Committee hearing led by Sen. Bernie Sanders to examine wages at major companies. Jelinek said the starting wage for Costco employees would rise to $16 next week up from $15 the company instituted two year ago.

The starting wage scale puts Costco above competitors including Amazon Target and Best Buy which have $15 minimum wages. Walmart's starting pay is $11 an hour.

Jelinek said that the higher pay would bolster worker retention and productivity.

""I want to note: This isn't altruism"" Jelinek said. ""At Costco we know that paying employees good wages and providing affordable benefits makes sense for our business and constitutes a significant competitive advantage for us.""

Workers from Walmart and McDonald's testified at the hearing to demand those companies raise their minimum pay.

The federal minimum wage is a $7.25. Democrats are trying to push through a $1.9 trillion covid-19 relief bill that would include a provision raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour over five years a policy strongly opposed by Republicans.

That effort suffered a serious blow Thursday when the Senate parliamentarian decided the minimum wage provision must be dropped from the bill.

A growing number of states already have raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

Costco's announcement also was made as labor groups are demanding hazard pay for grocery employees and other essential workers which some companies offered at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and later ended.

Costco has continued to pay a $2 hourly premium to its workers since March. Jelinek said Costco would end the premium as the one-year mark approaches but would convert some of it through increases in wages across pay scales.

Costco has 180000 employees in the U.S. Jelinek said more than half make $25 an hour or more.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjgvMjMwLW1pbGxpb24tZG9sbGFycy1zcGVudC1vbi1uYmEtdG9wLXNob3QuaHRtbNIBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzAyLzI4LzIzMC1taWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhcnMtc3BlbnQtb24tbmJhLXRvcC1zaG90Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,People have spent more than $230 million buying and trading digital collectibles of NBA highlights,"Source: NBA Top Shot

A LeBron James highlight sold for $200000. A Zion Williamson edition went for a little less than that. The National Basketball Association has officially aligned itself for the future of the trading card marketplace and currently this game is sold out. The NBA partnered with Canadian-based Dapper Labs makers of the CryptoKitties game to make its version of a collectible digital asset. NBA Top Shot is a crypto-collectible consumers can purchase as a non-fungible token (NFT). Each collectible is tied to a blockchain -- a digital ledger similar to the blockchains used for digital currencies like bitcoin. This effectively gives each NFT a unique and non-hackable certificate of authenticity. So even if somebody makes a perfect copy of the highlight video it will instantly be recognizable as a fake. Current ""packs"" to get in the game go for as low as $9.00 -- and they're constantly sold out. Caty Tedman head of marketing and team partnerships at Dapper Labs says that Top Shots has generated more than $230 million in sales so far although most of this has come from traders exchanging the collectibles after their initial sale. Dapper earns revenue via fees captured from peer-to-peer transactions and unleashing new packs of NFTs. ""I think it's fascinating"" said Tom Richardson a digital media professor at Columbia University's sports management program. ""It's a nice evolution and good to see that people are still doing collectibles even during this time"" added Lars Rensing CEO of blockchain service provider Protokol. ""It's a new step to the future."" The game has also become a new source of revenue for the NBA. And again its sold out.

Inside the new trading card model

Top Shots emerged from a licensing agreement the NBA and its players' union made with Dapper Labs in 2019. The NBA did not make an official avaiable to comment for this story but Richardson who was once head of publishing at the National Football League says the league can solicit 10% to 15% of sales from a company leveraging their intellectual property. The NBA licenses the reels to Dapper Laps which digitizes the footage making a limited amount to create scarcity. Some NFTs feature highlights in different angles and digital artwork. One is currently listed for over $240000. Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban has compared Top Shot to the old-school model of trading cards where consumers can have fun trading and collecting scarce items – only with no risk of damage or theft. ""And the value is still set by the same laws of supply and demand"" he wrote in January. ""Leave it to Mark Cuban to frame it in a good sensible easy-to-understand way"" said Richardson also SVP of strategy at Mercury Intermedia. ""So if enough people wanted that same Zion Williamson highlight that NFT and bidding on it they got up to $100000 that's supply and demand. Someone thought it was worth $100000."" The bet for traders is that in 2051 a LeBron James NFT could be worth what a 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle card is worth today -- one of those rare cards recently sold for $5.2 million. And just imagine what a rare Michael Jordan rookie highlight NFT would sell for in 30 years. ""We think it could be a 100-year product"" said Tedman from Dapper Labs. ""If you think about what the rookie cards today will be worth in the future especially the ones from this point of the product. Everyone who is participating now is really getting in on the ground floor."" By using the blockchain Richardson says Dapper overcomes a big challenge with digital assets which is the ease of copying them infinite times with almost no friction. ""One of the things that have defined the digital era is we've moved from a world of scarcity to a world of abundance with all kinds of media assets and products"" he added. ""But the thing that defines the trading card business is a physical scarcity of the cards. So (Dapper) created these NFTs with the idea of scarcity combined with authenticity because of the way the blockchain works."" With this asset Dapper is positioning itself to capitalize on a digital-driven generation who value digital assets as much as physical ones. ""The new generation is more digital-native"" Rensing said. ""I think it will stick around because it's a solution that also brings in new fans and digital natives.""

Mobile game coming this year

Earlier this month Dapper raised $250 million and now values itself at $2 billion thanks in part to the sudden popularity of Top Shot according to digital asset research and news outlet The Block. With the funds Dapper will continue expanding its blockchain Flow. Tedman one of the creators of Top Shot said it now has roughly 350000 registered users and claimed that Flow can better handle capacity of a high-value marketplace something that caused problems with its CryptoKitties product. ""It lets us hit a scale that other blockchain projects haven't yet"" Tedman said. She said that of the $230 million generated in sales so far 95% of that has been captured by consumers on its marketplace who buy sell and trade. She said the firm released 5000 new packs of highlights this week as a stress test for Flow and 90000 people got in line to buy. The packs quickly sold out. ""They're coming in collecting putting together what they think are good collections buying and selling"" Tedman said. ""It's almost like if you stash together trading cards with the stock market. That in of itself is a game before we release the mobile game."" That mobile game slated to roll out this year will allow consumers to build NBA-like rosters by acquiring NFT moments then compete in online tournaments -- and possibly win more scarce NFTs that can increase in value. ""It can be the opportunity to have some fun with your interest and love of a sport – in this case basketball – combined with your interest in new technology experiences and financial experiences such as cryptocurrency and NFTs"" said Richardson. Saum Noursalehi is the CEO of tech firm tZERO a firm that tokenizes private or public companies' assets and builds the platform that allows the assets to trade. He sees a bright future with sports leagues using NFT licensing agreements and suggests it's a model for how blockchain technology could be used to track and trade other types of assets. Blockchain technology ""is going to change the way we trade value today how we trade assets"" Noursalehi said. Added Tedman ""We're just at the very beginning of this. We have lots of big plans that we can't wait to put in front of people."" Let the new games begin as the digital age continues to take shape. But entry into Dapper's NBA Top Shot contest is currently sold out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjcvZ3JhYi1hLXNhbXN1bmctZ2FsYXh5LXMyMS1mb3ItNjUwLTE1MC1vZmYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grab a Samsung Galaxy S21 for $650 ($150 off),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjcvZ3JhYi1hLXNhbXN1bmctZ2FsYXh5LXMyMS1mb3ItNjUwLTE1MC1vZmYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

To explore the possible relationship between CDX2 and Reg IV in gastric cancer tissues mRNA and protein levels were measured by real-time PCR and IHC. The samples were divided into two groups based on the relative expression of mRNA in the 93 cases: low (≤ 2) and high expression (> 2). A high expression of CDX2 mRNA was found in 31 of the 93 cases and a low expression was found in 62 of the 93 cases. Low CDX2 expression was frequently observed in gastric cancer tissues with low Reg IV expression (72.6% 45 of 62 cases) and high CDX2 expression was frequently observed in tissues with high Reg IV expression (67.7% 21 of 31 cases; p = 0.0002 by χ2-test; Table 4). Correlation analysis further showed that the expression of CDX2 mRNA was positively associated with that of Reg IV mRNA in gastric cancer tissues (r = 0.387 p = 0.0001; Table 4). Furthermore we examined protein expression in the 102 cases and representative images of the IHC results are shown in Fig. 1. CDX2 was mainly found in the nucleus with cytoplasmic staining occasionally observed. Reg IV was detected mainly in the cytoplasm of tumor cells. CDX2 was negative in 67 cases and positive in 35 cases and CDX2 expression was associated with Reg IV expression (p = 0.032 by χ2-test; Table 5). Further analysis showed that the expression of the CDX2 protein was positively associated with that of the Reg IV protein in gastric cancer tissues (r = 0.334 p = 0.001; Table 5). These results suggest that CDX2 expression positively correlates with Reg IV expression in gastric cancer tissues.

CDX2 silencing downregulated Reg IV expression in gastric cancer cells

To confirm whether CDX2 regulates Reg IV expression in gastric cancer cells CDX2 expression was knocked down via RNA interference (RNAi). Measurement of the relative CDX2 mRNA expression level at 48 h post-transfection with the three CDX2 siRNAs showed that siR-CDX2-3 produced an optimal interference effect and CDX2 mRNA levels decreased by 86.0% in AGS cells (Fig. 2a). siR-CDX2-3 significantly reduced the mRNA (p = 0.0002) and protein (p = 0.003) levels of Reg IV in AGS cells (Fig. 2a–b). In MKN-45 cells siR-CDX2-1 achieved the highest knockdown effect. Reg IV mRNA (p = 0.001) and protein (p = 0.007) levels were also decreased in the CDX2 knockdown group compared with the control group (Fig. 2c–d). These results indicate that the silencing of CDX2 led to the downregulation of Reg IV in gastric cancer cells.

Fig. 2 CDX2 silencing downregulated Reg IV in gastric cancer cells. AGS (a b) and MKN-45 (c d) cells were transfected with the three CDX2 siRNAs for 48 h and the CDX2 siRNA with the optimal silencing effect was chosen and used for subsequent experiments (left of a c). CDX2 mRNA level was measured using real-time PCR and the results were normalized to GAPDH (right of a c). Moreover western blotting was used to analyze Reg IV and CDX2 protein levels β-actin was used as a loading control. Representative immunoblots are shown and the relative protein signal intensity was quantitatively analyzed using Image Lab software (b d).

To further confirm the regulation of Reg IV by CDX2 in gastric cancer cells cells were transfected with pcDNA4/TO-CDX2 or pcDNA4/TO (control) for 36 h and CDX2 expression was analyzed via real-time PCR and western blotting. Figure 3a c shows that CDX2 mRNA levels increased by 101.8-fold (AGS p < 0.0001) and 301153.3-fold (MKN-45 p < 0.0001). The western blotting results further verified the overexpression of CDX2 protein in AGS (p = 0.0001) and MKN-45 (p = 0.007) cells (Fig. 3b d). We found that Reg IV mRNA and protein levels increased after CDX2 overexpression in AGS and MKN-45 cells (p < 0.01; Fig. 3a–d). These results suggest that the overexpression of CDX2 led to the upregulation of Reg IV in gastric cancer cells.

Reg IV did not affect CDX2 expression in gastric cancer cells

To investigate the effect of Reg IV on CDX2 in gastric cancer cells Reg IV was silenced or overexpressed. siR-Reg IV which had a significant silencing effect in our previous study [1] was transiently transfected into cells for 48 h. Real-time PCR analysis showed that Reg IV mRNA levels decreased by 79.5% (AGS) and 90% (MKN-45) (p < 0.01; left panels of Fig. 4a b). The western blotting results also demonstrated that siR-Reg IV significantly reduced Reg IV expression compared with the control groups (p < 0.01; middle and right panels of Fig. 4a b). Although the CDX2 mRNA level was downregulated (p < 0.0001) the protein level did not change (p = 0.274) following Reg IV silencing in AGS cells (Fig. 4a). However Reg IV silencing had no effect on CDX2 mRNA and protein levels in MKN-45 cells (p > 0.05; Fig. 4b). These results suggest that Reg IV silencing had no effect on CDX2 expression in gastric cancer cells.

Fig. 4 Reg IV had no effect on CDX2 in gastric cancer cells. AGS and MKN-45 cells were transfected with siR-Reg IV (a b) or pEGFP-C1-Reg IV (c d). Reg IV and CDX2 mRNA levels were evaluated using real-time PCR and relative mRNA expression results were normalized to GAPDH (left of a–d). Reg IV and CDX2 protein expression levels were analyzed via western blotting. β-actin was used as a loading control. Representative immunoblots are shown in the middle panels of a–d. The relative protein signal intensity was quantitatively analyzed using Image Lab software and shown as histograms (right of a–d). Full-length original blots are presented in Additional file 1. Data are presented as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 compared with the control groups Full size image

Cells were also transfected with pEGFP-C1-Reg IV or pEGFP-C1 (control) and the expression of Reg IV was validated by real-time PCR and western blotting. Figure 4c shows that Reg IV mRNA levels increased by 526.1-fold (AGS) and 3478357.1-fold (MKN-45) (p < 0.01). To further determine whether the Reg IV protein was overexpressed we detected the fusion protein (EGFP-Reg IV; ~ 41 KDa) of EGFP (27 KDa) and Reg IV (14 KDa) via western blotting using the Reg IV antibody. The results showed that EGFP-Reg IV was expressed when AGS and MKN-45 cells were transfected with pEGFP-C1-Reg IV (Fig. 4c d). Moreover the endogenous Reg IV level was significantly upregulated in pEGFP-C1-Reg IV-transfected AGS cells (Fig. 4c). However CDX2 mRNA and protein levels were unchanged following Reg IV overexpression in AGS cells (p > 0.05; Fig. 4c). Although Reg IV overexpression downregulated CDX2 mRNA levels in MKN-45 cells (p = 0.0002) protein expression did not change (p = 0.154; Fig. 4d). These results indicate that Reg IV overexpression had no effect on CDX2 expression in gastric cancer cells.

CDX2 promoted the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells

To determine the roles of CDX2 in the motility of AGS and MKN-45 cells wound-healing Transwell migration and Matrigel invasion assays were performed following CDX2 silencing or overexpression. In the wound-healing assay migration of AGS cells was significantly reduced after CDX2 silencing in comparison with the control group (p = 0.002 for 24 h p < 0.0001 for 36 h; Fig. 5a). Alternatively cell migration was significantly increased after CDX2 overexpression (p = 0.047 for 24 h p = 0.008 for 36 h; Fig. 5b). Because MKN-45 cells migrated very slowly the wound healing process was monitored for 72 h. Consistent with the findings in AGS cells knockdown of CDX2 dramatically inhibited the migration of AGS cells (p < 0.01; Fig. 5c) while overexpression of CDX2 significantly increased migration especially after 48 h (p = 0.003) and 72 h (p = 0.031) (Fig. 5d). Moreover the Transwell migration assay showed that CDX2 silencing significantly reduced the number of AGS cells that migrated from the upper surface to the lower surface of the inserts (p = 0.009; Fig. 5e) and CDX2 overexpression had the opposite effect (p = 0.014; Fig. 5f). Similar results were also observed in MKN-45 cells (Fig. 5g–h). Therefore these data indicate that CDX2 promoted the migration of gastric cancer cells.

Fig. 5 CDX2 promoted the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. a–d Wound-healing assay to detect the migration of AGS and MKN-45 cells after CDX2 silencing or overexpression. Representative microscopic images are shown. Magnification 100 × . The bar charts show the percentage of wound-healing at indicated times (below panel). e–h Effects of CDX2 silencing or overexpression on the migration and invasion of both cell lines were assessed by Transwell assay. Cells transfected with CDX2 siRNA or pcDNA4/TO-CDX2 migrated across uncoated or Matrigel-coated Transwell inserts. Cells in five fields from each membrane were counted using an optical microscope. Representative images of migrated cells are shown. Magnification 200×. The bar charts show the number of cells that migrated across 8 µm pores to the underside of the membrane. Data are presented as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 compared with the control groups Full size image

We further assessed the impact of CDX2 on the invasive properties of AGS and MKN-45 cells using Matrigel-coated inserts. Compared with the control group the number of cells that passed through the Matrigel-coated membranes reduced by 81.0% in AGS cells transfected with siR-CDX2-3 (p < 0.0001; Fig. 5e). However CDX2 overexpression resulted in the opposite effect (p = 0.0002; Fig. 5f). Consistently CDX2 silencing inhibited the invasion of MKN-45 cells (p = 0.015; Fig. 5g) and CDX2 overexpression markedly increased invasion (p < 0.0001; Fig. 5h). These results show that CDX2 promoted the invasion of gastric cancer cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I write that carefully because curiosity and a love of writing are in the blood and will continue to be so in the period I will loosely call ‘retirement’.

The opportunity and expectation that I would not have to wear a shirt and tie was not low on my priorities as I considered my future as a youth.

I joined the Leinster Leader in 1980 the year the paper celebrated the 100th anniversary of its founding starting work there on October 14.

Born in Dublin in 1956 to Dubliner Harry the Deputy Controller of the Irish Patents Office until his death in 1972; and Brid a Wexford native who trained as a psychiatric nurse I lived a happy life off Stillorgan road beside the former Montrose Hotel along with my only sibling Paul.

I started school at the age of 4 at Miss Eileen Shine’s — she was an aunt of the singer Brendan Shine who ran a small private school — before heading to Willow Park and on to Blackrock College.

A modest Leaving Cert led me to repeat that exam in the College of Commerce Rathmines after which I was accepted into the School of Journalism course from 1975-79 under the direction of RTÉ broadcaster Sean Egan.

Some class colleagues there included Barbara Sheridan editor of the Kildare Nationalist; RTÉ’s Tommie Gorman; the late Paul Drury an editor with the Irish Mail group; Maurice Gubbins editor of the Evening Echo; and Mary Morrissy whose work includes three novels Mother of Pearl The Pretender and The Rising of Bella Casey.

Well-known Kildare journalist Jane Mullins and former RTÉ Agriculture correspondent Joe O’Brien were in the class ahead of us.

After some low-earning freelance work in the summer of 1977 Sean Egan called me to say there was a vacancy as a journalist at the Dungarvan Observer in county Waterford run by Paddy Lynch and family.

This was my second newspaper as I had trained for two months at the Westmeath Examiner office in Mullingar under the direction of editor Nicholas Nally an enjoyable experience.

A colleague was Don Lavery who was on hand to report Minister for Defence Paddy Donegan describing the then President of Ireland President Cearbhall O Dalaigh as ‘a thundering disgrace’ — which led to the latter’s resignation.

Fully expecting to be the tea boy it quickly emerged that I was the only journalist and Paddy and the lads were letting me off the leash to work greatly on my own initiative.

They very quickly put me on the senior wage rate set down by and requested by the National Union of Journalists on whose Irish Executive Council I was to serve for a number of years.

Around September 1980 though I loved Dungarvan and many in it I felt it was time to move closer to Dublin where it was all supposed to be happening and a lot of it was.

Hired by the Leinster Leader then a broadsheet paper I had presumed a role in Naas where the late Bill Britton was then the managing director of the Williams family-owned operation — but I was asked to go to Edenderry or the “colonies” as I named it.

I liked Edenderry and the nice part of the job was that I was able to and required to work from home.

As in Dungarvan I was let get on with it by editor Senan Carroll an easy going Clare man.

Work sport and friendships amalgamated many times.

I was still using the manual typewriter my parents had given me as a gift when I was 15 after indicating a desire for journalism.

I became great friends with the late Kevin Farrell of the Offaly Topic and Leinster Express. Kevin did a lot of work for the Star and the Sunday World. I miss him a lot. We had some great laughs together.

I first met my Leader friend and colleague Paul O’Meara in that area when he was working with the Offaly Topic.

Five years were spent in Edenderry until 1985 covering the town itself and outlying areas such as Rhode Clonbullogue Walsh Island and Rathangan.

Once a week I headed to the town and got to know folks like Leo Conway the late John Fullam and the Forde family among many others.

I was also fortunate to cover the Offaly hurlers and footballers over those years and was a regular attendee at Croke Park including for the All Ireland hurling and football wins in the early 1980s.

A very fruitful source of news was McCormack’s pub in Edenderry particularly on weekend nights.

As one pint led to the next potential stories rolled off the tongues and citizens did their duties to tip off the press inadvertently or otherwise.

As a result Monday was often quite busy phoning (on the landline) various parties for responses.

I was in the same pub when the late Minister for Defence Paddy Power spoke at a Fianna Fail meeting during the Falklands War and asked the British to get out of this little country of ours Ireland. Kevin Farrell was also present.

I shared the copy with the Irish Times and Kevin with the Irish Independent and others. I awoke the next morning to hear on the RTÉ radio news that my very brief quote of Paddy’s words had been reported in the New York Times.

At this time I got to know many Kildare sports people after starting to write up reports of soccer rugby and golf reports on a Sunday evening usually after phoning both clubs in a game.

The Edenderry years also coincided with the Malcolm McArthur murder cases and as the death of a local man Donal Dunne who had met McArthur with a view to selling a gun.

Later reports said McArthur had hung around The Harbour area in Edenderry which was where I was living in a ground floor flat overlooking the canal.

Apart from anything else it was the start of a terrible time for the family of Mr Dunne whose death was not formally attributed to McArthur

I recall the late Cllr Jim Flanagan of Edenderry Town Commissioners and Offaly County Council fame.

A one time wrestler he once threw eggs at an unfortunate county manager during a council meeting.

Jim did not like small planes flying near him and the Irish Parachute Club was located very close to his home formerly a school building.

Between 1981 and 1985 he campaigned against it relentlessly.

Some time into the controversy I was taken on a flight by the club as part of my reporting on its side of the story.

I wrote what I thought was a balanced article for the Leinster Leader bearing very much in mind that if parachutists chose to act as dangerously as Jim believed they would be most likely the first victims of their own mistakes.

Jim argued publicly the wool had been pulled over my eyes.

At the following meeting of Offaly County Council in a reference to my proud piece of writing Jim told the gathering that the editor of the Leinster Leader “should come down here and see things for himself instead of sending a boy up in a plane with goggles on”.

In 1985 the Leader asked me to move to Kildare town to cover that area as well as some of the Edenderry beats and I did so for three years.

Kildare was different to Edenderry.

The latter had some historic roots in migrants who came from elsewhere to work the bogs in the 1940s and 50s. It was to a great extent the go to-town for west Kildare areas.

Kildare town had a different feel — racing and military traditions abounded.

It was there I made a resolution to put a halt to what was a relatively mild amount of gambling on horses.

I would bump into racing folk in the local hostels from the time and on one occasion a more senior stable hand recommended a certain horse now surely in the heaven’s stable as a good investment.

I shelled out with great hope a relatively small sum at the local bookmakers.

Alas my four-legged pal was not up to it on the day and so began a successful effort to lower to almost zero my investment in these matters. To this day I am a dry racing gambler.

Another memorable incident in those years was when I gave a lift to a woman in Newbridge as I was driving back to Kildare town one sunny afternoon.

A number of people were standing with thumbs out on the side of the road and in the days when giving someone a lift was more normal I stopped.

A lady made a beeline for the car and hopped into the front passenger seat.

There was as the gardaí might say in evidence a strong smell of drink.

Nothing wrong with that in itself but things started to veer off course when she completely out of the blue accused me of abusing her sister in Portlaoise.

She snatched the miraculous medal of not just any regular saint but the Virgin Mary herself which was dangling with a light blue string off the front mirror.

A number of unpleasant thoughts started to run through me including ending up banged up for sexual assault.

I told her it would be best if we both dropped into Kildare garda station so she could report the matter.

As I came to a halt on the garda station grounds she stepped out of the car and started walking up towards the square.

I explained to the desk garda inside that a woman had taken my miraculous medal and very quickly two gardaí and myself hot footed it up the road to try and catch her. We did.

On the way back for the interview she would not walk beside me calling me that ‘that dirtbag’.

At the station I took a seat and my travelling companion was taken inside for an interview.

After a little while I heard from another corridor the voice of then Detective Garda Tim Kennedy asking one of his colleagues: “What fecking eejit picked her up?”

I was then told that Tim was their PRO man — ie he dealt with those selling sexual services.

I was later handed the blue stringed medallion which had adorned the front of my Volkswagen Beetle and told: “We won’t tell you where we found this.”

In the final quarter of 1988 the late managing director Bill Ralph asked me to go to Leixlip.

Intel Ireland was just starting there and I have no doubt that it helped change part of Irish business culture.

Another big story then was one of the early campaigns against water charges.

The developments at Weston Aerodrome stand out as do meeting the late legendary airman Darby Kennedy.

Leixlip Town Commissioners came into being around this time.

There was plenty to get my teeth into story wise — planning issues among them — and again working from home in River Forest in Leixlip happenings in Celbridge Maynooth and even further flung mythologies kept me busy.

This included the joy of reporting on rugby at MU Barnhall in Parsonstown.

Kildare VEC (now KWETB) adult education section enabled me to get an economics degree from University of London via Coláiste Chiarain Leixlip.

I also became a volunteer director of Leixlip & District Credit Union for nine years all as either secretary and treasurer.

In the mid-2000 and I did an economic masters course at nearby Maynooth University and later took up the secretaryship of Leim an Bhradáin Housing Association now merged into Clanmil.

Early in the Leixlip days I interviewed Aida Best a native of Pampanga in the Philippines in her role as president of the Irish-Filipino Association in Ireland.

I married my soulmate Aida in Celbridge on September 8 2018 with the aid of Fr Pat Egan and hundreds of family and friends.

Throughout my Leader career a notable time came in December 2006.

The Leader had expanded from a single newspaper into a group by buy out; and in 2006 the Johnston Press group (JP) in the UK bought the group out for around €155 million which even in those Celtic Tiger boom times was thought to be a bit high.

Staff received a pay off from the previous owners headed up by John McStay more or less out of the blue. My own share was a decent €18000 approx translated to €11000 after tax.

The financial crash came in 2008 and it appeared JP had over-borrowed. They tried to sell us as the banks pressured them but it seems that the best on offer was €60m in around April 2009.

The current owners Iconic Newspapers bought in at significantly less than that €60m asking price.

Journalism’s greatest gift has been the many great and kind people whom I got to know through both work and citizenship in politics courts and other community entities.

My sense is that subject to health and sufficient faculties my journalism gene will not be packed away in the attic as I would be dead if that happens.

My career saw me start with a manual typewriter move to the electric typewriter and the fax machine the email etc.

I also saw the move from metallic print fonts and away from the clack of large printing presses (under the eyes of the late Winnie Beresford in Dungarvan and Tony Ryan in what is now the separate Naas Printing establishment) to online publishing where it is possible to make a complete fool of oneself very quickly indeed possibly in addition to being subject to a libel suit.

This is called progress and I hope the changes live up to that name particularly when it comes to our democratic freedoms.

To this day I regularly write on paper with a fountain pen handed down to me by my late father.

I have a sense that good journalism and my friends and colleagues in that trade need those in the wider community who cherish good journalism which is one of the safety guards for democracy and a safer and fairer life for all.

I hope I have made some contribution to that but I am conscious that others have made much more.

The current editor Laura Coates continues the battle — Covid-19 has knocked us hard — to maintain the Leinster Leader standard in the 21st century along with colleagues sports editor legend Tommy Callaghan Paul O’Meara Senan Hogan and Niamh O’Donoghue.

Recent colleagues who departed the Leader (and Kildare Now which it took over) include Conor McHugh Paula Campbell Sarah Peppard Rose Barrett O’Donoghue and Louise McCarthy.

We also relied on photographers and in recent years Tony Keane was such a reliable colleague until his retirement. Aishling Conway continues to snap.

Some journalists have had a tendency to turn up their collective noses at the difficult world of advertising/administration over the years often forgetting that along with sales price revenue from advertising has been a vital element of income. Anna Cathryn Lorna Michael Giselle Theresa and many others were important.

Naas Courthouse where I spent quite a lot of time in recent years has been a source of work but also good relationship with court staff gardaí and the legal profession all of whom continued to educate me up to now. As indeed have many of the defendants.

It has also been fun at times. They may not see the last of me.

I am conscious that Naas Courthouse was possibly the last building at which the late investigative journalist the courageous Veronica Guerin attended.

As she made her way back to Dublin that day from Naas she was murdered by a criminal gang.

She had given her life for her trade and her country.

I am so grateful for what journalism has given me particularly what Waterford Offaly Kildare and Dublin have provided.

I did not have to wear a tie for most of the time and I would do it all again — even though Aida has since bought me some nice ties."

Mojang added Blackstone to Minecraft during the version 1.16 update and the darker cobblestone alternative can typically only be found in the Nether. Still there are ways to gather it in the overworld if needed.

Blackstone can occasionally be found around ruined Nether Portals which spawn in the overworld. This is the only way to find it without going into the Nether but there is still a chance a ruined portal will spawn without any Blackstone.

For players to gather a large amount of the stone they will need to venture into the Nether.

Where to find Blackstone in Minecraft

In the Nether

Blackstone is usually found in the Nether's basalt desert biome (Image via Minecraft)

Blackstone is typically only found in Minecraft in the Nether a different hell-like dimension that players can enter through a Nether Portal.

To build a Nether Portal players will need to craft a 2x3 rectangle out of obsidian then light the obsidian on fire. The easiest way to do this is by using flint and steel.

Once players are in the Nether Blackstone is usually found in the basalt desert biome within the Nether. Blackstone can also spawn anywhere underground or below the surface of a lava sea all in the Nether.

Using Blackstone

Blackstone can be made into slabs and stairs (Image via Minecraft)

Gamers can use Blackstone just like cobblestone in Minecraft. They only need a wooden pickaxe to mine Blackstone and it can be used to craft stone tools furnaces and more.

Blackstone can even be made into slabs and stairs. The stone is popular to use while building as it has similar textures to cobblestone but it is significantly darker.

Keep in mind that despite the stone being darker any tools crafted with Blackstone will look like regular stone tools. The tools do not become darker.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbG9jYWxwcm92LmNvbS9uZXdzL3RoZS1teXN0ZXJ5LW9mLXJpcy1wYW5jYWtlLWFuZC1naW5nZXJicmVhZC1pc2xhbmRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Mystery of RI's Pancake and Gingerbread Islands,"The Mystery of RI’s Pancake and Gingerbread Islands

Do you know where Rhode Island’s Gingerbread and Pancake Islands are?

The islands are often seen but few pay attention to their existence and infamous -- and racist -- Rhode Island writer H.P. Lovecraft linked them to pirate treasure.

""H. P. Lovecraft was once something of a waterman on the Seekonk River seen in a Whitman Bailey drawing made on the Poe-haunted west shore at Blackstone Park"" writes David Haden.

“I used to row considerably on the Seekonk … Often I would land on one or both of the Twin Islands — for islands (associated with remote secrets pirate treasure and all that) always fascinated me.” — Lovecraft letter to Rimel April 1934.

Gingerbread and Pancake Islands are mere spits of land just to the north of the Washington Bridge on I-195 in the Seekonk River between Providence and East Providence.

If you search on Google Maps you will see them marked as Pancake and Gingerbread Islands. They are not however named on navigational charts produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

So where -- and when -- did they get those names?

Representatives at the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management did not know the origin of the names.

NOAA however was able to shed a little more light.

Colleen Roche is NOAA’s Navigational Manager for Rhode Island and provided GoLocal with some historical perspective.

About Islands

Roche confirmed that the U.S. Board of Geographic (UBG) Names lists the islands as Pancake and Gingerbread — as well as under “Twin Islands.”

Pancake and Gingerbread Islands were entered into the United States Geographical Survey in 1991 — but were officially deemed those names in a UBG decision in 1930.

Other variant names that were listed by the USGS? “Cup-Cake Islands.”

“The US Board of Geographic Names (BGN) referenced the Official Gazetteer of Rhode Island printed in 1932 as the source for the names” said Roche.

See the 1930 Gazeteer HERE

The document provides the following context — and stated at the time that the names of the islands were not in fact one of the baked goods.

Pancake: island the eastern of the Twin Islands group in Seekonk River about half mile above mouth in Providence. (Not Bullock Cup-Cake nor Pan-Cake).

Roche said she was unable to find the notes from the February 5 1930 meeting in which they were formally adopted by the Board of Geographic Names and suggested it would require further research.

Updating Derogatory Names

In her capacity at NOAA Roche also told GoLocal she has seen an increase in proposals from the public to rename geographic features or places with derogatory names.

In Rhode Island a brook in Coventry officially named the “N-word Sawmill Brook” in 1930 was changed to “Negro Sawmill Brook” in 1972.

It was officially changed to just “Sawmill Brook” in 2020.

Practitioners of leveraged buyouts who refer to themselves as part of the “private equity” industry are among the richest Americans. They use a whole lot of borrowed money and as little equity as possible to buy companies they perceive to be undervalued or poorly managed. They hope to flip them at a big profit a few years later.

Photo: Getty

Swedish plant-based milk company Oatly has said it has begun work on a US stock market listing which could value it at as much as $10bn (£7.2bn).

While Oatly did not specify how much cash it hopes to raise in its initial public offering (IPO) the $10bn valuation is more than the $2bn suggested in an investment round in July 2020.

The firm which has celebrity investors such as Oprah Jay-Z and Natalie Portman raised $200m in investment last year. Products from the company which is backed by Blackstone are sold in over 20 countries.

Earlier this week the Malmo-based group said that it had submitted a confidential filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The IPO which is subject to market review is expected to take place following the SEC's review the company said.

Appetite for plant-based alternatives has increased in recent years amid a surge in demand for environmentally friendly food and drinks.

While the company hasn't released its sales figures for 2020 yet the company which was founded in 1990 had revenues of about $200m in 2019 — roughly double that in 2018.

US investors have also invested in companies such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods which opened the lane for vegan products to enter the mainstream league.

Vegan-meat pioneer Beyond Meat (BYND) and Impossible Foods have both secured big deals with fast-food franchises such as McDonald's (MCD) and Burger King respectively.

Beyond Meat announced on Friday that it signed a three-year global contract with McDonald's and Yum! (YUM) brand companies including KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell — further cementing the future of plant-based meat in the sector.

“We will combine the power of Beyond Meat’s rapid and relentless approach to innovation with the strength of McDonald’s global brand to introduce craveable new plant-based menu items that consumers will love"" Ethan Brown founder and CEO of Beyond Meat said.

Plant-based options at fast-food chains hospitality venues and grocery stores have become increasingly more popular especially during the coronavirus pandemic which prompted people to focus more on their health.

Shopping trends are also changing in the UK. In 2020 there were more than £1bn in sales of plant-based foods with an estimated 13 million shoppers in the country opting for meat-free substitutes and alternative milk options.

In January 2021 nearly 600000 people had taken part in Veganuary which sees people give up animal products for one month. Despite the third national lockdown this was an increase of the 400000 or so people that took part in 2020.

Meanwhile FTSE 100 (^FTSE) firm Unilever has said that expanding its vegan business is a high priority the company's chief executive Alan Jope called plant-based alternatives an ""inexorable trend.""

Unilever (ULVR.L) which is behind brands such as Marmite and Hellman plans to capitalise on the shift by increasing sales of plant-based foods to €1bn ($1.2bn £867m) by 2027 — a five fold increase.

SEATTLE — Boeing's 737-9 MAX aircraft took center stage Monday when it began passenger flights for Alaska Airlines from Sea-Tac International Airport.

The airplane was re-certified for flight by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in November after being grounded in March 2019 following two crashes that killed a total of 346 people.

Alaska received the plane from Boeing in January and spent the last five weeks training pilots and other employees on its systems as well as taking the aircraft out for several hours of test flights.

""It's all part of a public relations campaign to instill confidence in the traveling public"" said aviation consultant Scott Hamilton. The goal is to make people feel safe flying on the 737 MAX and try to erase the negative stain the grounding put on Boeing's reputation.

After the aircraft was grounded federal investigators determined the cause of the fatal crashes was a faulty computer system that pushed the plane's nose downward in flight and couldn't be overridden by pilots.

""I think it will be a couple of years before you see statistically that people no longer have a fear about flying MAX"" said Hamilton. ""I think there will always be some but I think that as long as you don't have another accident that is tied to a design issue of the airplane I don't think you're going to have any real concern after a couple of years.""

Alaska Airlines will make daily roundtrip flights with the new 737-9 MAX between Seattle and San Diego and Seattle and Los Angeles according to information from the airline.

Alaska's second 737-9 MAX is expected to start service later in March.

These new aircraft will also be flown with sustainable aviation fuel to help reduce CO2 emissions which Hamilton said is appealing for the airline industry.

""That's especially important right now because of the pandemic"" said Hamilton ""if the airlines can reduce their operating costs by 15-16% that's huge... That’s something that will help Boeing to recover that it will help support the demand for the MAX"" continued Hamilton.

It's not just airlines and Boeing that have a lot riding on the success of the MAX -- it could also have an impact on the entire economy in Puget Sound.

""The success of the 737 MAX means jobs for Boeing and the Puget Sound right here in Renton"" explained Hamilton.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1ib2VpbmctNzY3LXByb2JsZW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Air Lines Has A Problem: The Boeing 767,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1ib2VpbmctNzY3LXByb2JsZW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hdXRvcy10cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi9ib2VpbmctY2VvLWFza2VkLXRlc3RpZnktY3Jhc2gtbGl0aWdhdGlvbi1sYXdtYWtlcnMtZGVtYW5kLWZhYS1yZWxlYXNlLXJlY29yZHMtMjAyMS0wMi0yNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing CEO asked to testify in crash litigation lawmakers demand FAA release records,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/boeing-ceo-asked-testify-crash-litigation-lawmakers-demand-faa-release-records-2021-02-26/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hdXRvcy10cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi9ib2VpbmctY2VvLWFza2VkLXRlc3RpZnktY3Jhc2gtbGl0aWdhdGlvbi1sYXdtYWtlcnMtZGVtYW5kLWZhYS1yZWxlYXNlLXJlY29yZHMtMjAyMS0wMi0yNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9mYWN0Y2hlY2svMjAyMS8wMi8yOC9mYWN0LWNoZWNrLWZhbHNlLWNsYWltLXBlbG9zaS10cmF2ZWxzLXdlZWtseS0yMDAtc2VhdC1wbGFuZS82ODYwMDQzMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fact check: False claim that Pelosi travels weekly on 200-seat Boeing airplane,"The claim: Pelosi travels weekly to California on a 200-seat Boeing that costs millions annually in fuel

For more than a decade social media users have claimed that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi travels to her home state of California every weekend on a 200-seat Boeing 757.

That claim has now resurfaced in a Feb. 21 Facebook post with over 2000 shares that reads ""Speaker Pelosi flys (sic) home to CA every week. She leaves on Friday & returns on Monday.""

The post goes on to claim that the Gulfstream assigned to her had to stop and refuel so she now uses a 200-seat Boeing 757.

""The fuel cost for this trip is $120000 per RT. That is $5760000 annually not including crew $"" the post reads.

One user shared a similar version of the claim in a Feb. 26 post that features an image of a large plane that reads ""See this plane. It's not Air Force One. This is QUEEN NANCY PELOSI'S JET.""

USA TODAY was unable to reach the users for comment.

Fact check: False claim declares there are ID requirements to enter Washington

Claims reportedly date back to 2007

The claim that Pelosi travels to California every weekend on an expensive Boeing 757 have been circulating on the internet since at least 2008 when it was first debunked by FactCheck.org.

The plane Pelosi used most often for travel between Washington and San Francisco on business was the C-20B a 12-seater based on the Gulfstream III. For any other trip she flew commercial.

Eric Sharman deputy chief of public affairs at Andrews Air Force Base and Pelosi's spokesman at the time both confirmed to FactCheck.org in 2008 that Pelosi used a C-32 a military version of a Boeing 757 one time when no other planes were available. The C-32 is able to make a nonstop flight across the country and includes 45 seats not 200.

Also known as Air Force Two the C-32 is primarily used by the first lady members of the Cabinet and Congress according to an Air Force fact sheet.

In 2007 then-House sergeant at arms Bill Livingood clarified that it was  and not Pelosi who had requested a large plane for the House speaker because of security reasons.

Livingood's statement was in response to accusations that followed reporting by The Washington Times that Pelosi had asked for a larger and more expensive plane than the one used by her predecessor former House Speaker Dennis Hastert CNN reported.

Pelosi seen flying commercial

Drew Hammill deputy chief of staff and spokesman for Pelosi told PolitiFact in 2020 that Pelosi had access to a 12-seat Gulfstream from 2007 to 2011 during her first stint as speaker; after that she began routinely flying commercial.

Hamill also recently confirmed to USA TODAY that claims that the House speaker travels on a 200-seat Boeing aircraft are false and have been for 13 years.

In July 2019 CNN national affairs correspondent Jeff Zeleny posted a photo on Twitter of Pelosi on a crowded Delta flight.

""For those wondering she's in coach"" he added.

With a few exceptions one hardly gets to see them flying anymore even at air shows the places where humans generally celebrate all things airborne. With so little interest in these old engineering marvels and despite the fact that airplanes in general are much more expensive than cars it’s no wonder biplanes sell for less than the price of a new Corvette.

Flying in a biplane the likes of the 1943 Boeing Stearman we have here must be much more exhilarating than driving a mid-engine Corvette down the strip however. After all this is a nearly eight decades old machine whose last inspection took place in 2014. Boeing ’s Stearman was introduced in 1934 the same year the Stearman Aircraft company became part of Boeing. It was used ever since its introduction as a military trainer being deployed in the service of the U.S. Air Force U.S. Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force.By the time it was retired the Boeing Stearman 75 family comprised close to 11000 members and that meant they spread far beyond the borders of the two North American countries reaching most of the nations in South America but also Iran Greece or Yugoslavia.Having trained pilots during the war the Stearmans got released into the civilian wild once hostilities ended and were relegated mostly to crop-dusting duties.We don’t have the operational history of this particular biplane. It is one of the A75N1 variety (PT-17) the kind that was originally fitted with blind-flying instrumentation and later agricultural spraying equipment.Total time since new on this particular one is 2290 hours and according to the seller on Platinum Fighters  some paint and fabric might be needed here and there. As said the asking price for this one is lower than for a Corvette $50000 but no mention of its airworthiness is made."

This isn't the usual private equity playbook.

Tripadvisor acknowledges that it is building its new subscription program Tripadvisor Plus with wholesale rates from “aggregators” — that it refuses to identify — covering 100000 hotels. Skift has learned however that most of these hotel discounts and perks are coming from an unconventional source — travel agency brands within private equity firm Certares’ portfolio.

Travel agencies within Certares’ wide array of travel holdings are providing Tripadvisor with the bulk of the wholesale hotel inventory according to a source close to Tripadvisor.

That’s a twist on standard industry practice on several fronts. Hotels regularly give wholesale rates to traditional travel agencies including discounts and perks and not with the expectation that these traditional travel agencies will pass the inventory along to online travel companies for use in standalone hotel sales. One would have also thought that Tripadvisor would turn to bed banks to scale its wholesale program and not offline travel agencies.

In addition it is atypical in travel for a private equity firm to share its assets in the way Certares is doing it.

Tripadvisor’s sales force has also started to sign direct contracts with hotels for wholesale inventory.

The source close to Tripadvisor did not identify which Certares-affiliated brands are providing the inventory. But Certares owns Internova Travel Group formerly called Travel Leaders which counts travel agency brands within its ranks such as Tzell Travel Group Altour Protravel International and more than a dozen more for example.

Certares also is a leading shareholder and joint venture partner with American Express in American Express Global Business Travel which acquired Ovation Travel Group in January. It also has airline and cruise investments.

Tripadvisor could also be working with other travel agencies which commonly strike deals with wholesalers and hotels for net rates and amenities.

Tripadvisor spokesman Brian Hoyt didn’t comment about whether travel agencies were providing the company with wholesale inventory but said: “We’ve been public that we’ve engaged aggregators and hotels directly to help us scale quickly and test an offering like Tripadvisor Plus. Both groups will continue to have a role in the future of this membership subscription service as they seek to engage high value travelers bookings vacations.”

Tripadvisor Plus is currently available on desktop and mobile Web to a limited number of users. It isn’t yet included in Tripadvisor’s app.

Hotelbeds the largest global bedbank provider of wholesale rates is not apparently working with Tripadvisor at this point. Hotelbeds didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment and a spokesman for another leading bed bank Webbeds said: “We don’t make public comment on who we work with except in some unique circumstances.”

A source at a private equity firm — not at Certares — said it is “atypical” for a private equity firm to leverage its holdings the way Certares is doing with Tripadvisor although it could have significant upside for Certares’ various holdings.

In March Certares purchased $325 million of preferred stock in Tripadvisor’s parent company Liberty Tripadvisor and became a strategic investor. Certares founder Greg O’Hara became vice chair of Liberty Tripadvisor and a Tripadvisor board member.

Wholesale Controversy

Tripadvisor’s use of wholesale inventory to pass along discounts and perks to travelers for hotel stays and experiences could prove controversial. Wholesalers traditionally provide online travel agencies with deeply discounted rates that are used on an opaque basis because they are supposed to be assembled in vacation packages. In that way the hotelier isn’t revealing that the room it is offering on its website for $300 per night is actually being sold elsewhere for $150.

Tripadvisor though is not using the wholesale inventory in packages but in standalone hotel bookings.

One Tripadvisor rival believes that Tripadvisor’s use of wholesale rates for its subscription program will add confusion to the already wild world of wholesale rates which often show up without authorization on metasearch sites.

The Tripadvisor competitor believes that Tripadvisor Plus’ use of wholesale rates will be unsustainable.

The source close to Tripadvisor rebuffed that type of thinking saying the rates will be offered behind a subscription paywall and they will not be “advertised.” Advertised in this sense broadly speaking the source close to Tripadvisor said means that Web scrapers will not be able to access these wholesale rates on Tripadvisor.

Luxury Play?

The company touts Tripadvisor Plus which is in beta and sells for a $99 annual subscription as offering discounts on unlimited bookings and perks at 100000 hotels. Many of the Tripadvisor Plus offerings will be for longer stays and that’s why Tripadvisor can claim that subscribers will be saving at least $200 per booking.

But it is the perk side of the equation in luxury hotels that could become a sweet spot for the program the source close to Tripadvisor said.

There are numerous types of travel agency wholesale programs that Tripadvisor may be working with. In one type of program for example travel agencies and consortia — or agency groups — have private commissionable rates that they offer to their customers.

“Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts or Virtuoso or Signature all have these at select super-upscale hotels” said a former hotelier. “They offer their clients usually an upgrade free breakfast and/or other amenities and are generally priced at parity with their website but they throw in goodies for these key agency partners. The agency receives the same 10% commission after the stay (sometimes more sometimes less) and there is often an override or other kicker paid to the consortia.”

The source close to Tripadvisor said ultimately cruise and car rentals may be more scalable for Tripadvisor Plus than hotels. If it’s peak season in Paris there aren’t an infinite number of upgrades that the program could provide to program members the source close to Tripadvisor said.

Why would hotels want to join Tripadvisor Plus? Tripadvisor is telling them that in exchange for providing discounts and perks to Tripadvisor the company will offer them preferred placement on Tripadvisor and bookings at zero or greatly reduced commission. The bookings would take place on Tripadvisor but the hotels would service them.

Tripadvisor if everything works out would forego its usual commissions and make its money on the subscription revenue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlaW5kdXN0cnluZXdzLmNvbS9jcnVpc2UtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAyL3ByaWNpbmctaXMtdXAtYXQtbm9yd2VnaWFuLWNydWlzZS1saW5lLWhvbGRpbmdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pricing Is Up at Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,"Demand is strong world cruises are selling out in a day and pricing is up for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings’ trio of cruise brands in Norwegian Regent and Oceania.

“And while still early in the booking cycle we are very encouraged and very pleased by the strong booking activity driven by pent up demand across all three brands for 2022 voyages. Volumes during January and February sequentially improved by over 40 percent from November and December 2020 and as an added bonus over 80 percent of these bookings where new cash bookings” said Frank Del Rio president and CEO speaking on the company’s fourth quarter and year-ending earnings call.

Del Rio stressed that pricing continues to be in line with pre-pandemic levels.

“For the first half of 2022 and for all of 2022 in fact our load factor is currently well ahead of pre-pandemic levels with pricing at each of our award-winning brands inline to up mid single digits when excluding the dilutive impact of future cruise certificates” he continued.

“Consumer appetite for global travel abode our 28 ships but 28 vessels is so strong that even with limited marketing investments we are yielding outside results and we are experiencing record demand with our launches for our future itinerary and global voyage collections” he said.

Later in the call Del Rio said that the ability to fill company ships at strong pricing was not among his concerns.

“And to be able to do what we’re doing in terms of the load factors and new bookings new cash bookings with the (minimal) amount of marketing that we’re doing with the travel agency system being less than 100 percent is truly remarkable. And again points to what we’ve been saying for years the resiliency of the consumer the resiliency of those who love to cruise. It’s a great value that hasn’t changed. And people are eager to get back to the high seas. There’s no question about that.”",,,,,,,,,

And not in a good way.

That’s how “Fringe” and “Almost Human” veteran J.H. Wyman is positioning it anyway. He’s now the creator and executive producer of “Debris” an NBC sci-fi series that premieres Monday making fallen pieces of an alien spaceship threats to physics … thus causing people to start falling too. Two dissimilar agents played by Jonathan Tucker (“Westworld” “City on a Hill”) and Riann Steele (“The Magicians” “Lovesick”) are dispatched to collaborate and gather the debris — though how it will be handled afterward and to what end is figuratively up in the air. Two-time Tony Award winner Norbert Leo Butz also stars.

“We’re going to put something out there that’s going to make a difference to people and (make them) say ‘There’s something different about the show’ ” Wyman said. “It speaks to things that I think aren’t really out there right now. There’s a hope and a concept that maybe there’s something out there that we don’t know and that is something that I think is intriguing enough. And all I can ask for is people to sample it and kind of understand it.”

Actor Tucker explains that “week to week a new piece of debris is discovered. And it allows us to discover the unique capabilities that this debris has to offer how it affects people how it affects the world and ultimately how it affects (the characters) and their own relationship. It’s fun for us as actors for sure but I think it will be fun for audiences to see … and it speaks to the kind of cable-level sci-fi that we’ve become accustomed to. You can have a case of the week but you can also have meaningful character development and mythological rollout over the course of this first season at least.”

Fellow “Debris” star Steele adds that there is a realism alongside the fantasy of the show: “You’re meeting two characters who are very flawed and very broken and we get to see them along the season kind of understand each other through the debris.”

However “Debris” is received generally Wyman believes it is meeting his own criteria for what he wanted to do with it. “To me the best sci-fi is more about the human condition that it talks about” he reasoned. “There’s a lot of people out there that do the ‘little green men’ thing better than me. I’m more (about) with the sci-fi genre what does it look like when there are questions asked that really shine a light on the human condition? I just always find that fascinating.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vdGZpcG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi91dHRhci1wcmFkZXNoLWJlYXRzLXRhbWlsLW5hZHUta2FybmF0YWthLWFuZC1ndWphcmF0LXRvLWJlY29tZS10aGUtc2Vjb25kLWJpZ2dlc3QtZWNvbm9teS1pbi1pbmRpYS_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly90Zmlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyL3V0dGFyLXByYWRlc2gtYmVhdHMtdGFtaWwtbmFkdS1rYXJuYXRha2EtYW5kLWd1amFyYXQtdG8tYmVjb21lLXRoZS1zZWNvbmQtYmlnZ2VzdC1lY29ub215LWluLWluZGlhL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uttar Pradesh beats Tamil Nadu Karnataka and Gujarat to become the second biggest economy in India,"Uttar Pradesh the state once infamous for lawlessness has become a bright spot for the economy of the country in the last few years. In the last fiscal year Uttar Pradesh overtook Tamil Nadu Gujarat and Maharashtra to become the second-largest state of the country in terms of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP).

As per the data from Finance Department UP’s GSDP for the FY 21 was Rs 19.48 lakh crore more than Tamil Nadu’s Rs 19.2 lakh crore Karnataka’s Rs 18.03 lakh crore and Gujarat’s Rs 17.4 lakh crore.

वैश्विक महामारी कोरोना जनित आर्थिक मंदी के उपरांत भी उत्तर प्रदेश सकल राज्य घरेलू उत्पाद (GSDP) के मामले में भारत का दूसरा सबसे बड़ा राज्य बन गया है। यह आदरणीय प्रधानमंत्री जी के कुशल मार्गदर्शन एवं समस्त प्रदेशवासियों के परिश्रम का सुफल है। सभी को हार्दिक बधाई। — Yogi Adityanath (मोदी का परिवार) (@myogiadityanath) February 26 2021

Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath said that the state has achieved this despite the Coronavirus pandemic under the guidance of the Prime Minister. Uttar Pradesh performed really well in managing the Coronavirus-induced pandemic and has emerged as a favourite destination for national as well as international investors.

“Our state has been making rapid strides in industry and economy under the able leadership of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath who has ensured an industry-friendly eco-system in the state as a result of which UP had achieved the second position among all states in ease of doing business in a short span” said MSME and export promotion minister Sidharth Nath Singh.

Yogi Adityanath has run the state like an efficient administrator in the last four years and has improved the law and order condition leading to a conducive environment for investment.

On the occasion of half-term completion of the Yogi Government the government expressed that it has created 20 lakh private and 2.5 lakh government jobs in a span of the last 2 and a half years and the other half will be dedicated to achieving the $1 trillion economy goal. UP now aims to compete with Maharashtra– the most productive state in the country to become the $1 trillion economy by 2025.

After the Coronavirus outbreak in China and its mishandling of the crisis leading to a pandemic many countries are looking to move manufacturing units away from China. In fact many countries that are arch-enemies of China but have manufacturing units in China like Japan are incentivizing companies to move out and this presents a golden opportunity to India especially the industrially backward states like UP Bihar where labour cost is extremely low.

UP has the existing capacity to replace China as the ‘factory of the world’ with a population of 22 crores and young demography. With the outbreak of Coronavirus and the anger towards China the companies of developed nations that have manufacturing units in China are looking for other avenues.

The UP government has shown the most proactive approach in the last few weeks to attract these companies and this has resulted in ongoing talks with many foreign companies over shifting manufacturing units to the state some of which have already pledged investment.

South Korean electronics majors agreed to set up manufacturing units in Uttar Pradesh and state officials held a webinar with 100 US firms like Adobe Boston Scientific and UPS to shift their units from Shanghai to Noida which is already a known popular IT hub.

German footwear brand Von Wellx has decided to move its factory operations from China to Agra Uttar Pradesh. The company has more than 10 crore customers in more than 80 countries.

UP is one of the most efficiently administered parts of the country and the ‘rule of law’ prevails in the state. Therefore the industrialists have no qualms about over-investing in the state which is not just being governed efficiently but the government is also providing various incentives for investment.

The Yogi government has been proactive in dealing with the Coronavirus threat and has already set up committees to assess the financial and social impact of lockdown on 11 sectors – industry construction revenue labour education agriculture social welfare rural development urban affairs water and handicapped welfare.

Yogi must be applauded for transforming the state from a nightmare for industrialists to heaven for law-abiding companies. And the results are already evident with the state overtaking the nearest rivals like TamilNadu Karnataka and Gujarat to become the second-largest economy of the country.",,,

On May 17 1954 the nine justices unanimously ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that schools segregated by race did not provide an equal education. Students could no longer be barred from a school because of the color of their skin. To commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Brown decision I wanted to look at how far we’ve come in integrating our schools and how far we still have to go.

Two sociologists Sean Reardon at Stanford University and Ann Owens at the University of Southern California have teamed up to analyze both historical and recent trends. Reardon and Owens were slated to present their analysis at a Stanford University conference on May 6 and they shared their presentation with me in advance. They also expect to launch a new website to display segregation trends for individual school districts around the country.

Here are five takeaways from their work:

The long view shows progress but a worrying uptick especially in big cities

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

Not much changed for almost 15 years after the Brown decision. Although Black students had the right to attend another school the onus was on their families to demand a seat and figure out how to get their child to the school. Many schools remained entirely Black or entirely white.

Desegregation began in earnest in 1968 with a series of court orders beginning with Virginia’s New Kent County schools. That year the Supreme Court required the county to abolish its separate Black and white schools and students were reassigned to different schools to integrate them.

This graph above produced by Reardon and Owens shows how segregation plummeted across the country between 1968 and 1973. The researchers focused on roughly 500 larger school districts where there were at least 2500 Black students. That captures nearly two-thirds of all Black students in the nation and avoids clouding the analysis with thousands of small districts of mostly white residents.

Reardon’s and Owens’s measurement of segregation compares classmates of the average white student with the classmates of the average Black student. For example in North Carolina’s Charlotte-Mecklenburg district the average white student in 1968 attended a school where 90 percent of his peers were white and only 10 percent were Black. The average Black student attended a school where 76 percent of his peers were Black and 24 percent were white. Reardon and Owens then calculated the gap in exposure to each race. White students had 90 percent white classmates while Black students had 24 percent white classmates. The difference was 66 percentage points. On the flip side Black students had 76 percent Black classmates while white students had 10 percent Black classmates. Again the difference was 66 percentage points which translates to 0.66 on the segregation index.

But in 1973 after court-ordered desegregation went into effect the average white student attended a school that was 69 percent white and 31 percent Black. The average Black student attended a school that was 34 percent Black and 66 percent white. In five short years the racial exposure gap fell from 66 percentage points to 3 percentage points. Schools reflected Charlotte-Mecklenberg’s demographics. In the graph above Reardon and Owens averaged the segregation index figures for all 533 districts with substantial Black populations. That’s what each dot represents.

In the early 1990s this measure of segregation began to creep up again as depicted by the red tail in the graph above. Owens calls it a “slow and steady uptick” in contrast to the drastic decline in segregation after 1968. Segregation has not bounced back or returned to pre-Brown levels. “There’s a misconception that segregation is worse than ever” Reardon said.

Although the red line from 1990 to the present looks nearly flat when you zoom in on it you can see that Black-white segregation grew by 25 percent between 1991 and 2019. During the pandemic segregation declined slightly again.

Detailed view of the red line segment in the chart above “Average White-Black Segregation 1968-2022.” Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

It’s important to emphasize that these Black-white segregation levels are tiny compared with the degree of segregation in the late 1960s. A 25 percent increase can seem like a lot but it’s less than 4 percentage points.

“It’s big enough that it makes me worried” said Owens. “Now is the moment to keep an eye on this. If it continues in this direction it would take a long time to get back up to Brown. But let’s not let it keep going up.”

Even more troubling is the fact that segregation increased substantially if you zero in on the nation’s biggest cities. White-Black segregation in the largest 100 school districts increased by 64 percent from 1988 to 2019 Owens and Reardon calculated.

School choice plays a role in recent segregation

Why is segregation creeping back up again?

The expiration of court orders that mandated school integration and the expansion of school choice policies including the rapid growth of charter schools explains all of the increase in segregation from 2000 onward said Reardon. Over 200 medium-sized and large districts were released from desegregation court orders from 1991 to 2009 and racial school segregation in these districts gradually increased in the years afterward.

School choice however appears to be the dominant force. More than half of the increase in segregation in the 2000s can be attributed to the rise of charter schools whose numbers began to increase rapidly in the late 1990s. In many cases either white or Black families flocked to different charter schools leaving behind a less diverse student body in traditional public schools.

The reason for the rise in segregation in the 1990s before the number of charter schools soared is harder to understand. Owens speculates that other school choice policies such as the option to attend any public school within a district or the creation of new magnet schools may have played a role but she doesn’t have the data to prove that. White gentrification of cities in the 1990s could also be a factor she said as the white newcomers favored a small set of schools or sent their children to private schools.

“We might just be catching a moment where there’s been an influx of one group before the other group leaves” said Owens. “It’s hard to say how the numbers will look 10 years from now.”

It’s important to disentangle demographic shifts from segregation increases

There’s a popular narrative that segregation has increased because Black students are more likely to attend school with other students who are not white especially Hispanic students. But Reardon and Owens say this analysis conflates demographic shifts in the U.S. population with segregation. The share of Hispanic students in U.S. schools now approaches 30 percent and everyone is attending schools with more Hispanic classmates. White students who used to represent 85 percent of the U.S. student population in 1970 now make up less than half.

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

The blue line in the graph above shows how the classmates of the average Black Hispanic or Native American student have increased from about 55 percent Black Hispanic and Native American students in the early 1970s to nearly 80 percent Black Hispanic and Native American students today. That means that the average student who is not white is attending a school that is overwhelmingly made up of students who are not white.

But look at how the red line which depicts white students is following the same path. The average white student is attending a school that moved from 35 percent students who are not white in the 1970s to nearly 70 percent students who are not white today. “It’s entirely driven by Hispanic students” said Owens. “Even the ‘white’ schools in L.A. are 40 percent Hispanic.”

I dug into U.S. Department of Education data to show how extremely segregated schools have become less common. The percentage of Black students attending a school that is 90 percent or more Black fell from 23 percent in 2000 to 10 percent in 2022. Only 1 in 10 Black students attends an all-Black or a nearly all-Black school. Meanwhile the percentage of white students attending a school that is 90 percent or more white fell from 44 percent to 14 percent during this same time period. That’s 1 in 7. Far fewer Black or white students are learning in schools that are almost entirely made up of students of their same race.

At the same time the percentage of Black students attending a school where 90 percent of students are not white grew from 37 percent in 2000 to 40 percent in 2022. But notice the sharp growth of Hispanic students during this period. They went from 7.6 million (fewer than the number of Black students) to more than 13.9 million (almost double the number of Black students).

Most segregation falls across school district boundaries

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

This bar chart shows how schools are segregated for two reasons. One is that people of different races live on opposite sides of school district lines. Detroit is an extreme example. The city schools are dominated by Black students. Meanwhile the Detroit suburbs which operate independent school systems are dominated by white students. Almost all the segregation is because people of different races live in different districts. Meanwhile in the Charlotte North Carolina metropolitan area over half of the segregation reflects the uneven distribution of students within school districts.

Nationally 60 percent of the segregation occurs because of the Detroit scenario: people live across administrative borders Reardon and Owens calculated. Still 40 percent of current segregation is within administrative borders that policymakers can control.

Residential segregation is decreasing

People often say there’s little that can be done about school segregation until we integrate neighborhoods. I was surprised to learn that residential segregation has been declining over the past 30 years according to Reardon’s and Owens’s analysis of census tracts. More Black and white people live in proximity to each other. And yet at the same time school segregation is getting worse.

All this matters Reardon said because kids are learning at different rates in more segregated systems. “We know that more integrated schools provide more equal educational opportunities” he said. “The things we’re doing with our school systems are making segregation worse.”

Reardon recommends more reforms to housing policy to integrate neighborhoods and more “guard rails” on school choice systems so that they cannot be allowed to produce highly segregated schools.

Brown Dish on This Is Us Podcast (Exclusive),"Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown and Chris Sullivan are teaming up to launch a This Is Us rewatch podcast titled That Was Us.

PEOPLE has an exclusive look at the podcast's new trailer which teases what fans can expect when That Was Us officially makes its debut on Tuesday May 14.

Moore Brown and Sullivan also chatted with PEOPLE to discuss what they're most excited about what episodes they're feeling a bit anxious to revisit and why the NBC show's impact remains years later.

Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown and Chris Sullivan are ready to get in touch with their Pearson and Pittsburgh roots!

The trio is just one week away from launching their This Is Us rewatch podcast aptly titled That Was Us — and Moore Brown and Sullivan tell PEOPLE they can't contain their excitement!

""I’m very much looking forward to a Pearson family reunion"" says Moore 40 noting that they're ""excited to get everybody in the studio with us.""

""I don’t think any one of us was ready for the show to end"" continues the actress who played matriarch Rebecca Pearson. ""This show will forever hold a special place in my heart and I think a lot of people feel the same way.""

Brown who played Randall Pearson says he was in London promoting his film American Fiction when he realized the widespread impact of This Is Us.

""I realized that folks over there were kinda just discovering the show and it was moving them the same way folks in America were moved when we were on the air"" he recalls. ""And I just realized whenever folks come to it wherever they’re from they are impacted. And it made me want to revisit it again.""

Sullivan who played Toby Damon adds: ""We missed each other! Nobody was ready for the show to end when it did even though it was wrapped up to perfection. And fans were telling us that they had started rewatching and so we figured why not watch along with them? I’m excited to see everybody again and share in our love for the show.""

This Is Us aired on NBC from Sept. 2016 to May 2022. The family drama centered on the lives of siblings Kevin (Justin Hartley) Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Randall (Brown) and their parents Rebecca (Moore) and Jack (Milo Ventimiglia). The series used multiple timelines showing stories that took place in the present as well as flashbacks to the siblings’ childhood and flash-forwards to later years.

The NBC drama earned numerous accolades throughout its run. It received 39 Emmy nominations winning four. Additionally it also received the Television Academy Honors Award in 2017.

The trio tells PEOPLE they've already recorded episodes with show creator Dan Fogelman as well as Susan Kelechi Watson who played Randall's wife Beth Pearson. They also have plans to welcome Hartley and Jon Huertas (Miguel Rivas) as guests on the podcast.

The podcast — which PEOPLE can exclusively debut its new trailer — will also feature an emotional support hotline for fans to call and share their thoughts about the show and its impact.

Brown 48 says knowing how much the show has meant to people and continues to resonate is ""incredibly gratifying.""

""While the show was incredibly timely when it was on the air it also has a certain sense of timelessness. So whenever folks come to it it can’t help but move you"" he says.

Sullivan 43 echoes his costar noting ""The themes of this show are eternal and they are presented in a way that allows the audience to explore these subjects within themselves and gives them the context to discuss these topics with the people they love. The show is about connection providing its audience with the opportunity to connect.""

Moore who has since welcomed two little boys of her own says she's particularly excited to now rewatch the series from a mother's perspective.

""It’s been such a thrill to rewatch this series. The cast and the writers are just so incredibly talented that each episode has copious amounts of takeaways"" she explains. ""There’s obviously a lot of excitement in reigniting conversations that meant a lot to fans as well as excitement in reuniting and reminiscing.""

""But what I’m seeing as we rewatch is that my viewing perspective has shifted and it’s like watching it all unfold for the first time"" she notes. ""It’s been eight years since This Is Us premiered and I’ve lived a lot of life since then. I’m now a mom with two little boys and so I’m excited to rewatch all the episodes and rediscover the stories from a new perspective.""

Another special moment for the cast has been revisiting episodes of their costars who are no longer alive and honoring their legacy. (Ron Cephas Jones who played Randall's biological father William Hill died in August 2023 at age 66.)

""We try to honor Ron at every turn. Rewatching his performance is an education on acting and humanity. He is one of the most self-realized people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing"" says Sullivan.

""Oh boy it’s gonna hit hard! I can’t tell you exactly how I’ll react but it’ll be powerful. It was powerful shooting it and powerful watching it the first time"" adds Brown. ""I don’t anticipate it being any different.""

Ultimately the cast is just looking forward to fans finally being able to hear their new project and reigniting the bond they had for so long during the NBC hit's six-season run.

""It’s human nature for us as a society to seek connection and This Is Us connects people all around the world with the storylines themes and topics that are presented in every episode"" says Moore. ""Fans continue to watch and rewatch sharing what This Is Us means to them how it helped them navigate life differently not feel alone and even heal from trauma. Revisiting the Pearson’s stories can help us all do a bit of collective healing I think.""

The Sister Wives star took to her Instagram Stories on Sunday to share a snapshot of her special day.

She first posted a photo of her outdoor gardening area in North Carolina where she spends part of her time when she's not in Flagstaff Arizona.

""The NC garden adventure begins (technically I'm at the last part of planing seasons but that's life lol)"" Janelle wrote.

After reposting several birthday messages from friends and family Janelle also shared a photo of herself grinning as she sat in front of what appears to be a homemade German chocolate cake.

""A little red faced from working in the garden"" the TLC star wrote noting that the cake -- which her daughter Madison Brush made -- was mouth watering.

On Monday Janelle shared a video of herself with her new garden and planters boxes writing ""I'll be spending a lot of the summer in NC with Maddie Caleb and the kids so Maddie and I have made big plans for a garden. I am looking forward to learning how to grow veggies in a climate that has such a long season and way more moisture than I'm used to.""

It's been a challenging few months for Janelle whose son Garrison Brown died of suicide in March at the age of 25. Garrison was one of Janelle and her ex Kody Brown's six biological children.

Last month Janelle took to Instagram to honor what would have been Garrison's 26th birthday with a touching tribute video.

""Happy Birthday Sweetheart"" she wrote at the time. ""We are missing you terribly today. It’s hard to believe you aren’t here anymore.""

The Brown family has been estranged in recent years in the wake of Christine Janelle and Meri Brown's splits from Kody. Kody's relationship with his only remaining wife Robyn Brown and his presumed favoritism toward her has also caused friction between the former polygamist and his older children.

This was thoroughly documented on Sister Wives particularly his fractured relationship with his sons Garrison and Gabriel.

ET spoke with Janelle and Christine in November 2023 about Kody's estrangement from some of his family members. Janelle said that Kody wanted to have a better relationship with his kids.

""I think that's probably the goal right? He will eventually figure out how to have a relationship with his children. I mean I hope it will over time"" she told ET at the time.

But it didn’t take Brown too long after forcing his way off the team in 2019 to start thinking differently. Even in February 2020 he already acknowledged he didn’t realize how good he had it. He discussed Roethlisberger among many topics in a recent interview with Jason Whitlock.

“Ben Roethlisberger is the best quarterback I ever played with as far as the skill level and the skill set and the intangibles of what we was able to do” Brown told Whitlock. “Like sometimes I did some stuff and Ben just he already knew what I was gonna do and he just threw the ball and laughed because he knew”.

Of course Roethlisberger and Brown had nine years to forge a connection. He never had anywhere near that length of time to build the nuances with Tom Brady that he had elsewhere. But Roethlisberger is a Hall of Fame quarterback in his own right and the numbers with Brown speak for themselves. What’s notable however is that Brown also spoke glowingly about his off-field relationship with Roethlisberger.

“We had Big Ben house playing basketball cookouts in the pool” he noted going back to his rookie season. Brown also referenced the many workouts Roethlisberger organized at Georgia University. Recalling that Roethlisberger was under great scrutiny in 2010 during Brown’s rookie season he recalled his rare relationship he built. “I was one of those players that was able to get open with him” he said.

Brown also referenced a wide variety of experiences he and Roethlisberger shared including flights on the quarterback’s private jet. This is a very different tone than the one he took while attempting to orchestrate a trade. He painted a picture of a soulless organization that didn’t care about him as a person. Today’s equivalent I suppose is unfollowing your team on social media.

Roethlisberger’s relationship with Brown though is unquestionably on the field and Brown understands what that means in terms of his legacy. “Ben is one of my best teammates. That’s one of the quarterbacks and one of the teammates I had the most fun [with] and being able to have the most success of becoming who I was because of him” he said.

But more than that he seems to regret the deterioration of the relationship they had off the field. He admits that in hindsight perhaps he “should have opened up and expressed more” during his schism from the team. Brown said that Roethlisberger is the last person he spoke to before the trade. Roethlisberger offered him very thoughtful advice he suggested.

“Big Ben was always a bright spot for me at the Steelers and somebody that always uplifted me and was there for me as a big brother” Brown said of Roethlisberger. One wonders what kind of presence he has influencing his life today. I’m sure he would like to redo many things over the past five years but life doesn’t work that way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmFuZHNwYWNlZm9yY2VzLmNvbS9icm93bi1kb2N0cmluZS1jaGFuZ2VzLWhlbHBlZC11c2FmLXJlc3BvbmQtdG8taXJhbnMtc3RyaWtlcy1vbi1pc3JhZWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brown: Doctrine Changes Helped USAF Respond to Iran’s Strikes on Israel,"Share Article

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. still “believes” in his mantra of “Accelerate Change or Lose”—and indicated the doctrinal changes it produced when he was Air Force Chief of Staff played a role in the service’s recent response to Iran’s aerial assault on Israel he said May 7.

Speaking at the Ash Carter Exchange conference in Washington D.C. Brown said he recently spoke with U.S. Airmen who helped respond to Iran’s attack on April 13. U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles and F-16 Fighting Falcons shot down dozens of Iranian drones as they were heading toward targets in Israel. While Iran launched more than 100 ballistic missiles 30 land-attack cruise missiles and 150 drones U.S. Israel and coalition forces intercepted “99 percent” of them U.S. and Israeli officials have said.

“Just amazing work by a very talented group of young people and older people as well” Brown said.

Brown said during his talk with the Airmen “We talked about mission command and how they used parts of our doctrine that we changed back in April of 2021.”

Early on in his tenure as CSAF Brown released Air Force Doctrine Publication 1 or AFDP-1 distilling two volumes of airpower doctrine down to 20 pages. As part of that publication the Air Force said mission command “empowers subordinate decision-making for flexibility initiative and responsiveness in the accomplishment of commander’s intent.”

It was an idea Brown repeatedly returned during his time as Chief imploring Airmen to take action without formal approval from commanders instead acting based on what they believed their commanders’ intent to be. In 2023 the service released another Air Force doctrine publication devoted entirely to the subject dubbed AFDP 1-1.

“While this publication will help build a common understanding of mission command across the force the culture of mission command doesn’t happen just because it is written in our doctrine” Brown wrote at the time. “I believe building confidence in mission command for both leaders and Airmen requires daily execution in simple scenarios ahead of a complex challenge in conflict.”

By trying to accelerate the process of change then Brown added May 7 he hoped he had “broke the inertia to get the momentum going and move things forward.” Helping that push is new CSAF Gen. David W. Allvin who served as Brown’s vice chief whose manta is to “follow through.”

“There’s some things we moved forward and I’m very fortunate but the person who succeeded me was my Vice Chief of Staff” Brown said.

Iran’s attack on Israel “puts the region a little bit more on edge” Brown said and the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza continues to create tension across the Middle East. But the situation has improved for U.S. forces that faced an onslaught of dozens of strikes from Iranian-backed militias.

“We’ve been able to defend ourselves we’ve been able to strike at a time a place of our choosing” Brown said. “I think we sent back in February a pretty strong message. It’s been 90 days since the last time our forces have been attacked. We take force protection very seriously.”

The response in February included dozens of airstrikes against Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force and Iranian-aligned groups in Iraq and Syria in retaliation after a drone strike killed three American service members in Jordan."

Tony Davich’s voice carried over the great distance filling all of Allegiant Stadium.

“I’ve got two tickets to paradise!” the Santa Fe &The Fat City Horns singer called out. “Won’t you back your bags we’ll leave tonight!”

It was paradise but no tickets Sunday at the Las Vegas Raiders’ home facility. Nonetheless Santa Fe performed the first show ever at Allegiant Stadium months before Garth Brooks’ formal sold-out lid-lifter on July 10. The band called out after the show “We are the first!”

Forget that there were more players onstage and in the band’s support team than watching from the stands. One of those spectators was the lord of this manor Raiders owner Mark Davis keeping a keen eye and ear on the performance.

“I’m very impressed” said Davis who watched and listened from several vantage points in the stadium including the end zone opposite the band’s stage under the stadium’s peristyle and the Al Davis Memorial Torch. “When I was listening I almost had tears in my eyes. Everything is looking great it’s working great but you never know until you actually have a band playing.”

Davis became aware of Santa Fe and its sterling reputation during one of his visits to Bootlegger Bistro which is a few cartwheels from the Copa Room Santa Fe’s home venue for its Monday night shows. But the team owner and Vegas scenester had not seen the band live until Sunday.

Suffice to say the owner’s interest in the Vegas institution runs a bit deeper than a one-off showcase. The Raiders are looking for a house band to play the eight home games (not including preseason or playoffs) for the upcoming season. Raiders fans of a bygone era remember Del Courtney’s band playing at Frank Youell Field beginning in 1963 and later the Oakland Coliseum.

“We are looking at options for something like that — a house band to play before and after the game and during commercial breaks” Davis said. “Something like what Paul Shaffer’s band was with David Letterman.”

Of the performance Davis couched his enthusiasm saying “I’m very impressed it’s still a process to figure it out.”

Davis beamed through the showcase as Santa Fe tore through many of their fan favorites over the years including its Earth Wind & Fire medley and “Rosanna” by Toto. Raiders officials asked the band to stray off-script too with the ZZ Top cover of “Viva Las Vegas” sliding into “Enter Sandman” by Metallica. Santa Fe also took a run at the Raiders theme “The Autumn Wind.”

Band leader Jerry Lopez said afterward “For us we hit a home run. It was fun to play Earth Wind & Fire and Metallica in a really beautiful facility.”

Regardless of where it all leads the Raiders have found a bonafide Las Vegas act whose history dates more than 45 years.

The band has for decades referred to their shows as “The Healing.” The promise has been you walk out feeling better than when you walked in. Lopez christened the gigs with that name as he was about to take the stage one night at Palace Station. He’d had a horrible day and said “’You know what? Let the healing begin.’ The band started playing and all the pain was gone.”

The title has stuck over myriad Vegas venues.

Santa Fe started their Vegas run as the wide-eyed backing band for topless dancers at the old Thunderbird hotel-casino on the north side of the Strip. The band’s first casino headliner gig was at the Mint in 1975. Lopez was just 17 years old and the full horn section was 20 years in the offing.

The band crisscrossed the valley through Nero’s Nook and Cleopatra’s Barge at Caesars Palace the lounge (and later showroom) at Tropicana the since-closed lounge at Palace Station The Lounge at the Palms Club Madrid at Sunset Station the South Point Showroom and Myron’s Cabaret Jazz at the Smith Center.

About six years ago the band recorded live performances for Royal Caribbean International and appeared on the cruise line’s virtual concert series. That company too has bought into “The Healing.”

Lopez’s most prominent international affiliation has been as guitarist on Ricky Martin’s “Livin’ la Vida Loca” 1999-2000 world tour.

Many band members have either attended the UNLV Jazz Studies program or have taught music at the university. The entire lineup was inducted into the UNLV College of Fine Arts Hall of Fame in 2019. The musicians have effectively created a path from the university to Vegas lounges — all the way to a Las Vegas Strip superstar residency production.

One night in January 2019 Lady Gaga’s friend and bandleader Brian Newman caught the band at the Copa Room. The next day he emailed contract offers to the whole horn section to play Gaga’s “Jazz + Piano” production.

Four months later leading to his “After Dark” debut at NoMad Restaurant Newman said “I’d already known about the Santa Fe boys when we came in to Las Vegas. I got here a few days early to meet with them not really as an audition but to be around them and see how tight they were together.”

Over the years Chicago; Earth Wind & Fire; James Taylor’s backing players (notably sax great “Blue Lou” Marini in July 2019); Tower of Power; and Elton John’s and Gwen Stefani’s bands have hit Santa Fe’s shows. Kenny Loggins and Christopher Cross have made unbilled appearances too in the days the band played The Lounge at the Palms.

None of those places rival the spectacle that is Allegiant Stadium of course.

On Friday the 24-year-old model posted a series of photos on her Instagram page showing her hooked up to an IV. ""Living with a few chronic autoimmune disease = always finding time for my IVs"" she captioned the photos.

Hadid was diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2012 alongside her younger brother Anwar 21 and their mom Yolanda 57.

In 2016 when Bella was 20 the star opened up to PEOPLE about struggling with Lyme disease while working as a model.

""Life isn't always what it looks like on the outside and the hardest part of this journey is to be judged by the way you look instead of the way you feel"" she said at the time.

Former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Yolanda told PEOPLE that the severe symptoms can sometimes ""bring you to your knees.""

""There are rough days when you sleep 12 hours you wake up at 11 and you can't get out of bed with severe joint pain brain fog anxiety. There are a lot of symptoms that you can't see from the outside but bring you to your knees on the inside"" she said at the same 2016 Global Lyme Alliance gala event.

""You can never get rested that's the best way to explain it"" the Hadid matriarch shared at the time. ""Life goes on and you try to keep going. Especially with the younger generations they have to keep pushing.""

Bella's older sister Gigi 25 — who has been candid about her own struggles with a different autoimmune disorder Hashimoto's disease — has also previously spoken out about what it was like to grow up with her mom and siblings battling Lyme.

""Growing up having three of my family members sick made me very independent"" she told Elle in February 2019. ""My mom couldn't drive or get out of bed some days so I took my brother to school with me or I made lunch.""

""But I also felt a lot of guilt for being the one person in the family who didn't understand what they were going through"" Gigi added. ""It's hard when your whole family is in pain and you don't know what to do.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXl3ZWVrLmNvbS9lY29ub215L3Blb3BsZS82MDI4NDIvaWFuLWFuZC1yaWNoYXJkLWxpdmluZ3N0b25lLXRoZS1icm90aGVycy13aG8tYnVpbHQtYS03MmJuLWZvcnR1bmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ian and Richard Livingstone: the brothers who built a $7.2bn fortune,"Over the past 30 years brothers Ian and Richard Livingstone have quietly amassed a multibillion-pound property portfolio spanning some of the finest hotels in the world. “But their shrewdest bet by far is a different kind of investment” says The Daily Telegraph. The brothers’ stake in Evolution Gaming – a Swedish-based online gambling business that has surged during the pandemic – has delivered 5000% returns since they became shareholders jumping 200% in the last year alone. The brothers’ 8.6% stake is now worth almost $3bn and Evolution has proved a crucial source of liquidity while many of the hotels in their London and Regional property empire have been closed.

This is the tech niche to be in

Plenty of the world’s richest have diversified into tech in the pandemic says Bloomberg. But the Livingstones spotted Stockholm-listed Evolution’s potential much earlier. Since the brothers provided early seed funding the fifteen-year-old company has grown to become the unseen presence behind live casino games run by some 300 operators globally including Betfair and William Hill. And the real bonanza is still to come. Having recently signed partnership deals with Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts Evolution is poised to clean up from the liberalisation of the huge US market. As analyst Martin Arnell of DNB Markets observes: “within gambling globally this is the niche to be in right now”.

Raised in Ealing west London – the sons of a dentist – and educated at St Paul’s School the brothers now in their mid-50s have always displayed a flair for snapping up promising assets when underrated by others. The basis of their combined $7.2bn fortune is London West End property snapped up in the recession of the early 1990s when they were still in their 20s remarkable given that their training (Ian pictured as an optometrist; Richard a chartered surveyor) suggested other life trajectories.

The funding of the Livingstones’ early investments is “shrouded in mystery” said the London Evening Standard in 2012. But their ascent began in 1989 when Ian opened his first opticians shop Optika in Hampstead. Within three years the business was strong enough to buy the upmarket David Clulow chain out of receivership and by 1996 there were 40 outlets valued at £20m. Richard’s contribution according to a friend was a nose for property. “They cobbled together a bit of money somehow and started buying and selling flats. Gradually lots of small deals got bigger and bigger.”

A genius for persuasion

Between 1991 and 1994 the youthful wheeler-dealers set up 18 companies to buy commercial properties in central London. Richard’s “genius” appears to have been “his power to persuade lenders” – particularly Jacob Rothschild’s Dawnay Day – “to advance tens of millions to a young man with only the shortest of track records”. Key to this was the brothers’ reputation for decency. “They’re lovely people really clever but really quite modest” says one associate.

Over the years the brothers invested in everything from fitness clubs to nursing homes and London cinemas. But they found their niche in luxury hotels – most famously Cliveden the Grade I-listed Buckinghamshire pile made infamous by the 1960s Profumo scandal. Modesty is everything to the Livingstones. But as Ian’s wife Natalie once observed there’s a certain satisfaction that a house once run by the notoriously antisemitic Nancy Astor is now in the hands of “a self-made Jewish family”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRoaW5ncy5jb20vY291cnRuZXktYW5uZS1taXRjaGVsbC1jb3JleS1mZWxkbWFuLXdpZmUtbnVtYmVyLTMtam9iL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who Is Corey Feldman's 3rd Wife Courtney Anne Mitchell And What's Her Job?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRoaW5ncy5jb20vY291cnRuZXktYW5uZS1taXRjaGVsbC1jb3JleS1mZWxkbWFuLXdpZmUtbnVtYmVyLTMtam9iL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The FBI and Justice Department remained focused on Washington.

As recent events have borne out the federal government often underreacts to perceived security threats from the right and overreacts to those coming from the left.

The 1971 bomb blew at a crucial moment for Richard Nixon. On that particular morning he was winging his way to Iowa to shore up political support in the heartland. The president was struggling politically his approval rating dropping. Republicans had lost a slew of congressional seats and governorships in the 1970 midterms despite Nixon’s hope that moderates would approve the way he was handling the Vietnam War—stepping up the fighting while slowly withdrawing U.S. troops. Next year’s reelection campaign was looking fierce; polls showed him trailing the presumed leader among the Democratic challengers Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine.

Nixon had largely built his career on antipathy to liberals and the left and he didn’t need any additional fuel for his visceral distaste of the antiwar movement. A successful Spring Offensive threatened to not only complicate his Vietnam policies and thus his second term but also could distract from his grand plan to reopen diplomatic ties with China and remake the Cold War world.

One of his aides Egil “Bud” Krogh Jr. who would later run the notorious White House “Plumbers” unit that plugged damaging leaks to the media and sought to undermine the president’s opponents fired off a memo suggesting the Capitol bomb could be a rare opportunity. Handled right it might counter the trend of “softer” support for the administration’s Vietnam policies from “middle of the road Americans.” The explosion wrote Krogh “is a chance for us to point out that we have not been tough for nothing. A bomb detonating in the breast of the Senate is as close as one can get to the heart of super-liberal thought in this government.”

Early in his presidency Nixon had urged the FBI and Justice Departments to crack down harder on the antiwar movement even contemplating giving written approval to illegal tactics such as burglarizing the homes and offices of activists. Before the Spring Offensive Attorney General John Mitchell insisted the protests would turn out to be violent no matter what organizers said. He secretly authorized warrantless wiretaps on the Mayday Tribe and three other groups. Now the bombing fed the president’s belief that there wasn’t much difference between underground militants and peaceful protesters. Reporting to Nixon on the FBI’s hunt for the bombers his chief domestic policy adviser listed the suspects: “It’s the Bernadette (sic) Dohrn Rennie Davis bunch.”

The FBI shifted agents from all parts of the Washington field office to the case. They tailed Mayday activists including four young people who drove north the day after the bombing finally stopping them on a Pennsylvania highway. The agents brandishing shotguns searched their car but found no reason to detain them.

After all the investigating only one person was taken into custody in connection with the bombing. She was a tall 19-year-old blonde from California named Leslie Bacon who had been helping book musicians for the rallies. The FBI found witnesses who said they saw Bacon in the Capitol the day before the blast. When she denied it she was charged with lying to the grand jury. Weather wrote an open letter to Bacon’s mother saying she was innocent: “Mrs. Bacon we cannot turn ourselves in to save Leslie. She is a committed revolutionary and understands this.”

At least a dozen other activists were subpoenaed before grand juries in New York Detroit and Washington. All refused to answer questions. Some taunted the feds like Judy Gumbo Albert the driver of the car stopped in Pennsylvania who declared of the bombing: “We didn’t do it but we dug it.” Prosecutors had to decide whether to bring Bacon to trial anyway. But by the time the matter came up the Supreme Court had issued a decision that effectively would have forced the government to disclose details of its surveillance. The Watergate burglars had just been caught and the last thing the administration needed was another bugging scandal. Nixon himself ordered the Bacon case dropped. She and the other activists went free. Bacon has continued to say she had nothing to do with the bombing.

The FBI on Oct. 14 1970 added to its 10 Most Wanted list of fugitives Bernardine Rae Dohrn a self-proclaimed Communist revolutionary who advocates widespread terrorist bombings. The FBI described Dohrn 28 as a reputed underground leader of the ""Violence-Oriented Weatherman Faction of Students for a Democratic Society."" | Getty Images

The Weather Underground continued to stage nonlethal bombings in the 1970s notably a blast inside a Pentagon bathroom and at the State Department. (They called ahead on those too.) When the Vietnam War finally ended the group lost its center of gravity. By 1980 Weather had effectively disbanded. Dohrn along with her husband and fellow member Bill Ayers came out of hiding. They didn’t go to prison. The government had dropped most charges against them for the same reason they couldn’t prosecute Leslie Bacon and also because agents on a desperate hunt for clues had been caught conducting illegal break-ins at homes of the fugitives’ friends and relatives. The FBI’s overreach had backfired but the era of left-wing extremism imploded on its own.

Kathy Boudin was one of the few who remained underground. In 1981 she helped a group called the Black Liberation Army rob an armored Brink’s truck outside New York City. Two police officers and a guard were killed the militants were captured. Boudin and her romantic partner David Gilbert went to prison. She left their 14-month-old son to be raised by her closest friends Dohrn and Ayers who became academics in Chicago.

A grand jury subpoenaed Dohrn in the Brink’s case. When she refused to give a handwriting sample she was jailed for eight months. Her friend Boudin spent 22 years in prison winning parole in 2003 and now serves as co-director of the Center for Justice at Columbia University.

Neither has disclosed anything specific about Weather’s activities but Dohrn has spoken in general about those days with some regret if not quite an apology. “Now nobody in today’s world can defend bombings” she said in a November 2008 interview with Amy Goodman of “Democracy Now.” “How could you do that after 9/11 after you know Oklahoma City? It’s a new context in a different context … the context of the time has to be understood.”

In the same interview her husband said: “I think that if we’ve learned one thing from those perilous years it’s that dogma certainty self-righteousness sectarianism of all kinds is dangerous and self-defeating.”

As a slogan of the 1960s went what goes around comes around. That 14-month-old son who Dohrn and Ayers raised for Boudin? He became a Rhodes scholar a lawyer and a public defender. In 2019 he was elected district attorney of San Francisco a job once held by Vice President Kamala Harris. And on Jan. 6 as the pro-Trump mob attacked Chesa Boudin sent out a tweet: “Hoping everyone who works in the Capitol is safe from this despicable effort to take down our democracy.”

Fifty years on it seems remarkable how fast the 1971 attack faded from collective memory even as it exercised a profound effect on the end of an era of political activism that would be unrivaled until the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. The bombing supercharged Nixon’s paranoia leading the president and his aides to ramp up their crackdown on the New Left. They ordered the biggest and most unconstitutional mass arrests in U.S. history during the Mayday protests rounding up more than 12000 people. And then weeks later the White House launched illegal measures to discredit Daniel Ellsberg leaker of the Pentagon Papers. On Labor Day weekend Krogh dispatched operatives to break into the office of Ellsberg’s former psychiatrist in Beverly Hills searching for compromising material. Nixon’s men were field-testing the tactics they’d soon be caught using against their political opponents in the 1972 election. Thus you can draw a line if a dotted one from the bombing to the demise of Richard Nixon in 1974. Donald Trump meanwhile still awaits the consequences of the Jan. 6 attack.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpcmdpbmlhYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvb24tdGhlLW1vdmUtMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,On the move,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/on-the-move-2/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpcmdpbmlhYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvb24tdGhlLW1vdmUtMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9sYWlkLWJhY2stbWlhbWktdmFjYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yes you can pull off a laid-back Miami vacation — here's how to do it,"The first thing that comes to mind when you hear ""Miami"" probably isn't ""laid back"" but the cosmopolitan city is much more than what can be found on South Beach.

Omer Ismail the head of Goldman’s consumer bank is making a surprise exit to the fintech according to people with knowledge of the matter. The world’s largest retailer made a splash last month after disclosing plans to offer financial services with an independent venture in a tie-up with investment firm Ribbit Capital without offering much detail.

David Stark one of his top lieutenants at Goldman will join him in the new venture the people said asking not to be identified as the moves haven’t been announced.

“Our business has serious momentum and a deep and growing bench of talent” said Andrew Williams a Goldman Sachs spokesman. “We wish these two well.” Walmart didn’t immediately respond to calls seeking comment.

Walmart’s move — depriving one of Wall Street’s elite firms of the talent atop its own foray into online banking — underscores the seriousness of the retailer’s intent to intertwine itself in the financial lives of its customers. The audacious poaching punctuates years of warnings by bank leaders that their industry faces tough new challengers after regulators smoothed the way for corporate giants and Silicon Valley to expand into payments and other services.

Ismail in particular offers rare credentials. He’s credited as one of the key architects behind Goldman’s push into Main Street seeing through the growth of Marcus into a billion-dollar business in five years.

The departures are a setback for Goldman which had just entrusted Ismail and Stark with bigger roles. Ismail formally assumed control of the consumer bank at the start of the year. But he’s been tied to it ever since Goldman’s merchant bank set up the side project several years ago.

The investment bank was looking to grow beyond its traditional strengths and Ismail helped formulate the plan for Marcus — the biggest strategy refresh the firm has seen in three decades. The company ultimately resolved to make itself a serious force in digital banking.

Stark played a key role in Goldman’s partnership with Apple Inc. on a credit card for which the bank provides the financial backbone. Weeks ago Goldman named Stark as the head of large partnerships. That’s a key peg for Marcus’s growth which has already struck deals with Amazon JetBlue and even Walmart.

Fintech ventures typically offer customers low-cost products by eschewing physical branches and instead using online portals or phones to provide loans savings accounts or investment options.

Walmart said in January it aims to combine its “retail knowledge and scale with Ribbit’s fintech expertise” to serve shoppers and associates. Walmart will own a majority of the new venture but in Ribbit it has a partner that’s made big bets in the fintech space including backing Robinhood Markets Inc. the popular no-fee brokerage.

In December the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved a final rule governing so-called industrial loan companies that would make it easier for major businesses to seek banking charters while escaping capital and liquidity demands faced by dedicated financial firms. That’s a worrying prospect for banks facing the risk of going up against against corporate behemoths that could lean on their huge customer base to eat into the banking wallet.

Ismail’s predecessor Harit Talwar is still a chairman at Marcus and will probably continue to play a key role with the division after Ismail’s exit. The unit also hired a former Stripe Inc. executive Swati Bhatia as the head of its direct-to-consumer business earlier this month."

Since the interview with the pope took place in 2019 restrictions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic have disrupted access to mental health services around the world according to the World Health Organization at a time when anxiety and depression are rising.

""I'm convinced that every priest must know human psychology"" Pope Francis said. ""There are those who know it from the experience of the years but the study of psychology is necessary for a priest.""

The pope recalled that reading the book ""Be Glad You're Neurotic"" by the American psychiatrist Louis E. Bisch was very interesting and ""made me laugh out loud.""

It was not the first time that the pope had revealed his prior experience with seeing a psychiatrist at the age of 42. Pope Francis also discussed it in an interview in 2017 with French sociologist Dominique Wolton.

In the La Nacion interview Pope Francis also talked about the origin of his lung condition which was brought on by a flu epidemic when he was a 21-year-old seminarian.

""It was 1957. I was in my second year of seminary ... That winter there had been a strong flu epidemic that affected many of the seminarians. Among them was me. But the truth is that my case evolved in a more torpid way. … Upon viewing the X-rays the specialist found three cysts in the upper lobe of the right lung. There was also a bilateral pleural effusion that caused me pain and shortness of breath"" he said.

After his recovery from the operation to remove part of the affected lobe he said that he never felt any limitation in his activities.

Pope Francis said: ""As the doctors have explained to me the right lung expanded and covered the entire ipsilateral hemithorax. And the expansion has been so complete that if he is not advised of the history only a first-rate pulmonologist can detect the lack of the excised lobe.""

The article also quoted Cardinal Óscar Andrés Rodríguez Maradiaga who said that the issue of Bergoglio's lung came up during the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis.

""When the figure of the Archbishop of Buenos Aires began to emerge as the new possible pope they began to move to stop God's plan that was about to come to fruition. Someone who was supporting another ""papabile"" cardinal in effect spread the rumor in Santa Marta that Bergoglio was ill because he was missing a lung"" Maradiaga said according to La Nacion.

(Story continues below)

""It was at this point that I took courage. I spoke to other cardinals and said 'OK I'm going to go ask the archbishop of Buenos Aires if these things are really true. ' When I went to see him I apologized for the question that I was about to ask him. Cardinal Bergoglio was very surprised but confirmed that apart from a little sciatica and a small operation on his right lung to remove a cyst when he was young he did not have any major health problems.""

The final questions in the 2019 interview with the pope related to death. Pope Francis responded that he thinks of death but is not afraid of it. When asked how he imagines his own death the pope replied:

""Being a pope whether in office or emeritus. And in Rome. I am not going back to Argentina.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

At their regular February meeting the Breckenridge Independent School District’s Board of Trustees voted to accept the resignation of trustee Ardes Johnson and voted to issue an order for a special election to fill his position on the board Place 7.

As of Friday afternoon Feb. 26 two candidates have filed to run for the office Chad Townson and Tammy Wimberley-Anderson.

The deadline to file to run for the unexpired term is 5 p.m. Monday March 1. Applications to serve on the BISD Board of Trustees may be filed in person at the BISD central office 208 N. Miller St. or by mail sent to BISD Attn: Brittany Edgar P.O. Box 1738 Breckenridge TX 76424. Applications may also be submitted by email to brittany.edgar@breckenridgeisd.org or by fax to 254-522-9600.

The election for Place 7 will be held at the same time as the regular election for Places 1 and 2 on May 1. The ballot will include Graham Reaugh who is running unopposed for Place 1 and for Place 2 incumbent Paul Lippe and Jimmy McKay.

At the meeting on Feb. 8 the Board of Trustees approved the purchase of a 2022 Bluebird 77 passenger school bus from Rush Bus Center. After discussing the options with Mark Wilcox BISD’s Maintenance and Transportation Director the board chose to approve a bus with a gasoline engine rather than a diesel engine. The gasoline bus’s purchase price was cheaper and the expected maintenance costs will be less expensive as well.

Also during the meeting BISD Chief Learning Officer Prairie Freeman presented the annual Texas Academic Performance Report to the board and the campus administrators gave updates on their campuses and departments.

The elementary school and junior high principals presented the students of the month. At East Elementary the February Student of the Month is first-grader Gage Ethridge; the South Elementary Student of the Month is fourth-grader Joel Pulgarin; and the Breckenridge Junior High Student of the Month is eighth-grader Antley Rodgers.

Following an executive session the board members voted to approve several personnel recommendations from Superintendent Bryan Allen including a multi-year contract for Laura Gibson as a certified administrator and a probationary teacher contract for Christy Robertson through the end of the 2020-2021 school year as well as other administrative personnel.

The school board also met on Feb. 23 for a special meeting which included a strategic planning session for the district.

At the beginning of the special meeting the board unanimously approved a resolution to pay school district employees who were not able to work the week of Feb. 15-19 because the schools were closed due to the winter storm. Additionally the resolution included “extra duty compensation” for those employees who assisted with efforts to recover and restore regular district operations during and after the storm.

On Friday Prime Minister of Grenada Dr Keith Mitchell announced the cancellation of the Spicemas carnival 2021 celebrations for the second consecutive year due to the pandemic.

Also cancelled this year have been Mardi Gras in New Orleans Carnival in Trinidad and “the world’s biggest party” in Rio de Janeiro.

The Cayman islands’ severe lockdown a figment of legends (or nightmares) that was experienced at the beginning of the pandemic has made Cayman one of the only countries in the world with no community transmission or need for masks. Well— not medical masks that is— revelers are open to wear masks and beautifully designed costumes in what might just be one of the Caribbean’s only carnival street parades for 2021.

Last year CayMAS and Batabano organizers had designed a joint festival during the same weekend but when the event was forced to cancel due to COVID-19 CayMAS' director Craig Fredrick hoped for a return this year.

And he's getting what he wished for…

Taking place from June 30 to July 5 2021 this year’s Caymas will surely be a celebration of all the sacrifices and hard earned wins that the Cayman Islands have experienced during the pandemic and with premier Alden McLaughlin's confidence that the island might have achieved its goal of 70 per cent vaccination and herd immunity by that time there might just be an added reason to party.

CayMAS’ schedule of activities which consists of musical and parade events such as Soca At Dawn (June 26) Soca On The Beach (June 30) Happy Parrot Block Party (July 1) Huukie Day Fete (July 2) Flaunt Fete (July 2) Chicken Run Breakfast Fete (July 3) Swanky AfterMAS (July 3) Tide Up Boat Flex (July 4) and Swanky Couture (July 5) culminates on Constitution Holiday weekend when revelers put on the costumes of their respective bands and jump in the vibrant CayMAS Street Parade.

The ‘masquerade’ which begins in George Town on the afternoon of July 3 will feature music trucks pelting infectious and pulsating soca rhythms followed by a kaleidoscope of costumed revelers representing bands such as Swanky International Kalabbra Entertainment Liquid Ice Iconz Cayman Chicken Run Azucar and Quintessential Movement making their way down West Bay road to Seven Mile Beach.

But there will of course one major difference to celebrations of years past. As a major tourism product of the Cayman Islands CayMAS won’t be quite the same without all of the visitors and with public gathering restrictions that may or may not be in place at the time organizers will have to find a way to control the crowds.

This will be the second consecutive year Spicemas has been cancelled due to the pandemic.

Grenada’s immunization rollout began on February 12 and health officials are working towards having 60 percent of the island’s population of 110000 vaccinated.

“I don’t see how we will be able to achieve 60 percent by July but even if we did I think it will be a mistake to go and have a mass event because you will still have 40 percent of the people who will not have been vaccinated. I don’t think it is a smart thing” said Prime Minister Mitchell during an interview with selected journalists in a format adopted as part of the new COVID-19 health protocols aimed at avoiding any mass gathering of media workers.

He acknowledged that the Carnival period is not only a major revenue earner for the Government but also for many citizens who use the Carnival period to make a living.

Against that background Mitchell said discussions will be held on possibly providing assistance to those individuals.

“We have asked the Ministry of Culture to meet with the various stakeholders and see what can be done to aid the pain because many people live and operate their livelihood by cultural activities” said the Prime Minister.

“Like we have done for the taxi association [we will see] what can we do for the cultural artistes and other people involved who live by the cultural activities in the country.”

Grenada’s Carnival climaxes in August annually but is normally launched during the second quarter of the year.

There were no celebrations in 2020 because of measures enforced to control and contain the spread of COVID-19. However many people defied orders and held J’ouvert celebrations in communities and villages across the island.

The Nevsky Design Bureau told TASS about the project and its significance for the Russian Navy.

By TASS Russian news agency

After the Cold War universal amphibious assault ships developed from support means of major Navy formations into independent units capable of combat and humanitarian missions. They demonstrate the flag deliver troops engage in patrol and support bigger warships. The Russian shipbuilding industry has focused on such naval hardware of late.

One of the projects is Varan designed by Nevskoe Bureau. It is a major Russian designer of universal ships and the sole designer of aircraft carriers and simulators.

The bureau said Varan is distinguished by multirole structure (unified platform) which can produce several types of big surface warships including an aircraft carrier landing ship hospital vessel and even a support vessel for the Arctic.

“It is a new approach in domestic and global shipbuilding. The project will represent a new class of naval hardware — universal sea complexes (UMK)”



Nevskoe Bureau

Varan is an aircraft-carrying ship distinguished by a high level of automation. It can carry 24 multirole fighters six helicopters and 20 drones.

“The airpower of Varan will include seaborne MiG-29K fighter jets and their modifications as well as prospective aircraft including vertical takeoff and landing jets. They will provide balanced and effective engagement corresponding to modern and prospective foreign aircraft-carrying complexes”



Nevskoe Bureau

The airpower includes future UAVs. The ship has a high automatic control integrated into the command system.

Varan displacement is close to 45 thousand tons. It is 250-meter long and 65-meter wide. The draft by the construction waterline is 9 meters. The warship can develop a speed of 26 knots.

The bureau said the hull will be modular to promote a high construction pace. Equipment is built into the main units of the ship to minimize overhaul time and costs during operation.

Varan is to be powered by a gas turbine unified with propulsion units of the Russian Navy. “The warship will receive available general systems to decrease construction costs” the bureau said.

Varan has the size and displacement that fit for construction by any major Russian shipyard without a considerable upgrade of facilities. “It will help build a series of warships and decrease the cost and time of construction” the bureau said.

Varan price will not exceed the cost of currently built warships of similar displacement it added.

Varan is at the stage of preliminary design and some of its main units are at the stage of frontend engineering. “The general scheme and the scheme of the main power plant and electric system have been designed and a 3D model of the hull created” said the bureau which is developing the project on its own initiative. It also plans to create an export option of Varan.

“The concept of Varan positions it in the global market as an innovative and balanced sea platform that meets all the modern tasks of the Russian Navy in the World Ocean. Project priority focuses on economic feasibility and combat effectiveness to maintain the military-political status of the country”



Nevskoe Bureau

There are no direct foreign analogues of Varan at present. The leading shipbuilders in the world produce universal landing ships for a number of missions however there are no universal complexes on a single platform and with unified components.

By displacement Varan is similar to US America-class ships. The US Navy currently operates two of them — the America and the Tripoli. Another warship the Bougainville was laid in March 2019. The warships have a high cost of 3.3-3.4 billion dollars each.

China is actively building landing ships of Type 075. Three warships are at various construction stages. Their number is to increase to eight. The Chinese ship has a smaller displacement than Varan (40 thousand tons against 45 thousand).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRyYWRlbWFnLmNvbS9jcm9zcy1ib3JkZXItY2FyZ28tdHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24tY2hhbGxlbmdlcy1hbmQtc29sdXRpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CROSS-BORDER CARGO TRANSPORTATION CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS,"Haylle Sok

[shareaholic app=""share_buttons"" id=""13106399""]

Managing a streamlined supply chain for cross-border cargo transportation entails much more than identifying the fastest most efficient method of getting cargo from point A to point B. Current market challenges have been amplified due to the pandemic and now go beyond ensuring cargo arrives at the final destination on time. The safety of transportation workers as a result of internal processes is now at the forefront of cross-border transportation. After all if the truck driver is not healthy enough to deliver the products the products do not move. In the new normal worker safety is more important than ever.

“Some of the challenges out there are found more so in the area of the trucks that are crossing and the drivers” says Michael Ford vice president of Government and Industry Affairs at BDP. “If I was a trucking company how do I ensure my driver’s safety? When that driver gets in the cab every day do I know they are healthy?”

Ford continues “Setting up those types of protocols internally ensuring that I’m putting a safe driver on the road and that they’re able to perform those tasks as if there’s any type of cross border is critical especially now. Coordinating communicating setting that up and ensuring that everything is in play really becomes important.”

When driver safety has been established coordination efforts are challenged once again depending on the region the cargo is crossing. Each region presents a unique set of roadblocks from customs to short and long-haul planning times. Cross-border transport from the U.S. to Canada is a much different process than what U.S. to Mexico transport requires for success.

Although these challenges are not new they include more variables that require streamlined coordination from the very beginning. Trade lanes are now more open and traveler impact has shifted presenting opportunities along with the challenges.

“In the past we have seen much more congestion than we do currently” Ford notes. “It has always been there between the U.S. and Mexico. But now while there is less cargo and less traffic running back and forth it has improved processing time. So less cargo less travel. If anything it has improved and allows U.S. and Mexico customs to do what they need to do–which is all about security and ensuring the right cargo is coming through.”

Technology continues to play a critical role in ensuring worker safety and the efficient transport of cargo. The pandemic created an environment where technology is no longer simply an option but a requirement for the continuation of operations as it provides alternatives to paper-processes and close-contact for workers and customs agents.

“Previously when trucks cross the driver pulls over gets out of the cab and hands paperwork over” Ford says. “So the question now is how do we achieve that full paperless experience on both sides in the U.S. Canada and Mexico? When the driver pulls off I need to know I have the driver the driver’s ID etc. and technology supports the keeping up with this information. It also keeps the driver in the cab and allows whatever information needed to be accessed.

“Advanced data has allowed a lot of that to take place. Being able to share and obtain better inter-agency cooperation goes a long way to helping the flow of cargo across the borders.”

Technology is a part of the bigger picture. Without technology the constant exchange of information and obtaining updated data is slowed down. Without inter-agency communications along with customs collaborations cross-border operations are at risk for further delay. Collaborations between customs agents are the key to making operations for cross-border providers more simplified and accelerated. This incorporates security and accuracy while verifying the right cargo continues to its final destination.

“U.S. Customs has been working with Mexico and vice versa to establish points inside of the other’s country and allowing personnel to set up there” Ford says. “In the case of letting Mexican Customs come into U.S. territory and process the clearance it allows that truck to go all the way through eliminating the need for stopping at the border area. This makes a world of a difference and it speeds everything up. It requires the need for cooperation of the companies that want to improve their business flow. Changing to a brand-new environment for cross borders is big.”

Beyond reducing interactions the overall reduction of paper processes and redundancies continues to be at the top of mind for companies engaging in cross-border operations. Along with its other supply chain disruptions COVID-19 has pushed logistics players toward paperless and contactless operations adding more pressure to the already complex market. For some utilizing the technology toolbox (such as blockchain) could be the very thing that overcomes the hurdles presented by the pandemic.

“We hear a lot about blockchain and there are applications inside of this cross-border sector where blockchain can be used as a piece of technology” Ford says. “Instead of paper using a blockchain technology to prove that your goods qualify under the USMCA agreement should be in play for example.”

Regardless of whether the world is battling a pandemic streamlined collaboration will ultimately pave the way for successful cross-border trade. This requires the latest data for every participant thorough internal and external communications and solid business relationships with a common goal to ensure products are received safely and accurately.

“Everybody needs to be involved” Ford maintains. “It is everybody working together: the carrier the custom-house broker the government and all others. It is also about forming that type of relationship where information is being shared and collected and as much in advance as possible is part of the success that needs to happen.”

He concludes: “Things can’t just stay the way they have been. But on the other side of things we need cargo security and the customs officers from the U.S. and Mexico need to be safe. We talk about COVID-19 and workers but we are also asking those officers to be on the front lines. Keeping that in play becomes a big challenge.”

The express delivery arm of postal and logistics giant Deutsche Post DHL Group (DIX: DPW) arranged for German leisure airline Condor and a start-up cargo division of Latvian carrier SmartLynx to fly packages in its European air network.

The first cargo flights under the Condor partnership began last week. Condor a charter carrier for tourists will operate four of its Boeing 767 medium-size jets for DHL until the end of May. The Condor planes will be based at DHL Express’ largest European hub in Leipzig Germany and cover three routes – to Shannon Ireland; Milan-Malpensa Italy; and Cologne Germany. DHL suggested the initial contract could be extended.

It’s the latest example of smaller passenger airlines diversifying business amid a severe downturn in travel demand and establishing full cargo divisions for the first time. The Condor deal resembles what DHL has done in the U.S. where regional carrier Mesa Air Group in October began flying converted Boeing 737-400s an aircraft it never operated before on DHL’s behalf.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlybGluZXMvYWlyYXNpYS14LWNvbnRpbnVlcy1sb3NzLW1ha2luZy1zdHJlYWstYW1pZC1ncm91bmRpbmctcmVzdHJ1Y3R1cmluZy8xNDI2NjEuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AirAsia X continues loss-making streak amid grounding restructuring,"Beleaguered AirAsia X stayed in the red at the operational level despite narrowing its losses on a quarter-to-quarter basis.

For the three months ended 31 December the long-haul low-cost carrier which is undergoing debt restructuring reported an operating loss of MYR356 million ($87.8 million). This compares to the previous quarter’s MYR426 million loss.

It offered no year-on-year comparison of its financial results as it shifted its financial calendar in December citing an ongoing Scheme of Arrangement. This meant that the carrier’s current and subsequent financial year would end on 30 June instead of 31 December.

For calendar 2020 the sister unit to Malaysia’s AirAsia Group racked up operating losses of more than MYR1.2 billion.

AirAsia X reported a quarterly revenue of just MYR54.7 million marginally lower than the previous quarter’s MYR60 million revenue.

As with previous quarters it took no revenue from scheduled flights as its network remains effectively frozen amid pandemic-driven travel restrictions. The bulk of its revenue for the quarter — at MYR47 million — came from aircraft operating lease income.

The carrier’s expenses for the quarter were MYR419 million about 13% lower than the previous quarter. Depreciation costs as well as maintenance and overhaul expenses made up the bulk of the carrier’s costs for the period.

AirAsia X narrowed its net loss quarter on quarter at MYR174 million.

The troubled airline reiterated its plans of returning to the black through a rationalisation of fleet and routes. These include focusing on routes in core markets with proven demand as well as terminating unprofitable routes.

In October the carrier announced a debt restructuring plan as it continued to bleed amid the coronavirus pandemic.

A few months later in mid-December it unveiled plans to raise RM500 million from a new share issuance which it described as a “critical component” of its restructuring plan.

Since then a UK court has allowed the carrier to convene a meeting with its creditors to seek approval for its restructuring.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlZmVuY2UvcmF0aW9uYWxlLWJlaGluZC1pbmRpYS1kZXZlbG9waW5nLWZsZWV0LW9mLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWNhcnJpZXJzL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgxMjUzNzQyLmNtc9IBggFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9kZWZlbmNlL3JhdGlvbmFsZS1iZWhpbmQtaW5kaWEtZGV2ZWxvcGluZy1mbGVldC1vZi1haXJjcmFmdC1jYXJyaWVycy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODEyNTM3NDIuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rationale behind India developing fleet of aircraft carriers,"

At present India has two aircraft carriers - INS Vikramaditya and INS Viraat while it is planning to develop the third - INS Vishaal by 2030. The question arises why is India developing a fleet of aircraft carriers?Robert Farley writing for The National Interest - American bimonthly international affairs magazine wrote that the rationale behind India's carrier force development has three reasons.The first is the support of a conventional war against Pakistan which would involve strikes against Pakistan naval assets and land bases.Second the carriers make the Indian Navy the preeminent force in the Indian Ocean better able to command the area than any foreign competitor.The third prong involves geopolitical competition with China.Regarding Pakistan Vikrant and Vikramaditya would struggle in strike operations because of limitations on aircraft weight although they certainly would attract Pakistani attention. Meanwhile the Indian Navy being the preeminent force in the Indian Ocean Indian carriers will always have better access to bases and support facilities in the Indian Ocean than China the UK or even the US and the presence of the carriers facilitates the projection of Indian power and the management of trade protection.The third and main reason competition with China - Beijing has managed to leapfrog Indian naval aviation development in a relatively short period of time. Although China lacks India's experience with carriers it boasts a remarkably efficient shipbuilding industry and an increasingly sophisticated aviation sector making it less dependent on foreign technology. Although India may struggle to keep up with Chinese construction it can leverage geography (proximity to bases) to its advantage in the most likely areas of any conflict reported The National Interest.Despite considerable economic challenges India took carrier aviation very seriously in the years after independence. Unlike China (or even the Soviet Union) India focused on carriers instead of submarines. INS Vikrant  a Majestic-class light carrier served from 1961 until 1997 fighting effectively in the 1971 war. INS Viraat formerly the Centaur-class carrier HMS Hermes joined the Indian Navy in 1987 and served until 2016.The operational INS Vikramaditya former Kiev-class warship Admiral Gorshkov was inducted into service in 2014. The 45000-ton INS Vikramaditya could operate around twenty MiG-29K fighters along with utility helicopters.The ship offered the Indian Navy the chance to redevelop its aviation muscles after years of operating only VSTOL (vertical and/or short take-off and landing) aircraft from Viraat.Vikramaditya was only the first step towards recapitalizing the aviation wing of the Indian Navy. The second step was the new INS Vikrant a 40000-ton ski-jump carrier built in India's Cochin Shipyard . Laid down in 2009 Vikrant was expected to finally enter service around 2020 with an air wing similar to that of Vikramaditya reported The National Interest.For the time being India has decided to stick with the MiG-29K as its primary naval combat aircraft rather than the Su-33 the F/A-18 or the Dassault Rafale. Both Boeing and Dassault remain at least somewhat hopeful of exporting carrier-borne fighters to India. Even Saab expressed an interest in converting the Gripen for naval service. The Indian Navy also contemplated developing a navalised version of the HAL Tejas but (for now) has wisely rejected the complicated effort to convert the troubled fighter wrote Robert Farley.With one large carrier in service and another on the way India has become one of the world's pre-eminent naval aviation powers.India has committed to carrier aviation and has the resources and experience to develop a successful force.The next step in India's naval aviation project will be INS Vishaal a 65000-ton conventionally propelled domestically produced CATOBAR (Catapult Assisted Take-Off But Arrested Recovery) carrier. With experience gleaned from the experience with Vikrant the design and construction of the carrier will hopefully go more smoothly.It appears as if India will have unprecedented access to US technology for the construction of Vishaal including the EMALS electromagnetic catapult system used on the Gerald R Ford class. Unlike Vikrant or Vikramaditya Vishaal will be able to launch and recover heavy strike aircraft as well as early warning planes such as the E-2 Hawkeye. Vishaal is supposed to enter service by 2030 although that timeline may be optimistic said Robert Farley."

For those of you who are still with us the U.S. Forest Service is taking public comments on a program — which it more discreetly describes as a “mating disruption treatment” — to eradicate an invasive species that feeds voraciously on foliage.

Gypsy moths also have a big appetite for sex. And unprotected moth sex leads to caterpillars which have stripped oak trees and other hardwoods of their leaves in Southwest Virginia and beyond.

To protect the trees the Forest Service is taking a family-planning approach to a problem that starts with the female gypsy moth’s inability to fly.

The female produces a powerful scent or pheromone to attract mates. As part of the program a synthetic pheromone called SPLAT GM Organic will be dropped from airplanes on nearly 21000 acres of forest in and near the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area in late June just as the breeding season begins.

An intense combination of real and fake pheromones is too much for most moths. “The males simply fly around in a confused state unable to specifically locate females to mate with” the Forest Service said in a statement.

Eventually they die lonely. That leads to less larvae which means fewer caterpillars. And over time the forests become more healthy.

The risk posed by gypsy moths is not new. A native of Europe the pest first arrived in Massachusetts in 1869. The intent was to cross it with native silk moths but the larvae escaped from cages in the backyard of an amateur entomologist.

Spreading slowly but steadily the infestation has now reached 20 states as far north as Maine and west to the Great Lakes according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Gypsy moths live for only about two weeks which explains why they are so bent on reproduction while they have the time. In fact they don’t even eat. Eggs are laid on tree trunks branches and rocks where they survive the winter and hatch at about the time leaves begin to appear on trees.

The hairy caterpillars distinguishable by red and blue dots on their backs climb high into trees. In order to sustain themselves before turning into moths breeding and then dying they feed rapidly — with as much as 10 square feet of foliage being consumed by a single caterpillar in its short lifetime.

“This is the reason why they are such terrible pests” said Ksenia Onufrieva a research scientist at Virginia Tech’s Department of Entomology.

Over the past century the spread of gypsy moths has happened primarily in two ways: Slowly when the wind blows the larvae from the trees advancing the insects by about 100 feet a year. And more rapidly when the egg masses are accidentally transported by humans after finding their way into cars campers and loads of firewood.

In the late 1980s they arrived in the Jefferson National Forest according to Tom Coleman an entomologist with the Forest Service who manages the moth eradication efforts.

Outbreaks occur in cycles of about eight to 12 years Coleman said. An infestation from 2015 to 2018 defoliated about 120000 acres in federal woodlands and on private land mostly in Bland and Giles counties.

Statewide about 4.4 million acres have been impacted since 1984 according to records kept by Virginia Cooperative Extension.

So how can the moths be muted?

The Forest Service began working with 12 states and in 2000 the Slow the Spread Program was created.

Traps baited with a synthetic pheromone are used to identify colonies that have been established beyond the main population front. The formula is then dropped from an airplane during the mating season causing a sexual — but ultimately unsuccessful — frenzy that is repeated each year.

The liquid formula is biodegradable and poses no threat to wildlife or humans according to a fact sheet from the Ohio Department of Agriculture which participates in the program.

Airplanes fly 100 to 200 feet above treetops spreading a small dose of about 6 grams an acre on the forest.

“These pheromone treatments are very effective they are shown to reduce mating success by over 95% compared to untreated areas” Onufreiva the Tech scientist who is involved in the Southwest Virginia efforts wrote in an email.

That has reduced the rate of spread by about 60%.

When trees are stripped bare they often grow a second set of leaves that are smaller and more lightly colored making them stand out in the forest. Healthy trees can usually withstand one or two severe defoliations according to Virginia Cooperative Extension. Stressed trees are likely to die the first time.

Oaks are most vulnerable to the gypsy moth but it has been known to feed on more than 500 types of trees shrubs and plants.

Although the aerial application of pheromones has been happening in the Jefferson National Forest since 2000 repeated doses are required as new populations continue to emerge.

In a recent classified ad the Forest Service said the treatment is planned this summer for almost 21000 acres in Smyth and Wythe counties.

The area includes about 18 miles of Forest Service trails. While the spraying is not expected to cause problems for humans exposure to the caterpillars can trigger respiratory problems skin irritation and allergic reactions for some people. But the biggest threat is to trees.

Without eradication measures Onufrieva said the gypsy moth will continue its spread across the country at a rate of about 12 miles a year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMudGhlYWR2b2NhdGUuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvdGhlYWR2b2NhdGUvbmFtZS9jbGFyay1ib3ljZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD03MTU3ODMw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Clark Boyce Obituary (1950 - 2021) - Baton Rouge LA - The Advocate,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.theadvocate.com/us/obituaries/theadvocate/name/clark-boyce-obituary?id=7157830 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMudGhlYWR2b2NhdGUuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvdGhlYWR2b2NhdGUvbmFtZS9jbGFyay1ib3ljZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD03MTU3ODMw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtOTMxMDYyOS9FZXJpZS10cmVlLWNvbXBsZXRlbHktY292ZXJlZC1jYXRlcnBpbGxhcnMuaHRtbNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtOTMxMDYyOS9hbXAvRWVyaWUtdHJlZS1jb21wbGV0ZWx5LWNvdmVyZWQtY2F0ZXJwaWxsYXJzLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eerie tree is completely covered in caterpillars,"A photograph of a tree trunk covered in thousands of hairy caterpillars has been shared to social media leaving viewers shocked at the sheer number of the creepy crawlies.

The picture showing the branch covered in light gray hairs which appear to sprout from the tree itself was shared to the Australian Geographic's Facebook page on Friday with more 1000 people reacting to the post.

'Now this is an image from our nightmares. While you may be familiar with with the long lines of processionary caterpillars you've probably never seen a tree trunk completely carpeted in them' the caption to the picture explains.

The picture posted on Friday shows the tree trunk covered in a carpet of thousands of the hairy caterpillers (pictured)

Many people said they has also witnessed groups of the 'itchy grubs' gathering like this before

Many people commenting on the post said they too has stories of the seeing the the caterpillars in a similar situation.

'One of the houses I lived in as a child had one tree that every year would be covered in hairy caterpillars! The thought of it gives me goosebumps!' one person said.

'I had an allergic reaction to these when I was a kid. Gives me the heebie jeebies whenever I see them' another said.

'I have walked on them with bare feet a couple of times. The itching nearly sent me crazy' added a third.

'We get them here in Spain around now. We see them walking in a line and hanging off pine trees' a fourth person said.

The processionary caterpillars also called itchy grubs or iwepe in some Indigenous languages hatch near the tree and then proceed to feed on the bark and leaves.

They then go into cocoons and emerge as moths in the cooler months before spring.

The caterpillers get their name from travelling in long lines when they move from one location to another

The picture prompted more than a thousand reactions from viewers with some finding the phenomenon interesting and others not so much

The caterpillers are known to group together in large numbers and form long trails when travelling from place to place hence their name.

While not poisonous to humans they hairs can be extremely itchy and can even cause an allergic reaction if touched.

Farmers also take note if they spot a large group of the caterpillers which indicates a good season with plant growth for them to munch on though some also commented they can cause issues for horses if mixed with their feed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbGZwcmVzcy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2d5cHN5LW1vdGhzLWhvcnJlbmRvdXMtbGFzdC15ZWFyLXRoaXMteWVhci13aWxsLWJlLWV2ZW4td29yc2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gypsy moths were 'horrendous' last year.

Last year I made mention of the abundance of Gum Emperor Moth caterpillars in the collective Eucalyptus trees around New Zealand; Well to be a bit more precise: from Canterbury north! These absolutely fascinatingly pretty larvae are huge colourful and prickly and strong in their legs and belong to the Silk moth Family. They feed on Gums Liquidambar and (South American) Schinus molle trees (all are un-related to each other – how weird!).



This year we had heaps of eggs again – big eggs in large strings laid on the leaves. And we noticed that the tiny black caterpillars literally ate most of the leaf-surfaces around the eggs but left the eggs alone!



I suppose it’s a strategy to not kill your brothers and sisters before they hatch from their eggs… but how do these siblings know that? I think the mother moth secretes some oily substance around each eggs that she lays – you can see the shining discolouration around each egg. Even fully-grown caterpillars will chew around the site where eggs were laid so the deterrent effect must work for weeks.



The small “instar” caterpillars are black and extremely hairy and very visible on the blue-green Eucalyptus leaves. I think their hairiness protects them from predatory birds although shining cuckoos are possibly not deterred by such hirsute prey. We observed them staying on the lower smaller and younger leaves often in large clusters of their cohort.



Once they moulted their skin a few times they started to disperse a bit more. They also lost their black fur and begun to look more like the older caterpillars: blue-green colour with spiky coloured protuberances on each body segment.

From this moment onwards we felt that they were being targeted by birds – we found fewer and fewer of them so we (Julie’s idea!) took three inside the kitchen a reared them on Eucalyptus foliage which we refreshed every three days or so: one small caterpillar and two medium-sized ones.

And they eat!!! Eat!!!

Suddenly you realise how much educational stuff you get from raising these critters:

Swap Eucalyptus leaves for Liquidambar: They wouldn’t touch it! Not even when they got hungry!

Theory: once they started their larval life on Gum trees they stuck with that host plant. Next year I start raising them on Liquidambar and see what happens if I reverse the choice to Gum.



When the caterpillars change their skin (moulting) what happens to that old skin? You can’t find it anywhere!

Many caterpillars eat their old skin and with this huge silk “worm” it is no different; As soon as they have “walked” out of their skin they turn around and start to nibble at it. They will not squander the micro-nutrients contained in that old skin – Nature does not know the concept of waste.





These caterpillars are constantly evacuating their slow-release fertiliser pellets – I collected them from the early days (1st instar) to the biggest (last instar) and you can now take measurements and average weight for the whole duration of the larval development – graphs maths statistics!



And then there’s the chrysalis: You’d expect some soft silken cocoon (just like the oriental silk moths make) No… just rough tough brown Aussie stuff. I expect it helps them through the hottest times of the day and the coolest winter days without losing too much moisture as metamorphosis takes places.



There is a softer “weak” spot in that sturdy cocoon: it is the spot where the hatching pupa pushes itself out of that cocoon in spring… to start life as a beautiful and impressive large moth. I have seen the caterpillars spin their cocoon (see video) but haven’t had the time to sit there watching all night to discover how they make these “weak spots”.



Another Day… another Night… another observational experiment!"

Canada needs another 40 million square feet of warehouse space over the next five years to keep up with demand after online sales rose 32 percent last year according to CBRE figures reported by Bloomberg News.

That’s more than three times the combined total of warehousing space in Canada’s three tightest industrial markets —Toronto Vancouver and Montreal.

CBRE projects that e-commerce sales volume will climb steadily from $58.8 billion Canadian dollars to $92.7 billion by 2025.

A similar phenomenon is taking place in the United States. The market for warehousing was already tight in many parts of the U.S. when the pandemic supercharged the growing demand from the e-commerce sector. Net absorption hit an all-time record in the fourth quarter according to CBRE.

Institutional investors poured tens of billions of dollars into the sector last year. Blackstone continued to pivot toward industrial from retail and hotels and now the sector accounts for 36 percent of the firm’s real estate equity value.

Foreign investors are also getting in on the action buying up industrial properties even as total foreign investment in the U.S. fell 31 percent last year.

The Falmouth Road Surgery has been run by a company called AT Medics for the past four years.

More than 11000 patients are registered with the surgery at the corner of Falmouth Road and Harper Road.

AT Medics – a firm established by a group of GPs – has expanded rapidly and now runs 49 medical practices under contract to NHS clinical commissioning groups including five others in Southwark and Lambeth.

In turn AT Medics has now been acquired by the Missouri-based Centene Corporation through its Operose Health offshoot.

Whilst a change in the control of a local GP surgery would normally be discussed in open meetings held by the NHS South East London Clinical Commissioning Group the number of meetings which the press and public can attend has been scaled down drastically during the COVID-19 crisis.

Minutes of a meeting held as a private video conference in December – at which local NHS commissioners gave consent for the change in control of AT Medics – were published by the CCG a few weeks ago.

The minutes show that committee members noted the potential public interest in the sale to an American company and discussed the potential impact of NHS money being transferred out of the country as well as airing concerns about patient data transfer.

Anti-privatisation campaigners have launched a petition against Centene's takeover of AT Medics.

Separately Southwark Council is currently considering a planning application for the redevelopment of the Falmouth Road Surgery site including new medical facilities at the bottom of a block of 39 flats.

In January 2014 power plants owned by Texas’ largest electricity producer buckled under frigid temperatures. Its generators failed more than a dozen times in 12 hours helping to bring the state’s electric grid to the brink of collapse.

The incident was the second in three years for North Texas-based Luminant whose equipment malfunctions during a more severe storm in 2011 resulted in a $750000 fine from state energy regulators for failing to deliver promised power to the grid.

In the earlier cold snap the grid was pushed to the limit and rolling blackouts swept the state spurring an angry legislature to order a study of what went wrong.

Experts hired by the Texas Public Utility Commission which oversees the state’s electric and water utilities concluded that power-generating companies like Luminant had failed to understand the “critical failure points” that could cause equipment to stop working in cold weather.

In May 2014 the PUC sought changes that would require energy companies to identify and address all potential failure points including any effects of “weather design limits.”

Luminant argued against the proposal.

In comments to the commission the company said the requirement was unnecessary and “may or may not identify the ‘weak links’ in protections against extreme temperatures.”

To support our nonprofit environmental journalism please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How

“Each weather event [is] dynamic” company representatives told regulators. “Any engineering analysis that attempted to identify a specific weather design limit would be rendered meaningless.”

By the end of the process the PUC agreed to soften the proposed changes. Instead of identifying all possible failure points in their equipment power companies would need only to address any that were previously known.

The change which experts say has left Texas power plants more susceptible to the kind of extreme and deadly weather events that bore down on the state last week is one in a series of cascading failures to shield the state’s electric grid from winter storms ProPublica and The Texas Tribune found.

Lawmakers and regulators including the PUC and the industry-friendly Texas Railroad Commission which regulates the oil and gas industry have repeatedly ignored dismissed or watered down efforts to address weaknesses in the state’s sprawling electric grid which is isolated from the rest of the country.

About 46000 megawatts of power — enough to provide electricity to 9 million homes on a high-demand day — were taken off the grid last week due to power-generating failures stemming from winter storms that battered the state for nearly seven consecutive days. Dozens of deaths including that of an 11-year-old boy have been tied to the weather. At the height of the crisis more than 4.5 million customers across the state were without power.

As millions of Texans endured days without power and water experts and news organizations pointed to unheeded warnings in a federal report that examined the 2011 winter storm and offered recommendations for preventing future problems. The report by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation concluded among other things that power companies and natural gas producers hadn’t properly readied their facilities for cold weather including failing to install extra insulation wind breaks and heaters.

Another federal report released three years later made similar recommendations with few results. Lawmakers also failed to pass measures over the past two decades that would have required the operator of the state’s main power grid to ensure adequate reserves to shield against blackouts provided better representation for residential and small commercial consumers on the board that oversees that agency and allowed the state’s top emergency-planning agency to make sure power plants were adequately “hardened” against disaster.

Experts and consumer advocates say the challenge to the 2014 proposal by Luminant and other companies which hasn’t been previously reported is an example of the industry’s outsize influence over the regulatory bodies that oversee them.

“Too often power companies get exactly what they want out of the PUC” said Tim Morstad associate director of AARP Texas. “Even well-intentioned PUC staff are outgunned by armies of power company lawyers and their experts. The sad truth is that if power companies object to something in this case simply providing information about the durability of certain equipment they are extremely likely to get what they want.”

Luminant representatives declined to answer questions about the company’s opposition to the weatherization proposal. PUC officials also declined to comment.

Michael Webber an energy expert and mechanical engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin said the original proposal could have helped in identifying trouble spots within the state’s power plants.

“Good engineering requires detailed understanding of the performance limits of each individual component that goes into a system” Webber said. “Even if 99.9 percent of the equipment is properly rated for the operational temperatures that one part out of 1000 can bring the whole thing down.”

Luminant defended its performance during last week’s deep freeze saying it produced about 25 percent to 30 percent of the power on the grid Monday and Tuesday compared with its typical market share of about 18 percent.

In a public statement officials said the company executed a “significant winter preparedness strategy to keep the electricity flowing during this unprecedented extended weather event.” They declined to disclose whether any of the company’s generating units failed during last week’s winter storms.

State officials are again promising reforms. Lawmakers have called on officials with the PUC and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas which operates the power grid that spans most of the state to testify at hearings later this week. Governor Greg Abbott has called on lawmakers to mandate the winterization of generators and power plants and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said he was launching an investigation into ERCOT and almost a dozen power companies including Luminant. Separately the PUC announced its own investigation into ERCOT.

Texas is the only state in the contiguous U.S. that operates its own electric grid making it difficult for other regions to send excess power in times of crisis especially when they are facing their own shortages as they were last week. All other states in the Lower 48 as well as peripheral areas of Texas are connected to one of two grids that span the eastern and western halves of the country.

Because Texas operates its own grid the state isn’t subject to federal oversight by FERC which can investigate power outages but can’t mandate reforms. Many energy experts say the very nature of the state’s deregulated electric market is perhaps most to blame for last week’s power crisis.

In Texas a handful of mega-utilities controlled the distribution and pricing of the power they produced until two decades ago when the legislature shifted to a system where companies would compete for customers on the open market. Lawmakers said the change would result in lower power bills and better service a promise that some experts and advocates say hasn’t been kept.

But under this system power companies aren’t required to produce enough electricity to get the state through crises like the one last week. In fact they are incentivized to ramp up generation only when dwindling power supplies have driven up prices.

Other states with deregulated power markets including California have made reforms and added additional safeguards after experiencing similar catastrophes.

“The fault on this one is at the feet of the legislature and the regulators for their failure to protect the people rather than profits the utility companies rather than investing millions of dollars in weatherization that had been recommended in review after review of these kinds of incidents” said Tom “Smitty” Smith a longtime Texas consumer advocate and environmental activist. “They have chosen not to do that because it would be too expensive for the utilities and ultimately to the consumers.”

‘We’ll be opportunistic’

Three years after the 2011 storms the Texas electric grid faced another major cold weather test when a polar vortex swept across the state. Freezing temperatures helped to knock out nearly 50 generating units at Texas power plants in the first week of 2014 bringing ERCOT perilously close to ordering rotating outages.

The event quickly faded from public attention because it was a near-miss that didn’t actually leave people without electricity or heat. But because the state had come so close to blackouts the North American Electric Reliability Corporation which has some authority to regulate power companies in the country launched an investigation. The probe found similar problems to those that dogged the state after the 2011 storms primarily equipment that failed to stand up to the freezing temperatures.

Despite the equipment failures that brought the electric grid to the brink of disaster the polar vortex was a financial windfall for power-generation companies. In the months that followed the storm some of the companies stressed to investors the financial benefits of the two days of cold weather and accompanying high energy prices.

“This business benefited significantly from increased basis and storage spreads during the polar vortex earlier this year” Joe McGoldrick an executive with Houston-based CenterPoint Energy said in a November 2014 earnings call. “To the extent that we get another polar vortex or whatever absolutely we’ll be opportunistic and take advantage of those conditions.”

A CenterPoint spokesperson said McGoldrick was the head of the company’s gas marketing division but has since left the company. She said that division was sold last year and had no role in responding to last week’s storms.

“The remarks made in 2014 do not reflect the core values of CenterPoint Energy” Natalie Hedde communications director said.

Texas has relied on the principle that higher prices will spur greater power generation when the state needs it most a structure that helps explain the persistence of blackouts said Ed Hirs a University of Houston energy expert.

In extreme weather events like last week’s freeze prices per megawatt hour jumped from an average of around $35 to ERCOT’s maximum of $9000.

Hirs said it’s in the power generators’ interest to “push ERCOT into a tight situation where price goes up dramatically.”

“They are giving generators incentive to withdraw service” he added. “How else do you get the price to go up?”

Texans have already been hit with sky-high bills since last week’s event with some climbing as high as $16000 according to The New York Times. At an emergency meeting Sunday the three-member PUC ordered electric companies to suspend disconnections for nonpayment and delay sending invoices or bill estimates.

Power companies weren’t the only ones that saw the 2014 event more as a success story than a sign of weakness.

ERCOT concluded that operators “handled a difficult situation well” and took “prompt and decisive actions” that had prevented system wide blackouts. In the “lessons learned” section of its final report the agency promoted the continuation of its winterization site visits which are not mandatory.

Winterization efforts were paying dividends in the form of fewer generating units falling victim to cold weather the report stated.

Federal regulators agreed. During a meeting of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners in February 2014 a month after the storm a top-ranking official from NERC stated that the response showed “industry is learning [and] using the resources and tools available to improve their preparations and operations of the grid during a significant weather event.”

But NERC’s investigation exposed problems that would bring Texas to a crisis point last week.

In the 2014 report NERC methodically laid out how power-generating equipment failed during the cold snap detailing 62 examples that included frozen circulating water that caused a supply loss and moisture in the air causing valves to freeze. In all those cold-related failures were responsible for the vast majority of lost power during the event the agency found.

The incident also highlighted the need to improve winter performance of natural gas pipelines which NERC found hampered the ability of gas-fired power plants to generate electricity. The agency declined to comment saying it doesn’t discuss investigations.

Natural gas and power generation are highly dependent on each other: Natural gas processing requires electricity which may be produced in turn by burning natural gas.

Citing preliminary figures from ERCOT that show natural-gas-fired power plants performed worse than those fueled by other types of energy during this year’s power crisis energy experts say producers and distributors of that fossil fuel played a major role in the catastrophe.

Natural gas producers and pipeline companies in Texas are regulated by the Railroad Commission.

R.J. DeSilva a spokesperson for the agency declined to say whether it requires natural gas producers and pipeline companies to weatherize wellheads or pipelines. He noted that poor road conditions made it impossible for crews from natural gas companies to inspect wells and said some producers reported “the inability to produce gas because they did not have power.”

Because so many homes are heated with natural gas fossil fuel plays a much more central role in the winter than it does in the hot summer months.

“When all this began millions of Texans wrapped their pipes to keep them from freezing and the Railroad Commission didn’t order — has never ordered — the gas companies the gas producers and gas pipeline companies … to wrap their pipes to protect them from freezing” said Smith the consumer advocate.

Failed legislation

After days of scrambling to address the myriad crises that pummeled his city last week former longtime state Representative Sylvester Turner — now mayor of Houston the state’s largest city — had a message for his former colleagues.

“You need to dust off my bill and you need to refile it” the Democrat said during a press conference Friday referring to legislation he filed in 2011 that would have required the PUC to ensure ERCOT maintained adequate reserve power to prevent blackouts. “Because it’s not about just holding hearings.”

The state’s deregulated market is to blame for the crisis according to some experts who say the catastrophe shows that the system ultimately prizes profits over people. But some of the architects of the system are doubling down.

In a blog post published last week on the website of U.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy former Texas Governor Rick Perry suggested that the current disaster was worth it if it keeps rates low and federal regulators from requiring changes to the system.

“Texans would be without electricity for longer than three days to keep the federal government out of their business” said Perry who was governor from 2000-15 and presided over the early days of energy deregulation in Texas. “Try not to let whatever the crisis of the day is take your eye off of having a resilient grid that keeps America safe personally economically and strategically.”

Perry who returned to his job on the board of Dallas-based pipeline giant Energy Transfer LP after serving as energy secretary in the Trump administration received at least $141000 in campaign contributions from Luminant’s former parent company TXU Corp. between 2002 and 2009 when he was governor.

On Saturday Turner warned about the soaring residential utility bills that Texans would be getting in the coming weeks. In 2012 when Turner was still a state representative he wrote a letter to the then-chairman of the House State Affairs Committee raising concerns about PUC rule changes that increased the price caps companies could charge for power to $9000 per megawatt hour.

Those price caps remain the same today.

This time Turner called on lawmakers to pursue substantive reforms that don’t simply “scapegoat” ERCOT referring to the increasing calls for an investigation into the council including by Abbott. “You must include the Public Utility Commission in these reforms because they provide direct oversight over ERCOT and all of those commissioners are appointed by the governor” Turner said.

In 2013 Turner attempted unsuccessfully to pass a measure that would have replaced the governor’s appointees on the PUC with an elected commissioner. The same year he tried to salvage a measure that would have increased the administrative penalty for electric industry participants that violate state law or PUC rules.

The Texas Sunset Advisory Commission which audits state agencies every 12 years to determine how they can better function or if they should be abolished recommended in 2013 that the PUC exercise additional oversight of ERCOT including a review and approval of annual budgets and annual review of “PUC-approved performance measures tracking ERCOT’s operations.”

One of the recommendations called on the PUC to increase the administrative penalty to $100000 a day per violation stating that the $25000 daily penalty “may not be sufficient for violations that affect grid reliability which can cause serious grid failures such as blackouts.”

Lawmakers passed a bill during that year’s legislative session that adopted many of those recommendations but the change in penalties was left out. An amendment by Turner to restore the higher fee in the bill failed.

Another former Democratic lawmaker who now leads a major Texas city similarly tried and failed to pass legislation that would bring greater accountability to the state.

In 2015 Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson then a state representative authored a bill that would have required state agencies including the PUC to plan and budget for severe weather using state climatologist data.

“It would have forced state agencies to prepare for an event like what just happened and to account for that in their agency plans” Johnson said during a Thursday press conference addressing the crisis. “It was quite unfortunate because we can’t say that it would have prevented this situation but certainly may have.”

Then two years ago facilities owned or controlled by utilities regulated by the PUC were exempted from legislation that requires the Texas Division of Emergency Management to “identify methods for hardening utility facilities and critical infrastructure in order to maintain essential services during disasters.”

The bill’s author Republican state Representative Dennis Paul declined to comment. State Senator Eddie Lucio Jr. who co-sponsored the measure said he did not know why the PUC was exempted.

‘Demanding answers’

For the past two decades consumer groups have fought without success for a larger role in how the state manages its power grid. Giving residents a stronger presence on the ERCOT board would have forced the agency to take the lessons of extreme winter storms in 2011 and 2014 more seriously said Randall Chapman a ratepayer attorney and longtime consumer advocate.

“It would have changed things entirely” Chapman said. “Residential consumers are the ones who have been through outages before. They are the ones with the broken water pipes the ones freezing in their homes. They would be demanding answers.”

Chapman said the groups were stymied when the legislature agreed to reserve only a single seat on the ERCOT board for a representative of residential consumers. In comparison eight seats including alternates are filled by representatives of energy retailers power generators and investor-owned utility companies.

“Residential consumers need a stronger voice over at ERCOT” Morstad of AARP Texas said. “Decisions are made every week that affect the health and safety of millions of Texans. You need a strong voice there to call B.S. when companies aren’t following through on winterizing or other things that are critical to reliability of the electric system.”

In 2011 Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar co-authored a bill while serving in the state legislature that would have increased the size of the ERCOT board and allowed for more consumer representation. It didn’t pass.

Hegar said the failures displayed in the last week once again bring the significance of representation to the forefront.

“As a result of this extremely unfortunate event where so many people were out of power and now have damage to their homes and their businesses there needs to be a broader range of representation on the board and to bring those voices as we move forward in trying to decide what we want our electric grid to be” Hegar said.

A lot of penny stocks have gotten off to amazing starts in the market this year. Bargain hunters have flocked to the category -- comprised of stocks that trade for less than $5 per share -- looking for tickers that can blast higher and grow shareholders' money quickly.

For example Castor Maritime (CTRM 8.41%) a previously little-known shipping company with a market capitalization of less than $30 million as recently as December saw its stock shoot up more than 750% in the early days of 2021.

These sorts of movements by their nature are nearly impossible to predict and chasing them can wipe out a lot of your net worth very quickly if trends suddenly reverse.

Long-term investors would do well to steer clear of the frenzy and instead focus on solid companies with the proven ability to post solid results. Here's why three Fools are ignoring penny stocks and focusing on XPO Logistics (XPO -0.36%) General Motors (GM 0.49%) and Best Buy (BBY -1.80%) instead.

A shipping company that has delivered over the long haul

Lou Whiteman (XPO Logistics): XPO Logistics provides a suite of transportation services to customers primarily in North America and Europe. But don't let the diesel fool you: This is a tech-powered business set up well to take advantage of megatrends like the growth of e-commerce.

The company's XPO Direct service offers logistics and delivery products to online and brick-and-mortar retailers to help them better compete with Amazon. Few retailers have the size and scale on their own to match the e-commerce leader but by joining forces on the XPO platform they can better match it on efficiency.

XPO also is automating the brokerage side of the business allowing shipping customers and truckers to connect digitally to each other which brings down costs and more efficiently fills cargo holds. And it has invested heavily in robotics with more than a quarter of North American e-commerce direct-to-consumer volume shipped with help from automation in 2020.

XPO's stock price has an impressive story behind it too -- it's up by more than 100% from its late March pandemic low and up by more than 45% from where it started 2020. And to highlight the difference between this company and penny stocks XPO has a long record of high performance: The stock has gained 1200% in the past 10 years.

Management isn't resting on those gains. The company arguably suffers from a ""conglomerate discount"" a term used to describe how some companies that operate in a variety of businesses get valued at lower multiples than more pure-play operators. XPO trades at an enterprise value of 13.2 times earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Trucking specialist Old Dominion Freight Line by comparison trades at 21.1 times EBITDA and logistics specialist C.H. Robinson Worldwide is valued at 16.6 times EBITDA.

However by the end of the year XPO expects to split its trucking and logistics businesses into two more-focused public companies. That may help close the valuation gap. Even without the split XPO's businesses appear to be performing well giving me confidence this company can continue to deliver for investors for years to come.

Like EV stocks? Here's one that's actually a good investment

John Rosevear (General Motors): If you've been investing long enough to remember the bad old days of ""Government Motors"" (or the even-worse old days of GM ""quality"" in the 1980s) General Motors might seem like a weird stock recommendation. But consider:

Under CEO Mary Barra GM has gone ""all in"" on electric vehicles rolling out its brand-new Ultium EV architecture and promising a slew of battery-powered models over the next few years that will deliver something that most rivals' EVs still don't: Profits.

Speaking of profits GM's high-margin gas-powered pickups and SUVs have been selling like hotcakes despite the pandemic driving the automaker to a fourth-quarter profit that soared past Wall Street expectations. (It might seem weird for GM to be touting EVs and feasting on truck profits at the same time but there's a method to its madness: Today's trucks and SUVs are funding the electric-vehicle programs that will become its future.)

GM forecast another nicely profitable year in 2021 when it reported earnings in early February. But it hedged that guidance with concerns about a global shortage of semiconductors leaving auto investors concerned about prolonged production disruptions. Good news though: CFO Paul Jacobson said on Wednesday that the worst of the shortage appears to be over.

Sure unprofitable EV start-ups might be more fun for investors at least while the bull market continues. But between the Ultium platform its Cruise autonomous-vehicle subsidiary and those hugely profitable trucks GM is better-positioned than most automakers -- old and new alike -- for the transition to smart connected zero-emissions vehicles.

That makes GM a better bet than most for long-term profit growth. And trading at just 10 times its expected 2021 earnings GM's stock is still a relative bargain -- meaning that it's a good bet for long-term share-price growth as well.

Best Buy: It's right there in the name

Rich Smith (Best Buy): The past week's sell-off hasn't been a whole lot of fun for investors but here on the other side of the slide you might have noticed that there's finally a silver lining within the dark clouds of tech-sector despair.

Some -- not many but a few -- stocks are looking a bit more attractive at their post-sell-off prices.

Take Best Buy for example. As one of the heroes of the pandemic the retailer offset the loss of foot traffic to its stores by implementing curbside pickup and buy-online-pickup-in-store models allowing it to efficiently meet the technology needs of millions of people who suddenly had to kit themselves out to work from home.

You have to admit -- that has worked out pretty well. In its Q4 earnings report Thursday Best Buy reported 9% profit growth year over year 11% sales growth and 89% growth in online sales.

And even before the pandemic this retail superstar was doing just fine turning 4% average annualized sales growth over the past five years into 15% annualized earnings growth (according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data). That kind of high-quality performance bodes well for Best Buy in 2021 and beyond whether COVID-19 continues to boost work-from-home electronics sales or not.

Best Buy is quite simply the kind of stock where even a ""return to normal"" should be more than enough to make an investor happy. And best of all after this week's slide Best Buy stock sells for less than 15 times trailing earnings. For a company that has proven its ability to grow earnings at 15% annually over the long term and that pays its shareholders a steady dividend that currently yields 1.9% that's a bargain price -- and a much safer investment than any penny stock you can name.",,,,,,,,,,,,

SCHW,Charles Schwab Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAyLzI4L2JldHRlci1idXktdmFuZ3VhcmQtc21hbGwtY2FwLWdyb3d0aC1ldGYtdnMtc2Nod2FiL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF vs Schwab U.S. Small-Cap ETF,"Small caps have outperformed large caps over the past year so investors may want more exposure to them.

Small-cap stocks outperformed large-cap stocks in 2020 and that trend is expected to continue in 2021 many analysts say citing Biden administration policies that will help Main Street more than Wall Street among other reasons. The Russell 2000 which is the major index tracking small-cap performance was up 20% in 2020 while the S&P 500 rose 18.4%. The difference so far this year is more pronounced: Through the market close Friday the Russell 2000 was up about 11.5% year to date while the S&P 500 was up roughly 1.5%.

While market trends shift over time small caps should be part of a diversified investment portfolio to capture gains when large caps are weaker. Finding the right individual small-cap stocks can be a challenge in part because of the more volatile nature of smaller companies so exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be a great solution. Two of the largest small-cap stocks funds are the iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO 0.49%) and the Schwab U.S. Small-Cap ETF (SCHA 0.12%). Which one is the better buy?

iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF

The iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF is the fourth-largest small-cap ETF holding about $12.9 billion in assets. It tracks the Russell 2000 Growth Index which includes about 1100 stocks with higher price-to-value ratios and higher levels of forecast growth. It has a median price-to-earnings ratio of 36.5 and a median price-to-book ratio of 6.2 with a standard deviation which is a measure of volatility of 48.5%.

The largest holdings in the ETF include Plug Power Caesars Penn National Gaming Sunrun Deckers Outdoor Redfin Churchill Downs Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Mirati Therapeutics and Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals.

Launched in 2000 this ETF has been a stellar performer. In 2020 it rose 34.5% and it has 5-year and 10-year annualized returns of 16.4% and 13.6% respectively. All that and an expense ratio of 0.24% which is lower than the category average of 0.32%.

Schwab U.S. Small-Cap ETF

The Schwab U.S. Small-Cap ETF launched in 2009 is the third-largest in the small-cap universe with roughly $15.3 billion in assets. It tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Small-Cap Total Stock Market Index. That's a broader index than the Russell 2000 Growth containing 1750 stocks.

For reference the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market Index tracks the 750 largest U.S. companies by market cap. Those with valuations from No. 751 through No. 2500 fall within the Small-Cap Total index.

The Schwab U.S. Small-Cap ETF has a median P/E ratio of 21.8 a median P/B ratio of 2.3 and a standard deviation of 14.3%. Its top 10 holdings are Plug Power Caesars Penn National Gaming Novocure Cloudflare Cree 10X Genomics Five Below Repligen and Darling Ingredients.

The ETF returned 19.3% in 2020. Over the last five years it has posted an annualized return of 12.9% and over the past 10 years has returned 11.6% on an annualized basis. Also this ETF has a rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.04% -- well below the 0.32% category average. That means that investors pay just 4 cents in fees for every $100 they have invested.

Which is the better buy?

If you're looking at returns it's hard not to lean toward the iShares ETF. It has delivered better results over the 1-year 5-year and 10-year periods than the Schwab fund. The Schwab fund is doing better thus far in 2021 though -- it was up about 10.7% through Friday compared to the iShares fund which was up by about 8% year to date.

The Schwab ETF obviously has a much lower expense ratio at 0.04%. Not that the iShares ETF's fees are high at 0.28% but the Schwab ETF will cost the investor next to nothing in fees and that can add up to a significant difference over time especially when large sums are involved. It also has a much lower standard deviation meaning the underlying stocks have lower volatility.

Your preference between these two ETFs might depend on your risk tolerance or your expectations for the market over the next few years. If you're anticipating another 10-year bull market you'll have a different take on this decision than someone who foresees more volatility over the next decade than we saw in the last one.

It may also depend on your time horizon. If you're picking in one of these ETFs for a retirement-focused portfolio then the iShares ETF will be the better choice because of its track record of long-term returns. If you're investing with a nearer-term goal in mind for the money you may feel more comfortable with the more diversified less risky Schwab ETF.",,,,,,,,,,,,

For months in 2020 most of the city was in lock down with Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration and the City Council holding virtual meetings and hearings during the pandemic instead.

But well-connected high powered lobbyists still found a way to rake in bundles of cash from wooing City Hall and the Council for their clients.

The lobbyists raked in $106.34 million in 2020 — just slightly less than $113.2 million in compensation during the 2019 pre-pandemic year according to a new report from the City Clerk’s Office.

Leading the pack for the fourth consecutive year was Suri Kasirer’s lobbying firm — taking in $14.164 million nearly matching the $14.3 million earned in pre-pandemic 2019.

One government watchdog wasn’t surprised.

“The seasoned hot-wired lobbyists still get their phone calls returned. From a client’s perspective lobbyists are more important than ever” said Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group.

“The top connected lobbyists can still wield their influence and charge clients the big bucks” added Horner.

Suri Kasirer’s 32-member firm pressed the mayor and council to provide COVID-19 relief to the hard-hit restaurant and hotel industries. Her clients included ROAR — Relief for the Restaurant Industry — and the Hotel Association of NYC which has been trying to get the city to defer property taxes and interest fees on hotels that are closed and not generating revenue.

Kasirer’s well-heeled client list also includes Northwell Health Columbia Presbyterian and Mt Sinai hospital systems. Northwell had been pushing a controversial proposal to expand its Lenox Hill hospital on the Upper East Side which is facing fierce neighborhood opposition.

The firm’s table of clients last year also included the Target Corporation T-Mobile USA IF Cornerstone which owns part of the vacant Long Island City waterfront property where the aborted Amazon headquarters project was supposed to be located; Charter Communications Comcast Cable South Street Seaport Sotheby’s Columbia University the Disney Company and real estate powerhouses Two Trees Management the Related Company SL Green Realty and Silverstein Properties; the Archdiocese of NY Google the anti-horse carriage group NY-CLASS etc.

“We are pleased to continue to be the leading advocate in New York City and are proud to support our clients as they work to reinvest in and rebuild New York as we emerge from the pandemic” Kasirer said.

“This was a very tough year. This was a year from hell. My clients were struggling to deal with COVID.”

She also spoke of her unsung clients who helped the needy during the pandemic including the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty AARP and SAFE Horizons which aids victims of domestic violence.

And she said there were some positives in terms of development amid the pandemic noting client SL Green’s opening of the 14011-foot tall One Vanderbilt office tower by Grand Central terminal following the rezoning of Midtown East.

Lobbyist James Capalino’s firm was the second highest compensated firm with $9.9 million — down from $11.9 million in 2019 followed by Bolton-St. Johns with $6.7 million.

The top ten lobbying firms also included Constantinople & Vallone (includes former Council Speaker Peter Vallone) $5669402.00; Pitta Bishop & Del Giorno $4826526.51; Greenberg Traurig $4571504.20; Davidoff Hutcher & Citron $3240421; Fried Frank Harris Shriver $3198924.84; Geto & de Milly Inc. $3120500; and CMW Strategies ( Connelly McLaughlin & Woloz) $3104899.92.

The developer of a project to build a 13-tower mixed-use project along Flushing Creek in Queens — the FWRA consortium — paid over $1 million in lobbying bills as it won City Council approval to rezone the area the most paid by any one client last year.

Real estate and development remain the bread and butter of the lobbying industry accounting for 40 percent of lobbying activity by industry by far the most.

Entities with their own in-house lobbyists included the Real Estate Board of NY ($320844) the Association of Neighborhood Housing ($285978) Greater New York Hospital Association ($180700) and the United Federation of Teachers ($173164) among others.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hean Rangsey

The government has welcomed Chevron (Cambodia) Ltd’s plan to nearly triple its network of Caltex petrol stations in the Kingdom to 100 according to a senior official at the Ministry of Mines and Energy on February 28.

Cheap Sour director-general of the ministry’s General Department of Petroleum told The Post that Chevron Cambodia CEO Pongtorn Tangmanuswong revealed the expansion plans at a meeting with minister Suy Sem on February 23 without providing an exact timeframe.

“In actuality these are merely sketches they don’t confirm whether the 100 stations would materialise by this year. The company now has just 35 stations.

“The government welcomes all of the company’s business expansions so long as the proposed locations have received the go-ahead from local authorities and the technical specifications of the stations are in accordance with our directives and procedures related to safety” he said.

Sour noted that he had yet to receive formal applications for the proposed petrol stations.

“The company has to apply for the added stations individually and we need to keep tabs on safety at the prospective locations.

“The petrol station business is different from others and requires us to visit and evaluate safety plans and locations in a practical way.”

Chevron Cambodia was incorporated in 1995 as Caltex Cambodia according to its parent company the New York-listed Chevron Corp. In 2008 the wholly-owned retail and marketing subsidiary was renamed while it continued to do business under the Caltex brand.

On the New York Stock Exchange Chevron’s (CVX) share price fell $2.35 or 2.30 per cent to close at $100.00 on February 26 for a market capitalisation of $192.638 billion with 14.454 million shares traded.

Chevron Cambodia’s expansion plans come as Singapore-based oil and gas exploration company KrisEnergy Ltd on December 28 extracted the first drop of crude oil from Cambodian waters.

The highly-anticipated milestone extraction from the offshore Cambodia Block A concession in the Khmer Basin’s Apsara oilfield made the Kingdom the eighth oil producer in the 10-member ASEAN with only Singapore and land-locked Laos not producing crude.

And Prime Minister Hun Sen recently said the PV Drilling III jack-up rig began drilling the second well of the five-well “Mini Phase 1A” mini platform on January 30.

“I would like to assure our compatriots that our first oilfield has been in operation for 33 days producing 1236 barrels a day. In 33 days 40788 barrels” he said then. “We will continue to pump oil in 2021.”

If international oil prices remain at around $55 per barrel the Kingdom could net about $30 million per annum from the commodity he added. The estimates show that the Block A could be able to pump out between 7000 and 7500 barrels a day.

Sour has confirmed that KrisEnergy is drilling the remaining four wells of the mini platform to accompany A-01D the source of the Kingdom’s first drop of oil extracted. These wells have been named A-02D through A-05D.",,,,,,,,,

Please check the time stamp on the story to see when it was updated last.

The Chipotle customer has been forced to pay higher prices on takeout orders following delivery apps such as Uber Eats and Grubhub being in such high demand during Covid-19. Yikes!

The company’s CEO just appeared on Yahoo Finance Live to explain the increases.

“It’s no surprise that delivery comes with an added cost. Our belief has been that’s a premium experience from a convenience standpoint. We want to make sure that channel covers the cost — we raised the prices 13% in our app [in the fourth quarter]” Jack Hartung said.

If 13% seems high remember that the Mexican grill lowered its delivery fees before the novel coronavirus outbreak.

“We also lowered them before the pandemic we were charging a $3 delivery fee we lowered that to $1. If you were ordering in the app prior to the pandemic and now you’re ordering delivery through the app the increase is 2% to 3%. The 13% increase all it does is allow us to cover most of our cost in delivery.” That makes sense!

The Colorado-based company says it hasn’t seen much resistance to the higher online from customers but we see that as hard to believe considering how many “quac is extra” memes there are out there.

“In terms of pricing I think in the delivery channel there is additional pricing potential there. We found that when people decide they want that channel they’re willing to pay a higher price” he said.”

And it gets worse: “I don’t think we have reached the limit there. We’ll continue to experiment. We’re not going to go crazy on pricing because we think we can.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

Last year Guardian Australia revealed the widespread use of stay applications to permanently halt civil cases brought by survivors where perpetrators had died.

The Catholic church and other institutions effectively used the passage of time to block survivors from having their cases heard by arguing a fair trial was no longer possible.

The tactic was adopted despite clear evidence before the royal commission that significant barriers meant survivors took on average 22 years to come forward and that institutions had themselves hindered justice by concealing abuse from law enforcement and destroying records.

The high court delivered a significant blow to the use of stays in November finding they must only be allowed in rare and exceptional circumstances or risk bringing “the administration of justice into disrepute”.

Legalise Cannabis Party upper house MLC Jeremy Buckingham is preparing to introduce a bill to state parliament to enshrine the high court findings into statute law and remove any uncertainty around the way stay applications can be used.

It introduces changes that would limit the ability for a defendant to argue for a permanent stay simply because of the passage of time. The bill would also allow survivors who had a stay granted against them since 2016 the ability to have their cases reconsidered.

Buckingham said he was aware of about a dozen cases that had been permanently halted due to stays in that time period.

“We want justice for victims of child sexual assault” Buckingham said. “That’s what we want.”

“We want to ensure that they get their day in court in the civil court and that what I think [of as] this cunning ‘lawfare’ is removed as a tactic from institutions.”

Survivor Matt Barker said the legislation would be “enormously beneficial” for those who were still pursuing justice through the courts.

Barker’s own case against Scouts NSW was stayed last year despite the fact that his abuser was alive had been convicted of criminal offences against Barker and was willing to give evidence.

Barker appealed and has since settled but said he was “aware of other organisations still using the threats of permanent stays” against other survivors.

“[The legislation] would be enormously beneficial for anyone who has a live case and it also has provisions for anyone whose case was closed due to a stay or because of the threat of a stay to allow them to re-litigate their case” he said.

“From that point alone it’s super important legislation because there will be so many people out there who have accepted minute settlements.”

The government has previously indicated support for amending the law to enshrine the high court’s findings.

In November Buckingham moved a motion recognising the court ruling and to “consider enacting legislation to amend the Limitation Act 1969 to remove this roadblock to justice once and for all”.

The government said at the time that it “supports the motion as it asks for the government to consider mechanisms and changing statute law which we will do”.

Buckingham said the government was yet to act so he was introducing the bill to force change.

A spokesperson for the attorney-general Michael Daley said the government had not yet seen Buckingham’s bill and had not been able to consider its contents.

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- From Irwin to North Braddock to Ross Township multiple types of disruptions impacting church services have taken place throughout the Pittsburgh area within the last several weeks.

One of the incidents involved a gun pulled on a pastor during a sermon while another consisted of vandalism impacting an organ and sound equipment.

New federal funding has been approved to help increase security for places of worship and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says that all types of churches are welcome to apply.

Places of worship can apply for funding through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and can use the funds for whatever they would like as long as it helps add security. The deadline to apply for funding is May 21.

""I thank God because only God stopped and jammed this gun.""

A man was arrested in North Braddock on Sunday after pulling a gun on a pastor during his sermon at the Jesus' Dwelling Place Church -- and it was all caught on camera.

Bernard Polite is facing attempted homicide and aggravated assault charges and is accused of trying to shoot and kill the pastor.

As the pastor ducked out of the way Polite was tackled by a deacon and held down on the ground until police arrived.

Police are also investigating after a man was found shot to death in Polite's home near the church. It's unclear if he is responsible for that shooting.

""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

A church in Westmoreland County fell victim to vandalism late last week and is looking for help identifying the teenagers responsible for the damage.

As a result of the vandalism the church was unable to use the organ for the first two Holy Communion masses the following morning.

The church is now asking for help identifying the two teenagers and say that information will be turned over to Irwin Police.

""It would be nice if people could just practice their religions in peace.""

Last month a man was reported to be walking into nearly a dozen area churches includes St. Sebastian Church in Ross Township and yelling at a priest that he was the devil.

Parishioners said that these type of incidents are especially disturbing because the man's intentions weren't clear.

The Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh is working with multiple law enforcement agencies to track down the man.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vZXBpc2NvcGFsbmV3c3NlcnZpY2Uub3JnLzIwMjQvMDUvMDcvc2FuLWZyYW5jaXNjby1jaHVyY2gtb2ZmZXJzLXNwYWNlLWZvci1zYWNyZWQtc2xlZXAtc3VwcG9ydC1zZXJ2aWNlcy1ldmVyeS13ZWVrZGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,San Francisco church offers space for 'sacred sleep' support services every weekday,"[Episcopal News Service] Every weekday at 7 a.m. the Episcopal Church of St. John the Evangelist in San Francisco California opens its nave to people who need a safe place to rest – what it calls “sacred sleep.” Those who come are unhoused neighbors in the city’s Mission District and they find a place of welcome without judgment.

“We love having our space open almost recklessly open for the neighborhood” the Rev. Kevin Deal St. John’s vicar told Episcopal News Service. Serving its community “has been part of the DNA of St. John’s almost since its inception 164 years ago.”

St. John’s provides space for more than just sleeping through its partnership with the Gubbio Project a nonprofit organization that serves unhoused people with “safe compassionate respite during the day” according to its website.

The project takes its name from an Italian town where according to legend St. Francis of Assisi brokered a truce between a hungry wolf and frightened townspeople. The nonprofit was founded in 2004 and moved into space at St. John’s in 2017.

Lydia Bransten Gubbio’s executive director since 2021 told ENS that the legend embodies what her organization is about. “When people come together with mutual need we find commonality and can work together” she said.

Their response shines a light not only on homelessness in general but on how communities across the country seek to address it. Homelessness has been on the rise across the United States since 2017 and cities have grappled with how where and even if to provide shelters or housing. A lawsuit against Grants Pass Oregon for its decision to fine homeless people for sleeping outside on public property made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court for oral arguments on April 22.

According to the Associated Press one-third of the country’s unhoused population live in western states like Oregon and California. The San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing’s 2022 Point-in-Time count found more than 7700 unhoused people in the city with more than 4000 of them unsheltered. The 2024 count is due out this summer.

While unhoused people have existed in America since the 17th century their needs have grown more acute than ever since the COVID-19 pandemic Bransten said. Homeless people in San Francisco who weren’t gravely disabled or seniors “were basically left out on the street” and with shelters closed encampments sprang up so people could find some safety in being together. There were few services available and many people watched others die of an overdose. “There was a lot of trauma in those years” she said.

“The result is a community of people who are distrusting who are more ill and fentanyl addiction collided with COVID in a way that has been debilitating for that community” she said.

A recent assessment of homeless people living in the Mission District found that before COVID 68% of them were employed and had housing she said. Immigrants make up a large portion of the area’s population and many lost their jobs as office building cleaners or restaurant workers during the pandemic. Loss of a job often meant loss of housing.

Now when St. John’s opens its doors each weekday about 35 people come to sleep and over 100 more arrive for the supportive services Gubbio offers. With no pews in the nave it’s easy to set up cots with blankets and people are welcome to bring their belongings and their dogs inside with them. Couples can arrange their cots to be near each other which usually isn’t permitted in shelters Bransten said. “The only rule is to just stay peaceful” she said.

In other parts of the building people can get a cup of coffee or see one of the nurses who provide foot and wound care. The city’s Department of Public Health’s street medicine team provides health screenings and follow-up appointments. Gubbio’s harm reduction specialist who also is a treatment counselor provides clean needles and other paraphernalia so those using drugs can do so safely.

“That provides an entrée to a conversation with a person who is struggling with drug use” Bransten said. Recovery from addiction always is the end goal but “we need to keep them alive long enough and love them enough until they are ready to love themselves into recovery.”

Bransten said that St. John’s offers a space for Gubbio’s clients that is both sacred and safe. “Not all sacred spaces feel safe” she added. “A lot of people have experienced a level of spiritual violence and St. John’s is an incredibly healing community.”

Deal and some of his parishioners provide pastoral care to those who come to the church for Gubbio’s services and many of them now attend worship services at St. John’s something Deal says he loves. “We don’t think of them as people from Gubbio” he said “they are just folks in the St. John’s community.” He said that because people are familiar with the church and think of it as their space they feel comfortable coming back on Sunday.

Bransten said St. John’s building itself helps the people Gubbio serves. “The beauty of the space is key to the way we’re able to create an environment where people feel welcomed where they feel like it’s peaceful it’s beautiful and it’s for them.”

“This is exactly who the beauty of God’s house is intended” Deal said. “It’s not for the people who have everything. The beauty of God’s house is for the people who are down and out.”

Paling tidak itu dialami pasangan muda Apurva Shind dan Zaved Mohammad di negara bagian Uttar Pradesh belum lama ini.

“Saya mencintainya Saya datang ke Meerut untuk mencari kerja dan kami menemukan sebuah kamar yang dapat kami sewa. Namun tetangga-tetangga meributkan kami dan bahkan melaporkan ke polisi.”

Masalahnya di mata polisi Shind adalah seorang Hindu sementara Mohammad adalah seorang Muslim. Negara bagian Uttar Pradesh memberlakukan undang-undang baru yang mengkriminalkan pemaksaan pindah agama. Pasangan muda itu -- terutama perempuan -- harus menunjukkan bukti bahwa ia tidak akan berpindah agama ataupun sekalipun berpindah agama bukan karena alasan pernikahan.

Tidak hanya Uttar Pradesh. Negara-negara bagian lain seperti Karnataka dan Madhya Pradesh yang pemerintahannya dikuasai BJP juga sedang berusaha memberlakukan undang-undang yang sama. Banyak pemimpin BJP dan umat Hindu di negara-negara bagian itu meyakini saat ini sedang berkembang apa yang disebut sebagai ""jihad cinta"" sebuah gerakan yang diklaim mereka digelar oleh orang-orang Muslim untuk membujuk para perempuan Hindu agar memeluk ajaran Islam melalui pernikahan.

Selama setahun terakhir ini beberapa politisi BJP bahkan secara terbuka menuding bahwa jihad cinta adalah bagian dari konspirasi Islam untuk meningkatkan populasi Muslim India. Meskipun merupakan negara mayoritas Hindu India memiliki 200 juta Muslim.

Banyak aktivis HAM termasuk Shabnam Hashmi menentang pandangan keliru ini. Mereka menuding partai yang berkuasa BJP dan organisasi induknya yang berhaluan ekstrem kanan Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) berusaha menarget Muslim India.

“RSS berusaha menyebarkan gossip bahwa pria-pria Muslim secara terorganisir merayu perempuan-perempuan Hindu dan membujuk mereka agar berpindah ke agama Islam melalui pernikahan. Mereka kemudian memproduksi anak sehingga populasi Muslim meningkat di India"" katanya.

Tidak hanya RSS yang menggelar usaha menentang jihad cinta. Banyak organisasi Hindu berhaluan kanan juga mengambil tindakan serupa seperti Hindu Sena yang juga dikenal sebagai Hindu Army. Mereka bahkan telah melakukannnya selama hampir 10 tahun terakhir.

Vishnu Gupta adalah ketua Hindu Sena. Ia mengatakan ia bekerjasama dengan polisi untuk mencegah pernikahan-pernikahan yang melanggar hukum.

“Kami telah membatalkan banyak pernikahan seperti itu. Kami punya jaringan pengacara dan informan yang luas. Para orang tua perempuan Hindu banyak meminta bantuan kami untuk membatalkan pernikahan-pernikahan itu.”

Asif Iqbal menganggap apa yang dilakukan Hindu Sena sebagai sebuah masalah. Organisasinya Dhanak mendukung pernikahan beda agama.

“Banyak pasangan beda agama ketakutan terutama di negara-negara bagian yang melarang pernikahan seperti itu. Mereka akhirnya pergi ke negara-negara bagian lain seperti New Delhi untuk melegalkan pernikahan mereka. Cinta adalah cinta"" katanya.

Ketakutan berlebihan umat Hindu terhadap jihad cinta tercermin dalam reaksi mereka terhadap apa muncul dalam kehidupan moderen India.

Oktober lalu sebuah iklan televisi perusahaan perhiasan mewah Tanishq dikecam habis-habisan. Pasalnya iklan berjudul Ekatvam yang artinya persatuan menggambarkan seorang perempuan Hindu dan seorang pria Muslim yang sedang mempersiapkan pernikahan. Begitu iklan itu ditayangkan sejumlah aktivis Hindu melakukan protes keras di media sosial. Karena takut menghadapi kekerasan perusahaan itu mencabut iklan tersebut dari peredaran.

November lalu ketika Netflix menayangkan adaptasi BBC atas novel ""A Suitable Boy"" karya penulis India terkenal Vikram Seth reaksi serupa juga muncul. Beberapa aktivis Hindu melakukan protes keras karena film itu menggambarkan ciuman mesra pasangan Hindu-Muslim. Mereka mengklaim bahwa film itu mendorong jihad cinta dan membakar sentimen agama.

Namun hal ini bisa menjadi masalah perselingkuhan ketika berkembang menjadi hubungan romantis kepada seseorang yang telah terikat hubungan dengan orang lain.

Cinta itu memang buta alias tidak logis tetapi membangun relasi romantis itu rasional. Kita bisa memilih dengan siapa akan berpacaran atau menikah tetapi kita tidak bisa menentukan dengan siapa dan kapan untuk jatuh cinta.

Bermula dari tudingan terhadap penyanyi religi muda isu pelakor meluas ke sejumlah selebritas Tanah Air. Padahal di luar dunia hiburan kasus pelakor pun mudah ditemukan. Kasus ini sering kali berfokus pada persaingan sesama perempuan sedangkan laki-laki yang terlibat seolah tak dipersalahkan.

”Asmara adalah hubungan timbal balik yang dibangun atas keinginan dua belah pihak tidak ada satu pihak yang merebut atau direbut pihak lain” kata peneliti hubungan romantis dan dosen psikologi Universitas Bina Nusantara Jakarta Pingkan CB Rumondor di Jakarta Sabtu (20/2/2021).

Yang bisa menjaga pernikahan hingga puluhan tahun itu bukanlah cinta tapi komitmen. (Pingkan CB Rumondor)

Cinta dalam perselingkuhan umumnya berawal dari kekaguman yang berkembang jadi ketertarikan pada orang yang telah memiliki hubungan dengan orang lain baik berbentuk pacaran atau pernikahan. Rasa itu muncul akibat tingginya paparan atau interaksi di antara keduanya bisa karena satu kantor satu pekerjaan atau menghadapi beban hidup yang sama.

Perasaan sama dan senasib itu membuat dua orang saling membuka diri hingga membangun kedekatan dan keintiman. Saat itulah berbagai zat kimia atau neurotransmitter di otak akan saling bekerja hingga membuat mereka jatuh cinta.

Saat jatuh cinta (limerence) seseorang akan merasa berbunga-bunga deg-degan nyaman dan selalu memikirkan si dia. Apakah orang yang dicintai itu sudah terikat komitmen dengan orang lain atau belum tidak akan terpikirkan. Risiko yang terjadi akibat hubungan terlarang itu juga tak masuk dalam pertimbangan.

”Saat jatuh cinta otak yang mengatur emosi menjadi lebih aktif sedangkan otak yang berperan dalam berpikir logis tidak aktif” tambahnya.

”Walau secara sosiologis tidak lazim tetapi dalam neurosains jatuh cinta pada orang yang sudah memiliki hubungan dengan orang lain adalah normal” kata ahli neurosains dan perilaku sosial dan Dekan Fakultas Kedokteran Universitas Pembangunan Nasional Veteran Jakarta Taufiq Pasiak.

Rasa cinta tidak harus selalu diteruskan menjadi hubungan romantis. Terlebih jika salah satu atau kedua orang yang jatuh cinta itu masih terikat hubungan dengan orang lain. Namun beberapa orang tidak mampu menimbang dan memperturutkan emosinya hingga akhirnya terjebak dalam perselingkuhan.

Karena munculnya ketertarikan pada pacar atau suami/istri orang adalah manusiawi dan wajar Pingkan menyarankan orang yang mengalami hal itu untuk menerimanya bukan terus membantahnya. Penyangkalan atas rasa cinta pada orang lain yang sudah memiliki hubungan justru bisa membuat rasa cinta kian menggebu-gebu hingga makin sulit menghindari perselingkuhan.

”Penerimaan atas rasa cinta yang muncul justru bisa membantu berpikir jernih” katanya. Pengakuan atas cinta pada orang yang salah justru bisa membuat seseorang lebih ikhlas menerima kenyataan hingga mempermudah menghindari membangun hubungan dengan orang tersebut.

AFP/MARVIN RECINO Pasangan yang baru menikah turut ambil bagian dalam acara pernikahan massal 44 pasangan yang diselenggarakan oleh pemerintah kota selama perayaan Hari Saint Valentine di Taman Cuscatlan di San Salvador Nikaragua di tengah pandemi Covid-19 Minggu (14/2/2021).

Namun proses berpikir atau menilai untuk mengembangkan cinta yang muncul ke dalam sebuah hubungan itu butuh kedewasaan berpikir dan kematangan emosi. Kondisi itu membuat remaja atau orang dewasa muda yang jatuh cinta pada orang yang sudah memiliki pasangan butuh bimbingan orangtua.

”Terkadang apa yang dianggap remaja sebagai cinta sebenarnya bukan cinta. Bisa jadi hanya kekaguman rasa nyaman atau keinginan mendapat perlindungan saja” tambah Taufiq.

Menjaga komitmen

Tidak ada orang yang punya niat untuk selingkuh karena jatuh cinta bisa terjadi kapan saja di mana saja kepada siapa saja. Interaksi dalam lingkunganlah yang membuat jatuh cinta dengan seseorang yang sudah dimiliki orang lain bisa muncul. Namun sebagai makhluk sosial interaksi itu sulit dihindari.

Untuk menghindari perselingkuhan menurut Taufiq hanya ada dua pilihan: menghindari atau justru menghadapi lingkungan itu. ”Pilihan ini terkait dengan kemampuan seseorang mengendalikan dirinya” katanya.

Mereka yang yakin mampu mengendalikan diri untuk tidak masuk dalam perselingkuhan bisa tetap berinteraksi dengan orang yang dicintai itu seperti sebelum rasa cinta itu muncul. Namun mereka yang tidak yakin cukup berinteraksi seperlunya. Bagi pekerja kantor itu bisa dilakukan dengan interaksi sebatas kepentingan profesional saja tanpa perlu terlibat aktivitas di luar pekerjaan.

Meski demikian Pingkan mengingatkan masa munculnya bunga-bunga jatuh cinta hingga terbangunnya keintiman emosional maupun kedekatan fisik dan seksual itu tidak bertahan lama hanya sekitar 2 tahun. Setelah itu bunga-bunga cinta itu akan turun. Pada saat itulah yang bisa menjaga kelanggengan hubungan romantis hanyalah komitmen.

”Yang bisa menjaga pernikahan hingga puluhan tahun itu bukanlah cinta tapi komitmen” kata Pingkan. Perselingkuhan sejatinya terjadi karena komitmen yang rendah. Karena itu laki-laki atau perempuan yang kurang puas dengan pernikahan atau hubungan yang dijalani lebih rentan berselingkuh.

Terbatasnya waktu munculnya cinta hingga terbentuknya ikatan emosional itu juga dipengaruhi kerja dopamin dalam tubuh. Dopamin adalah neurotransmitter di otak yang terkait dengan pencarian penghargaan atau kepuasan. Hormon ini berpengaruh besar dalam menentukan intensitas cinta dan keterikatan seseorang dalam hubungan asmara.

Masalahnya seperti ditulis Sebasitian Ocklenburg dosen biopsikologi di Institut Neurosains Kognitif Universitas Ruhr Jerman di Psychology Today 19 Desember 2020 dopamin bisa mengirimkan sinyal yang salah tentang penghargaan. Hadiah atau penghargaan yang besar tidak otomatis akan menaikkan dopamin di otak.

RM Kendati masih dalam kondisi pandemi Covid-19 kegiatan itu tetap banyak menarik perhatian pasangan muda untuk turut serta.

Sebagai gambaran orang yang menginginkan hadiah motor tetapi mendapat mobil dia akan melepaskan dopamin dalam jumlah besar. Namun orang yang mengharap mobil dan mendapat mobil maka dopamin yang dilepaskan tidak akan besar.

Karena itu dalam hubungan pernikahan atau komitmen jangka panjang saat perasaan di antara pasangan makin biasa-biasa saja tidak ada kejutan-kejutan dalam hubungan romantis di antara keduanya jumlah dopamin di otak tidak akan banyak. Jika terus dibiarkan rasa cinta dalam sebuah hubungan akan semakin turun.

Secara sederhana Pingkan menganalogikan cinta seperti mesin yang harus dirawat atau dipanaskan secara konsisten. Manusia tidak bisa berharap cinta yang tumbuh di masa lalu akan terus menjaganya karena cinta memang ada batas waktunya.

Penting bagi suami-istri untuk terus menjaga dan merawat cinta kepada pasangannya. Saat seseorang bertekad membangun komitmen dalam relasi romantis dia seharusnya juga siap untuk terus-menerus berusaha menjaga dan memperkuat komitmen itu.

Untuk menjaga komitmen dan menghindarkan diri dari perselingkuhan seseorang perlu fokus pada hal positif atau kelebihan pasangannya serta tidak gampang membandingkan pasangannya dengan orang lain.

Saat seseorang merasa hubungan yang dijalaninya membosankan berat dan tidak sehat komunikasikanlah dengan pasangan apa yang membuatnya tertekan dan tidak bahagia dalam menjalani hubungan. Sampaikan apa yang Anda inginkan atau butuhkan dari pasangan.

Selain itu agar hubungan romantis yang dijalani senantiasa memberi penghargaan atau kebahagiaan lakukanlah hal-hal baru yang menegangkan bersama pasangan. Menonton bareng mengerjakan hal baru bersama atau mencoba situasi baru dalam hubungan seksual bisa dijadikan pilihan kegiatan untuk ’memanaskan mesin’ cinta.

”Munculkan lagi rasa deg-degan dan berbunga-bunga seperti saat awal jatuh cinta” katanya. Menjaga hubungan romantis itu butuh investasi waktu energi dan biaya. Semakin tinggi investasi yang dilakukan makin besar pula komitmen yang dihasilkan untuk menjaga hubungan.

Hanya dari hubungan yang dijaga dan dirawatlah kepuasan seseorang atas relasi romantis yang dibangunnya bisa tetap terjaga. Ikatan cinta atau pernikahan yang menghasilkan lebih banyak penghargaan (reward) daripada pengorbanan (cost) akan memberikan kepuasan lebih besar hingga bisa menjaga hubungan yang dibangun dari perselingkuhan.

Meski tak dijelaskan secara gamblang keputusan Glenca berhenti bermain media sosial namun kita doakan agar ia terus maju dan tetap fokus dengan kehidupannya sebagai publik figur.

Glenca Chysara sukses memerankan peran antagonis sebagai Elsa di sinetron Ikatan Cinta. Memiliki sifat antagonis dan terus menganggu Amanda Manopo dan Arya Saloka membuat Glenca Chysara banjir hujatan. Walau begitu Glenca justru senang karena aktingnya sebagai karakter antagonis berhasil.

The Loboes (18-3) scored the first seven points with the Panthers' first bucket coming at the 4:35 mark of the first quarter. Cisco extended its seven-point lead to 26-15 at halftime.

The Loboes outscored Seymour 16-7 in the third period including a 9-2 stretch in the final two minutes to put the game out of reach.

The Panthers (21-6) couldn't get going against Cisco's 2-3 zone. Seymour coach Rusty Gilbreath said the Loboes were even better defensively than they appeared on tape.

""They were a lot faster and more physical than we even realized on film once we got to play them in person"" Gilbreath said. ""They increased their intensity and their energy level really good. And you have to this deep in the playoffs. You have to increase all that stuff and get after it. They did a good job.""

Loboes coach Kevin Hearne was pleased too. The coach's focus entering the game was containing senior guard Grant Wright who finished with a team-high 14 points.

""We played excellent defense"" Hearne said. ""Seymour all the film we had on them was mainly (against) man (defense). (Wright) I don't know if you could tell towards the end of the game (he) can really take over games. We thought the zone would kind of slow him down as far as penetrating in. They have some good shooters but we've played teams with good shooters in the past in our zone and we can cover out on good shooters.

""That was the key. The basic 2-3 zone came in big for us today.""

Layne Edgar led Cisco with 19 points and Stephen Bird followed with 16. Hearne felt the team had opportunities for more but he'll take the third-round win.

""We played OK offensively enough to win the game"" Hearne said. ""I'll be honest with you I thought we left a lot of opportunities on the floor tonight. Not saying that Seymour didn't cause that their physicality and us getting bumped around more than normal...(Our guards) made enough plays to give us the win tonight.""

Both teams trudged through a contest that featured 44 fouls — 21 on Cisco and 23 on Seymour. Gilbreath didn't blame the whistles for keeping his team out of rhythm and Hearne was glad the referees made calls on the physical Panthers bunch.

""Seymour is extremely physical"" Hearne said. ""When they played Tolar earlier in the week the refs didn't call fouls. Tolar had a lot of trouble dealing with their physicalness. I was glad we had fouls called tonight. That was the first time we've been in foul trouble in months. But I appreciate it because they were in more foul trouble than we were.""

Cisco advances to face Bogata Rivercrest in the region semifinals.

The Rebels (23-2) are ranked No. 6 in the final Texas Association of Basketball Coaches poll. Rivercrest finished second in district to No. 5 McLeod which fell to unranked Wolfe City 60-54 in the region quarterfinals.

Plainly the sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon a definition of the word liberty.”

On 9 March the case California Department of Fair Employment and Housing vs Cisco Systems Sundar Iyer & Ramana Kompella will come up for hearing before a state court in California. Last June the DFEH filed suit before a federal court alleging that the IT giant Cisco had failed to address discrimination and harassment against one of its engineers anonymised as “John Doe” by two others Iyer and Kompella. John Doe a Dalit had accused Iyer and Kompella both Brahmins of prejudiced treatment on the basis of his caste. The DFEH later withdrew the case from the federal court and filed in the state court instead. (It is generally believed that Californian state law has stronger anti-discrimination protections than US federal law.)

The Cisco case is being widely watched as a potential landmark in the United States which does not have laws that recognise or punish discrimination on the basis of caste. It has also caught the attention of the Hindu American Foundation an advocacy group that claims to speak for all Hindus in the United States and is closely aligned with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh a right-wing organisation promoting the divisive ideology of Hindutva in India and across the world. In February the HAF filed a motion to intervene in the case. The document claimed that the HAF was acting “to protect the religious freedoms of Hindu Americans … from the unconstitutional efforts of the State of California to decide the scope and nature of Hindu religious teachings and practices. In this case the DFEH claims that caste-based discrimination is religious discrimination because the caste system is ‘a strict Hindu social and religious hierarchy’ and therefore an integral part of Hindu teachings and practices.”

On its website the HAF wrote that “California’s actions blatantly violate the rights of Hindu Americans. The US Constitution prohibits the state from interfering in questions of religious doctrine and prevents the state from depriving any American of their right to liberty.” Further “In the United States there is no role for government to define our religious beliefs whether it be Hinduism Islam Judaism Christianity or any other. In fact the Constitution expressly prohibits it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL2FtZXJpY2Fua2FoYW5pLmNvbS9wZXJzcGVjdGl2ZXMvdGhlLWNhc2UtYWdhaW5zdC1jaXNjby10aGUtaW1wZXJhdGl2ZS1vZi1vdXRsYXdpbmctY2FzdGUtZGlzY3JpbWluYXRpb24taW4tdGhlLXVuaXRlZC1zdGF0ZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Case Against Cisco: The Imperative of Outlawing Caste Discrimination in the United States,"On July 30 2020 a lawsuit was filed against Silicon Valley tech giant Cisco by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleging workplace discrimination based on caste. Over 70 percent of workers in Silicon Valley companies are immigrants and more than 40 percent are Indian immigrants; and the majority of Indian Americans are Hindu.

As progressive Hindus our biggest priority is to address every kind of injustice and discrimination in our society from a Hindu perspective — particularly caste discrimination since our religion has had the biggest role in this atrocity which dates back thousands of years and still exists today.

Some Hindus argue that the caste system is not intrinsic to Hinduism and that untouchability was outlawed at the time of independence and is not practiced today. We take issue with both assertions.

We are Hindus who are committed to both preserving the inclusive heart of our faith and also vehemently reject the parts that are inhumane. It simply isn’t true that Hinduism has no relationship to caste. Chapter 10:90 of our oldest known scripture the Rig Veda (a shruti text considered to be transmitted from God to the sages of that time) outlines the four-fold varna system:

“When they divided Purusa how many portions did they make?

What do they call his mouth his arms? What do they call his thighs and feet?

The Brahman was his mouth of both his arms was the Rajanya made.

His thighs became the Vaisya from his feet the Sudra was produced.”

(From Ralph T.H. Griffith’s translation of the Rig Veda)

It is inhumanity of an unfathomable order for any of us to suggest that the caste system and the discrimination that results from it are vestiges of the past.

Some argue this is merely a pragmatic division of labor and there is no hierarchy between those who came from God’s head and feet but this is disingenuous. To us it is self-evident that this passage treats the Brahmins who purportedly came from God’s head as the highest caste and the Sudras who purportedly came from God’s feet as the lowest caste.

This is the most horrific thing we learned from our elders about caste which we object to vociferously — that our faith requires us to place our brothers and sisters in such a dehumanizing hierarchy. We and our colleagues in Hindus for Human Rights embrace a love-centered Hinduism that rejects caste entirely and which insists that all of us regardless of race religion caste gender are equally deserving of dignity and justice.

The group of people who were formerly called “untouchables” today self-respectfully refer to themselves as Dalits. “Untouchable” castes are mentioned repeatedly in Hindu scriptures. For instance the Bhagavata Purana includes the story of King Rantideva.

King Rantideva is the most beloved devotee of Lord Vishnu because he sees God equally in everyone including a “chandala” a person of an “untouchable” caste. While the story tells us that the ideal devotee sees all people equally it also tells us that there were people of “untouchable” castes in ancient South Asia.

Another undeniable fact is that untouchability persists today. While the practice may have been outlawed in India we know from personal experience that untouchability is still practiced today. “Servants” don’t eat the same food eat on the same plates or sit on the same furniture as the families they work for. There is a special caste of people — the lowest among the Dalit castes — who clean people’s toilets. In the South people still refer to these people as scavengers. And the people who clean India’s sewers known as manual scavengers are almost all from the Dalit community. Manual scavengers all too frequently die while doing their job: they either drown in the sewage or they die from breathing the toxic fumes.

It is inhumanity of an unfathomable order for any of us to suggest that the caste system and the discrimination that results from it are vestiges of the past. It makes sense that we Indians have brought the caste system with us to the lands we have emigrated to. While caste discrimination is not as extreme in the United States as it is in India it nevertheless exists. It especially rears its ugly head at the time of marriage when families look for upper-caste partners for their children.

The case against Cisco alleges that upper-caste managers in the company have discriminated against a Dalit worker because of his/her caste. As Hindus who have seen discrimination based on caste throughout our lives in extreme ways in India and more subtle but undeniable ways in the United States we applaud the Dalit complainants in this case for coming forward.

We believe it is up to so-called upper caste Hindus to call out and denounce casteism every time we encounter it and furthermore to live and build a Hindu faith and practice that rejects caste entirely. We are honored to have played an “ally” role in support of an anti-caste organization called Ambedkar International Center (AIC) that has filed an amicus brief in this case against Cisco.

The next hearing date for the case is March 9th when a judge will likely decide if caste is admissible as grounds for workplace discrimination or not and whether the case can go forward. We hope AIC’s strong amicus brief persuades the judge that caste discrimination is illegal under California’s civil rights law which clearly states that discrimination on the basis of ancestry is illegal.

What is now The CW‘s most senior Arrowverse series had to cut Season 6 short by three episodes when production was halted almost a year ago. A version of those leftover episodes will now launch Season 7 on Tuesday March 2 and soon enough close the book on Graphic Novel No. 3 (which saw Efrat Dor’s Eva McCulloch trap Candice Patton’s Iris West inside the Mirrorverse).

TVLine spoke with showrunner Eric Wallace about how the conclusion of the Mirrorverse arc changed over the course of the supersized hiatus how a depleted Team Flash will resort to “extreme measures” to shatter Eva’s devious dreams the uniquely interesting journey ahead for one character and much more.

TVLINE | You ended last season with three unfinished episodes. Did it in fact wind up taking all three to finish the Eva McCulloch arc?

I don’t know if it’s a spoiler or not if I can say that but with the early part of the season we do address last year’s cliffhanger. In the first few episodes we’ll be getting Iris out of the Mirrorverse all those good things and we will be wrapping up the Eva McCulloch storyline — before launching into a brand-new Graphic Novel.

TVLINE | You had a long summer and then some to noodle with those leftover episodes. Outside of the whole Ralph thing (cast member Hartley Sawyer was fired in June) did you end up making any changes?

Yes the first and the third episodes of the season changed. The first changed about 20 percent let’s say. Our premiere was not intended to be a premiere so we had to give it an entirely new opening that had more Flash-y action because people want to see Flash (played by Grant Gustin) and Eva McCulloch in her Mirror costume. We had to re-engineer the entire first third of the premiere which was a really fun challenge but I think it made the episode much stronger.

In order to then wrap up Eva’s story there was an episode early in the season that literally we had to change almost half of it. That was also due to COVID too. Usually to wrap up a storyline we have hundreds of extras and all of these things going on in downtown Vancouver we blow up cars…. We have a sense of scale and spectacle to end the Big Bad and we couldn’t do that because of COVID but we still had to have spectacle — so how do you do that? And we had to deal with the loss of a cast member in the Elongated Man who was very wrapped up in that story because we have to exonerate Sue [of Joseph Carver’s murder]….

It was an incredible puzzle to finish Eva’s story but you make lemonade out of lemons and the episode is stronger as a result. We found clever ways to bring in scale by relying a bit more on visual effects and we had to rely more on character emotions and the actors themselves and how things were introduced and how twists were presented. When we wrap up Eva’s story there are some real surprises for the audience that would not have existed in the same manner if there hadn’t been this COVID interruption.

TVLINE | What was it like looking at that first episode back where Iris is somewhere else Cisco (Carlos Valdes) is off the map Caitlin (Danielle Panabaker) is off the map Ralph is off the map…? Talk about the challenges and opportunities that presented.

It was an opportunity because Barry also is losing all of his speed at this point. Team Flash is at their lowest point which means they can’t fight so whatever happens will push them to extreme measures — and that is the plot of the season premiere. What extreme measures do they adopt and what are the consequences of that? Barry without all of his usual Team Flash helpers needs his speed back in order to fight Eva so you’ll see that happen… but maybe not in the way you thought.

TVLINE | Still trapped and at risk of going mad inside the Mirrorverse will Iris need to shift into a new gear in order to help save herself?

Well that’d be a spoiler…. Let’s just say you can’t get out of the Mirrorverse and not be unaffected when you return to real life. And what does that mean for Barry and Iris as a couple? Without spoilers it is very fair to say that once Iris gets out of the Mirrorverse yes she will rejoin Team Flash as an active member and help bring down the McCullochs once and for all.

TVLINE | Without spoiling it at all the premiere features one of the funniest sequences in the show’s history. Was that always in that episode or did it get added in?

That sequence — which I also think is one of the funniest things we’ve done in a long time — was always there. There would have been a little more of it though. Unfortunately we didn’t get to go as deeply into it.

TVLINE | Regardless it’s this great little burst of lightness amid an incredibly intense arc.

And that was on purpose. We were like it’s getting really intense here we need to have some laughs. This season premiere — not only with that sequence but one later on that is related to it — involves some of Grant Gustin’s best acting ever. It’s Grant at his finest.

TVLINE | Give me a little something about when Cisco (who went to visit Atlantis) and Caitlin/Frost (who went with their mom to recuperate from an injury) eventually return.

Caitlin because of COVID came back sooner than expected [since Panabaker’s maternity leave ended during the pandemic]; that was a real blessing. You won’t have to wait long at all for Caitlin and Frost to return and we actually added scenes to bring Frost in at least two to three episodes sooner than originally planned.

Same thing with Cisco. Let’s just say that he comes back wiser and with the skills and talents to help them defeat Eva.

TVLINE | After Eva we’re heading into Graphic Novel 3. In addition to No. 4 might there also be a 5 this season?

There will be Graphic Novels No. 3 and 4 two just like last year. After Eva look for two new Big Bads in their own Graphic Novels.

TVLINE | Might there be any overlap between Chillblaine and the Graphic Novel No. 4 villain?

It’s funny we have finished our first couple of Chillblaine episodes and I’m happy to report that they’re so great and so much fun that we may be adding more Chillblaine than we even anticipated. He may leak over into the fourth Graphic Novel which was not one of the plans. He was just supposed to be a part of Graphic Novel No. 3 but I’m happy to report that Jon Cor (pictured) is doing an amazing job and I think the fans are going to fall in love with him — a villain I hope they love to hate.

TVLINE | What are you plans for David Ramsey’s announced next visit as Arrow‘s John Diggle?

[Laughs] Oh boy that’s a spoiler. When we last saw Diggle he had a situation at the end of Arrow he needed to deal with so he arrives to help Team Flash in the back half of the season carrying the weight of that “problem.” The question is how can he help Team Flash when he has got something even bigger on his mind? And that’s what the story is.

TVLINE | I saw your quotes over the hiatus about Joe West’s upcoming storyline inspired by recent “societal changes.” How tricky is it bringing a real-life topic like that into a show like The Flash?

It’s tricky. You have to walk a fine line between being honest with the audience about social justice issues while also remembering that this is family-oriented entertainment so you can’t get too heavy. It has been tricky but I think we found a good balance and it helped us find what I think for Joe is his most interesting character journey yet. It’s going to take him to some very unexpected places and Jesse [L. Martin] has risen to the challenge and is knocking it outta the park.

Each man reaped a windfall of $70 million from an initial investment of $330000. Ever since the alchemy of leveraged buyouts has been dazzling.

Practitioners of leveraged buyouts who refer to themselves as part of the “private equity” industry are among the richest Americans. They use a whole lot of borrowed money and as little equity as possible to buy companies they perceive to be undervalued or poorly managed. They hope to flip them at a big profit a few years later.

The formula’s success has been stunning. Private equity firms once quaint partnerships are now publicly traded behemoths. Steve Schwarzman a co-founder of the powerful Blackstone Group with more than $600 billion under management is worth roughly $23 billion. Leon Black a co-founder of Apollo Global Management is worth about $10 billion.

But now the party could be ending. In a little-noticed December ruling in a case involving a failed 2014 leveraged buyout Jed S. Rakoff a federal judge in the Southern District of New York threw some sand into the otherwise well-lubricated gears of what has been a 40-year financial bonanza. It’s about time we started asking tough questions about the ramifications of loading up companies with huge amounts of debt they will surely have difficulty repaying.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1bGYtdGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5LzY4NTY4Mi9jaXRpcy1jb3JiYXQtaGFzLXBhcnRpbmctd29yZHMtYmFua2luZy1pcy1xdWlja2x5LWNoYW5naW5n0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ3VsZi10aW1lcy5jb20vc3RvcnkvNjg1NjgyL2NpdGlzLWNvcmJhdC1oYXMtcGFydGluZy13b3Jkcy1iYW5raW5nLWlzLXF1aWNrbHktY2hhbmdpbmcvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Citi’s Corbat has parting words: Banking is quickly changing| Gulf Times,"Michael Corbat CEO of Citigroup speaks during the Bloomberg Global Business Forum in New York. Corbat’s departure comes as Citigroup is facing fresh scrutiny from regulators about its underlying technology and internal controls work that will continue on Fraser’s watch.

Citigroup Inc’s Michael Corbat warned that the world of banking is quickly changing in his final message as chief executive officer to the bank’s hundreds of thousands of employees.

Corbat who will be succeeded by Jane Fraser on today said customers are increasingly looking for financial services to be more personalised and delivered in a faster and simpler way.

A decade after the financial crisis the chiefs of the largest US banks faced a grilling from lawmakers on everything from income inequality to their ties to politically controversial industries.

“As I pass the reins to Jane I can confidently say that this 208-year-old institution has its best days ahead” Corbat said in a memo to staff. “I cannot wait to see how Citi helps shape this new world.”

Corbat 60 reflected on the morning 38 years ago when he was headed to an interview for the training programme at Salomon Brothers one of Citigroup’s predecessor firms.

“I woke up to catch a flight to New York City only to discover that my car had been stolen” Corbat said in the memo noting he eventually made his way to New York and was offered a spot in the prestigious programme. “Not exactly an auspicious beginning to my career.”

The bank has been investing in its wholesale business in Brazil to take advantage of project-finance deals mergers and acquisitions and capital-markets offerings.

He spent decades climbing Citigroup’s ranks with stops as head of the franchise in Europe the Middle East and Africa and a stint overseeing the unit that housed assets marked for sale in the aftermath of the financial crisis. He was named CEO in 2012.

“I have loved every job I’ve had at Citi” Corbat said. “But serving as your CEO has been the honor of a lifetime.”

Corbat’s departure comes as the bank is facing fresh scrutiny from regulators about its underlying technology and internal controls work that will continue on Fraser’s watch.

She’s also taking over as the world continues to grapple with the deadly coronavirus pandemic hindering economic growth and sending unemployment soaring. That’s meant the bank has had to set aside more in reserves to cover potentially souring loans pressuring profits. Still it’s a far cry from the firm’s performance during the financial crisis when Citigroup drew a larger bailout than any other US bank and was forced to sell almost $1tn of subprime assets and exit dozens of businesses.

“Think about how far this bank has come over the last decade” Susan Katzke an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG said on Thursday at a virtual conference.

During his tenure as CEO Corbat became known for taking daring stances on social issues. The firm was the first major company to offer a frank assessment of the difference in wages it pays to men and women and remains one of the few companies to continue to do so today.

And when outcry over gun violence engulfed the US in 2018 Corbat announced the bank would prohibit retailers that are customers of the firm from offering bump stocks or selling firearms to people who haven’t passed a background check or are younger than 21.

“As CEO I’ve been determined to keep our mission and purpose front and centre” Corbat said in his parting memo. “As a global bank we must never forget the tremendous influence Citi can have on society.”

This title is not synonymous with a chief sales officer chief customer service officer or even a chief marketing officer.

The latest position to join the C-Suite is an individual who is solely responsible for owning a brand or family of brands thus the title of Chief Brand Officer.

According to Wikipedia a Chief Brand Officer or CBO “is a relatively new executive-level position at a corporation company organization or agency which typically reports to the CEO or Board of Directors and is responsible for a brand’s image experience and promise. The brand officer oversees marketing advertising design public relations and customer service. Organizations that have established a CBO position include the American Automobile Association Baskin-Robbins Boston Market Citigroup McDonald’s Mattel Lululemon Athletica – to name just a few.”

No matter who owns the brand or brands in your organization there are three key responsibilities for the individual in this role.

This means that all your digital assets including your main website your blog and all your social media accounts reflect the same look and feel; and make sure all your printed collateral also reflects the same look and feel (brochures newsletters flyers annual reports etc.). Make sure they all provide the same description about your company and brand feature the same logo and/or tagline and include the same color palette. For example you would not trust a site with a purple Coca-Cola logo – those iconic red and white colors are as famous as the product they represent.

Second make sure your brand has a clear and defined voice.

If you provide professional services for example legal or financial services you may use formal language that matches your industry. But if you sell consumer products your ads and emails may be full of informal lingo to connect with your audience. Depending on your industry there may be appropriate words that would be considered essential to include in your brand messaging. For example professional sports have terminology that is important in their branding – football ads can easily integrate “touchdowns” and “hail Mary’s” and baseball ads can easily integrate “home runs” and “shut outs.” And if your product is more appropriate for a specific age group keep appropriate words and phrases in mind.

Third create brand advocates.

As the owner of your brand you want to welcome employees into the branding process so that they understand their importance in sharing your brand story with the world. Since all employees are brand advocates take the time to educate employees about your brand’s strengths during the onboarding phase and also re-train on a regular basis. Make the training fun and always have a smile on all leaders’ faces.

According to Ideon Agency “Brands are more decentralized than ever. The brand ecosystem is more complex. A Chief Brand Officer can elevate consumer insights from leading the living brand presence to driving the business forward. The true role of the CBO is not to dictate a brand to consumers rather it is to create the values that earn brands real lasting reputations. A great CBO above all else creates a unified culture that ensures that all of an organization’s wide-ranging efforts are inspired by consumers’ real feedback and aligned with the core brand story design and beliefs. Your CMO can broadcast your message but building a tribe around your brand requires a CBO. Take a page from most Fortune 100 companies: Hire a CBO now.”

So have you updated your thinking? Will you now consider adding a CBO to your C-Suite? And if you serve as the Chief Brand Officer for your organization what do you do on a daily basis to protect your brand promote it and create brand awareness? Please chime in.

Philadelphia has the highest incarceration rate of any big city in the country according to the city’s Office of Criminal Justice as well as the highest poverty rate among major cities and a growing affordable housing crisis.

These facts have a lot to do with one another. The reentry system locally and nationally is fraught with disconnected systems that offer formerly incarcerated individuals few resources to meet their desired goals. Individuals are often required to do things like obtaining gainful employment and secure housing despite the fact that increased background checks and technology advancements mean even a minor criminal record can negatively affect a person’s ability to obtain employment housing and transportation or further their education. This disconnect often leads to longer periods of supervision and re-incarceration.

But rather than a punitive approach that further penalizes a person for having a record on top of the punishment they have already served what if we looked for ways to remove barriers for returning citizens and help individuals build assets that could set them up for success in their lives after returning home?

One such model is the Supervision to Aid Re-Entry (STAR) program created in 2007 by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

The program engages 30-40 participants per year from Philadelphia with a high risk of recidivism for violent crime. Participants attend 26 court sessions in front of a judge for 52 weeks and if they successfully complete the program they receive a full year off their term of supervised release.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pZGRsZWVhc3Rtb25pdG9yLmNvbS8yMDIxMDIyNy1sZWJhbmVzZS1jYW5ub3QtYWNjZXNzLW1vbmV5LWluLWJhbmtzLXNpbmNlLWxhdGUtMjAxOS_SAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWRkbGVlYXN0bW9uaXRvci5jb20vMjAyMTAyMjctbGViYW5lc2UtY2Fubm90LWFjY2Vzcy1tb25leS1pbi1iYW5rcy1zaW5jZS1sYXRlLTIwMTkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lebanon: Citizens cannot access money in banks since late 2019,"Allegations that authorities in Lebanon have smuggled money out of the country have sparked widespread anger here when one considers that Lebanese have not been able to withdraw money from banks since October 17 2019 Anadolu Agency reports.

Following protests that started in 2019 because of the financial crisis banks tightened limits on foreign currency withdrawals to $200 – $300 per week. And when the coronavirus pandemic began cash withdrawal from those accounts were completely halted and a limit was set on local currency.

While banks which face liquidity problems due to the crisis kept deposits of Lebanese for nearly one-and-a-half years on grounds of preventing an outflow of capital allegations that billions of dollars were transferred abroad by administrators caused an uproar.

Lebanese economists told Anadolu Agency that banks gave money belonging to customers to the Central Bank and in turn offered the deposits as loans to the state that is incapable of paying its debts.

Economic and political situation in Lebanon

The blast in the Port of Beirut in August 2020 created a new government crisis along with growing economic troubles in Lebanon which has long struggled with high public debt and unemployment.

Prime Minister Hassan Diyab’s government resigned August 10 2020 following the reactions after the explosion but a new government could not be established for months due to disagreements between political groups.

Considering the political forces and rulers as the cause of the economic crisis the people of Lebanon demand the establishment of a diminished government consisting of technocrats without sectarian political parties that have shared power for many years.

The country has established ways to determine and treat mental illness in citizens and has prioritized the mental well-being of all Germans since the 1990s. Mental health in Germany provides a blueprint for other countries to follow.

Mental Health in Germany

Germany has similar rates of mental illness to other developed nations with around 31% of Germans diagnosed with at least one mental illness. Like most other developed nations depression and anxiety rank the highest among adults but formed at a young age.

Surveys conducted by German health insurance company DAK revealed that 24% of 800000 tested children had some sort of psychological anomaly although less than 2% of those tested between the ages of 10 and 17 were diagnosed with depression.

What Makes Germany Different?

What makes Germany different from the rest of Europe in its fight against mental illness is its level of commitment to finding and treating the mentally ill. Those who suffer from some form of mental illness in Germany have a vast support system provided to them by their government.

Diagnosed German citizens have access to financial support and extensive healthcare services. Germany runs programs to ease the transition from a mental health hospital back to everyday life. It also has programs that provide the mentally ill with jobs. With roughly 270 mental health hospitals and sufficient healthcare workers to assist patients Germany makes sure that the mentally ill are taken care of.

Perhaps the most effective strategy Germany has employed is its campaign to remove the stigma of mental illness in German society. While one-third of adults suffer from some sort of mental illness during the course of their lives many do not seek the proper help because of the social stigma attached to mental illness.

Germany has dedicated extensive amounts of resources to create outreach campaigns that promote actively visiting psychologists and testing for mental illness. The country also works to reinforce the idea that seeking assistance for one’s mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of as a large portion of people suffer from them.

Recognizing that mental illness is just as common as physical illness is the first step toward curbing the epidemic. By encouraging citizens to assess their mental health and by providing the necessary support and opportunities for the mentally ill Germany successfully manages mental health in the country.

A Mental Health Role Model

Germany has taken great strides to ensure that those with mental illnesses are treated as well as any other citizen in the country and has worked hard to create normalcy for testing and treating mental illness.

In order to battle the mental illness epidemic countries with lacking mental healthcare systems should look to adopt Germany’s stance on battling mental illness providing not only psychiatric help to those who need it but also giving financial and occupational support to those at risk.

While 22-year-old Korda leads the LPGA event at Lake Nona the PGA Tour has taken over her home course The Concession in Bradenton Florida.

“I call it ‘Concussion’ ” said Korda. “That’s what I call it out there. Either you’re riding on a high with your confidence or you’re at a major low.”

Right now Korda is riding a high at Nona pacing a stacked board at 13 under after carding rounds of 67-68-68. For the record her best round at Concession is 6-under 66.

Korda’s older sister Jessica who turned 28 on Friday won the first LPGA event of the season. She’s six strokes back at 7 under.

“I told her she got a little sweet surprise back at her place” said Nelly who is looking to win her fourth career LPGA title and first on American soil.

Gainbridge LPGA: Leaderboard

Rookie Patty Tavatanakit trails Korda by one shot after carding a third-round 66 that included four birdies over the last five holes. She has her coach former PGA Tour winner Grant Waite on the bag this week and next. They focus on “what’s good enough good and great” a mental technique that helps keep her positive.

“There were a lot of great shots” she said of Saturday’s play.

World No. 1 Jin Young Ko who headlines a group at 10 under spent 20 minutes with her short game coach Gareth Raflewski on Friday after carding a 72 that included 34 putts. They quickly addressed an old habit of Ko’s and got her back on track. She had 29 putts in Saturday’s round.

“Instead of rotating around her spine angle she was tilting up and down like a see-saw which a lot of people think is the right way to putt” said Raflewski. “But when you’re tilting up and down like that it moves your head a lot. It also makes your right arm get very long in your backswing which shuts the face. And then on the way through you have to do something to compensate so you have to kind lift your left shoulder up and poke your left elbow out just to manage the clubface. It’s very inefficient for start line.”

The pair have worked together for three years but this week is the first they’ve spent time together in person since 2019 due to the pandemic.

Ko also credited her caddie David Brooker for giving her added motivation with a dinner bet. If she shot 4 under or better he’d buy take-out and deliver it.

Ko shot 66 to pull within a share of third and seeks to win her second consecutive title dating back to the 2020 CME Group Tour Championship in late December.

Angel Yin carded the day’s low round a 7-under 65 to climb join Ko at 10 under while Lexi Thompson birdied her last three holes and trails by four along with Chella Choi.

Round 3 wasn’t the best day for the two Nona residents who dominated early-week coverage. Lydia Ko held the lead heading into the weekend but dropped to three shots back after an even-par 72.

Annika Sorenstam who made the cut at age 50 in her first LPGA start since 2008 struggled to a 79.

“I think I’ll go hit some balls after lunch and figure out why I’m spinning the ball in different directions” said Sorenstam. “Normally I hit the ball straight and today was everything but straight.

“It’s hard to play this golf course when it’s windy and when you have some rough so maybe I have to tweak my swing a little bit. Not really sure what to tweak at the moment.”",,,,,,,,,

Wait I can almost hear you say it: ""Xi_b what? Let's move on where's the sports section?"" Ok if you need to please go. But do not underestimate excited Xi_b baryons. They are a helluva lot of fun to watch as they pop into existence and then decay in stages as if stripping piece by piece throwing out opaque layers of matter one by one and finally exposing their naked beauty in full bloom.Are you getting aroused yet? we are talking about a haDR-on here don't be mistaken but the matter is not less sexy than the stuff you'd get on the sports section anyway. For you know there is simply so much we still do not know about how quarks can create excited states of nuclear matter that one cannot ignore any new development.Just like protons and neutrons bind into atomic nuclei in ways that store enormous amounts of energy - something that was realized in the late thirties and led to nasty as well as fantastic new technology developments - also quarks bind into hadrons much in the same way and they too store ginormous energy in the bounds they make. One day that energy might become exploitable but please do not say you heard that for me or my career would be over. For now though it is just amazing to see the strip dance of the Xi_b states. But let me start from the beginning for those of you who are not familiar with this stuff.CMS is the acronym of the collaboration I work in. It stands for ""Compact Muon Solenoid"" although its participants have renamed it ""continuous meetings system"" for obscure reasons. It includes over 3000 scientists from all over the world who use the detector they have built at the beginning of this century to analyze the proton-proton (and heavy ion) collisions that are produced by energetic beams in the Large Hadron Collider the highest-energy proton-proton collider in operation at the CERN laboratories near Geneva Switzerland.Proton-proton collisions of very high energy often produce quarks of the ""third generation"" - the heavier replica of the three light ""up"" and ""down"" quarks that make up the proton and the neutron. Quarks in fact come in three generations as shown in the table below. The heaviest quarks are named ""top"" and ""bottom"". They are both extremely intriguing to study for a variety of reasons connected with questions such as whether the Universe is stable or it is capable to pull off the trick to quantum tunneling annihilating everything that there is just when you finally decided to buy a new car; or why there is more matter than antimatter around and why it matters.For all we can tell the bottom quark is a point-like matter particle while the proton is an extended object; and yet the former weights 4.3 times more than the latter. And that's peanuts if we take the top quark the heaviest of the lot: it weighs about 180 protons by itself.But let's focus on the bottom quark here. That particle can be produced in pairs with its anti-matter companion the anti-bottom quark in LHC collisions. When this happens the pair may end up traveling away together or each of the two quarks may be kicked away in different directions. In the first case there is a chance that the pair will create a so-called ""quarkonium"" state a meson made by a quark and antiquark of the same kind. Otherwise each of the lone (anti-)bottom quarks may find one or two companions to dress up as a hadron. That is because quarks cannot travel away from the interior of the proton-proton collision region alone as they carry a quantity colour charge which cannot exist in free space.So to neutralize their colour charge the lone bottom quarks need an antiquark companion carrying the opposite colour or two other quarks of different colour. The first scheme produces mesons - quark-antiquark bound states and the second produces baryons of which the proton and the neutron are the most notable examples and of which the Xi baryon the subject of this article is a very special one.The Xi_b baryon contains a bottom quark a strange quark and an up or down quark. Since the bottom quark is very heavy the Xi_b also is. The combination with a strange quark makes this particle more complicated to produce than other bottom-rich baryons so it is a very rare particle. But its decays are quite striking as the bottom quark lives a long life and when it decays it does so in very distinguishable ways. But the Xi_b is not the particle CMS discovered.What CMS found was a signal of the doubly excited Xi_b particle Xi_b**. That baryon can exist in excited states ready to de-excite with the emission of the extra energy is a thing that makes them even more similar to atomic nuclei than they already were. But the de-excitation results in the emission of strong force carriers - gluons - and not gamma rays (photons) as atomic nuclei emit. Those gluons eventually materialize into pions through complex processes that materialize bound states of quark-antiquark pairs (that is what pions are).To prove that you see a Xi_b** particle you need to see those two pions and then detect the very striking sequence of decays that transmutes the Xi_b (now rid of the asterisks as it has de-excited) into ordinary matter - matter that is made of quarks of the first generation up and down. There are in reality two different main ways for this to happen.The first way a Xi_b may decay is by emitting a J/Psi meson and a Xi baryon. The former is a quarkonium state made up by a pair of charm quarks and the latter is made up of two strange quarks and a down quark. The Xi can then decay to a Lambda baryon and a pion and the Lambda finally decays to a proton and a pion. As you see a lot is going on: by tracking these cascade of decays the CMS physicists can reconstruct the mass of each of the intermediate particles so the background that mimics the chain is reduced significantly.One should also note that the J/Psi meson is seen by detecting its decay into a pair of opposite-charge muons. Not all J/Psi particles decay this way (in fact only 6% of them do) but by selecting such decay modes is a great way to ensure that one is not fooled by backgrounds.In the second decay mode the Xi_b makes more of a show as it produces a J/Psi a Lambda baryon and a kaon simultaneously. In reality a soft photon may also be emitted but that is a detail that does not belong here. In any case the resulting Lambda baryon also successively decays to a proton-pion pair and the decay is no less spectacular.Below you can see a graph I drew to explain what is really going on in one of these decays. The thing to note is that the successive decays are mediated by the weak the electromagnetic or the strong interaction. The weak interaction takes place by the presence of a W boson; the electromagnetic one has the photon as its vector and the strong interaction has the gluon as a mediator. The W can change the flavour of quarks it couples to but the photon and the gluon cannot - that is why the chain from bottom to charm to strange to up quark is always produced by the intercession of a W; instead the materialization of a up-antiup pair in the first diagram is due to a strong interaction.In the diagram which you should read left to right each circle (okay I am not Giotto - let's call them ellipsoids) represents a particle. Continuous lines represent the propagation of matter particles: quarks and muons (there's nothing else in the pic although of course if there were electrons they would also get lines). Lines have an arrow that distinguishes particles (forward-going) from antiparticles (backward oriented). The dotted line is a W boson the wiggly line is a photon and the curly line is a gluon.So the diagram reads: ""A Xi_b comes in and soon a weak interaction changes its bottom quark into a charm quark. The W boson materializes an anticharm-strange pair and the anticharm merges with the charm to form a J/Psi meson; the latter then decays by annihilating the pair into a photon which subsequently materializes a muon pair. Meanwhile the baryon has now become a (sds) one -it is a Sigma baryon although I did not labeled it as such in the diagram. One of the strange quarks in the Sigma soon emits a gluon; the gluon materializes an up-antiup pair of which the latter merges with the strange quark to form a negative kaon. The baryon is now a Lambda with constituents (uds). The Lambda baryon now has its strange quark emit a W boson turning into an up quark; this up quark merges with an anti-down quark materialized by the W boson forming a negative pion. The baryon now has a (uud) composition and it is a perfectly stable proton.Of all particles at the end of this decay chain only the proton is stable: the pion the kaon and the muon will all decay by weak interactions eventually yielding electrons (in total 3 electrons and one positron) and as many as eight neutrinos.One further thing to note is that quark lines track the colour (or anticolour) carried by these particles. By looking at the graphs you realize how you cannot destroy colour as if you have three colour lines in the initial state you will end up with three lines in the final state. That's reassuring: we are made of protons and it is precisely that property that ensures the stability of our atoms!Below I have seconded my urge to show you the nice ""peaks"" that the reconstructed masses of these particles make in CMS data.First of all the baseline signal of Xi_b decays which are reconstructed before an attempt is made at associating to these particles a couple more pion candidate tracks:Above the black points are CMS data and the red curve is the fit to the sum of signal (green) and background contributions. On the left the Xi_b signal found in J/Psi Xi final states is cleaner than the one on the right which is ridden with higher combinatorial backgrounds. In addition a significant part of the data on the right is constituted by ""partly reconstructed decays"" where a photon was lost.And then the Xi_b** which are extracted in the ""mass difference"" variable:The trick of taking the combined invariant mass of all observed particles in the final state and subtracting off the known mass of the individual bodies is as old as Pithagoras or something like that. Here you can see that the mass difference sharply peaks at the ""released energy"" that is the surplus of mass-energy possessed by the decaying Xi_b particle. From these signals CMS is capable of measuring the Xi_b** mass with sub-MeV precision.There would be a lot to say about the signals the backgrounds underneath and their resolution how they are reconstructed etcetera but I guess that if you are curious about this information you are likely good enough for reading it directly in the preprint...",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuaW4vc2NpZW5jZS9oZWFsdGgvbmV3cy8zLXJlYXNvbnMteW91LW1heS1ub3QtZmVlbC10aGUtZnVsbC1lZmZlY3RzLW9mLWNhZmZlaW5lLWFuZC1hbHRlcm5hdGl2ZXMtd2F5cy10by1ib29zdC15b3VyLWVuZXJneS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MTIzNzMwOS5jbXPSAbIBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmluL3NjaWVuY2UvaGVhbHRoL25ld3MvMy1yZWFzb25zLXlvdS1tYXktbm90LWZlZWwtdGhlLWZ1bGwtZWZmZWN0cy1vZi1jYWZmZWluZS1hbmQtYWx0ZXJuYXRpdmVzLXdheXMtdG8tYm9vc3QteW91ci1lbmVyZ3kvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgxMjM3MzA5LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 reasons you may not feel the full effects of caffeine and alternatives ways to boost your energy,"If caffeine does not affect you it may be due to your genetics lack of sleep or increased tolerance.

does not affect you it may be due to your genetics lack of sleep or increased tolerance. To boost your energy without caffeine try exercising going outside or eating a healthy snack.

If you drink multiple caffeinated drinks without feeling a boost of energy you may have a caffeine tolerance. A caffeine tolerance limits or completely blocks you from feeling the effects of caffeine.

Here are three possible reasons caffeine doesn't affect you and alternative ways to wake up.

1. Caffeine may not affect you due to your genetics

Your genetics may be to blame if you can't feel caffeine's stimulating effects.

What the research says: In a 2011 study researchers found that about 10% of people carry a gene that makes them hyposensitive to caffeine allowing for a high caffeine intake while experiencing little to no effect.

After ingesting caffeine it takes about 45 minutes for the body to absorb it. Then caffeine molecules quickly move to the brain. Once there they bind to receptors normally paired with adenosine a neurotransmitter that encourages sleep. This action blocks adenosine from reaching those receptors thereby inhibiting sleepiness.

""Genetics can play a factor in caffeine sensitivity because genetics determines how effectively the body's adenosine receptors can bind to caffeine molecules"" Jenna Liphart Rhoads PhD a registered nurse and nurse educator at Nurse Together.

Additionally how quickly you feel caffeine's effects and for how long depends on your genetics. An enzyme in the liver called CYP1A2 is responsible for 95% of caffeine metabolization. However there are two forms of CYP1A2 one of which will metabolize caffeine faster than the other meaning you feel less of the stimulant's effects. Which form you have depends on your genetics.

2. Caffeine may not affect you because you've built a tolerance

You may also not feel a buzz from your morning cup of coffee because you've built up a tolerance. When you continue to consume caffeine at a higher quantity or frequency the body becomes less sensitive to it. As a result the caffeine needed to have the same effect you've experienced before increases.

The recommended maximum dosage of caffeine is 400 mg per day which is about four cups of coffee. If you're no longer experiencing the stimulating effects of caffeine at that limit you may have built too high a tolerance as drinking more than this can cause negative effects like headaches or insomnia.

If you are no longer affected by caffeine try taking a break.

""People can reduce their tolerance to caffeine by tapering down their use of caffeine"" says Morgyn Clair a registered dietitian nutritionist. ""Taking a caffeine break can help the body become more sensitive to caffeine's effects.""

However if you're dependent on caffeine quitting cold turkey can cause headaches and irritability. Therefore it's best to slowly taper off caffeine use.

The break's length will depend on how desensitized you are and a nutritionist can provide you with a personalized estimate.

3. Caffeine may not affect you because you're fatigued

Caffeine isn't a cure-all when it comes to fighting sleepiness.

""If someone is extremely fatigued and worn-out caffeine may not alert you and adequate sleep is what the body needs"" Rhoads.

If you haven't been getting enough uninterrupted rest recently try going to bed earlier by using a sleep meditation.

Caffeine alternatives to help you wake up

Stay hydrated. ""Dehydration is a huge contributor to fatigue"" says Clair. Drinking enough water can also help you sleep longer. In a large 2019 study of Chinese and US individuals researchers found sleeping six hours a night was associated with a higher chance of inadequate hydration than sleeping eight hours a night.

Insider's takeaway

Factors such as genetics overconsumption of caffeine and a lack of good quality sleep can cause you to not feel the full effects of caffeine. Limiting or cutting back entirely on the amount of caffeine you consume may help to lower your tolerance. Getting adequate rest can also help you feel more substantial effects from caffeine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vc3dhcmFqeWFtYWcuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvaWlzYy1zY2llbnRpc3RzLWNvbnRyaWJ1dGUtdG8ta2V5LWZpbmRpbmctb24taGlnZ3MtYm9zb24tc2VsZi1pbnRlcmFjdGlvbtIBc2h0dHBzOi8vc3dhcmFqeWFtYWcuY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9zY2llbmNlL2lpc2Mtc2NpZW50aXN0cy1jb250cmlidXRlLXRvLWtleS1maW5kaW5nLW9uLWhpZ2dzLWJvc29uLXNlbGYtaW50ZXJhY3Rpb24?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IISc Scientists Contribute To Key Finding On Higgs Boson Self-Interaction,"Saying it in simple words this new result brings scientists closer than ever to measure the Higgs field which manifests the Higgs boson and to test out predictions from the Standard Model. An exciting byproduct is the possibility of new physics beyond the Standard Model.

Recently using data from experimental runs extending from 2016 through 2018 the CMS collaboration at CERN arrived at an important result – they derived the most stringent constraint on the value of the Higgs self-coupling denoted mathematically by the Greek letter ‘lambda’ (λ).

But the particle’s discovery was more a milestone than an end goal. The ATLAS and CMS (compact muon solenoid) experiments using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN have been at work over the years producing data from the detector regularly that can be used to improve our understanding of fundamental particles and forces and how they operate.

The Higgs boson is a manifestation of a universal field called the Higgs field that gives matter its mass. Its discovery was also important in the context of the Standard Model of particle physics which captures the workings of fundamental particles under the sway of fundamental forces as it provides a means to test out the long-standing theory.

One of the landmark scientific discoveries last decade was the discovery of the Higgs boson. The particle named after British theoretical physicist Peter Higgs existed in theory for five decades until evidence of its existence emerged in 2012 from experiments conducted at the European Organization for Nuclear Research or CERN.

The CMS collaboration has taken an encouraging step towards observing a process with access to the key unknown parameter in the shape of the Brout-Englert-Higgs potential: the self-coupling Î». https://t.co/1gLcN7b9vt via @CERNCourier

This important result as is nearly any work that is carried out at CERN has been possible because of collaboration with international scientists and research groups.

For the lambda determination two physicists from the Centre for High Energy Physics at the Indian Institute of Science Bengaluru assistant professor Dr Jyothsna Rani Komaragiri and her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) student Lata Panwar have made important contributions.

Speaking to Swarajya Dr Komaragiri says “For the first time we have a stringent limit on the parameter lambda.”

Lambda is the Higgs self-coupling parameter and pertains to how the Higgs boson interacts with itself.

Studying the Higgs boson and its interactions with other particles – couplings – is one of the ways to vindicate the success of the Standard Model or if deviations are observed go in search of new physics beyond the model.

Measurements of the Higgs boson’s couplings to W and Z bosons among other fundamental particles have already strongly correlated with the theoretical framework proposed by Higgs along with collaborators Brout and Englert.

But this experiment observes and measures the self-interaction of the Higgs boson.

For the analysis Dr Komaragiri and Panwar applied their expertise in computation. They helped with building the algorithm and later analysing the vast amount of data coming in from the detector.

“We also needed to make sure that the data matched the simulations. So we did the initial exercise of all the matching parts” Dr Komaragiri says.

The Higgs boson pair production is feeble and rare. The rate of production is a thousand times lesser than that for one Higgs boson. Yet they pulled it off.

“With limited data and feeble production we still put a constraint on the parameter” she says.

The sensitivity of this analysis said the report in CERN Courier was better by about a factor of four compared to the previous analysis based on 2016 particle detector data. Innovative analysis techniques including the application of advanced machine-learning methods played a part in arriving at a more refined result.

The result is the best constraint to date set on the ratio of the measured lambda parameter to the Standard Model prediction at 0.6 (+6.3 –1.8).

The CMS collaboration extends far and wide – about 40 countries 200 research institutes and 5000 people participate in this grand particle physics project. India is a major contributor to CERN’s research activities and IISc is among India’s participating institutes.

The IISc CHEP sub-group participating in the CMS collaboration was formed by Dr Komaragiri herself in 2016.

“CHEP didn’t have a collaboration with the CMS group before 2016. Then in that year an experimental group comprising two members (Dr Komaragiri included) was formed and collaboration established” she says.

Panwar who is a collaborator on the CMS project was Dr Komaragiri’s first PhD student. Since then Dr Komaragiri has supervised the work of four physics PhD students.

On 15 February she completed five years of working at the IISc.

Over the course of her career she has co-authored over 850 experimental particle-physics publications in peer-reviewed journals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZXJneWZtLm5ldC9jbXMvbmV3c19zdG9yeV82NjY2NzMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Government: Still unclear about two unexplained COVID-19 cases,"Government: Still unclear about two unexplained COVID-19 cases

Treating lice with Coca-Cola is a myth

The myth that Coca-Cola is an effective solution for getting rid of head lice first began circulating on the internet in 2016 according to Snopes.

In 2019 SaLeah Snelling owner of Lice Clinics of America tested out the remedy by pouring Coca-Cola onto a Petri dish with lice on it and shared the results to YouTube.

Snelling debunked the myth and found that after 20 minutes the lice were still alive and swimming in the Coca-Cola.

""I think the biggest takeaway from these types of videos is that when it comes to natural treatment for head lice you need to take advice you hear about or read about with a grain of salt"" Snelling wrote along with the video. ""Most of these treatments don't work or aren't safe options.""

Pest Strategies also notes on its website that soda beverages lack the materials needed to eliminate a nit's strong bond with a hair follicle. While soda includes phosphoric and citric acid it has never been proven to help in removing lice from hair.

""There's also nothing special about the other chemicals in Coca-Cola that would make it toxic to lice either"" Pest Strategies writes. ""Sugar caffeine and caramel coloring would have no effect on the pests.""

Recommended treatments

There are other at-home remedies and medications that have been proven to be effective treatments.

Dr. Patricia Quinlisk medical director for the Iowa Department of Health told USA TODAY in 2016 that shampoos containing permethrin and pyrethrin and over-the-counter topical treatments are the best course of action.

Parents should treat lice twice by first killing it with an insecticide shampoo and then use an anti-lice shampoo to kill any bugs that have hatched since the initial wash according to Quinlisk.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends over-the-counter medications such as pyrethrins combined with piperonyl butoxide or permethrin lotion.

Fortunately the company is making moves to turn itself around.

Coca-Cola has partnered up with the paper-bottle-making Danish company Paboco to trial a more sustainable packaging this Summer in Hungary. Kifli.hu the country’s fastest-growing online grocery retailer will offer 2000 bottles of 250ml AdeZ packaged in Paboco’s prototype paper bottle.

Daniela Zahariea the Director of Technical Supply Chain & Innovation for Coca‑Cola Europe said:

The trial we are announcing today is a milestone for us in our quest to develop a paper bottle. People expect Coca‑Cola to develop and bring to market new innovative and sustainable types of packaging. That’s why we are partnering with experts like Paboco experimenting openly and conducting this first-in-market trial. It’s part of delivering on our World Without Waste goals.

The bottle is an extra-strong paper shell that contains a thin recyclable plastic lining and cap. However the goal is for it to be 100% plastic-free eventually. The bottle’s strength comes from being formed out of a single piece of paper-fiber-based material.

The firm’s commercial manager Michael Michelsen explained:

That’s part of the secret really; molding a single object – rather than relying on joins – ensured the bonds between the fibers stayed robust. With a clever combination of product design and a strong fiber blend that’s what makes it possible to not break under pressure.

The innovation falls in line with one of Coca-Cola’s World Without Waste sustainable packaging goals: to collect and recycle one bottle or can for each one it sells by the end of the decade; while reducing virgin plastic use and transitioning to only 100% recyclable packaging materials.

Paboco’s technology uses sustainably sourced wood with a bio-based material barrier that can resist liquids CO2 and oxygen. The packaging is suitable for beverages (including carbonated drinks) and other liquid goods like beauty products.

The most challenging obstacle Paboco overcame was to create a structure that could withstand the forces exerted by fizzy drinks (such as beer and cola) which are bottled under pressure. Secondly the paper should be moldable like plastic to form different bottle sizes and shapes for various brands. Third the material should take ink cleanly for printing labels. Solving these issues took seven years of lab work but the firm finally made it all work.

Paboco is also working with other companies including the vodka-maker Absolut and the beer company Carlsberg. Absolut will soon test 2000 paper bottles with its pre-mixed carbonated raspberry drink in Sweden and the UK. Carlsberg’s beer bottle is still being developed.

The company is excited about the technology’s potential and the opportunity to learn from these trials.

Stijn Franssen Coca‑Cola Europe’s R&D packaging innovation manager noted that the breakthrough technology is still developing. He said that Coca-Cola would continue to invest in the company as it improves its paper bottle performance and figures out how to replace all the plastic parts.

He said:

We will continue to invest in innovating and exploring new packaging technologies in cooperation with our partners at Paboco. This launch shows that we’re making good progress despite the journey ahead of us. It also shows Coca‑Cola’s determination to drive this sort of packaging innovation forwards by exploring and working together.

Coca-Cola is also introducing 100% recycled plastic bottles this year in America.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvYXJ0aWNsZS05MzA4Mjk3L0NvY2EtQ29sYS1sYXVuY2hlcy12ZW5kaW5nLW1hY2hpbmVzLXBlcnNvbmFsaXNlLWNhbi5odG1s0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL2ZlbWFpbC9hcnRpY2xlLTkzMDgyOTcvYW1wL0NvY2EtQ29sYS1sYXVuY2hlcy12ZW5kaW5nLW1hY2hpbmVzLXBlcnNvbmFsaXNlLWNhbi5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coca Cola launches vending machines which personalise every can,"Australian shoppers can now get personalised cans of Coca Cola at specialised vending machines - which means people with unique names no longer have to miss out on having their very own can.

Australians can now get their sweet fix from a pop-up cupcake ATM - which offers six different desserts at the push of a button

The ATM was set up last Friday in the Fortitude Valley and has a flashy display which shows off the variety of cupcakes served inside.

One video shows a lineup outside the ATM as people patiently wait for their turn to use the novel machine.

'Oh my goodness this is fabulous' one woman wrote.

The ATM is stocked every Friday and Saturday from 5pm according to the baker - but will only be there until the end of February.

'This is such a cool concept. Would drive to one if you had it in Victoria' another cake fan said.

'I'll be testing this out for our kid free weekend away' another person said.

Another person simply said 'shut up and take my money'.

The Mason Baker rose to fame in 2018 after owner James Willis secured a $100000 investment on hit show 'Shark Tank'.

The now 28-year-old former Coles worker shocked the show's judges when he presented his idea for the company.

Instead of sending flowers the concept sees an overnight delivery of assorted cupcakes in secured mason jars ensuring the delicacy arrives in prime condition.

The company still does gift boxes - posting the glass jars around Australia."

Traces Covid Outbreaks in Gyms Urging Stricter Precautions (Published 2021),"Public health officials on Wednesday urged gym-goers to wear masks when they work out and to remain six feet apart as new research described the rapid spread of coronavirus infections during high-intensity exercise classes at gyms in Honolulu and Chicago.

Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised fitness centers to take a variety of measures to prevent outbreaks including enforcing proper mask use and reminding gym and staff members to stay home if they have symptoms of illness or have tested positive for the virus.

Heavy breathing during intense physical activity in confined indoor spaces increases chances of transmission and fitness teachers who shouted exercise instructions to members may also have contributed to the spread the C.D.C. research found. Exercising outdoors or taking virtual fitness classes could help reduce infection risk the authors noted.

“It’s very important for individuals who would like to attend a gym and work out to be cognizant of what the Covid symptoms are and to be aware that if you are feeling something that looks and feels like a Covid-19 symptom to stay home as a precaution” said Richard A. Teran a C.D.C. epidemiologist in Chicago who was one of the authors of the Chicago case study published on Wednesday.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether it’s a pricey premium package that comes with 13 different HBO feeds or the hidden fees for high-def everything there’s always something adding to the monthly expense. Here is a quartet of tips for getting your bill under control so you can binge Property Brothers in financial peace.

1. Trade in Your DVR

So much is available on demand now that the necessity for recording anything new is minimal. You just need to remember which Better Call Saul episode you left off on and catch it on demand before it expires. Returning your digital video recorder (DVR) could shave off as much as $13 a month in “equipment rental” fees plus your original deposit.

2. Toss Extra Cable Boxes

There is a ton of content to consume but unless you’re actually on the Food Network do you really need a hookup in the kitchen? Comcast’s Xfinity charges $9.95 a month for a second cable box while Verizon Fios will run you $12 for a spare unit. It might be time to return any additional boxes that you don’t use and consider a streaming device (like a Roku) instead.

3. Downsize Your Plan

According to a 2018 analysis the average household uses between 6 and 7 percent of the 200-plus channels they’re paying for. So chop that dead wood! It could mean the difference between roughly $50 for 125 channels and $90 for an unwieldy 425 options on Verizon. Pro tip: Use their online chat service to ask about packages that fit your viewing habits.

4. Cut the Cord Already!

You’ll still need to pay for an internet connection but plug-in HD antennas like the Mohu Leaf which range from $24.99 to $149.99 are an affordable onetime cost and usually offer a solid lineup of over-the-air broadcast channels. Just make sure you can get it high enough to receive a good signal. You can always add streaming services for more robust content options. Most of NBC’s and ABC’s offerings stream next-day on Hulu and plenty of favorites are on HBO Max like Doctor Who and The Big Bang Theory. But don’t subscribe to so many that you wind up paying as much or more than you were for cable.

How to… Stop Auto-Playing Trailers on Netflix



Just because you paused while browsing Netflix’s heaps of options doesn’t mean you wanted to watch the trailer for The Queen’s Gambit for the fifth time right? Log in to Netflix on a computer (this won’t work on your TV’s app). On the home page hover over your profile and click “Account.” Choose your profile and find “Playback settings.” You can uncheck “Auto-play previews while browsing on all devices.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmluaWouY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjcvZGljay1zcG90c3dvb2QtdW5oZWFsdGh5LXVuc2FmZS1mbG9hdGluZy1zbHVtcy1vbi1yaWNoYXJkc29uLWJheS1tdXN0LWJlLXJlbW92ZWQv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFyaW5pai5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yNy9kaWNrLXNwb3Rzd29vZC11bmhlYWx0aHktdW5zYWZlLWZsb2F0aW5nLXNsdW1zLW9uLXJpY2hhcmRzb24tYmF5LW11c3QtYmUtcmVtb3ZlZC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dick Spotswood: Unhealthy unsafe floating slums on Richardson Bay must be removed,"Richardson Bay is one of southern Marin’s jewels. In recent years its waters have been despoiled by a fleet of unseaworthy vessels some of which are occupied.

Portions of the bay are designated as a “special” anchorage but only for boats whose stay is limited to 72 hours. Starting in the 1960s houseboats in Sausalito’s yacht harbors were joined by vessels anchored in Richardson Bay because it was a famed haunt for alternative lifestyle folks then described as hippies.

As the years passed the vibe changed but drug use remained a constant. The Bay Conservation and Development Commission finally commenced sporadic enforcement to remove semi-permanently moored anchor-outs. Their goal was eliminating environmental degradation and properly disposing of derelict vessels.

Those free spirits enamored of the life aquatic or unable to afford onshore homes vehemently protested frustrating BCDC’s efforts. It’s no different today with ideologically based objectors clamoring to maintain unhealthy unsafe floating slums on the public’s waters.

In recent decades far more anchored-out vessels were unseaworthy. Other than their floating home many dwellers were effectively homeless some of whom endured the double diagnosis of mental illness and substance abuse.

BCDC recently stepped up enforcement delegating the dirty work to local jurisdictions. Richardson’s Bay Regional Agency was established by Marin County government and Tiburon Belvedere Sausalito and Mill Valley to do the job. Eventually Sausalito broke away and assumed enforcement duties within its jurisdictional waters.

There’s been progress. In 2019 there were 190 anchored-out boats of which 90 were occupied. The remainder were abandoned pollution-filled hazards to navigation. Today 103 vessels remain with 90 still occupied.

In this era of climate change every storm leaves Richardson Bay’s shoreline littered with damaged vessels and half-sunken hulks creating hazards to legitimate navigation.

The next step is removing occupied unsafe vessels.

Sausalito has a “safe harbor program” moving anchor-outs to yacht harbors with sewage hook-ups. Unfortunately so far only two vessel-owners relocated.

If anchor-outs can’t afford land-based residences the law and basic morality makes evicting them proper only if they’re provided housing options.

For those water dwellers free from substance abuse and mental health issues the county should obtain and allocate federal Section 8 rent vouchers. While that means not living on the water there’s no inherent right to any particular lifestyle. For those rejecting vouchers they’ll need to endure the consequences of their decision.

Mentally ill anchor-outs like others so afflicted face California’s mental health crisis – the principal cause of chronic homelessness. They should be promptly relocated to supportive housing onshore.

Kudos to Corte Madera for advancing community dialogue in a manner other local governments should emulate. At 4 p.m. on the second and fourth Tuesday of each month Mayor Eli Beckman Town Manager Todd Cusimano and department heads conduct a virtual “Corte Madera Community Chat.”

Go to Corte Madera’s website locate the Zoom link join the chat and ask questions with on-the-spot staff responses. Unlike public open time at council meetings questioning isn’t limited to items on a particular agenda and can relate to all facets of municipal affairs.

Credit also goes to Tiburon’s Mayor Holli Thier who’s launching “Mondays with the Mayor” via Zoom on the second and fourth Mondays starting March 8.

Streaming platform Peacock is developing the series.

The Real Housewives is continuing to expand the franchise with an All-Stars edition. Fans of the series that started on Bravo with The Real Housewives of Orange County will be able to catch some of the most iconic personalities in a new spinoff. The untitled project is confirmed to be set at Peacock the streaming platform from Comcast’s NBC Universal.

‘The Real Housewives All-Stars’ is in the works

As of now there are not a lot of details about this Real Housewives spinoff on Peacock. Since its launch back in 2006 with the Orange County-based show the franchise has expanded to cities across the country and the world. The U.S.-based spinoffs include Beverly Hills New York City New Jersey Miami D.C. Atlanta Potomac Dallas and most recently Salt Lake City.

International cities that adopted the format for their local market include Vancouver and Toronto in Canada Cheshire and Jersey in England Melbourne and Sydney in Australia as well as versions for Auckland Bangkok and Johannesburg.

“Some women were contacted in late 2019/early 2020 to test the temperature on the idea which would see cast members — potentially both past and present — from various cities take a trip together” Entertainment Tonight reports.

Names for which housewives have been contacted were not available but it is rumored that only stars being considered are the ones not filming for their franchise. Potomac and Salt Lake City are currently in production and filming their sixth and second seasons respectively.

“The trips are always the most memorable part of any season of Housewives so it makes total sense they’d want to do this” the ET source added. “If the women want to do it is another question.”

Andy Cohen wasn’t always keen on an ‘All-Stars’ spinoff

Although many fans are excited about the potential for drama with a Real Housewives All-Stars cast Andy Cohen was not always excited for this type of spinoff. The Watch What Happens Live host shot down the idea of making an All-Stars version of The Real Housewives as it wasn’t time yet.

“You know what? We will do Real Housewives: All-Stars when the show is just about out of gas” Cohen told Entertainment Tonight back in 2016. “So right now we had our second highest season of Beverly Hills New York’s highest ratings since 2012 and Orange County last season had its highest rated season in 10 seasons.”

At the time Cohen said that Bravo wasn’t ready to put the housewives on an island but he said that they would eventually do it in the future.

“We will and I can’t wait to do it” Cohen added. “But it’s going to be at the end of the line … We’ll do it at the end. It’s something that we don’t waste now. We want to save it for later.”

The quote from Cohen went viral after The Real Housewives: All-Stars rumors surged. With the franchise being 15 years old many questioned if this was the end of the line for the format. In the past year ratings have dipped for most of the franchises but it has also gone in hand with changing viewing patterns.

As streaming platforms rise viewing habits have changed and people are not watching like they did before.

The All-Stars edition has not been announced by Peacock just yet."

There are food combinations that are straight-up genius and others that are questions. It’s unclear where the new Mac & Cheese Popcorn from Conagra Brands’ Act II will fall but we’re willing to try it out as soon as humanly possible.

Instagram accounts @junkpickers and @junkfoodmom recently posted pictures of the new microwavable popcorn. The top questions on everyone’s minds are about the flavor. How will the mac and cheese flavor differ from just cheese? How cheesy will it be? What kind of cheese is used? Act II please feel free to clarify at your convenience.

There’s no indication of when we can expect to see the Mac & Cheese Popcorn in stores but we’re keeping our fingers crossed that it’s this year and soon. It looks like each box will contain six 2.75-ounce bags. We’re so ready for this cheesy experience.

Believe it or not this isn’t the first time Act II has added mac and cheese flavor to its popcorn. A few years ago the brand released a ready-to-eat bagged Bacon Mac & Cheese Popcorn. If you ask us the new microwavable variety sounds even better because it’ll be cheesy and warm.

It has approximately 40 production facilities across North America and Italy. Its product portfolio includes snacking beverages and meal preparation products available in shelf stable refrigerated frozen and fresh formats.

Barry Rosenstein managing partner at JANA calls his activist strategy ""V cubed"". The three ""Vs"" are""(i) Value: you need to buy in at the right price with a margin of safety so that JANA still has a good investment in the event the activism does not work; (ii) Votes: you need to know whether you have the votes before commencing a proxy fight; and (iii) Variety of ways to win: you need to have more than one strategy to enhance value.

The firm does not use activism simply to agitate boards and management but to implement sound well-conceived business strategies that they strongly believe will enhance shareholder value.

Activist Commentary: JANA uses a value-oriented and research-intensive approach to special situation public security investing capitalizing on the transactional legal and finance backgrounds of its principals. JANA has extensive activist experience. They use various shareholder tools including letters proxy fights shareholder communications and lawsuits to achieve their activist goals. However they have crafted a reputation for a 'diplomacy first' approach. JANA also partners with highly credentialed executives who bring specific industry expertise to the situations and lend credibility to their arguments.

The firm has had constructive discussions with TreeHouse's board and management regarding avenues to resolve the company's undervaluation and total stockholder return including evaluating a sale of the company operations capital allocation corporate governance and compensation practices.

On January 29 2021 JANA notified TreeHouse Foods of their intent to propose three nominees Meredith Adler (Institutional Investor's top ranked analyst in the food and drug sector for 14 years) John Paul Gainor Jr. (former president and CEO of Dairy Queen) and Charles L. Myers (former portfolio manager at Fidelity) for election at the company's 2021 Annual Meeting. JANA believes this represents an attractive investment opportunity with TreeHouse nearly three years into a comprehensive turnaround.

JANA has extensive experience in this industry with a successful track record in the consumer retail space and their involvement has led to sales of Pinnacle PetSmart Safeway Whole Foods and ConAgra's spinoff of its Lamb Weston business. The firm knows TreeHouse well as a significant part of its assets were acquired from ConAgra at JANA's urging.

JANA partner Scott Ostfeld is presently on the board of ConAgra but don't look for ConAgra to be a potential acquirer. It is not interested in private label production which is why it sold the Ralcorp business to TreeHouse in 2015 for $2.7 billion less than three years from acquiring it for $5 billion.

TreeHouse is a pure play private label business which is an area of tremendous secular tailwinds. Private label brands are cheaper for consumers more profitable for retailers and do not have the stigma of generic brands of yesteryear (think Whole Foods 365 or Costco's Kirkland). As a result shelf space has been migrating towards private label space with tremendous growth in the US which is not close to the penetration level of Europe.

TreeHouse is multiple years into an extensive turnaround program that has helped it significantly improve its product portfolio go-to-market structure and supply chain and service operations. However it is also a broken equity story in that these operational improvements have not been reflected in the stock price. As one of the only pure play private label manufacturers with no real comps TreeHouse is not a great public company. The opportunity is for it to be sold to private equity who has a ton of dry powder and a lot of pressure to do deals. Moreover JANA knows most of the potential buyers having sold many similar companies in the past to firms like Cerberus Veritas BC Partners and Clayton Dubilier and Rice.

So what is TreeHouse worth? In 2018 Post sold part of its private label business to Thomas H. Lee Partners for over 10 times EBITDA. A 10 times multiple here would imply a six handle on a sale. Similar to their engagements in Whole Foods ConAgra and Pinnacle JANA has yet again teamed up with world-class executives who they are nominating to the board. While their expertise would not be as necessary in the context of a sale of the company they could certainly help evaluate a potential sale and they have tremendous experience in public markets as well so they can help rehabilitate the equity story in the meantime.

A mighty manhole blast rocked Midtown Manhattan during the early hours of Sunday morning injuring three workers.

Residents along East 56th Street were given a rude awakening by an ear-splitting explosion on Feb. 28 following reports of multiple manhole fires before dawn.

According to FDNY Deputy Assistant Chief John Sarrocco firefighters had been on the scene since 4:30 a.m. when they responded to smoke emitting from numerous manholes.

“Units responded in about three or four minutes. They got on scene and found multiple manholes with smoke issuing from it. We did searches throughout all of the buildings on each side of the street on 56th Street between First and Second Avenue. The situation seemed to be under control at that point” Sarrocco said.

FDNY EMS and Con Edison personnel remained in the area for several hours. Everything looked to be secure until about 7:40 a.m. when a massive blast injured three first responders each from the aforementioned emergency services. Immediate backup support was requested at the scene.

“We had multiple power outages on 56th Street between First and Second Avenue with rising CO levels in various buildings” Sarrocco said. “We escalated the incident to have a second alarm assignment respond which consists of approximately 200 firefighters. Those firefighters had to do extensive searches of buildings on 56th Street between First and Second. Checking all of the elevators because there are multiple power outages. We also have civilians that need electricity for life support systems. Those people were being evaluated by FD personnel. This is a long and extensive operation which is still going on right now. We had 3 injuries one to an EMS operation personnel from the explosion one from Con Ed from the explosion and we also had one firefighter injured with difficulty breathing during the operation. Right now things are starting to settle down. CO levels have dropped within the buildings.”

FDNY officials erected a mobile command center while Con Edison employees worked on several manholes. The street was completely cut off from traffic as NYPD and FDNY officials maintained a vigilant watch over the proceedings as the morning wore on to ensure another explosion would not take place.

Still this didn’t soothe the minds of those who heard the eruption with their own ears.

Henry Smith 17 and his mother were jolted awake by a resounding boom. They reside on the 10th floor of an apartment just overlooking the street where the explosion occurred.

“It was really smoky” Smith said describing the experience as akin to waking up in a war zone. After a few minutes he left his apartment building and could smell a strong gas odor. Smith shared that the fire department warned that his building might have to be evacuated.

“It was just a boom. I was fine but it scared my mom. We live on the 10th floor but my mom wanted to evacuate” Smith told amNewYork Metro.

According to Con Edison one of their employees is having his hearing evaluated after being in close proximity to the exploding manhole.

Con Edison believes that these manhole fires are most likely related to the influx of snowstorms New York has been experiencing over the past few weeks. A representative shared that when the melting snow and ice mix with road salt it gets into the manholes.

The investigation into what caused the blast is still ongoing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjgvbnlyZWdpb24vbmV3LXlvcmstY2l0eS1tYW5ob2xlLWZpcmVzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Manhole Explosion in Manhattan Injures 3 Officials Say,"A manhole fire and explosion in Manhattan early on Sunday morning damaged cars and storefronts caused power failures and injured at least three people officials said.

CO-OP CITY The Bronx (WABC) -- The lights are slowly returning after as many as 10 buildings in the Bronx were in the dark once again Sunday morning.

The news comes less than 24 hours after Co-Op City got the power turned back on from Friday's deadly blackout.

Police have been going through the buildings doing wellness checks as many woke up to cold apartments.

The previous outage happened at the same cluster of buildings Friday due to a transformer fire.

On Sunday morning at around 2 a.m. residents started reporting their buildings were dark and power was out once again.

Emergency services removed at least one person with an oxygen tank while water stations were set up outside.

Officials said it was not clear what the problem was.

Con Edison released a statement on the incident.

""Co-op City is unique in New York City in that it generates its own power and distributes it to its residents. Con Edison maintains feeders running to Co-op City that can be used for backup power but I can confirm that those feeders remain in service.""

Sunday afternoon a backup generator was in place and being connected to one of the buildings.

Riverbay Corporation runs the sprawling complex and calls the incident a fluke.

They had few answers when asked about why backup generators weren't already in place.

""It sounds simple when you ask the question but the technology and cost of installing those generators is quite difficult"" Riverbay's Bob Klehammer said.

Ada Longmore 73 who lived in a 19th-floor unit died during the blackout on Friday.

Her body was found in a stairwell between the 18th and 19th floors.

She had an oxygen tank which was empty and she has been climbing the stairs to get to her apartment since there was no power to the elevator.

Local officials are calling for change they say Co-Op City has long been plagued with problems including crumbling infrastructure.

""When the power goes out and electricity goes out those people are left vulnerable and that seems to be what happened to Ada Longmore"" Rep. Jamaal Bowman said.

Crews are in the process of checking the following addresses that are reported to be without power:

920 Baychester Avenue - 33 story residential building with 186 residential units

920 Co-Op City Boulevard - 33 story residential building with 186 residential units

100 Darrow Place - 33 story residential building with 392 residential units

""I thought I heard maybe two or three booms and that was it. So I was curious and came out and saw all the police cars"" one person told CBS2's Hazel Sanchez.

At around 4:30 a.m. the FDNY responded to reports of fire and smoke coming out of multiple manholes on East 56th Street between First and Second avenues. Fire crews stayed on scene for more than three hours convinced the situation was under control.

More than 200 firefighters responded to the two-alarm emergency and there were extensive searches done at all the surrounding buildings. Carbon monoxide levels were through the roof. There were multiple power outages firefighters had to search elevators and the apartments of people who need the electricity for life-support systems.

""You worry about the infrastructure you know. The infrastructure is too old for the number of people using it you know? It's kind of scary to be honest but the response is amazing and I hope everybody is safe"" Lynch said.

The couple had just returned from the hospital where they had refilled Ada’s oxygen tank.

You can skip our detailed discussion about the trends in the alcohol sector and go to the 5 Most Valuable Alcohol Companies.

The alcohol industry performed better-than-expected in 2020 as demand grew worldwide. According to a report the global alcoholic beverage market was valued at $515.2f billion in 2019 and projected to reach $614.7 billion at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7% from 2021 to 2023. In 2019 the largest region in the global alcoholic beverage market was Asia Pacific which accounted for 41% of the market. North America was the second biggest region contributing 24% of the global market for alcoholic beverages.

Rising Online Demand

A report by the market research firm International Wine and Spirit Records or IWSR said that online demand for liquor in the U.S. was expected to jump by over 80% in 2020 as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. The report said that alcohol e-commerce sales were expected to come in at $5.6 billion in 2020 up from about $3 billion in 2019.

Another unexpected trend that favored the alcohol companies in the U.S. and abroad was high consumer spending on spirits. A report by Distilled Spirits Council said that distillers’ revenue in the U.S. jumped 7.7% to $31.2 billion in 2020. As people missed travel concerts and live sports matches they treated themselves with more food and high-end spirits boosting major distillers’ revenue. The report added that spirits with price tags of over $40 per 750 milliliters made up 40% of the U.S. spirits industry’s growth last year compared to 34% in 2019.

International Wine and Spirit Records said 44% of alcohol e-shoppers in the US only started buying alcohol online in 2020 compared to 19% in 2019. In the middle of the pandemic e-commerce stores have become an increasingly important retail platform for alcoholic beverages across the world. Alcohol e-commerce has grown in almost all marketplaces this year but some have seen faster growth than others. China is the largest online alcohol market in the world but its growth rate of 23% during 2019-2020 has been relatively slower than that of the US the UK Australia and Brazil as the online ecosystem for alcohol sales in China is already established and thriving with less runway for growth.

Several companies jumped in the alcohol industry to profit from the changing trends. Uber (NYSE: UBER) recently acquired Drizly an alcohol delivery service startup in a $1.1 billion deal. Founded in 2012 Drizly has seen an outstanding 300% year-over-year growth in bookings from 2019 to 2020 and is already profitable. Shares of UBER rallied 58.55% over the past twelve months.

Country artists are usually known for the songs that they sing. But it may come as a surprise to some fans that many of them have dabbled into other areas of interest that aren’t related to country music.

Interestingly enough a lot of country stars have stepped into the business of making booze starting brands of their own that are downright noteworthy especially if you’re looking to gift your friends something unique and special.

From beer to liquor to whiskey and wine here’s a list of alcohol brands owned by some of your favorite country stars!

LIQUOR

Blake Shelton’s Smithworks American-Made Vodka

Shelton’s Smithworks American-made vodka bottled in Fort Smith Arkansas is made with corn grown in Kansas Missouri and Oklahoma. The singer calls it the “perfect anchor for a good time” and we couldn’t agree more!

Florida Georgia Line and Jason Aldean’s Wolf Moon Straight Bourbon Whiskey

Brian Kelley and Tyler Hubbard collaborated with Jason Aldean on Wolf Moon Straight Bourbon Whiskey. Before hitting shelves this 80-proof bourbon is aged for four years in some of the finest new charred American Oak barrels. The name of the beverage serves as a tribute to the friendship between Aldean and FGL as they consider each other to be a pack of brothers.

Thomas Rhett And Jeff Worn’s Dos Primos

Rhett and his close pal/third cousin Jeff Worn got together to create an exceptional ultra-premium tequila brand. They came up with the idea for the drink during a ski trip to Telluride CO. The appropriately-titled name of the drink Dos Primos is Spanish for “two cousins.”

Florida Georgia Line’s Old Camp Peach Pecan Whiskey

Before teaming up with Aldean on Wolf Moon Straight Bourbon FGL launched their own Old Camp Peach Pecan Whiskey. The unique alcoholic drink crafted back in 2016 and infused with natural peach and pecan flavors is the perfect beverage for easy drinking – especially if you’re planning to party all day long.

Jake Owen’s Beach Whiskey

Owen’s clear flavored whiskey takes the drink from the bar to the beach. Partnering with the Beach Whiskey Company in 2016 the singer’s line of whiskey comes in three different flavors – Original Island Coconut and Bonfire Cinnamon.

Kenny Chesney’s Blue Chair Bay Rum

Chesney gives fans plenty of flavor choices to choose from with his award-winning Blue Chair Bay Rum. From Pineapple and Coconut to Banana and Key Lime it’s impossible to be disappointed when it comes to picking out a flavor from this line. Inspired by the “Summertime” singer’s beachy lifestyle Blue Chair Bay Rum is crafted in the Caribbean and made with molasses sugarcane and other natural ingredients.

John Rich’s Redneck Riviera Whiskey

Vanilla honey smoothness with a subtle touch of oak is how Big & Rich’s John Rich would sum up his Redneck Riviera Whiskey. Born out of a realization that American-blended whiskey was hard to come by this approachable All-American drink can be found in several states across the country. What’s more impressive a portion of the profits made from each purchase of whiskey goes to support Folds of Honor.

Willie Nelson’s Old Whiskey River Bourbon

Nelson was inspired by his 1978 smash Old Whiskey River to come up with this spirit of the same name. Those who opt for this drink will be delighted by its packaging as each bottle comes with a Nelson guitar pick and a sticker that resembles the country icon’s famous guitar strap.

George Strait’s Código 1530 Tequila

Investing in the successful Mexico brand Strait’s Código 1530 Tequila line named after one of his songs features five different expressions of tequila. The drink is made from matured blue agave and goes through an extensive process before hitting shelves in all 50 states.

Swindell partnered with Sugarlands Distilling Company to produce his own delicious brand of moonshine. He has so far launched two flavors – Pre-show punch and Peppermint Moonshine.

Darius Rucker’s Forbidden Bourbon with Castle & Key Distillery & Backstage Southern Whiskey

Rucker teamed with Castle & Key Distillery (formerly Old Taylor Distillery) and Master Distiller Marianne Barnes in Frankfort Ky. to develop his signature bourbon known as Forbidden.

Toby Keith’s Wild Shot Mezcal

Keith developed Wild Shot Mezcal due to his love for the Mexico-born brand. Each shot of the 100% green agave beverage includes an agave worm or “gusano” which is believed to bring each individual a special experience when they take a drink from the Wild Shot Mezcal.

Eric Church’s Single Barrel Tennessee Whiskey by Jack Daniels

Eric Church worked with the Jack Daniel’s brand to create his own Single Barrel Tennessee Whiskey. A fan of the Tennessee-brand Church often purchased barrels of Jack Daniels for his crew and band. So it only makes sense he would team with the brand on a limited-edition designed with his personal style in mind.

Tanya Tucker’s Cosa Salvaje Tequila

Tucker teamed with founder Elle France on her tequila Cosa Salvaje which is Spanish for “Wild Thing.” Available in select cities across the state of Tennessee each bottle of Cosa Salvaje is thoughtfully created from recycled glass and includes an embossed leather strap featuring Tucker’s signature logo on it.

Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports

SCOTTSDALE — The dreams that unfold under Arizona suns during spring training are usually ones of beginnings. Of debuts of years of work paying off of a childhood vision becoming an adult reality.

For Scott Kazmir who has nearly 1700 major league innings under his left arm it’s not a dream that is starting but one he doesn’t want to wake up from.

He has not pitched in the major leagues since 2016. A career that began in 2004 with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays — four years before Evan Longoria even got his call-up — has been not dashed but on hold for five years. Injuries kept him from throwing a pitch in the majors in 2017 when he said he still felt he had more left. He was dealt from the Dodgers to the Braves before the 2018 season and was released during camp.

He stepped away but not too far.

“There were a lot of health issues going on with my family and everything. I knew I had to be at home” said the 37-year-old Kazmir in his first media appearance as a Giants minor league signing.

There was a family to care for and the now father of two had started a family of his own. Time went by and he wasn’t retired but also wasn’t pitching. The lefty had a catch with a friend during the 2019 All-Star break and he felt it again.

“It just felt great” said the former Devil Ray Indian Angel A Astro and Dodger. “I kind of used it at the beginning just as more of a way to stay in shape — stay in shape by working out and throwing pitches and throwing bullpens. It was fun; I liked doing it.

“Ever since then I just stuck with it.”

And then the pandemic hit. He wanted to be there for his family but he felt his body pulling him back toward a mound that had been a home of its own. The Texas native stayed local last year and joined the startup Constellation Energy League which was thrown together in the wake of the independent Atlantic League canceling its season.

“Once I got out there and was able to get that adrenaline again and being able to face hitters” Kazmir said before a slight pause. “It was something that I missed so much. And I knew that this was the path for me.”

His manager in the league was Dave Eiland a former major league pitching coach whom the Giants kept in touch with. The Giants have followed Kazmir consistently. Farhan Zaidi and the southpaw were together with both the A’s and the Dodgers and the Giants will look everywhere for pitching help. He reportedly was at 92-93 mph in a recent bullpen session that the Giants attended.

Kazmir has followed the Giants through the years too. He said so many players who have come through have “talked very highly about just how professional and how everything is run.” He knows nearly every coach on the staff from run-ins to previous coaches to previous teammates to previous opponents; Kapler and Kazmir were Tampa teammates.

Kazmir felt the itch but it couldn’t be scratched just anywhere.

“I didn’t necessarily solicit myself out to a lot of teams because there was a certain situation that I wanted to be in” said the three-time All-Star. “I felt like I wanted to be in a situation where no matter the outcome no matter what happens I would have a support staff there and I would just be comfortable and at the same time have a chance to win. They checked all the boxes.”

If there is an unchecked box it’s openings on the Giants who have a likely starting five. Kazmir will be developed as a starter Kapler said and there will inevitably be opportunity during a season of intense pitching concern and with a club that has intense concern about the health of its current five.

It sounds as if Kazmir who admitted some hesitation about a comeback during the pandemic would be willing to work his way back from Triple-A Sacramento.

“Of course I’m going all for it right now out of camp but at the same time I know that I need reps I know that I need to get my feet wet and really be able to … kind of breathe in that moment” Kazmir said over Zoom from Scottsdale Stadium. “… No matter what happens no matter where I’m at I’m going to keep working every single day to get better.”

He softly smiled with his eyes wide though the dream is clearly still going.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS90ZWNoLW5ld3MtdGVjaG5vbG9neS9zaW1pbGFyLXRvLWVsb24tbXVza3Mtc3RhcmxpbmstZm91bmRlcnMtb2YtZGV2YXMtcGxhbi10by1wb3dlci01Zy11c2luZy1zYXRlbGxpdGUtdGVjaC03MjA3ODEyL9IBpgFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS90ZWNoLW5ld3MtdGVjaG5vbG9neS9zaW1pbGFyLXRvLWVsb24tbXVza3Mtc3RhcmxpbmstZm91bmRlcnMtb2YtZGV2YXMtcGxhbi10by1wb3dlci01Zy11c2luZy1zYXRlbGxpdGUtdGVjaC03MjA3ODEyL2xpdGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Similar to Elon Musk’s Starlink founders of Devas plan to power 5G using satellite tech,"FOUNDERS OF Bengaluru start up Devas Multimedia a firm embroiled in a legal battle with the Indian government over a failed 2005 satellite deal are attempting to deploy satellite-based technology earlier associated with Devas for 5G telecom rollout in the US.

Daily briefing | The stories you need to start your day with

Omnispace LLC a start up in the US which has Devas Multimedia Founder and CEO Ramachandran Viswanathan as its President and CEO announced this month it would put together a small constellation of satellites to power 5G from space – especially to provide connectivity to remote areas where terrestrial mobile network does not work.

“We are forging ahead in the delivery of truly mobile 5G connectivity solutions from space. Our network will leverage harmonised 2 GHz spectrum to bring the power of 5G to users and industries around the globe” Viswanathan said in a statement early February while announcing the closure of a $60-million funding deal for the firm’s satellite services business.

Omnispace plans to put in place a smaller constellation of around 200 satellites — 15 in middle earth orbit and others in low earth orbit — to provide 5G services. This is similar to the Starlink project of SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk which aims at putting up a constellation of over 1000 satellites for seamless 5G broadband communication in corners of the world that are not serviced by telecom networks.

Omnispace was launched in 2012 in the US shortly after the Devas Multimedia satellite deal with ISRO’s Antrix Corporation was scrapped in 2011 by the Indian government citing security reasons. Recently Antrix sought liquidation of Devas Multimedia on the grounds it perpetrated a fraud in connivance with former Antrix officials to bag the satellite deal in 2005.

Omnispace currently has an unused satellite from a private UK firm and has signed deals for the manufacture and launch of two more satellites. The F2 a middle earth orbit satellite which has been unused since launch in 2001 by ICO Global Communications – a firm in which VSNL invested in the the 1990s (prior to Tata Communications’ purchase of VSNL) – is already in space.

Last year Omnispace signed a deal with the French-Italian satellite manufacturer Thales Alenia Space to build two satellites for launch in 2022 on a SpaceX ride share mission. This Thales Alenia Space said marked a key milestone as Omnispace initiated the development of its new generation satellite constellation that would operate in the S-band. Omnispace had contracted the firm to build two satellites for its proposed constellation.

The Omnispace satellites will utilise the space band or S-band spectrum like Devas Multimedia was supposed to do with ISRO satellites. “Omnispace is rethinking how communications networks operate. The launch of these satellites will enable the first phase of implementation towards delivering our world-class hybrid network bringing the power of 5G from space to mobile networks anywhere around the world” Ramachandran Viswanathan said after a space launch deal with rideshare provider Exolaunch.

As the founder and CEO of Devas Multimedia in India Viswanathan is incidentally among eight people accused of criminal conspiracy cheating and corruption in a CBI chargesheet filed in August 2016 over the failed 2005 Devas satellite deal with ISRO. He is also accused in a money laundering case filed by the Directorate of Enforcement against Devas in 2018 for allegedly diverting FDI to the firm’s US subsidiary.

A special court hearing the ED case was on Friday informed that a summons had been served to Ramachandran Viswanathan and a director M G Chandrashekhar to appear in court for the case. The court has now asked for coercive steps to be taken like the issuance of non bailable warrants to ensure their court appearance.

The Bengaluru start up Devas Multimedia founded by Viswanathan — with people like former Verizon vice chairman Lawrence Babbio on its board (Babbio is also on the board of Omnispace LLC) — was supposed to provide satellite-based multimedia services on mobile handsets and was allocated two ISRO S-band satellites for the purpose under a 2005 deal signed between Devas and Antrix Corporation – the commercial arm of ISRO.

Following the cancellation of the 2005 deal Devas Multimedia and its foreign investors had approached international arbitration tribunals to seek compensation. The biggest compensation award has been a September 14 2015 ICC tribunal award of over $ 1.2 billion which was confirmed by a US federal court on October 27 2020. Antrix has filed an appeal against this order in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.",,,,,,,,,

The Hawks' 200-yard freestyle relay of Owen Fisher Ryan McNutt Daniel Hursh and Cal Bartone broke the New York state public schools record with a time of 1 minute 24.36 seconds in a 100-73 victory over Waverly on Monday at Corning-Painted Post High School.

Along with the record the performance earned the four All-American honors.

The previous state record of 1:24.54 was held by Clarence High School of Section 6 and had stood since 2010. Fordham Prep a member of the Catholic High School Athletic Association holds the overall state record of 1:23.84. Ithaca's time of 1:25.79 from 2013 was the previous Section 4 record.

""The way it ended up was perfect"" Corning coach Alyssa Helsing said. ""We couldn’t obviously have a state meet but with the limitations of sectionals it allowed them to have this last chance with their relays. Having this meet was a really nice way to go out because they got to really come together as a team to accomplish these things. The energy in the room was amazing.""

Helsing said there were ""happy tears"" from the boys after their achievement.

""The boys were excited"" she added. ""It was really wonderful to watch. And we got to have spectators there so the parents were able to come and see and cheer on the kids.""

Helsing's husband and co-coach Anthony Furstoss said coming into the meet they had confidence the boys could reach the All-American time of 1:24.80 but he did not anticipate a state record.

""They have been perfecting the stepover relay starts and even the officials have commented on how they were really paying attention"" Furstoss said. ""They just nailed every one. It was a perfect transition.""

Monday's meet opened with Yushi Portwood Bartone McNutt and Hursh winning the 200 medley relay in 1:34.66. That time broke school and pool records while putting the relay into consideration for All-American honors which will be determined at a later date based on high school performances from the 2020-21 school year. All-American consideration is 1:34.74.

Corning senior Nick Jubilee added a winning 11-dive score of 617.30 on the 1-meter board. That would have been good enough for a Section 4 record but the Seton Hall-bound Jubilee broke the mark Saturday at sectionals with his score of 625. Jubilee's top performances will be submitted for All-American consideration which is determined by a panel based on video.

""We’re hoping for Nick and optimistic but can’t guarantee any of that because it’s not just a score they want to look at the dives"" Helsing said.

Bartone's Section 4 record-setting time of 56.96 seconds in the 100 breaststroke at Class A sectionals also puts him into consideration for All-American.

Corning finished with a 9-0 record in dual meets two days after capturing the first Section 4 team championship in program history with a win in Class A. The 200 freestyle relay gives the boys program its first All-Americans.

""I’m very grateful to Waverly because they didn’t have to do this"" Helsing said. ""We needed a chance to give our relays a shot and they were willing to come to us. There’s no state meet there’s no end of the line. The boys were tapered and ready to go. We needed a meet to be able to compete in and they graciously came to us to do that.""

Class B competition was Friday and Class A followed Saturday. Because of the pandemic meets were virtual with schools competing at their home venues and results compiled afterward. Class C competition will conclude Monday.

In Class B Maine-Endwell earned a 10th consecutive sectional team title while Chenango Valley finished first in 10 of the 12 events and saw 2020 state champion Eli Lanfear deliver a sterling performance.

Two Section 4 records were among highlights Saturday for a Corning team that has broken section team and pool records on a regular basis this season. Corning unbeaten in dual meets finished first in eight of 12 events and earned its first Section 4 Class A team title.

The New York State Public High School Athletic Association canceled all state championship events this school year because of the pandemic. Normally the state swimming & diving meet would follow sectional championships.

Class A

Corning senior Nick Jubilee broke the Section 4 record for six dives earlier this season and added the 11-dive record Saturday with a score of 625 third-highest in New York this season. Jubilee topped the 2015 record of 612.10 held by Maine-Endwell's Jordyn Klym.

On Feb. 17 the Seton Hall-bound Jubilee set the six-dive sectional mark with a score of 371.75.

Hawks senior Cal Bartone broke the Section 4 record in the 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 56.96 seconds. Ithaca's John Nord (57.37 in 2011) held the mark. Bartone's time broke the Corning pool record and is fast enough for All-American consideration.

Also on Saturday Bartone broke his own pool record from earlier this season in the 50 freestyle with a winning time of 21.43.

Hawks junior Ryan McNutt broke his pool and team records in the 200 freestyle with a winning swim of 1:40.47 which ranks No. 1 in the state this season. McNutt broke his pool and team records in winning the 100 freestyle in 45.77 seconds the state's third-ranked time.

Corning's Owen Fisher McNutt Daniel Hursh and Bartone had a winning time of 3:09.38 in the 400 freestyle relay just off All-American consideration (3:09.26) and No. 3 this season in the state.

The Hawks' team of Yushi Portwood Bartone Nishant Lahiri and Robin Liu won the 200 medley relay in 1:39.48. Corning's 200 freestyle relay of McNutt Fisher Lahiri and Hursh took first in 1:29.35.

Jacob Rose altered the Elmira record book with a time of 55.76 to finish first in the 100 butterfly. The previous record of 55.90 was set by Dave Utter in 1992.

Other sectional champs were Binghamton's Aiden Howard in the 100 backstroke (55.26) Horseheads' Emmett Hanson in the 500 freestyle (4:56.53) and Horseheads' Shoonfon Li in the 200 individual medley (2:02.70).

Corning won the seven-team meet with 469.5 points followed by Horseheads with 403 Vestal with 286.5 and four-time defending champion Ithaca with 251.5.

Every Corning winning time or score would have qualified for the canceled state meet.

Class B

Lanfear a senior at Chenango Valley was part of four victories including a winning All-American time of 20.40 seconds in the 50 freestyle that ranks No. 1 in the state this season.

Lanfear's 50 time approached the section record of 20.25 held by Ithaca's Ryan Nicholson and was faster than any time at last year's state meet. Lanfear last year's state public schools champion in the 100 freestyle broke pool and school records with Friday's effort.

Lanfear added a win in the 100 butterfly in 49.05 seconds the fastest time in the state this season and one that broke pool and school records while putting him in consideration for All-American status.

He joined Alex Hilldale Tyler Schultz and Luke Hoyt in setting a pool record in the 200 medley relay with their winning time of 1:38.25 putting them No. 6 in the state rankings.

Lanfear Ian Hilldale Alex Hilldale and Peyton Broderick set a pool record in the 400 freestyle relay with a winning time of 3:15.14 also sixth-fastest in the state.

Broderick added wins in the 200 freestyle (1:46.35) and 100 freestyle (47.65) with both times meeting the standard for the canceled state meet.

Schultz won the 100 breaststroke in a state-cut time of 59.89 to break his own pool record and set a school record. He was also first in the 200 individual medley (2:01.82).

CV's other wins came from Schultz Broderick Ian Hilldale and Hoyt in the 200 freestyle relay (1:31.63) and Alex Hilldale in the 100 backstroke with a state-qualifying time of 54.71.

The other Class B champions were Maine-Endwell's Gavin Fanning in 1-meter diving (498.46) and M-E's Conner Steele in the 500 freestyle (5:19.28). Fanning's score would have qualified him for states.

Maine-Endwell's point total was 618 with Chenango Valley second out of eight schools with 514.

For the uninitiated Dynabook was formerly known as Toshiba. A rebranding exercise was conducted in 2019.

World’s lightest 2-in-1 convertible laptop

The first thing that catches your attention is its weight.

At just 989g* this very well could be the lightest laptop I’ve ever handled.

Dynabook markets the Portégé X30W-J as the world’s lightest^ 13-inch Intel Evo convertible 2-in-1 laptop.

For someone who is used to lugging around a 1.3kg aluminium chonk of a laptop for work the Portégé X30W-J felt like a revelation on cotton candy clouds.

It’s able to achieve this because the Portégé X30W-J has a magnesium alloy body. Magnesium is an extremely lightweight yet strong material. The screen is also fitted with Corning Gorilla Glass NBT.

Another thing that catches your eye is its convertible nature — the Portégé X30W-J you see is both a laptop AND a tablet.

To be honest my first reaction to this transformer extravaganza was “Wah quite gimmicky.”.

If that too is your reaction my advice to you is: Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it.

Before the Portégé X30W-J I never had a convertible laptop/tablet before — mainly because I never saw the need.

“Since a laptop can do (almost) everything a tablet can why waste money on an extra tablet or a convertible?” I used to say to myself.

“Fool!” I say now flipping faster than the Portégé X30W-J that I’ve been working/living with for the past week.

If there’s one thing that I’ve come to appreciate after using the Portégé X30W-J it is the ease of transiting from work to entertainment with just one device.

Brings you from work to entertainment in a flip

There are FIVE different viewing modes that you can use the Portégé X30W-J thanks to its stabilizing dual-action hinge: Laptop mode Tabletop mode Presentation mode Audience mode and Tablet mode.

The first three viewing modes Laptop Tabletop and Presentation are meant for work; Dynabook envisages that you might use them for giving presentations and collaborating.

The other two viewing modes Audience and Tablet are useful for watching videos reading and even taking notes.

Five viewing modes may be a tad excessive for some. Personally I find that the Laptop Audience and Tablet viewing modes are the most useful.

Working (and typing) is a breeze

Using the Laptop viewing mode made me appreciate what I suspect is quite an understated highlight of the Portégé X30W-J — it's keyboard.

It’s not clanky like an old Windows keyboard. Neither is it insufficiently tactile like what I’m used to with my current laptop.

The keys on the Portégé X30W-J feels just right and it makes typing such a breeze — especially important for those who just like me spend the better part of their day banging on keys.

Harking back to the light weight (989g!) I found that I’m no longer constrained to working at my desk because I can do my work on the Portégé X30W-J at the desk/pantry/beanbag corner/meeting room/ washroom — anywhere.

The laptop has very narrow bezels which allows the 13.3 inch laptop to have a footprint equivalent to a 12 inch laptop.

What I really like too is the variety of connection ports which make transferring content and connecting to other hardware a breeze:

Two USB 3.1 Type-C Gen 2 -Thunderbolt 4 ports which supports data transfer power delivery and display ports

One USB 3.1 (Sleep & Charge)

One HDMI-out (supporting 4k2k/1080p signal format)

One Headphone/microphone combo jack

One microSD Card reader

And thanks to the laptop’s 32GB RAM running multiple applications is a breeze.

For those who are concerned about security the Dynabook Portégé X30W-J comes with its proprietary BIOS face and fingerprint recognition technology. Now you can keep all your NSFW photos confidential documents safe.

Nice.

Great for watching videos reading

The Tablet viewing mode is great for browsing the internet. For those who love to write Dynabook’s Active Pen is programmed to respond to 4096 levels of pressure for incredibly smooth handwriting.

The Portégé X30W-J is also great for watching videos thanks to its anti-glare full HD touchscreen with a 12 inch footprint.

Some colleagues suggested using it to read or watch videos while commuting to and from work though I wouldn’t recommend it if you’re the sort who fancies ""50 Shades of Grey"" type of content.

One grouse of mine is that when in its Tablet viewing mode the front of the keyboard ends up at the back of the tablet meaning you are constantly fiddling with the keyboard when using the Portégé X30W-J as a tablet.

The other viewing mode I thoroughly enjoyed was the Audience mode which I used exclusively for watching Netflix.

The speakers of the Portégé X30W-J are located behind the keyboard. This means that when you flip it to the Audience mode the speakers will then be located behind the screen.

It’s a very elegant set up for a movie without the distraction of a keyboard in front of you.

Available in Singapore market now

The Portégé X30W-J is available in the Singapore market now. Find out more on Dynabook’s website or contact sales staff via email at [email protected].

To control smut grass Baxter tried Rezilon along with Velpar in bahiagrass plots. She put out 4 ounces of Rezilon per acre in April 2020 later than she would have liked; but like everyone else she notes they were battling shutdowns tied to COVID-19. In addition 2019-20 marked a mild winter in the state where the bahiagrass never really went dormant. So Baxter followed that April application of Rezilon with 3.5 pints per acre of Velpar in August. Once again she wanted to apply the herbicide earlier but she had to wait for a break in the rains.

""The advantage of using Rezilon and Velpar compared to Velpar alone is we didn't see as much bahiagrass damage in that study. Once we get another year of data though we'll know better"" she says.

Baxter was encouraged by the results of a systems-based approach to smutgrass control where both herbicides along with 50 pounds per acre each of nitrogen and potash seemed most effective. She put the fertilizer out in April then again after hay harvest in July. This was the priciest option by far at $185 an acre and Baxter says ""we've got to wait a year to see if the smutgrass comes back.""

SPRING-RELEASE PROCLOVA

Corteva officials are hopeful ProClova will be available to producers this spring. This new herbicide was developed with an eye toward protecting white clovers.

Scott Flynn Corteva zonal biology leader says the No. 1 reason producers don't want to treat pastures with herbicides is clover protection. The newly developed molecule in ProClova leaves white clover and annual lespedeza while controlling broadleaf weeds ranging from wild carrot to buttercup to musk thistle to cocklebur. It can be used with a reduced rate of 24-D to get even more species.

ProClova goes out at 24 ounces per acre. It also doesn't tend to drift as badly as some other herbicides.

Flynn says producers will see a bit of twisting of white clover after an application but even in pure stands by day 28 it has recovered. By day 46 he adds ""You can't tell we ever made an application.""

For red clover ProClova isn't so kind. And Flynn says alsike clover or burr clover don't tolerate it either. Aside from this he says there are few disadvantages to the herbicide.

""It isn't a magic bullet"" Flynn adds. ""It is not as broad spectrum as GrazonNext or DuraCor."" He says ProClova only suppresses horsenettle and since it isn't a residual it isn't effective on spiny pigweed if applied in the spring.

MANAGEMENT CONTROLS

In Nebraska range and forage scientist Daren Redfearn sees progress controlling certain weeds with management changes rather than chemical control.

""Eastern red cedar encroachment is our biggest problem"" he notes. ""It starts on fencerows where birds light but then it moves into the pastures. Prescribed fire is the easiest way to control it. Spring is the traditional time for controlled burns. It cleans up dead grass growth controls cedars and stimulates growth of native grasses.""

While the use of fire is not something new in land management here Redfearn says progress has been made in the last 10 years when it comes to the acceptance of prescribed fire.

Another management option for weed control is controlled grazing. This works well with cheatgrass a water-robbing weed in the region.

""Cheatgrass begins to grow before native warm-season grasses and uses soil moisture and shades out early growth of grasses. Annual bromes like cheatgrass complete their life cycle in six weeks. The [nutritional] quality can be high before they become reproductive"" he says. The goal here is to graze cheatgrass early with a high stocking density.

""Manage them the opposite of the way you manage the forages you want"" Redfearn continues.

The University of Nebraska specialist adds ""Recently we've seen some chemicals that can control cheatgrass but they are quite expensive. Trying to control a grass in a grass when you're starting behind the eight ball is almost impossible.""

Georgia's Baxter agrees that where management works it can be the key to long-term improvements.

""Anything we can do to promote ground cover does more than patching up with herbicides. Put out potassium and lime to increase pH and use basic forage management. Leave enough residual forage whether you're cutting hay or grazing it.""

Bangladesh stood 84th among 113 countries across the globe and the last among South Asian nations according to the ninth annual Global Food Security Index (GFSI) published online on February 23.

The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) with sponsorship of Corteva Agriscience released the GFSI 2020.

Beginning from 2012 the EIU has been publishing the GFSI considering the categories -- food affordability availability quality and safety. This year it has also included 'Natural Resources and Resilience' as a category.

GFSI aims to guide the nations on systemic gaps of food security issues and most recently raise awareness about how Covid-19 impacts on food systems.

Based on these findings the global food security has also deteriorated says a Corteva Agriscience press release.

Bangladesh scored 50 points out of 100 in the GFSI findings. In 2019 the score was 51.6 which was a 0.3 decrease from the previous year's score of 51.9 and this year it decreased by 1.6 points further.

The 2020 Index stated that a changing climate and declining natural resources pose a serious challenge to future prosperity while it highlighted the importance of connecting farmers to information and markets adding that the future is only as secure as our food system.

Bangladesh gathered the lowest points of 35.8 from the newly added category of natural resources and resilience.

In the category Bangladesh lost points for lack of political commitment for climate adaptation a 65 percent of its land degradation highest risks in agricultural water quality and its exposure to climate change effects.

In food quality and safety category Bangladesh scored 40.9 points with 21 percent non-starch foods (all foods other than cereals roots and tubers) in total dietary energy consumption against world's average of 52.4 percent.

In this category Bangladesh lost points for failure to ensure micronutrient availability availability of Vitamin A iron zinc and quality protein failure to ensure food safety and safety mechanisms with 55.4 percent people having access to safely managed basic drinking water services and 85.2 percent people having access to electricity for storing food safely.

In food availability category Bangladesh scored the highest 64.4. Still the findings suggested that Bangladesh needs to develop its food supply adequacy road air port and rail infrastructures reduce corruption and ensure political stability.

In affordability category Bangladesh earned 48.3 points for its food safety net programmes.

The findings noted 52.9 percent of the population is living under global poverty line in Bangladesh and suggested to improve the operation of the food safety net programmes ensure farmers' access to markets agriculture financial services and access to diversified financial products.",,,,,,,,,

Costco chief executive Craig Jelinek announced the increase Thursday at a Senate Budget Committee hearing led by Sen. Bernie Sanders to examine wages at major companies. Jelinek said the starting wage for Costco employees would rise to $16 next week up from $15 the company instituted two year ago.

The starting wage scale puts Costco above competitors including Amazon Target and Best Buy which have $15 minimum wages. Walmart's starting pay is $11 an hour.

Jelinek said that the higher pay would bolster worker retention and productivity.

""I want to note: This isn't altruism"" Jelinek said. ""At Costco we know that paying employees good wages and providing affordable benefits makes sense for our business and constitutes a significant competitive advantage for us.""

Workers from Walmart and McDonald's testified at the hearing to demand those companies raise their minimum pay.

The federal minimum wage is a $7.25. Democrats are trying to push through a $1.9 trillion covid-19 relief bill that would include a provision raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour over five years a policy strongly opposed by Republicans.

That effort suffered a serious blow Thursday when the Senate parliamentarian decided the minimum wage provision must be dropped from the bill.

A growing number of states already have raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

Costco's announcement also was made as labor groups are demanding hazard pay for grocery employees and other essential workers which some companies offered at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and later ended.

Costco has continued to pay a $2 hourly premium to its workers since March. Jelinek said Costco would end the premium as the one-year mark approaches but would convert some of it through increases in wages across pay scales.

Costco has 180000 employees in the U.S. Jelinek said more than half make $25 an hour or more."

Mother-of-five Emma Manners 57 married David Manners 61 the 11th Duke of Rutland in June 1992 after meeting at a dinner party in 1990 and said her 'biggest regret' was the dissolution of her relationship.

The marriage broke down in 2012 after the Duke embarked on an affair with a woman who lived on his 15000-acre estate Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire which is known for featuring in Netflix 's The Crown.

However Emma chief executive of the estate and David who are still officially married both continued to live at the 200-year-old stately home in separate towers and she has previously insisted the pair are still the 'very best of friends'.

'It’s been wildly unconventional but maybe it’s grown up' said Emma in an interview with the Sunday Times 'The aristocracy has been behaving in those ways for generations.'

She spoke of the 'horrendous' separation from husband David admitting daughter Lady Violet Manners 27 struggled originally with the split - but is now in full support of her relationship with estate manager Phil Burtt.

Speaking to guest Lady Emma Ingilby of Ripley Castle in North Yorkshire on her podcast Duchess the Duchess of Rutland said she was sad she and the Duke hadn't 'made their journey together'.

Emma said: 'I am actually officially still married and the duke and I are legally separated but it of course always brings that little bit within one that we didn't just make that journey together.

'But we are the very best of friends and lucky enough for me he's put me in charge of carrying on the mantle together we run the estate and he's entrusted me with the job.'

The marriage broke down when the Duke of Rutland had an affair with Andrea Webb (pictured in 2017 with Alexander Webb)

Meanwhile David is happily ensconced with Tiggy Maconochie former agent to the late fashion photographer Helmut Newton according to the Daily Mail's Richard Eden.

The Duke split from his Brazilian-born lover Andrea Webb whom he had had the affair with two years ago.

Discussing the breakdown of her marriage for the Daily Mail in 2013 Emma said making sure the family stayed together - living in the same place and even sharing meals - hadn't been easy.

Emma pictured with Lady Violet in 2018 has also discussed the impact of the pandemic on local businesses on her estate on her podcast

She wrote: 'When I married David Marquis of Granby and heir to one of Britain’s most distinguished stately homes I expected life to be full of challenges. But this by far has been my hardest yet.

'When a relationship collapses there is often fault on both sides. Mine was definitely devoting too much time to the business and the children and not enough to my husband. I suppose both gave me focus and a sense of achievement that was lacking in our marriage.'

A change in the drinking culture and habits has seen the decline of pubs - and the coronavirus pandemic will no doubt mean others will sadly bite the dust too. But there was a time when your local was at the epicentre of everything.

For some it was a place to go and talk anything from sports to politics and for others it was somewhere to go and wind down after a hard day's graft.

Long before the birth of bars and clubs pubs were the places were everyone went to socialise and found out what was happening - without social media.

Don't get us wrong there are still some great pubs left in South Derbyshire but we've certainly lost some once cracking boozers.

Dwindling profits have led to the closures as people's lives have changed. The advent of cheap supermarket booze and our liking for drinking at home more are at the heart of many closures.

There were once dozens of much-loved pubs in the district but most of not all trace of many have now gone. Many have been turned into homes or just simply bulldozed.

See what you think to out list of once-loved places.

However if we have missed any pubs off the list that are no longer open please let us know.

A spokesman for the local Camra (Campaign for Real Ale) branch said that while more pubs seem to be closing in recent years the trend is not entirely new with boozers shutting down as early as the 1960s.

He said that pubs were closing because people are not visiting them any more.

He added that costs were rising for pubs increasing running expenses  and publicans were finding it harder and harder to make a living.

He added that competition from supermarkets for cheap booze was also proving difficult and that while pubs were seen as community hubs it was possible that people were less social than they used to be.

For the third consecutive game in a row the Sea Eagles played in wet conditions. The home side showed their resilience in defence and were strong in attack through the 60 minutes.

The victory leaves Manly undefeated from three wins and a bye.

The Sea Eagles got off to a perfect start with centre and captain Josh Feledy beating four defenders to go over in the corner from a Manly scrum win in the third minute. Hooker Ollie Cummins failed to convert the try from the sideline for a 4-0 scoreline.

Manly were very strong in the opening 10 minutes with some powerful runs and were unlucky not to score from a chip kick only for winger Revelation Sio to drop the ball.

The Magpies’ first real attacking opportunity came inside Manly’s quarter in the 12th minute but came up short due to another error in their play the ball.

Manly were then forced to soak up pressure on their line with the Magpies surprisingly taking a penalty goal 10 metres out through fullback Taj’h Colquhoun for a 4-2 score line five minutes later.

Some fine work from half-back Alfred Ah Chong and full-back Lehi Hopoate saw Sio make up for his earlier mistake when he dived over in the right corner in the 23rd minute. Cummins missed the conversion from the sideline for an 8-2 lead.

With three minutes to go Manly forward Rene Bagon crashed over off a penalty tap to score near the posts. Cummins converted for a 14-2 lead at half-time.

The Sea Eagles were denied a try in the opening minute of the second half when Cummins was held up over the line.

A silly mistake by the Sea Eagles proved costly with the Magpies scoring underneath the posts in the 34th minute through forward Solomone Saukuru. Colquhoun converted for a scoreline of 14-8.

On the back of errors and penalties and thanks to some solid footwork Magpies five-eighth Kit Laulilii scored on the edge five minutes later. Colquhoun converted to level the game at 14-all.

Cummins then showed his sheer strength and determination to fight for a try in the 46th minute after a strong run from Hopoate before leaving the field with right arm injury. Alfred Ah Chong converted the try to regain the lead 20-14.

The Sea Eagles were denied a chance to close out the game with two minutes remaining after the referee called the play back for a forward pass.

Manly held on after an error filled end to the second half and a late surge in the last minute from the Magpies to win the game.

This campaign will run throughout the month of March to honor mechanics across multiple countries where the 150-year-old engine oil brand operates.

Globally Valvoline launched its inaugural Valvoline Mechanics’ Month campaign in March 2020. This year the brand is geared up for extending the campaign in India also by giving special thanks to mechanics’ ongoing everyday service especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sandeep Kalia Managing Director Valvoline Cummins India said “Despite the COVID-19 pandemic service centers and auto-repair shops across India never stopped giving their best to us.

“With all the resilience they have shown in the past year it is imperative to shine the spotlight on these unsung heroes. Their efforts and dedication kept us moving all essential services were able to reach those in need throughout the pandemic. We are truly thankful to all our mechanic friends.

“Our brand history has been dedicated to support mechanics with a variety of programs. And due to the many changes hardships safety measures and overall alterations in how they’ve done their business in light of COVID-19 we want to step up our efforts even more to demonstrate partnership and support — and pave the way across the globe for others to do the same” Kalia said.

The Blarney woman was among some 350 people to receive the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at a mass vaccination clinic at the Bishopstown campus of Munster Technological University (MTU) today.

The centre will be used by a number of GP practices to vaccinate patients aged 70 years and older over the coming weeks.

Today GPs vaccinated in the region of 350 patients aged 85 or over from certain GP practices in Cork City and Cork East.

It is expected that 2500 people aged at least 70 will be vaccinated by GPs at the facility over at least the next six weekends.

Nora who has six children 11 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren said she was delighted to have received the vaccine.

The Blarney woman said that thankfully the past few months have not been too difficult for her.

“I didn’t mind it. I read the papers and books and the neighbours were ringing me. My family are living near me” she said.

Asked what she was most looking forward to once she received her second dose of the vaccine she laughed saying “I’d like a glass of brandy” adding that she was looking forward to a visit to her local.

Glasheen couple Rhona and George Coulter also received the vaccine today with Rhona saying she felt “terrific” and “excited” to get the jab.

The couple said while they've missed things like playing tennis dancing and seeing friends over the past few months they have enjoyed each other's company.

“I’m a ballroom dancing teacher and I’d be working morning noon and night so now I nearly had a year off” said Rhona.

She said that she and George planned their routine together each day.

“We went for a walk every day and we enjoy each other's company and we’re getting on grand. We listen to the news.""

The couple already has a plan for the first things they would like to do once they have received the vaccine and restrictions have eased with Rhona saying she looking forward to hugging her grandchildren.

“To see all the family will be the first thing then to see the friends and have some of the dancers back” she said.

After that Rhona said they are looking forward to the day when they can go on holidays again.

Dr Mike Thompson from Imokilly Medical Centre is GP lead at the centre and is co-ordinating the GPs and administrative staff as well as the medical students who have volunteered their services at the facility.

He said that there was a sense of euphoria at the centre today.

“We have 21 GP practices today with over 50 GPs and practice nurses coming together to vaccinate the eldest people of our population today the over 85s who have definitely borne the brunt of it with cocooning or with Covid.”

He said it was a big relief for patients as they began to receive the vaccine.

“It’s the start of the end we hope.

“Everyone is so grateful and there’s just a fantastic atmosphere here today.” he said.

The Taoiseach paid a visit to the vaccine centre on Saturday.

Speaking to the Echo he said that there are already positive signs coming from the vaccination programme.

“It’s wonderful to see the happiness amongst people who have been vaccinated our senior citizens. They’re waiting for this. It’s very good the manner in which it’s been organised by the GPs coordinating a number of practices coming together here to the Munster Institute of technology along with the HSE.

“We’re now beginning to see already in our nursing homes and in our hospitals the impact of the vaccination programme. It’s reducing very significantly the level of disease and so it has made sense that we have focused efforts initially on the most senior of our citizens initially age-wise and also in terms of front-line healthcare workers that’s already bearing fruit.

“As we go through the age-cohorts in time we will have very significant numbers of people who would ordinarily be very vulnerable to this disease who will now be protected from it by the vaccines.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaC5jb20uYXUvYnVzaW5lc3MvY29tcGFuaWVzL2xhbmRsb3Jkcy1yZS1sZWFzZS1hcy1kZXBhcnRtZW50LXN0b3Jlcy1kb3duc2l6ZS0yMDIxMDIyNS1wNTc1dHUuaHRtbNIBb2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNtaC5jb20uYXUvYnVzaW5lc3MvY29tcGFuaWVzL2xhbmRsb3Jkcy1yZS1sZWFzZS1hcy1kZXBhcnRtZW50LXN0b3Jlcy1kb3duc2l6ZS0yMDIxMDIyNS1wNTc1dHUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Landlords re-lease as department stores downsize,"Shopping centre landlords and retailers are undertaking further restructuring in malls to adapt to new shopping habits and how consumers use malls in the post-pandemic era.

While tenants such as department stores have shrunk stores over recent years there has been a fresh wave of activity to future-proof malls by landlords allocating space to new tenancies by downsizing areas where space is no longer required.

One consideration for landlords is that department stores take an average 20 plus 20-year lease in a mall and can negotiate lower average leases. Smaller stores have shorter leases and are charged higher rents which make them more attractive for owners.

And it is another set of violent deaths in an area still coming to terms with the gruesome discovery earlier this month of the body of a woman in a burning car.

As news of this latest double-murder and suicide tragedy began to emerge in the early hours of Friday morning people's thoughts turned to the sequence of events which tore the O'Sullivan family apart in Kanturk late last year and wondered if something similar had occurred near Kildorrery.

On October 26 last a father and son took their own lives after shooting another son in a dispute over land in the Raheen area of Kanturk.

Gardaí believe Tadhg O’Sullivan 59 and his son Diarmuid 23 killed Mr O’Sullivan’s oldest son Mark 26 at the family home following a prolonged and increasingly bitter dispute over who would inherit portions of the 115-acre family farm.

Gardaí believe Mark’s mother Anne 60 was spared by her husband and younger son so that she could live with the torment of what they had done knowing that they had killed the son they believe she favoured.

A detailed suicide note found close to the bodies of Mr O’Sullivan and Diarmuid gave an insight into the bitter dispute.

It is understood Diarmuid was set to inherit a small field of relatively poor land and that he and his father in particular felt that Mark a trainee solicitor was being favoured.

It is also believed Mr O'Sullivan was the main influence in the dispute and that Diarmuid to a large extent followed his father’s lead.

It’s believed they confronted Mark in a bedroom that night and blasted him to death with rifles and let Anne flee the scene to the safety of a neighbour's house where she raised the alarm.

The father and son then walked the short distance to a nearby field and shot themselves.

Gardaí stress that they are at the very early stages of their investigation into the Kanturk killings and a motive is unclear.

But it is understood they will be exploring whether there was any dispute between the brothers in relation to land ownership or farm income as well as trying to establish whether any physical or mental health issues may have contributed to the tragedy.

Mary O'Keeffe

The north Cork region was left reeling after another devastating tragedy earlier this month when the body of Mary O’Keeffe 72 from Dromahane near Mallow was found in a burning car near woodland in Dromdeer East near Doneraile on February 4.

Michael Leonard 62 of Hillcrest Glenosheen Kilmallock Co Limerick remains in Garda custody having been charged with her murder.

And on September 4 2014 twin nine-year-old brothers Patrick and Thomas O’Driscoll were found stabbed to death at their home in Charleville.

An inquest later heard the wounds were inflicted by their brother Jonathan O’Driscoll 21 whose body was found about 14km away in Buttevant less than an hour later. He had taken his own life.

The inquest also heard how a road traffic accident relationship breakups the suicide of a close cousin Jonathan's quest for information about his birth family and concerns over a pending court appearance linked to a minor road traffic offence all combined to send him spiralling into depression.

Despite engagement with the mental health services and an improvement in his health in the weeks before the tragic murder-suicide it emerged he had stopped taking his medication just days before he stabbed his twin brothers to death and took his own life."

And with more vaccines being rapidly released across the country your turn to get a COVID-19 vaccine could be sooner than you think. Right now the current vaccine options are Pfizer and Moderna but more brands could be approved very soon.

While not all groups are eligible to get a COVID-19 vaccine at this time some places are offering a waitlist for anyone to sign up to get a vaccine if any are available. Last month President Joe Biden said he expects anyone that who wants to get the vaccine will be able to do so by this spring. Vaccine distribution has already ramped up by 70% since Biden took office The White House reported in a tweet on Friday.

If you're ready to get a COVID-19 vaccine you'll want to call your health insurance provider for the best options to make sure you're fully covered as some venues could charge an administration fee. Also note that smaller hospitals may receive a smaller number of COVID-19 vaccines at this time with larger health facilities that have the most coronavirus patients expected to get a larger majority.

Note that prioritization and organization of who gets a vaccine are being handled on the state level and in many cases on the county level. Some counties and hospitals are encouraging people to get vaccinated wherever they can rather than waiting for their primary care facility.

Here's where you can get the COVID-19 vaccine when it's your turn.

With coronavirus doses being released at ample speed you may have your choice of providers when you receive your inoculation. All of that will depend on which vaccine brand or type is available near where you live. You may have fewer choices if you're in one of the first groups to receive the immunization. More options may be ready by the time there are enough vaccine doses for people in later groups.

Angela Bassett is nudging her kids into a musical path.

During E!'s red carpet coverage before the 2021 Golden Globes the actress 62 shared how her 15-year-old twins Bronwyn and Slater whom she shares with husband Courtney B. Vance liked her movie Soul. The jazz-centric Disney/Pixar film went on to win the award for best animated feature.

""They loved it. They both play the piano and rap and play guitar so they have a little musical interest that I drill into them that I insist upon!"" she said. ""But I thought maybe they wouldn't get into it because it's jazz ... but surprisingly they loved it. They got a lot of the themes a lot of the ideas from it and really appreciated it.""

While chatting with host Janine Rubenstein on PEOPLE's brand-new podcast PEOPLE Every Day earlier this month Bassett said her kids have never seen her popular 1993 film What's Love Got to Do With It.

Bassett said her kids ""haven't seen it"" and she's not doing anything to change that. ""Let them discover it"" she said. ""Let their friends discover it ... maybe [then] I'd get some more respect around here! ... I tell them you don't know what I got up my sleeve.""

That's not to say her kids are totally in the dark about their mom's talents: ""They really enjoyed [Soul]"" Bassett noted at the time.

The release of former General Electric (GE 0.48%) CEO Jeff Immelt's book Hot Seat is naturally drawing attention to the company and GE's future under current CEO Larry Culp. One of the key questions it raises is the role of luck in management. To be fair Immelt has been putting much of the blame for GE's downfall on himself but he's also acknowledging the unfortunate headwinds he suffered during his 2001-2017 tenure. Let's take a look at what happened and more importantly what it means for GE investors right now.

A troubled beginning

Immelt certainly had his unfair share of bad luck as CEO of GE. After inheriting a sprawling empire of businesses ranging from NBC household appliances and plastics to gas turbines aircraft engines and a huge finance arm GE Capital Immelt was immediately hit by the impact of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on aviation.

Moreover the 2000-2010 decade proved to be a moderate one for spending on power and GE Plastics found itself suffering cost increases due to the surge in the price of oil over the decade. At the same time GE's lack of significant oil and gas business meant it missed out on the boom.

Immelt spent much of his first decade trying to grow the financing arm of the business in order to generate the earnings necessary to support investment in the industrial businesses. History and specifically the 2008 financial crisis would not be kind in assessing the wisdom of that strategy and GE took another major hit during the financial crisis.

Moreover the long-term negative ramifications of bulking up GE Capital with unfavorable deals would be felt for years afterwards. For example in 2018 (Immelt left the previous year) GE was forced to take a $6.2 billion charge relating to its insurance portfolio.

After the financial crisis

It gets worse. Turning to the industrial side. Immelt spent the period recovering from the financial crisis by disposing of non-core businesses and pivoting the company toward its industrial businesses.To his credit Immelt was an early adopter of digital technology and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). One of his big ideas was to grow GE's industrial scale in specific businesses apply GE's IIoT solutions and offer customers more productive solutions.

It was a rather simple and compelling big-picture strategy. Industrial businesses in GE's wheelhouse grow scale then sprinkle on the magic dust of IIoT from GE Digital (the company's IIoT business) and watch as GE generates more profitability from the assets.

Horrible acquisitions

Unfortunately it didn't work and it's only in 2021 that GE Digital is set to start generating profit.

Having been underexposed to the rising price of oil in the previous decade Immelt decided to acquire a slew of oil and gas equipment and services companies through the 2010-2017 period. Wellstream (a flexible pipemaker) the well support division of John Wood Group Lufkin Industries (artificial lift technology) and the reciprocating compression division of Cameron International were bought in a multi-billion dollar flurry of activity from 2010-2014. All of it lead to the buyout of Baker Hughes in 2017. Now GE definitely had scale in oil and gas but it also had a major slump in the price of oil to contend with.

It's easy to criticize Immelt for buying these businesses but whomsoever predicted the collapse in oil prices from 2014 to 2020 has the right to cast the first stone.

It gets worse. At the same time as GE was buying oil businesses Immelt oversaw the disastrous acquisition of Alstom's power and grid business for 12.35 billion euros in 2015. Here again the logic of adding scale in order to attach GE's digital capability made sense. Moreover before reaching for stones readers should note that Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries also bid for Alstom's assets. Unfortunately the market for heavy-duty gas turbines would fall by half from 2015-2020.

It all resulted in Immelt spending the remainder of his tenure in 2017 stubbornly tied to the mast of guiding toward $2 in EPS by the end of 2018. The ship the mast and the EPS guidance went down with Immelt in 2017.

So was it all because of bad luck?

The harder you practice the luckier you get

Aside from Immelt's admission of his own failures at GE the strongest argument against pinning the blame on luck is that GE has been unlucky since Immelt left as well. However Culp is doing an admirable job under far worse circumstances than Immelt had at his outset in building a resilient company.

I have two examples for you. The sale of the biopharma business to Culp's former company Danaher (DHR 0.55%) looked like a great deal for Danaher at the end of 2019 but it now looks like a fantastic one after COVID-19 boosted its sales. While GE needed the cash from the biopharma sale it probably would have got a much better price for it after the pandemic hit.

Second the collapse in air travel has crushed earnings at GE's most profitable business aircraft engines and aftermarket sales and service for engines.

That said GE's stock price somehow sits 8% higher than when Culp took over in October 2018 and the company looks positioned to embark on a multi-year recovery in 2021. Much of this is a result of Culp's actions to reduce debt the selling off of non-core assets and the focus on lean management techniques to generate every bit of margin improvement he can out of GE's businesses.

Meanwhile GE is now building a recent history of under-promising and over-delivering on guidance. Unlike Immelt Culp is not betting the farm on big-picture strategic bets that could go wrong if end-market circumstances change.

There's no luck in all of that.",,,,,,,,,

(Progressive Farmer image by Matthew Wilde)

Few things make Jim Loeb happier than the roar of a John Deere 5020 and the subsequent belch of black exhaust as the small but mighty diesel tractor lunges forward with a full grain cart in tow.

The jubilant feelings intensify when Loeb's 17-year-old grandson Clayton Loeb is behind the wheel. It encapsulates everything the 71-year-old La Porte City Iowa farmer holds dear: family farming and vintage John Deere tractors.

""My grandson was trying to get up a hill with the 1967 5020 pulling a 900-bushel grain cart and he didn't make it"" Jim recalls during the past harvest. ""He backs her down.

""I said 'The old girl is pissed off she can do it.' It started barking as he went up the hill (again)"" he continues. ""He had her revved up this time (and made it). That's good for a little bitty [engine] block pulling 50000 pounds (of corn) and the tractor and grain cart weighing another 30000 pounds.""

It didn't shock Loeb the tractor conquered the hill. He and his family restored the vintage green tractor years before to have beauty and power. They installed a turbo to crank out about 170 hp which is about 50 more than when it rolled off the assembly line in nearby Waterloo Iowa.

""She will pull anything"" says Clayton a senior at Union High School. ""She surprises me every day.""

FAMILY TRADITION

Loeb Farms has 15 vintage John Deere tractors -- two 3010s a 4010 a 4020 powershift two 4320s three 5020s and six 6030s -- in its stable of tractors. Most are fully restored.

The Loebs predominantly use John Deere tractors built in the 1960s and '70s which lack the creature comforts and technology of modern machines to grow about 1000 acres of corn.

The family's newest tractor a 1995 John Deere 8400 with front-wheel assist is considered the ugly stepsister of the fleet. Jim farms with his son Clint and his wife Seraysa and two of their six children. Even though the 8400 has an air-ride seat GPS guidance and auto-steer they all prefer the older tractors. They primarily use the 8400 out of necessity to plant where technology is needed.

""You would think you would want to drive the newer tractor but in reality it's not nearly as comfortable compared to the old 6030"" Clint says. ""It rides so smooth and it turns great. You hit the inside brake and she goes right around.""

BUCKING THE TREND

It's not uncommon on farmsteads today to see an older tractor or two power an auger or pull a wagon. However it is unusual in an era of precision agriculture for an operation that isn't a hobby farm to shun tractors with roomy luxurious cabs and push-button controls and filled with technology.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFncmljdWx0dXJlLmNvbS9tYWNoaW5lcnkvaGF5LWFuZC1mb3JhZ2UtZXF1aXBtZW50L21ha2luZy1oYXktYS1oaXN0b3J5LW9mLWhlc3N0b24tY29ycG9yYXRpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Making hay: A history of Hesston Corporation,"I love reading corporate histories especially when they are about agribusiness. I just finished Factory on the Plains: Lyle Yost and Hesston Corporation which tells the story of Hesston farm equipment from its humble beginnings through the eventual consolidation with AGCO. Having spent much of my teenage years cutting hay in a Hesston Swather I found this history particularly interesting.

Hesston Corporation began almost by accident. Lyle Yost a Kansas farmer and early custom harvester was frustrated by the long unloading times required by 1950s combines that used gravity flow to empty their grain bins. With the help of a local welder he fabricated an unloading auger to mount onto the side of his combine and speed up unloading. It worked and he was quickly flooded with requests from other combine owners who wanted to buy unloading augers. He hired a number of local farmers to fabricate augers when not busy on the farm and Hesston Corporation was born.

In a few years all combine manufacturers would incorporate unloading augers into their designs and Hesston sought new ways to help farmers. This theme — increasing the efficiency of farming — continued to drive the purpose of the company. It acquired the design rights to a hay windrower — the swather — from an Iowa farmer who had designed and built his own hay machine. Production was moved to Hesston Kansas and upscaled. The swather was a hit revolutionizing how hay was cut and cured for thousands of farmers and ranchers. Hesston continued to focus on haying equipment for the next two decades.

Hesston later branched into other market segments by acquiring smaller companies improving their products and streamlining production. By the mid 1970s Hesston was the ninth largest farm equipment manufacturer and the United States' leading manufacturer of haying equipment. It sold haying equipment in across the globe.

However in 1976 the agricultural market entered a long downward trough that would continue for nearly a decade. Farmers decided to hold onto equipment longer and dealer lots were filled with equipment that wasn't selling. Hesston avoided bankruptcy by selling a controlling interest in the company shares to Fiat Corporation of Italy. Yost and other founders retired or lost their board seats. Hesston would never again be controlled by its founders. Today it is a subsidiary of AGCO.

Hesston's story tells a similar story to other farm equipment companies (e.g. John Deere Kinze Vermeer). These companies were started by entrepreneurs who wanted to solve specific problems on the farm. Demand for their solutions pushed them to start companies to mass produce their fixes. In a world where venture capital often looks for problems to solve with existing solutions it's refreshing to read about how one entrepreneur did the opposite working hard to find solutions to farmers' problems.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzI3L3doeS1iaWxsLWdhdGVzLWlzLW5vdy10aGUtdXMtYmlnZ2VzdC1mYXJtbGFuZC1vd25lci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The real reason why Bill Gates is now the US' biggest farmland owner,"Late last year Eric O’Keefe was researching a mysterious recent purchase of 14500 acres of prime Washington state farmland. His magazine The Land Report tracks major land transactions and produces an annual list of the 100 biggest US landowners.

Sales of more than a thousand acres are “blue-moon events” O’Keefe noted so this one stood out. And Eastern Washington has some of the richest most expensive farmland in the country. But the purchaser of record was a small obscure company in Louisiana.

“That immediately set off alarm bells” O’Keefe says.

He assigned his research team to dig a little deeper. Soon they came back with the answer: The Louisiana company was acting on behalf of Cascade Investment LLC the secretive investment firm that manages most of the huge fortune belonging to Bill Gates.

O’Keefe knew Gates had been acquiring farmland for years mostly through various Cascade subsidiaries. The mogul’s holdings include large tracts in Illinois Iowa Louisiana California and about a dozen other states. With the Washington state acreage and other recent additions to his portfolio O’Keefe calculated Gates now owns at least 242000 acres of American farmland.

“Bill Gates co-founder of Microsoft has an alter ego” O’Keefe wrote: “Farmer Bill the guy who owns more farmland than anyone else in America.”

The Land Report scoop made headlines. Many stories focused on Gates’ longstanding interest in climate change and sustainability and suggested those concerns might be driving the land purchases. Newsweek called him a “sustainable agriculture champion.”

Those stories dovetailed with earlier reports about Gates’ large land acquisitions in Arizona. Most notably in 2017 the Gates-affiliated Mt. Lemmon Holdings invested in some 40 square miles of “transitional” land on the western fringe of the Phoenix sprawl. (According to The Land Report Gates owns about 27000 acres of non-agricultural land in addition to his farm holdings.)

Some partners in the Arizona project issued a press release touting plans to build “a forward-thinking community … that embraces cutting-edge technology.” There was talk of “high-speed digital networks” and “autonomous logistics hubs.” That was all it took for many in the media to conclude that Gates was personally engineering the city of the future.

“Bill Gates has started laying out his plans for creating a ‘smart city’ in Phoenix Arizona” science-news outlet Futurism wrote. This high-tech metropolis “could be both a breeding and testing ground for futuristic technologies.”

In reality the idea that Bill Gates was single-handedly reinventing farming — or designing cities of tomorrow — was almost entirely speculation.

“There’s a tendency in the media to personalize this” O’Keefe says. “People want to know ’Why does Bill Gates want all this land?’ ”

But hyper-wealthy people like Gates don’t make every decision personally O’Keefe notes. “He has very competent investment managers.”

Given that Gates is the third-richest person in the world — with an estimated net worth of $132 billion he falls in behind Tesla founder Elon Musk and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos — those money managers have their hands full.

Investment guru Michael Larson who has worked with Gates since 1994 runs the Washington-based Cascade Investment as well as supervising the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s nearly $50 billion endowment.

“The arrangement is simple” The Wall Street Journal wrote in a 2014 profile. “Mr. Larson makes money and Mr. Gates gives it away.”

Larson and his team are famously tight-lipped. Cascade employees almost never speak to the press. According to the Journal they are even discouraged from using Facebook and other social-media platforms. (Through a spokesperson the company declined to comment for this article.)

Larson sees to it that Gates’ wealth is sensibly even conservatively invested. According to public records the billionaire’s portfolio includes shares in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate a Coca-Cola bottling company and the tractor manufacturer Deere & Co. among other non-flashy investments.

People want to know “Why does Bill Gates want all this land?” Eric O’Keefe of The Land Report magazine

Larson also makes sure Gates keeps his eggs in a wide variety of baskets. His portfolio is diversified in other words. And that’s where the land purchases come in.

Most of us imagine farmers tilling the soil that has been in their families for generations. But many farmers lease at least some of the land they cultivate. According to Bruce Sherrick a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign about 60 percent of row-crop farmland in the Midwest is leased. The landowners can include investors like Gates.

For investors who know what they’re doing agricultural land offers financial stability in uncertain times.

“Farmland has had a remarkably consistent ability to hedge against inflation” Sherrick says.

And it tends to be “negatively correlated” against other investments he adds: If the stock market is going down the return on farmland is likely to be going up.

But farmland isn’t easy to buy.

7 Bill Gates’ portfolio even includes shares in John Deere. Alamy

“You can’t just say I’ve got $30000 saved up and I want to buy some farmland” Sherrick notes. Large investors usually work with expert advisors to help them acquire and manage their agricultural holdings.

According to press reports Gates’ farmland empire is mostly managed by a Cascade subsidiary called Cottonwood Ag Management. But the details are murky and there is no evidence that the billionaire’s farmland-buying spree is driven by anything more than a desire to have a well-diversified portfolio.

“When Ted Turner bought his Flying D Ranch in Montana in 1989 that was his personal passion” O’Keefe says. “Bill Gates’ land purchases look to me more like sensible long-term holds run by experienced asset managers.”

The same logic likely holds for Gates’ Arizona acquisitions. The largest parcel a proposed 24800-acre development known as Belmont might someday contain 80000 homes along with offices retail industrial and logistics facilities. At least that’s what the developers partnered with Gates’ investment group have promised.

For now though all that “smart city” talk is more than a little premature. As Slate financial writer Henry Grabar concluded the proposed town of Belmont is “not a city nor is it ‘smart’ nor does the Microsoft founder appear to be involved in any meaningful way.”

7 Gates’ largest parcel of land is a proposed 24800-acre development known as Belmont in Arizona. Google Maps

But while Belmont might not be a smart city it still looks like a smart investment.

The region west of Phoenix is booming. The nearby community of Buckeye has grown more than tenfold in the last 20 years. And the Belmont property is located along Interstate 10 the region’s major east-west artery making it an excellent location for Amazon-style warehouse complexes.

There’s also a proposal to build a new interstate linking Phoenix to Las Vegas. That proposed superhighway would run across a 5-mile stretch of the Belmont property. The project isn’t yet funded. But if it ever gets built it would boost the value of Gates’ land dramatically.

Today the Belmont tract remains mostly empty desert. Most likely it is just one more asset in Gates’ vast portfolio quietly appreciating in value while the billionaire himself remains at arm’s length.

People involved in the Gates financial empire stress that the family’s philanthropic endeavors are kept separate from their investments and business ventures. But some of the software pioneer’s investments do reveal his grander goals.

Gates — who stepped down from day-to-day involvement with Microsoft in 2008 — has long been looking for ways to help the world’s poorest and to address the planet’s environmental challenges.

7 Gates has invested in plant-based substitutes like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat which one day hope to rival the beef industry. NurPhoto via Getty Images

In 2006 he helped launch TerraPower a company developing a new type of compact ultra-safe nuclear reactor. In a recent episode of “60 Minutes” Gates explained that zero-carbon energy sources like nuclear power are vital in reducing the emissions that warm the atmosphere.

“Without innovation we will not solve climate change” Gates said. “We won’t even come close.”

Since 2016 Gates has led Breakthrough Energy Ventures a venture-capital fund that invests in clean-technology startups. The fund recently raised $1 billion which it is pouring into companies developing hydrogen-fueled airplanes zero-carbon building materials and other green innovations.

His environmental bent also extends to farming. Gates has invested in Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat two companies producing beef substitutes including the Impossible Burger. In his new book “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster” Gates explains why raising beef cattle causes more harmful emissions than other forms of agriculture. He hopes plant-based substitutes will allow us to “cut down on meat eating while still enjoying the taste of meat.”

And the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently launched a new division known as Gates Ag One. It aims to help poor farmers especially in Africa and South Asia get the “tools technologies and resources they need to lift themselves out of poverty.” If each acre can produce more food that’s good news for farmers. But it also means we can devote less of the planet’s surface to farmland which is good news for forests and ecosystems.

Meanwhile American agriculture today is being transformed as farmers employ new technologies and Big Data to help them manage their crops. That can mean better yields with decreased use of fertilizers and pesticides. Which in turn means less impact on the environment.

Farms also have a role in fighting climate change. With proper techniques the carbon from decaying plant matter can be kept safely in the soil rather than entering the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide.

A new coalition of farmland owners operators and environmental groups is working to come up with verifiable standards for sustainable farming. The group is called Leading Harvest and the Gates-linked Cottonwood Ag is one of its founding members.

Leading Harvest envisions a kind of sustainability seal of approval certifying that a given farm meets environmental standards. The program could be an economic boon for farmers.

“In the future farmers will be paid for sustainability” says Sherrick who sits on the group’s board. There will be incentives for things like using less water fewer chemicals and storing more carbon.

The group’s founding members are expected to spearhead the rollout of the new standards on their own lands.

Whether or not Gates personally directed Cottonwood Ag to get involved in the Leading Harvest project the move makes both environmental and business sense.

“The new green economy will mean new opportunities for land owners” O’Keefe believes.

“Farming is all of a sudden part of the solution and not just part of the problem” Sherrick adds. He sees Gates’ involvement — even if indirect — as crucial in encouraging the industry to embrace the new sustainability standard.

If the nation’s largest farmland owner can show that farming can be both sustainable and profitable that will make a big difference.

“People are going to pay attention to what Bill is doing” Sherrick says.

Delta Air Lines is paying out bonuses to management employees to compensate them for pay cuts mandated in 2020 as part of the airline’s pandemic belt-tightening. An airline spokesperson confirmed the payments.

The carrier is paying out these management bonuses while on government payroll support and they aren’t offering any ‘make goods’ to front line employees who have seen their hours (and thus pay) cut or for lower-level employees who in some cases were reduced to three or four day work weeks and received less pay.

According to a Delta employee with knowledge of the matter the bonuses break down as follows:



Managers (Grades 8-10): $8000



General Managers (Grade 11): $25000



Directors & Managing Directors (Grades 12-13): $25000 – $250000



Sr. Vice Presidents: $250000 or more

Delta went to great lengths to avoid furloughing any employees during the pandemic while carriers like American and United furloughed over 15000 workers apiece. They did this through aggressive efforts to encourage voluntary departures reduced hours for employees who remained on payroll and finding other jobs in the company for staff to do while reducing use of contractors and outsourcing.

Much of customer service and above- and below-the wing wing employee compensation has come in the form of profit sharing where Delta has been by far the most generous in the industry. Employees aren’t seeing profit sharing for 2020 and saw pay cut through reduced work as well. However they’ve been fully paid for the work they did do and don’t benefit from this program.

Instead Delta’s make-good focuses strictly on manager-level workers only who in some cases worked as much or more in 2020 as in 2019 but for less pay. As Delta spokesperson Anthony Black explains

While all Delta people were affected by the worst year in our history following a comprehensive pay review of all levels in our organization below the executive officer level we identified levels that were disproportionately impacted as a result of last year’s events and made a one-time adjustment payment.

This is all happening as the U.S. House of Representatives passed the President’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package which includes a third airline bailout meaning more payroll subsidies for Delta and other airlines. Yet Delta is voluntarily taking on additional payroll cost for their highest paid workers while taxpayers are being asked to cover the expense.

One positive spin to all this though is that Delta doesn’t see the need for continued belt-tightening among management employees and this suggests the world – and airline industry – may be on the cusp of recovering.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1ib2VpbmctNzY3LXByb2JsZW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Air Lines Has A Problem: The Boeing 767,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1ib2VpbmctNzY3LXByb2JsZW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc3V6YW5uZXJvd2Fua2VsbGVoZXIvMjAyMS8wMi8yNy9oZXJlcy10aGUtZmluZS1mb3ItcHVuY2hpbmctYS1kZWx0YS1mbGlnaHQtYXR0ZW5kYW50LWluLXRoZS1mYWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's The Fine For Punching A Flight Attendant In The Face,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2021/02/27/heres-the-fine-for-punching-a-delta-flight-attendant-in-the-face/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc3V6YW5uZXJvd2Fua2VsbGVoZXIvMjAyMS8wMi8yNy9oZXJlcy10aGUtZmluZS1mb3ItcHVuY2hpbmctYS1kZWx0YS1mbGlnaHQtYXR0ZW5kYW50LWluLXRoZS1mYWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZGVsdGEtcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy0yNzUwMC1maW5lLWZvci1oaXR0aW5nLWZsaWdodC1hdHRlbmRhbnQtaW4tbWFzay1yb3ctMjAyMS0y0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1wYXNzZW5nZXJzLTI3NTAwLWZpbmUtZm9yLWhpdHRpbmctZmxpZ2h0LWF0dGVuZGFudC1pbi1tYXNrLXJvdy0yMDIxLTI_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta passenger's $27500 fine for hitting flight attendant in mask row,"The unnamed passenger had been traveling on Flight 1997 from Miami to Atlanta on October 19.

A Delta Air Lines passenger is facing a $27500 fine for hitting a flight attendant according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

The unnamed passenger traveled on a flight from Miami to Atlanta on October 19 and was sitting next to a passenger who refused to wear his mask secure his tray table or fasten his seatbelt.

As a result Flight 1997 was forced to return to the gate and both the unruly passenger and their neighbor were asked to leave the plane.

However the FAA said: ""In response the passenger accompanying the non-compliant traveler ignored the flight attendant's instructions began yelling expletives at the flight attendant and other passengers and struck the flight attendant under her left eye.""

In January the FAA announced a stricter unruly passenger policy after dealing with over 1300 cases in the past 10 years including recent violent refusals to wear face masks.

Now passengers who interfere with attack or threaten to physically assault aircraft crew or anyone else on an aircraft now face fines of up to $35000 as well as potential imprisonment.

In a statement at the time Delta said: ""There is nothing more important than the safety of our people and customers.

""That's why two customers who did not comply with crew safety instructions were asked to deplane Flight 1997 this evening.

""We do not tolerate violence of any kind and this situation is currently under investigation.""

The passenger facing the $27500 fine now has 30 days to respond to the FAA's enforcement letter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2FpcmxpbmUtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAyLzI4L2hhd2FpaWFuLWFpcmxpbmVzLXJlY29yZHMtdG9wLWZsaWdodC1wdW5jdHVhbGl0eS1mb2xsb3dlZC1kZWx0YS82ODYyMjI4MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hawaiian Airlines records top flight punctuality followed by Delta,"Associated Press

In my case the first major career development opportunity was the Industry Trek to New York City. Applications for the trek opened just weeks after the start of my first semester. After an understandably competitive application process (including video submissions) I was selected as one of the attendees from the Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) program. This is my tale of the trek.

Day 1: FinTech Credit Suisse and more

If you don’t know about the International Business School’s Industry Treks you should. Students travel to and spend several days in a major U.S. city visiting companies in a particular industry and learning from and networking with people in that field. The best thing about it? Treks are paid for by the business school. All you have to do is show up and make the most of it. The New York City trek was focused on finance (which is where my career interests lie). It was a great way to kick-start my career development at Brandeis!

After arriving at our hotel near Times Square the night before the morning of the first day involved a visit to a FinTech accelerator in the Flatiron District. This was an opportunity for our group to discover opportunities in finance that we probably wouldn’t have otherwise encountered. Like Boston New York is a FinTech hub and we heard from several businesses at various stages of development — from a two-man shop developing immersive job experience simulations for students to an AI company (Forward Lane) that practically took up a whole floor of the building. We had Q&A sessions with these companies toured the building and then heard a longer interactive presentation from Forward Lane. This first morning of the trek was an unexpected highlight for me because I learned that there are a variety of businesses and business cultures within New York City’s financial industry. It was exciting and definitely set the pace for the rest of the trip.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdWRyZXZpZXcuY29tL2ZpbnRlY2gtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1odWItYnJpbmdpbmctdGhlLXdvcmtwbGFjZS1pbnRvLXRoZS1jbGFzc3Jvb20v0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly91ZHJldmlldy5jb20vZmludGVjaC1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWh1Yi1icmluZ2luZy10aGUtd29ya3BsYWNlLWludG8tdGhlLWNsYXNzcm9vbS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FinTech Innovation Hub: bringing the workplace into the classroom,"A composite image of the current construction and concept imagery of the FinTech Innovation Hub on STAR Campus.

Senior Reporter

STAR Campus’ newest addition the FinTech Innovation Hub owned by Delaware Technical Park reached its halfway point in construction on Feb. 10 according to a recent UDaily article. In this update it states that construction is “on schedule” to be completed by Nov. 2021.

Levi Thompson dean of the engineering college said that the expectation is that they will be ready to occupy the building in Spring 2022. Thompson has been heavily involved in the FinTech Innovation Hub and has worked closely with the Lerner College in this project.

City Councilman James Horning was one of many to sign the final beam in construction of the building. Horning said he is especially proud and is fully in support of this project because of the financial opportunities it offers for Newark and its residents.

“I’m proud of this project primarily because Newark is an attractive location for new business you know not every area can say that but especially in a time when the economy is hurting and people are looking for work and at the same time our city revenue has taken a hit due to [COVID-19]” Horning said. “It’s a nice promising sign of a bright future in Newark.”

Horning hopes that the FinTech Innovation Hub is an initial step in the direction of STAR Campus becoming more of a hub for financial technology. He also said that it is a great central location for this building and others as the train station has also just been renovated.

Going forward Horning said that he hopes the building will employ many residents and to some extent help support local businesses.

“Maybe if [employees] have a long enough lunch hour they would patronize the restaurants either by dining in or maybe catering to their facilities something like that” Horning said. “There’s a lot of ways this can contribute to the economy and help the full-time residents.”

In terms of opportunities for students Thompson said the FinTech Innovation Hub will help students build skills that will prepare them to have an impact on the workforce.

“I think we build better skills when we’re working potentially directly with the people that are going to employ our students” Thompson said. “So in that FinTech world partnering with Discover Bank makes all the sense in the world and then [with] our college of business and economics that also makes all the sense in the world.”

Thompson also said that this building will provide students with the opportunity to learn “real world skills” that makes them even more valuable to the workforce. Currently students sometimes lack those “real world skills” and might require additional training because of it according to him.

“So when you’re on the job or you’re in the workforce a lot of times they have to do some additional training or some exposure to other material” Thompson said. “We’ll try to bring that in and start that a lot earlier and I think the students will love it because they’ll actually have some perspective about how they use their skills.”

Thompson reflected on his experience in school and said he himself lacked those “real world skills” that make someone so valuable and equipped to be a part of the industry.

“When I was in school I thought I knew what a chemical engineer did but the reality is that engineers do a lot of other things that I wasn’t really aware of” Thompson said. “I was taught the basics of being a chemical engineer but didn’t really have that broader perspective about what it might be to be part of the workforce.”

Currently Thompson said that he recognizes that for those who have lived and worked in an academic setting for most of their careers there may not be as much opportunity to bring that real world experience to students. He said that this building will “absolutely” present that opportunity to students.

With the FinTech Innovation Hub Thompson believes it will “bring the workplace into the classroom” allowing students to collaborate and interact with professionals such as those who will work at Discover Bank in the building.

“For students we often talk about bringing the workplace into the classroom; this will actually do some of that” Thompson said. “You’ll actually have an opportunity and obviously for professionalism reasons there will be sort of a wall between Discover Bank and the University of Delaware; but it’s not a hard wall — it’s a soft wall or soft border that you can go across interact.”

Thompson also said that he and others have already started working with Discover Bank and its partners on some research and engagement opportunities that will involve students.

According to Thompson the building was a “substantial investment” because the university recognizes how important something like the FinTech Innovation Hub is for students. In a UDaily article Delaware Technical Park President Mike Bowman said it was a $38 million investment.

In Thompson’s opinion the financing of the FinTech Innovation Hub is one of the most creative financing deals that he has heard of involving several parties including the university and Discover Bank.

“It involves a developer; it involves Discover Bank and some advantages that they can take and working with the University of Delaware obviously [the university] is going to make some contributions financial and otherwise to this and so really a number of organizations have made significant investments bringing the FinTech building to reality” Thompson said.

With proximity to professionals in the financial technology engineering and business fields the FinTech Innovation Hub will be a unique opportunity for students to collaborate residents to explore job opportunities and a boost for the local economy. According to Thompson the collaboration opportunities this building has presented will allow the university to “go far” in this and other endeavors.

“I’m reminded of a saying … ‘If you want to go fast go alone but if you want to go far go with someone’” Thompson said. “So we’re trying to go far. We see collaboration as a way to change the world as we see it. So this FinTech building which will house FinTech activities is going to give us that opportunity.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NjaWVuY2Uvc2Nob29sLXN0dWRlbnRzLWluLWluZGlhLWRpc2NvdmVyLTE4LW5ldy1hc3Rlcm9pZHMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODEyNTcyNTYuY21z0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3Mvc2NpZW5jZS9zY2hvb2wtc3R1ZGVudHMtaW4taW5kaWEtZGlzY292ZXItMTgtbmV3LWFzdGVyb2lkcy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODEyNTcyNTYuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,School students in India discover 18 new asteroids,"

The International Astronomical Union (IAU) an organisation which assigns official names and designations to celestial bodies has recently confirmed the discovery of 18 new asteroids by Indian students as part of a global science programme.The International Asteroid Discovery Project was conducted by STEM and Space an organisation working towards the learning of astronomy and space science in India along with the International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC) as part of a NASA citizen science project.Over the last two years 150 students from all around India participated in this two month long campaign to find asteroids making this the largest asteroid discovery project in India Mila Mitra  Co-founder and Academic Head of STEM and Space said.In the project the students from India and across the globe analysed the high quality astronomical data provided by IASC -- an online scientific program for kids to discover Asteroids and Near Earth Objects ( NEO ).NEOs are rocky objects in an orbit between Mars and Jupiter which pose a challenge to Earth as they may get perturbed out of their orbit and pose a threat of impact.According to Mitra and her team NASA has initiated programs like IASC to track such asteroids regularly also open to citizen scientists and students to enable the discovery and tracking of more asteroids.She explained that in the project the students use advanced software analysis ""spending nearly two-three hours each day"" to look for asteroids and report their findings.Of the 372 preliminary asteroids flagged by the students 18 were finally declared to be ""provisional"" or confirmed discoveries of asteroids Mitra noted.""IAU confirmed these findings last month"" the STEM and Space co-founder added.Mitra believes brings such programs can bring the experiential learning of science technology engineering and medicine or STEM via the domain of space with a gamut of hands-on learning workshops.However she said more efforts need to be taken to extend the reach of such programs to government-run schools and those in rural parts of the country to make the citizen science projects more equitable.Mitra noted that all the discoverers received Provisional Discovery Certificates from IASC and NASA for their scientific contribution in discovering asteroids.",,,,,,

The video starts with a woman getting inches from a teen’s face and screaming homophobic slurs at him. It’s unclear why they are arguing or why the woman is so upset in the first place.

“Are you a queer?” she screams at the boy. “What are you? You like it up the a**hole? Cause you look like you like it up your a**hole.”

The teens start laughing to themselves and try to distance themselves from the woman which only angers her more. The young woman recording the argument Gabby asks if she is OK. But this made things worse and the woman walks up to Gabby and starts yelling at her instead.

After going back and forth Gabby asks the Karen if she is going to go drive her car while so upset and suggests they get the police involved.

“You’re gonna go hurt somebody if you drive your car” Gabby says.

The woman then starts attacking Gabby and says she looks like she “grew up in a trailer park.”

“Are you even dressed?” she asks Gabby.

Gabby or @raysofsunhine on TikTok explains in another video that she walked into the store with her girlfriend and saw the woman yelling at the kids. Gabby recorded the woman and when the woman left the store Gabby asked the teens what happened and if they were OK. The kids told Gabby the woman followed them to the Dollar Tree from another store and was harassing them the whole time.

“This behavior is disgusting and unacceptable” Gabby says in a follow-up video. “It’s not OK.”

Commenters agreed and said they couldn’t believe a grown woman was treating children this way.

“She said YOU look like ur in a trailer park?! Does she own a mirror?” one user commented.

“Why didn’t y’all jump her” another joked.

“If sunburn was a person” someone compared.

Many felt someone needed to put this Karen in her place.

“Attention all grown women – when u see another grown woman bullying young ones like this it’s ok to bully her” one user said.

“Ma’am this is a Dollar Tree” one TikToker concluded.

The Sanders family miraculously escaped their burning home unharmed late Sunday morning after an explosion lifted the house off its foundation and sent the family running for safety.

""We all just bounced"" said Ray Sanders who lived in the wood-frame house at 4840 North Honeytown Road with his wife Jennifer and their two children a 16-year-old son and a 22-year-old daughter.

Sanders said he was relaxing on the main floor when an apparent gas explosion blew the house from its foundation buckling the roof and sending smoke and flames into the air.

He and his son were able to usher everyone out a back door before flames consumed the house. Neighbors then called them over to safety.

""God's good"" Sanders said. ""We're faith-believing people. We really believe we're very protected. It wasn't our time.""

Fire destroys Smithville-area house

Central Fire District received the call around 11 a.m. Firefighters observed ""extremely heavy smoke and fire"" pouring out of the house when they arrived according to Asst. Chief John VanLanen.

Dominion Energy turned off gas to the property while AEP shut off the electricity. Sanders reported he noticed no issues with the gas line prior to Sunday's blast.

The cause of the explosion is still under investigation.

""We've had gas leaks and gas in houses but never one that did this"" VanLanen said.

Throughout Sunday afternoon firefighters continued work on the house from the outside due to the structural integrity being compromised. Fire crews cut through the walls to expose areas where the fire was still burning.

The house is destroyed according to VanLanen.

Sanders said the family lost most of their material items. Firefighters threw a pair of sneakers on the lawn that was still in the box. The shoes appeared untouched by flames. A plastic three-drawer storage unit was also pulled from the house relatively unscathed.

The property is valued at a little over $215000 according to Wayne County Auditor's Office records but a damage estimate was unknown as of Sunday. The Sanders built the home in 2003.

No major injuries were reported to the family or any emergency personnel.

Tanker trucks from Apple Creek Volunteer Fire Department Canaan Township Fire Department East Wayne Fire District Sterling Fire Department and Wooster Township Fire & Rescue supplied more than 30000 gallons of water to the scene.

The Orrville Fire Department and its rapid intervention dispatch team also provided mutual aid. The Wayne County Sheriff's Office and Ohio Highway Patrol maintained traffic through the area.

The American Red Cross provided assistance to the family and Sanders said his family had already started to hear from other members of the community. His son's baseball coach at Smithville High School also reached out to offer whatever he could.

""We live in a great community"" Sanders said.

A GoFundMe for the Sanders family was established for anyone who would like to contribute to the fund's $10000 goal.

Clarissa Hitchcock from Canada who worked for Domino's for around 10 years said the restaurant has the 'best policy ever' when it comes to getting an order wrong.

In a TikTok video she claimed that if you receive the wrong food Domino's will provide the correct dish as well as something extra giving sneaky diners a way to nab free meals.

Her top tip came in response to a prompt from @annaxjames who asked: 'If you have worked for a large corporation like a chain of a restaurant or retail place I want to hear all of the secrets that only employees would know.'

Clarissa Hitchcock (pictured) from Canada who worked as a Domino's manager for around 10 years said the restaurant has the 'best policy ever' when it comes to getting food wrong

To which Clarissa explained: 'Ok so I worked at Domino's as a manager for about a decade and they honestly have the best policy ever if your order is wrong.

'And this works even if your order is not wrong because as part of their policy they're not allowed to ask for the pizza back or for proof or anything like that.

'So here's what's gonna go down: You're gonna call and you're gonna say ""Hey this is wrong with my order"" and they have to do three steps.

'First they have to apologise to you then they have to give you exactly what you want and then they have to give you something extra.'

In a TikTok video Clarissa revealed that if you receive the wrong food Domino's have to give you the correct dish as well as something extra (pictured Domino's pizza)

Clarissa quipped that saying your order is wrong is a great way to get some 'cheesy bread' if you are a bit 'tight on cash' and cannot splash out on the starter as well.

But she was quick to add that although it is a good one-time fix if you complain too many times and Domino's think you are lying then they will put a 'note on file' which could result in getting 'blacklisted'.

Alongside the TikTok video Clarissa captioned: 'yes it is v embarrassing I worked my high school job for a decade but...'

More than 500000 people watched the clip with hundreds commenting to share their own experiences with the policy.

But Clarissa (pictured) was quick to add that if you complain too many times and they think you are lying then Domino's will make a 'note' which may result in getting 'blacklisted'

One person wrote: 'They got my order wrong once and instead of just replacing just the pizza they got wrong they resent my whole order free food.'

While another shared: 'I once got four XL pizzas because of this totally on accident honestly.'

And a third said: 'They've got my order wrong multiple times I wish I knew this.'

Another person claiming to be a former Domino's employee backed-up Clarissa's claims.

They wrote: 'I worked there for three years and can confirm this is true. Especially taking notes on how many times a customer does this'

One customer claimed that they did not receive such service but Clarissa insisted if they contacted the corporate office via an online form they would be given 'free coupons' and potentially store 'credit'.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBtcS5jb20vYXJlLXNhbGVzLWZpbmFsbHktc2xvd2luZy1kb3duLWZvci1kb21pbm9zLWFuZC1wYXBhLWpvaG5zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Sales Finally Slowing Down for Domino's and Papa John's? - PMQ Pizza,"Domino’s same-store sales increased by 11.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to third-quarter growth of 17.5 percent.

Papa John’s sales rose by 12.5 percent in the same quarter but that’s considerably less than the 20-percent increases the chain saw in the second and third quarters.

Same-store sales for two of the country’s top pizza chains slowed a bit in the fourth quarter of 2020 after skyrocketing earlier in the year a sign that competition is stiffening as more non-pizza restaurants enter the food delivery business.

As CNBC reports Domino’s Pizza’s fourth-quarter revenue fell short of Wall Street estimates. The company’s net sales rose by 17.9 percent to $1.36 billion a little less than expectations of $1.39 billion. The chain’s same-store sales increased by 11.2 percent in the October-December period compared to third-quarter growth of 17.5 percent.

For the overall year of 2020 Domino’s U.S. same-store sales were up by 11.5 percent far ahead of the 3.2 percent growth the chain experienced in 2019.

Domino’s CEO Ritch Allison attributed the slower sales to the lack of stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefits which left customers more strapped for cash during the fourth quarter.

“We aren’t sure exactly what the new normal will look like” Allison said in a conference call with analysts according to Crain’s Detroit Business.

Papa John’s actually beat sales expectations in the fourth quarter according to CNBC. Its net sales rose by 12.5 percent to $469.8 million topping projections of $467.9 million. Its U.S. same-store sales went up by 13.5 percent. That’s a solid increase but well below the 20 percent or more increases reported in the second and third quarters of 2020.

Crain’s notes that even fast-food chains have gotten a boost from delivery amping up pressure on fast-food pizza chains like Domino’s and Papa John’s. McDonald’s saw demand for delivery double in the U.S. in 2020 and Taco Bell also experienced higher delivery sales in 2020.

Allison said competition from independent restaurants that didn’t previously offer delivery has also impacted Domino’s sales. “They jumped in with both feet into delivery to stay alive” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9pcmwvZG9taW5vcy1kZWxpdmVyZXItZHJvcHMtcGl6emEtdGlrdG9rLXZpZGVvL9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9pcmwvZG9taW5vcy1kZWxpdmVyZXItZHJvcHMtcGl6emEtdGlrdG9rLXZpZGVvLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘This made me sad’: People feel sorry for Domino’s deliverer caught dropping pizza frantically putting it back,"A viral TikTok video captured the moment a Domino’s delivery driver dropped a whole pizza and then panicked to put it back before unsuspecting customers answered the door.

The video which was posted by @prerry29 and taken on a home security camera has been viewed a whopping 2 million times since being posted on Feb. 24. It shows a Domino’s Pizza employee who appears to be a senior citizen on a customer’s front porch. He accidentally knocks over a pizza box that was resting on a ledge when ringing the doorbell. He frantically picks it back up opens the box and tries to fix the pizza inside with his hands. “He hurried to leave before we opened the door” the TikToker writes and says using the text-to-speech effect.

The clip has divided viewers on TikTok.

While some are grossed out after watching the worker touch the food to seemingly avoid repercussions from his workplace others feel bad for the employee who was clearly in panic mode.

“Poor guy” the top comment on the video reads. “He was in panic mode and tryn not to get fired. At least the pizza stayed in the box.”

One TikToker said that the worker should have just put the box back without opening it to fix the pizza. “I’d rather have messed up pizza than him touching it” they said.

“An I the only one who felt bad for him? He obviously didn’t mean to” another said.

Others noted how the worker was not the first employee to touch the pizza and that customers “don’t order Domino’s for our health.” “You do realize (you’re) ordering from a place with many ppl touching it and making it right?” one user questioned encouraging some commenters to cut the worker who is probably just trying to make a living some slack.

Some are even chastising the customers who made the video public. One noted that while “he was definitely in the wrong for touching the pizza” accidents happen and “not everything has to be posted on social media.”

“It’s an old person! I wouldn’t complain (it’s) just an accident” another said with another commenting that while they wouldn’t eat the pizza they too wouldn’t “have reported him.”

It remains unclear if the customers in this incident reported the employee.

People online have been expressing support for fast-food workers throughout the pandemic considering just how essential they are while being often overworked and underpaid. Two Domino’s employees in Texas recently went viral for appearing exhausted while working through the historic winter storm that left millions of Texans suffering. And another recent TikTok video showed one Domino’s worker’s meltdown after not receiving a tip during a delivery made in the pouring rain. The viral instances have led to calls for higher wages and hazard pay for essential workers across the country.

The Daily Dot has reached out to he poster of the video.

Over on Brooklyn-based freelance prop stylist Randi Brookman Harris’s Instagram feed you’ll find images of artfully arranged beauty products lovingly displayed Legos and wrapped gifts with googly eyes. But dig a little deeper and you’ll unearth the hashtag #RBHSeder where Harris files some of her most personal work to date: her one-of-a-kind Seder plates.

From a green-themed assortment of bowls to 2020’s sparse arrangement every display is a twist on tradition. Here Harris tells us how she conceptualizes each year’s plate and how you can crib her look while making it all your own.

How did you start playing around with the traditional Seder plate?

I grew up in a mostly observant house. My parents kept kosher and we went to synagogue—all of that. When I got married my husband and I didn’t really have our own rituals and were slow at making them together but I eventually realized that I missed it. I love Passover. It’s one of my favorite holidays. When I was little we always had big big Seders with all the cousins. You’d get to stay up late and sneak wine and it was just so much fun.

After my son was born I felt like I wanted to make this a more special thing for him as it had been for me. As a prop stylist I wanted to make the Seder plate really beautiful because it’s the center of the table. But I wanted to make it our own and I wanted to do it in a modern way.

Every year your arrangement looks a little different—why is that?

Every year I take what’s happening in the world what’s happening in our lives and what’s important to us and I make the setup a bit different. For example for the first year I put a lot of different eggs on the plate. I sourced a goose egg a quail egg a green egg a brown one and a white one. That year was about diversity. And I like how spring-y it feels.

[In 2020] our Seder plate was very very sparse because we were all freaking out in pandemic mode. It was April and everything was scary. Grocery time slots were not gettable. It was sad. There were three sprigs of parsley to show sparseness and there was one tiny cup of haroseth. The horseradish was from a jar that had been in my fridge—normally I would have grated my own. There were just three lettuces in that little cloche. There was also an actual chicken wishbone for wishing that the pandemic would go away—that did not come true. The Bermuda glass was my nod to “Anywhere but here.” Gosh I’m choking up because I just remember how sad it was. It was such a scary time. We couldn’t gather and it was so sad. That was my sad Seder plate.

Do you feel as if because of your day job you can’t help but make it look beautiful?

I want to make it beautiful. But that’s also easy because I have all of these little plates and bowls at my disposal. The objects are storytelling for me which makes sense because Passover is a storytelling holiday.

What’s the story behind the all-green one?

That was for spring—it’s all from Mud Australia a great carbon-neutral company. I also just love parsley. I generally eat it like I’m chewing my way through a brush. Everyone at my table eats their one sprig and I go wild because basically I am a goat.

How have you improvised over the years?

Every year the bone changes. And one time I wanted a black bone—I don’t remember why—so I colored a wishbone with a Sharpie.

How can someone make it their own?

I don’t want to be the blasphemous person who says you can do whatever you want but I actually think that you can do whatever you want. It can be any bone. It can be any green. It can be any bitter herb. It can be anything. Remember that these things are symbolic of the Passover story so you can mold them for your own experience in the world.

The Dow Jones enjoys the most encouraging technical outlook in the week ahead

Dow Jones Technical Forecast

Outlook: Neutral

US equities had a rough week as rising Treasury yields pressured investors to consider other alternatives to the Dow Jones Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500. The sudden changes on the fundamental side have spurred key technical divergences across the US indices visible on their respective price charts. The Dow Jones has come out better than its counterparts as it looks to enjoy a confluence of support slightly beneath the Friday close.

Dow Jones Price Chart: Daily Time Frame (January 2020 – February 2021)

To that end the Dow Jones will look to the rising trendline from January 2018 which bounces off the high in February 2020 followed by a nearby Fibbonaci level the 50 day moving average and a rising trend line from March 2020. Together the technical levels should provide considerable support to the industrial average as it looks to avoid a deeper retracement. Should the Dow Jones break beneath the March trendline further losses might be in store as it would constitute a serious technical break.

Nasdaq 100 Technical Forecast

Outlook: Bearish

Elsewhere the Nasdaq 100 has already posted a serious technical break.Falling beneath the rising trendline from the March and November lows the Nasdaq 100 effectively opened the door lower last week and further losses could be in store as a result of this key breakdown. While the fundamental side is currently unfolding the damage has been dealt to the technical landscape and because of that damage there may be ongoing weakness for the tech heavy index.

Nasdaq 100 Price Chart: 4 – Hour Time Frame (September 2020 – February 2021)

After dominating US equity price action for months as tech stocks dragged the other sectors higher the Nasdaq now appears to be in a position of vulnerability and support may be initially derived from the January swing low around 12738. Subsequent assistance might be found along the September high just beneath 12500. In the meantime follow @PeterHanksFX on Twitter for updates and analysis.

S&P 500 Technical Forecast

Outlook: Neutral

Unsurprisingly the S&P 500 has split the difference between the industrial-leaning Dow Jones and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and crucially trades above the March uptrend. Generally viewed as the best barometer of US equities the S&P 500 will be the index to watch in the week ahead as a break beneath the March trendline could signal broader equity weakness is on the horizon.

S&P 500 Price Chart: Daily Time Frame (January 2020 – February 2021)

If on the other hand the S&P 500 can stave off a break lower broader equities might continue to tread water even if the Nasdaq 100 were to slowly bleed lower. Either way the Dow Jones Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 are approaching an inflection point and it looks as though strategies that favor Nasdaq weakness and Dow Jones strength might be well suited for the current climate.

At the Big Board advancers outnumbered decliners by four-to-one. Energy and financials which are popular cyclical plays jumped more than 2.5% each amid optimism on vaccines. Meanwhile high-growth tech shares outperformed as rates stabilized. Apple popped 5.4% and Tesla rose 6.4%.

The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 603.14 points or 2% to 31535.51 boosted by a 5.8% jump in Boeing. The S&P 500 gained 2.4% to 3901.82 as all 11 sectors registered gains posting its best day since June 5. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite  which shed 4.9% last week also popped 3% to 13588.83.

U.S. stocks jumped sharply on Monday in a broad-based rally as stocks tied to the economic reopening jumped on vaccine optimism while tech names rebounded from steep losses last week.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield dipped to a session low of 1.41% Monday before drifting back near the flatline. Yields appeared to be stable at these levels and the 10-year rate was off its high of 1.6% last week which encouraged investors that the rapid rise in rates was at least slowing.

""Investors ask whether the level of rates is becoming a threat to equity valuations. Our answer is an emphatic 'no'"" David Kostin Goldman Sachs' chief U.S. equity strategist said in a note to clients. ""Our bullish US equity view has already embedded expectations of rising interest rates.""

Boosting sentiment on the vaccine front the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel voted unanimously Sunday to recommend the use of Johnson & Johnson 's one-shot Covid-19 vaccine for people 18 years of age and older. The company expects to ship four millions doses initially.

A sudden spike in the benchmark 10-year note rate rattled stocks last week as rising rates can threaten the relative appeal of equities and compress stock valuation by reducing the value of future cash flows. Last week the blue-chip Dow and S&P 500 lost 1.7% and 2.5% respectively. The technology-heavy Nasdaq suffered its worst one-day sell-off since October on Thursday and posted its worst week since then by Friday's close.

""Equity investors are still looking at the rise in rates mostly as 'a good thing' and not yet as a threat notwithstanding some shaking of the tree in high multiple stocks and other parts of the market last week"" said Peter Boockvar chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. ""The benefits of the vaccines vs the challenge of higher rates will be the theme this year.""

On the stimulus front the House passed a $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 early Saturday. The Senate will now consider the legislation.

The major averages rose for the month of February bolstered by a strong earnings season positive news on the vaccine rollout and hopes of another stimulus package.

The Dow gained 3.2% for its third positive month in four in February. The S&P 500 advanced 2.6% and the Nasdaq rose nearly 1% for its fourth positive month in a row.

24/7 Wall Street

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed out a tumultuous 2020 by hitting a record high of over 30600 points. It has since climbed even higher leaving shareholders and analysts wondering how long the market can continue to rise before the next major sell-off.

Though the DJIA comprises only 30 stocks it is often regarded as a gauge of American business and economic prosperity. At the time of this writing the Dow Jones sits at just over 31300 roughly triple its value from a decade ago.

The DJIA is a price-weighted average of 30 large American companies. The index currently contains companies such as the world’s largest retailer Walmart media juggernaut Disney global financial institution J.P. Morgan aerospace and defense giant Boeing and as of 2015 tech behemoth Apple.

The companies comprising the Dow change over time to reflect the changing economy. Since the creator of the index Charles Dow was also the founding editor of The Wall Street Journal editors at the publication select the companies that comprise the index.

Since its inception in 1896 when only 12 companies were included in the average the Dow has changed over 50 times. The last remaining company from the original list of 12 General Electric was finally removed in June 2018. It was replaced with drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance.

NEW ALBANY Ind. (AP) — Duke Energy plans to close a 63-year-old coal-fired power plant in southern Indiana months earlier than had been expected.

The utility’s R. Gallagher power plant which boasts twin smokestacks that have long towered over the Ohio River city of New Albany was scheduled to be retired in 2022. But the company recently announced that the plant will close by June 1.

The Gallagher station went online in 1958 in New Albany. A second unit began generating electricity in 1959 followed by two more units in 1960 and 1961 at the plant located just north of Louisville.

Two units were retired in early 2012 after a federal jury ruled that illegal modifications had been made to two of the units causing violations of the Clean Air Act. Pollution-control equipment was installed in the other two units which burn low-sulfur coal to reduce emissions.

The Gallagher station operated at a limited capacity in recent years and lower power demand during the pandemic has further reduced operations said Duke Energy spokeswoman Angeline Protogere.

Protogere said the closure is not expected to disrupt service in the area noting that the company’s other plants and power resources meet current needs the News and Tribune reported.

Activity at the site could still continue for several years however as the company dismantles the facility and closes on-site coal ash basins.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZHJiLmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL2R1a2UtZW5lcmd5LWNsb3Npbmctc291dGhlcm4taW5kaWFuYS1wb3dlci1wbGFudC1lYXJseS9hcnRpY2xlX2M2ZDBhNWI2LTc5MjMtMTFlYi1hZjRhLTE3MzY1NzM5YmI4My5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Duke Energy closing southern Indiana power plant early,"You have permission to edit this article.

“A post mortem examination of the skeletal remains determined that the cause of death was due to a gunshot wound and the manner of death was ruled a homicide” police said in a news release.

A D.C. family is pleading for answers after a man disappeared more than a week ago. Police say his car was found with blood inside. News4's Shomari Stone reports.

Keith Johnson 44 was last seen the morning of July 13 2020. Police said he disappeared under suspicious circumstances after the car he was last known to be driving was found in the 3700 block of D Street SE four miles away from his home.

Then-Chief of Police Peter Newsham said police had found “a significant amount of blood” inside his car.

More than six months later on Feb. 4 police responded to a report of human skeletal remains in Fort Dupont Park. Police confirmed Friday that the remains were Johnson's.

Shortly after his disappearance Johnson's brother Daniel Johnson said he was frustrated “because I know Keith was very well-liked in the neighborhood… I know someone knows something and they’re not coming forward.”

Loved ones gathered to pray for closure on what would have been Johnson’s 44th birthday on July 21 2020.

His fiancée Letitia Kemp said through tears ""It’s indescribable because we don’t know where he at and this is stuff that he don’t do. He don’t do this. He would have been home by now.”

A suspect description was not provided and no one was detained related to the killing.

Playa Cabana started out on Dupont in the Annex later opening up a Cantina location in the Junction followed by Hacienda back on Dupont as well as Barrio Coreano in Koreatown which is currently temporarily closed.

Their newest space Esquina has opened up near construction-saturated Yonge and Eglinton.

The restaurants are known for a high-end menu of tacos and cocktails served in dimly lit high energy atmospheres.

""We never got to open really for full dining"" owner Dave Sidhu told blogTO. ""It would be comparable at this point to opening a ghost kitchen I imagine.""

Despite not being able to welcome diners in for the full Playa experience at the new location their good reputation and high quality food have kept them afloat.

The area is also saturated with something other than construction: condos.

""So far we have been pleasantly surprised by the volume of orders that we receive and put out for a location that has not yet opened for indoor dining and serving take out only"" Director of Operations Matthew King told blogTO.

""Due to the high density of condos in the area and with a large amount of people still working from home we have even been able to open for lunch takeout as well. We also already have a fair amount of return customers where we are even at the point of knowing who they are just by what they order. Hoping to get to meet them in person some day soon.""

They're also hoping that the construction that's making their new Esquina location more difficult to access right now will prove to be an advantage in the long run.

""There definitely have been various challenges outside of the obvious pandemic related challenges. The construction can at times be a challenge right now for both deliveries of supplies delivery drivers etc. However when it is done and the subway is operational we know this will be a great addition to the neighbourhood"" staff at Esquina told blogTO.

Though their menu is largely the same at Esquina as other Playa Cabana locations it's the only one serving lunch right now with a range of tacos and burritos.

They also serve beer for takeout and their famous Dave's Margaritas available in half litre or litre servings.

""The response has been great considering we opened for solely takeout and in a pandemic. The Yonge and Eglinton area residents and businesses alike have been super welcoming and receptive.

A police plane was spotted in Derby in the early hours of the evening on Saturday.

It remained over Chaddesden and Little Eaton for over two hours before leaving the scene at approximately 9pm.

A radar map shows it circling continuously.

Derby residents took to social media to discuss the plane which circled Little Eaton and Chaddesden.

One man said: ""Wish that plane flying over Chaddesden would leave. Been doing circles for ages.""

""It's doing my head in"" commented another.

""Very weird as to why"" said someone else. ""Went dizzy watching it.""

Several people replied pointing out it was a police plane although residents were left theorising why a National Police Air Service (NPAS) plane was circling the area.

A spokesman from Derbyshire Police revealed that the plane was conducting an ""area search for a possible sighted outstanding offenders. Whereupon standing down they remained in the area as part of their routine patrol"".

The plane was called to the area at 7.20 although police were currently unable to reveal more information as it could compromise an ongoing investigation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlcmJ5dGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvZGVyYnktbmV3cy95b3VuZy1kZXJieS1tYW4tY291cnQtaGF2aW5nLTUwMzAyODDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Young Derby man in court for having BB gun in local park,"Something went wrong please try again later.

If you were to head out with one of these few remaining canisters loaded into your camera what would you shoot?

Jason Kummerfeldt of grainydays scooped up a handful of rolls of Aerochrome a few years ago and wandered the hills of northern California to produce some mind-bending colors and make the most of this unique film stock.

An initial version of Aerochrome was created in the 1940s as part of an attempt to give Air Force pilots an advantage when trying to spot enemies camouflaged among a canopy of trees. The theory was that lacking chloroplast the uniforms of enemy troops would stand out among the vegetation which itself is converted by the film to vibrant pink. In the 1960s Kodak released a consumer version that was in production until its demise in 2010.

There are occasional rumors and petitions to bring the film back into production but if you’re impatient or devoid of optimism like Kummerfeldt Really Nice Images has an infrared film simulation preset for Lightroom and Adobe Camera Raw available for $96.

But in any portfolio there will be mixed results between individual stocks. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in Edison International (NYSE:EIX) since the last five years saw the share price fall 20%. The falls have accelerated recently with the share price down 14% in the last three months. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.

See our latest analysis for Edison International

While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).

Looking back five years both Edison International's share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 8.1% per year. This fall in the EPS is worse than the 4% compound annual share price fall. So investors might expect EPS to bounce back -- or they may have previously foreseen the EPS decline.

The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).

This free interactive report on Edison International's earnings revenue and cash flow is a great place to start if you want to investigate the stock further.

What About Dividends?

As well as measuring the share price return investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Edison International the TSR over the last 5 years was -4.7% which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!

A Different Perspective

Edison International shareholders are down 16% for the year (even including dividends) but the market itself is up 42%. However keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably last year's performance caps off a bad run with the shareholders facing a total loss of 0.9% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"" but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted 4 warning signs for Edison International you should be aware of and 1 of them shouldn't be ignored.

Mmmmaven closed in part because of a torrent of new technology seemed to make its mission all but impossible a managing director said at the time but the team members behind Subcentral say they have built a defining studio learning experience including a fully equipped DJ booth experience with specialized digital music players known as CDJs; a professional-grade mixer; and a studio with digital audio workstations synths modules and analogs that provide students with what they deem an industry-standard learning platform.

The team includes Jose Zamora known as Xoce a Mexico-born French artist who cofounded the U.S. Infra collective – a mainstay of the underground music scene at Central Square clubs such as The Lower Level and Phoenix Landing – and a former instructor at Mmmmaven; Victor Ribeiro a Brazil-born techno artist DJ and social media manager; and Don Derrick Haddad known as 9D3 an experimental music researcher inventor and doctoral student at the MIT Media Lab. (And an occasional promoter of dance parties at the institute’s List Visual Arts Center.)

All are evangelists for a scene that didn’t just support Mmmmaven for seven years but also its annual festival Together Boston and has generated masters of the medium including Eli Goldstein and Charles Levine of Soul Clap. The Subcentral team said they were prepared not just to teach but to provide opportunities for students to connect with industry professionals virtually and network within the scene. “Subcentral is not trying to become a part of the community – we are members of the community coming together to support the community” Ribeiro said. “These courses are not just a way to learn how to DJ and work in the studio but also an opportunity to support this community’s creative growth.”

“I truly believe in the potential of the Boston underground music scene. Subcentral is here to push the artistic limits of our community to new levels” Zamora said.

Diego Torres a press liaison for Subcentral expanded Friday on why Cambridge felt like the obvious place to set up its turntables and digital gear.

“It just seems to be an area that produces significant artistic and cultural output. And I believe that draws in people who are interested in the music that we create and the art that we create. This has become a beacon for those artists” Torres said. “That’s truly what Subcentral is trying to be – a gathering spot for artists in the electronic music scene as well as for people who are interested in production and visual artistry.”

The Subcentral website will host course descriptions and information about community-building events as they come along Torres said. There’s in-person class space set up at 645 Massachusetts Ave. Central Square for people ready for lessons in DJing – including a survey of the subculture sounds and history as well as the technical aspects; music production; and creating video and projections. The class and community space is set up to follow Covid-19 protocols the team said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZWRtLmNvbS9nZWFyLXRlY2gvZGFmdC1wdW5rLWFydGlmaWNpYWwtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLW11c2ljLXZpZGVv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Digital Artist Creates Daft Punk Music Video by Programming His Own Artificial Intelligence,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://edm.com/gear-tech/daft-punk-artificial-intelligence-music-video on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZWRtLmNvbS9nZWFyLXRlY2gvZGFmdC1wdW5rLWFydGlmaWNpYWwtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLW11c2ljLXZpZGVv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2RyYWdvbi1hZ2UtNC1kcm9wcGluZy1saXZlLXNlcnZpY2UtZWxlbWVudHMtZG91YmxlLWVkZ2VkLXN3b3JkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dragon Age 4 Dropping Live Service Elements is a Double-Edged Sword,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2RyYWdvbi1hZ2UtNC1kcm9wcGluZy1saXZlLXNlcnZpY2UtZWxlbWVudHMtZG91YmxlLWVkZ2VkLXN3b3JkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

Lana Condor is not letting a virtual show stop her from getting all glammed up.

For the 2021 Golden Globe Awards Lana wore a gorgeous blue floral Monique Lhuillier gown that she showed off on Instagram. If we didn't know any better we would have thought this was a look from the To All the Boys series that her character Lara Jean wore before.

Some fans might be shocked to see her rocking her black hair again after she posted a pic recently with some pastel pink hair. However it looks like it might have just been a wig that she decided to wear for a new look that day.

She finished off her look with subtle half up half down hair style some winged eyeliner and a light pink lip shade with some shiny lipgloss on top.

And if you weren't obsessed enough Lana showed off her manicure earlier as a hint of her dress and it is pretty iconic. She kept things subtle with a glitter mani but you better take a closer look or else you might miss the shiny silver metallic moon and stars on the tips that help tie it all together.

Even her To All the Boys co-star Janel Parrish couldn't get enough of it as she commented ""a princess woah.""

While we won't be seeing her on stage accepting or introducing an award tonight we're still glad that she was able to stun us with another incredible look. We're definitely going to be dreaming of this one for a long time.

For her appearance at the 2021 Golden Globe Awards the 54-year-old Academy Award-winner turned heads in a sleek black tuxedo that people think may be a nod to one of her “Big Little Lies” co-stars.

To present at Sunday night’s awards show Dern paired a menswear-inspired Givenchy suit with a fitted bustier that featured a bold choker neckline along with a pair of edgy spiked heels.

For those thinking the outfit looks familiar back in 1993 Nicole Kidman attended the Golden Globe Awards alongside then-husband Tom Cruise where she rocked a similar black pantsuit with a wide choker and a beret.

Whether the outfit inspiration was intentional or not fans on Twitter were quick to praise the 54-year-old’s red carpet style as well as her poise while handling an uncomfortable on-screen technical difficulty.

""Laura Dern looks stunning on the Golden Globes red carpet"" shared one Twitter user while another called her take on classic suiting ""flawless.""

THE WOODLANDS Texas — An 11-year-old boy who died during the winter storm was remembered Saturday during a memorial service in The Woodlands.

Family friends and teachers gathered at The Woodlands Church to honor the life of Christian Pineda the Conroe boy who passed away Feb. 16 after spending the night in his frigid mobile home that lost power.

Christian's assistant principal at Bozman Intermediate School spoke during Saturday’s ceremony.

“From the moment he walked into our campus his smile was bright his demeanor was sweet and his eagerness to learn was vibrate. There was never a moment that we did not see him smiling or engaged in a teacher's classroom. Everyone who knew him loved him he always brought great joy to those around him.”

Christian’s official cause of death has not yet been determined but his parents believe he died of hypothermia.

They have filed a $100 million lawsuit against ERCOT and Entergy.

Texas families who lost loved ones during winter storm

Dozens of Texas families who say they lost loved ones because of the massive power failure are now blaming their utility companies.

Texas lawmakers are holding hearings and demanding changes in the energy industry but Houston attorney Tony Buzbee is demanding justice.

The family of Christian says their son died in his sleep because of the cold after they lost power in Montgomery County.

The wife of Vietnam veteran Tony Anderson of Crosby says they lost power and her husband died while trying to connect to a portable oxygen machine in his pickup.

Both families are suing their energy provider. Both are being represented by Buzbee.

“I think what irks people the most what creates outrage among people I represent is we were not told the truth the city wasn't told the truth we were told there were rolling blackouts and we know that was not the case now"" Buzbee said in an interview with KHOU 11 News Anchor Len Cannon.

For so many rolling blackouts turned into days without power yet Buzbee and many people noticed plenty of power elsewhere.

“The downtown business district was lit up like Vegas and 5 miles away people are dying in Third Ward from hypothermia"" Buzbee said.

""Tony let me play devil’s advocate power providers say it was suggested they winterize they were not required to…you follow me?” Cannon asked.

“Of course let me say this they take your money if you fail to pay them they will track you down and cut off your power so when this happens they have a responsibility just because we have a deregulated industry in Texas does not relieve them of their obligation to act reasonably"" Buzbee explained.

He calls it multiple layers of failure.",,,,,,,,,,,,

News,"Experian is the biggest credit reference agency (CRA) in the UK providing data used to decide whether you get a mortgage credit card or loan. But it also has a second less well understood role.

As well as creating credit reports Experian is one of the UK's largest data brokers. Data brokers are companies that buy combine enrich and ultimately sell data typically for marketing purposes.

That data helps advertisers make guesses about everything from your wealth to whether you own a pet.

It was because of this data-broking role that the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) recently investigated Experian alongside two other CRAs Equifax and TransUnion. The ICO ultimately ruled that all three were processing data about millions of people without their consent.

Read on to find out what data Experian was sharing where it gets that data from and how you can take back control of your data.

Why should you care about your data?

Data has become one of the world's most valuable commodities as evidenced by near-trillion-dollar valuations of Google and Facebook.

Meanwhile the loss of data from emails to bank details has enriched criminals.

Since 2018 you've had the right to be informed about the collection and use of your data - and to correct mistakes or object to its use entirely.

In October last year the ICO published the results of its two-year investigation into the three CRAs including Experian.

It found all three had been conducting 'invisible' processing meaning they were collecting and using millions of people's personal data without their consent for the purposes of postal and phone marketing.

Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said: 'The information the CRAs are privileged to hold for statutory credit reference purposes was unlawfully used by them in their capacity as data brokers with poor regard for what people might want or expect.'

While Equifax and TransUnion made a number of changes as a result including scrapping some of the data services they offer altogether Experian has only partly complied and is appealing against the ICO's decision risking a huge fine.

What does Experian know?

To find out exactly what data was being shared we asked 12 Which? members to make subject access requests (SAR) to Experian and Equifax.

Each file they received from Experian had 31 pages containing personal data and profiling information compared with just two from Equifax. Experian therefore became the focus of our investigation.

The largest section of Experian's report was called 'propensities' containing a whopping 373 different characteristics for each of our volunteers across 14 pages.

They vary widely: from your level of education to the type of car you drive; from how much you donate to charity to how likely you are to go to the opera in your spare time.

Every attribute has a specific score against it which is essentially an estimate of how likely it is to apply to each person. Experian will use different combinations of facts that it knows about you to make these estimates as accurate as possible and produce these scores.

The scores don't mean much individually but if a business has scores for several million customers it means it can rank them and start to identify the ones most likely to have certain characteristics.

For example a travel agent promoting its most luxurious holidays might use the scores to target the most affluent 10% of customers with its marketing.

'Shocked and surprised'

A survey of 1126 Which? members in November found that 89% of our members had heard of Experian and as many as 51% said they were aware Experian has a role sharing marketing data.

But few realised just how extensive Experian's data was.

When one of our members Ade A. received his marketing file from Experian he said he didn't know exactly how the scores were applied but he was 'shocked and surprised' by the number and range of them.

Another member said he was also 'surprised' to see certain online transactions in his report but was less shocked by the rest of the report as he felt that companies having your data is a part of modern life.

The reports also contained estimates on various household attributes such as the level of affluence and income the number of children and the number of bedrooms.

Although this data is modelled volunteers said it was largely correct - especially on facts such as children and bedrooms.

Ade said that the data on income made him feel 'uncomfortable' while the accuracy of information on the number of bedrooms and children 'feels intrusive'.

Does Experian need your consent?

The answer is complicated. In the case of an IP address we saw it sharing as a result of the SARs Experian does have consent and included the source (getyaoffers.co.uk) and supplier (Data Mixx) to prove it.

However according to the ICO Experian doesn't have consent for some of the data in the files that we saw.

In its investigation the ICO criticised CRAs for using credit data to remove customers with particularly poor credit histories who wouldn't be eligible for certain financial products from lists provided to advertisers so that they don't market to them.

When we made our SARs in November Experian was still doing this.

Even if as Experian argues this may be to the benefit of consumers - as it could avoid promoting products that are 'inappropriate to the circumstances of the individual' involved - the CRAs did not have consent from the people involved to use their data in this way so it was and still is unlawful.

Not all data processing needs consent though as organisations can lawfully argue that processing your data is in their 'legitimate interest'.

The legitimate interest must be clearly defined the processing must be necessary to meet this interest and the company must balance its own interests against the interests rights and freedoms of the individual.

Experian told us that 'the proper protection of individual privacy is of paramount importance to us'.

It said it did not track users' internet activity behaviour or location adding that 'we collect very little actual information about an individual and most of the information an individual would see on their marketing file report is based on modelled data created by us and is not a statement of fact'.

Where does Experian get your data?

Does Experian track you online?

The ICO's investigation of CRAs related to their use of data for postal and phone marketing. A separate wider ICO investigation into online advertising is ongoing.

While the SARs didn't reveal the full extent of the online information Experian has access to they did reveal several ways in which it uses digital data.

One way is through a product it calls Club Canvasse which is essentially a data 'pool' through which select home shopping retailers can share anonymised insights about purchases their customers are making.

All the retailers we saw named as part of this 'club' mention - in one form or another - sharing your data for profiling or pooling purposes in the privacy policies on their website (these are legally required). Some even mention Experian by name. However we found no mention of data sharing when you make a purchase.

Another product involving digital data that we saw Experian offer was matching your IP address - essentially an online ID that is specific to your household - to your home address.

This could prove to be critical for an advertiser enabling them to combine all the offline profiling that Experian has about your address - like the household attributes and propensities mentioned above - with any data they have about your online activity attached to your IP addresspainting an incredibly rich picture about you in the process.

How to opt out

You don't need to live off the grid or go without a credit report to take back control of your data. You have the right to ask organisations to delete data about you.

Experian Equifax and TransUnion marketing data

While credit reporting data is exempt information collected for marketing purposes is not. Experian makes it relatively easy to opt out of this processing on its website. You can also see the marketing segment your postcode falls in as well as if you're on its 'marketing services' file. Equifax which now holds far less data advises opting out of the open register while TransUnion asks you to email it.

Open electoral register

As there are many data brokers it may be easier to opt out of some of their sources of data. For example the open electoral register provides a key source of names and addresses for mail marketing. You can go to gov.uk to ensure you are only on the full private register.

Mailing preference service

You can also opt out of most mail marketing via the Mailing Preference Service (MPS) which is run by the Data & Marketing Association (DMA). Lots of data users like Experian will be members of the DMA meaning they have to screen out addresses on the MPS.

Competition comparison and offers websites

If you are concerned about data privacy you should exercise particular caution on competition offers or comparison websites. These are common sources of information for data brokers so pay close attention to their terms and conditions if you don't want your data to be traded.

And following a $2.2 billion dollar deal this week some are wondering if the start-up will maintain its unique reputation.

Founded in Toronto in 2013 Deciem Beauty Group Inc. advertises itself as atypical even if its popular skincare brand is called The Ordinary. Unlike most big skincare brands it sells formulations with just a few ingredients at unusually low prices.

It has a strong following including celebrities such as Kim Kardashian with net sales for the 12 months ended Jan. 31 of about $460 million US. But some of that fan base is concerned after learning that cosmetic giant Estée Lauder Cos. Inc. bought Deciem.

Can an ""industry disruptor"" as Estée Lauder calls Deciem keep prices down and connect with consumers after it's absorbed by a U.S. conglomerate?

The New York-based multinational manufacturer of skincare makeup fragrance and hair care products will increase its stake in Deciem to 76 per cent from 29 per cent then buy the remaining interests after three years.

Deciem had gained a following as an alternative to big beauty. Its products come in plain white packaging with scientific sounding names and price tags that are a fraction of some of its rivals'. For example Estée Lauder's Resilience Multi-effect moisturizer costs $124 Cdn for a 50-millilitre jar; The Ordinary's moisturizer is just $7.70 for 100 ml.

WATCH | Fans of Canadian beauty brand concerned by Estée Lauder takeover:



Fans of Canadian beauty brand concerned by Estée Lauder takeover Duration 2:07 Fans of affordable skin care around the world wonder what will happen to their favourite low-priced brand now that the Canadian maker of The Ordinary has been scooped up by American beauty giant Estée Lauder.

Sale raises concerns among consumers

Some people took to social media with their concerns after the sale afraid the new owner might tamper with the brand. There was talk of hoarding the products before the formula or price changes.

Nneka Elliott a beauty writer who sometimes contributes to CBC Life said Deciem offers ""unheard of"" prices for certain products. She assumes Estée Lauder is looking for a foothold in the millennial and Gen Z markets.

""It certainly was a little bit of a head-scratcher for me ... They're so on opposite ends of the scale these two brands so I was wondering what the impact was going to be once they completely roll out.""

She pointed to a popular independent brand similar to Deciem's called Paula's Choice that she says changed radically after it was sold to a private equity firm.

""We saw the prices just skyrocket. And then we saw a whole bunch of new products just a wider range of products. And when that kind of happens it gets a little bit confusing. And so people keep citing: 'Oh I hope this is not another Paula's Choice.'""

Deciem’s products have a reputation of being affordable. (Doug Husby/CBC)

Deciem's co-founder and CEO Nicola Kilner said fans and employees have nothing to worry about. Accessible pricing is important to the new owners who intend to keep the headquarters lab and jobs in Canada.

She said Estée Lauder can learn from Deciem's transparent approach to communication with customers while Deciem can take advantage of Estée Lauder's distribution.

The growth trajectory as a result of the partnership means Deciem which is largely situated in the U.S. the U.K. and Canada will be looking at ""hyper expansion"" in staffing in its newer markets including India the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia.

Kilner said she thinks Estée Lauder appreciated Deciem's creativity and vision.

""So they very much want to retain the independence which I think is music to our ears.""

Big companies only buy small ones for control expert says

Business strategist Mark Satov of Satov Consultants in Toronto isn't buying that.

""All this talk about: 'No we're selling out but it's going to be [remaining] independent and they're not going to control us and the big corporate giant is not going to tell us what to do' — it's all very cute to say but it's not true.""

Big companies only buy smaller ones in order to control them but it doesn't necessarily mean there will be changes he said.

If Estée Lauder has ""a portfolio of brands they want one brand like this and one brand like that ... so they can cater to a wide range of consumers depending on what they want. And ... I guess that there's no reason to raise the prices especially if they don't have other brands that are in that price level.""

Estee Lauder products are displayed at a department store in South Portland Maine. The company may want to keep its Deciem products at a low price point one expert says. (Pat Wellenbach/The Associated Press)

He compares the cosmetics industry to the beer industry: it doesn't matter what's in the bottles so much as what it says about the person who's buying it. With that in mind it may have been a good time for Deciem to sell.

""The cosmetics industry is not based on differences in quality; it's all based on brand cachet. And so to some degree brands cannot be new and edgy and fun for 20 years. And so you launch new brands and they mature and then you put them in a certain slot.

""It's actually a very good thing to sell to a larger house of brands because you're not going to be cool and edgy for 20 years.""

He said people may be concerned about smaller Canadian companies being swallowed by larger U.S. ones but there's little they can do about it.



""What governments need to do is fund innovation in this country so that we develop great products that are successful enough and make sure that there's a community an investment community in this country that wants to buy it and retain it.... If we didn't allow Canadian companies to be sold to American companies what would happen is [the Canadian companies] wouldn't get capital at the venture stage.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcHBpLmNvbS9jb250ZW50cy92aWV3X3BvZGNhc3RzLzIwMjEtMDMtMDEvdGhlLWhhcHBpLXBvZGNhc3Qtd2l0aC1iZWF1dHktZXhwZXJ0LXZpbmNlLXNwaW5uYXRvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Happi Podcast: Beauty Expert Vince Spinnato,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.happi.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /contents/view_podcasts/2021-03-01/the-happi-podcast-with-beauty-expert-vince-spinnato/ (Caused by SSLError(SSLError(1, '[SSL: UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION_DISABLED] unsafe legacy renegotiation disabled (_ssl.c:1006)'))) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcHBpLmNvbS9jb250ZW50cy92aWV3X3BvZGNhc3RzLzIwMjEtMDMtMDEvdGhlLWhhcHBpLXBvZGNhc3Qtd2l0aC1iZWF1dHktZXhwZXJ0LXZpbmNlLXNwaW5uYXRvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

Go to Applications folder select Utilities  open the System Information app then select Window > Storage Management .

folder select  open the app then select > . To see how much free space you have right-click your hard drive in the Finder Window and then select Get Info.

This article explains how to clear space on a Mac. Instructions apply broadly to all Mac computers.

Backup Before You Delete Files

The first step is to have a current backup of your Mac's data. This is a precaution to ensure you can return your Mac to the state it was in before you began this process. There is nothing more disheartening than to remove files improve your Mac's performance and then discover that the work report you need to turn in at the end of the week is gone a victim of enthusiastic cleanup.

If you don’t have a backup method in place consider using Time Machine a backup app that comes with your Mac or a cloning app such as Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper.

Cleaning Up Your Mac's Storage

Start the cleanup process with the easiest methods first and move on to ones that may be more difficult to perform.

Empty the Trash - The Mac's trash is actually a folder used to temporarily store files you have deleted. All those files you have moved to the trash haven’t been erased they are still taking up space on your drive. The idea is that if you made a mistake and need a file you trashed you can easily retrieve it.

The disadvantage is that it is easy to forget to manually empty the trash resulting in a large number of files taking up space. Emptying the trash will permanently remove all files within the Mac's trash. If you would like to check what is in the trash first move your cursor to the trash icon in the Mac's Dock right-click and select Open from the popup menu.

If there are any files you need you can drag them out of the trash or right click on a file in the trash and select Put Back from the popup menu to move the file back where it came from.

Once you have the trash containing only unwanted items right-click on the trash icon in the Dock and select Empty Trash from the popup menu.

Automate Emptying the Trash

Finally a computer can take out the trash for you.

If you would rather not have to do the two-step trash dance you can configure your Mac to auto-empty the trash after 30-days.

Open a Finder window or click on the desktop to ensure the Finder is the active app. Select Preferences from the Finder menu. Click the Advanced icon in the Finder Preference window then place a checkmark next to the item labeled Remove items from the Trash after 30 days. You can close the Finder preferences window. From now on each item you place in the trash will be removed for you after a 30-day period has elapsed.

App Trash - Many Mac apps such as Mail Photos iPhotos have their own trash that is independent of the Mac's trashcan. When you delete an email in Mail or an image in Photos the item is moved to the apps internal trash. Just like the Mac's trash it isn't gone until you delete the trashes content.

The various apps trashcan allow you to recover an item you deleted should you change your mind. When you manually delete the trash in these apps you permanently remove the item. To delete the trash open each app and locate the trash icon in the app's sidebar. Clicking on the trash icon will display the current content of the trash letting you drag an item out of the trash you wish to keep. Once you determine that you want to permanently remove the trash follow these instructions:

iPhoto: Right-click the trash icon and select Empty Trash from the popup menu.

Photos: Select the Recently Deleted item in the Photos sidebar (looks like a trashcan) then click the Delete All button in the preview pane.

Images you though you removed from the Photos app may still be present in the Recently Deleted folder.

Mail: Right-click the Trash icon in Mail's sidebar and select Erase Deleted Items from the popup menu.

Mail: Right-click the Junk icon in Mail's sidebar and select Erase Junk Mail from the popup menu.

Uninstall Applications

If you have any apps you no longer use and don’t think you will use again you should consider uninstalling them to free up space. The Mac makes uninstalling apps somewhat simple just make sure the app you are removing is not currently running and then drag the app from the /Applications folder to the trash (Don’t forget to empty the trash when you're done).

Before you permanently remove an app a few things to consider:

If you purchased the app from the Mac App Store you can always reinstall the app. Just launch the Mac App Store app  select the Purchase tab. Locate the app in the purchase list and click the Install button.

the  select the tab. Locate the app in the purchase list and click the button. If you purchased the app from a third-party make sure you have the app's license before you delete it. In many cases a license key will be needed if you decide to reinstall it later.

If you delete an app you may not be able to reinstall the same version at a later date.

Remove Cache and Temporary Files

Your Mac keeps a large number of cache and temporary files that are hidden away from you. These files help the Mac system and specific apps perform their job. Cache files are used to store information that is often used by the system or specific apps. It is quicker to access this information from a cache file than to have an app have to recalculate the information every time it is needed. Cache files usually stay a manageable size but occasionally they can grow in size over time

Temporary files are as the name suggests just a temporary way for an app to store information. Generally the temporary files are removed when the app that creates then is closed or when your Mac shuts down.

Your Mac usually does a good job of managing the cache and temporary files but once in a while a cache or temporary file can grow to an unwieldy size. Manually removing these files can be done but using third-party apps such as Tinkertool Onyx or Cocktail makes the process much easier. By the way most of these apps have an option to remove system user internet and Application caches. It's a good idea to not remove the system caches.

Mail Attachments

If you have ever received an email that included an attachment such as a PDF image or Word doc chances are the file is still being stored on your Mac. For some of you this may represent a few megabytes of storage space but for others who routinely exchange large images audio or video files this can quickly account for a gigabyte or two of space.

Deleting the Mail attachments can be a time-consuming process if you try to remove them from within the Mail app. An easier way is to use Spotlight the Mac's search system and display the folder that contains the attachments directly in the Finder. This way you can go through the attachments fairly quickly and trash the ones you wish to delete.

Open Spotlight by clicking on its icon in the Mac menu bar. Enter ""mail downloads"" without the quote marks in the Spotlight search field. Spotlight will build a list of matches. Give Spotlight a little bit of time then look for matches in the Folder category. Double-click the mail downloads match in the folder category and the folder will open in a Finder window. You will likely find individual files within the folder as well as folders with names containing a long string of numbers and letters. You should check inside each folder for attachments as well as any individual files. Because the attachments are likely to be known file types you can use Quick Look to see the content of the file without opening it in an application. To Quick Look an item select the item and click the space bar. The item should be displayed in the Quick Look preview window. To close the Quick Look preview click the space bar again. Drag any attachment you do not wish to keep to the trash. Don’t forget to empty the trash once you are done.

System Tools Can Help

In recent versions of macOS there's a screen inside the System Information app called Storage Management that aims to help you keep on top of your Mac's storage. You can find the app inside the Applications folder > Utilities > System Information. Once you open the app go to (in the menu bar) Window > Storage Management. From there you can get a nice bird's eye view of what is taking up space (you can also empty the trash from here too).

How Much Space Is Free?

You can discover how much free space is currently available by right-clicking on a volume (that is the hard drive) either on the Desktop or in a Finder window sidebar and selecting the Get Info item from the popup menu.

The Get Info window will appear in the top left-hand corner of the display. It sometimes is covered up by other open windows so if you don’t see it move a few windows around.

Under the General heading you will see three entries of interest:

Capacity: The total space available on the selected volume.

Available: The free space currently on the selected volume.

Used: The amount of space currently in use.

The available value should be a minimum of 15% of the capacity value. More is better. The Finder makes it easy to keep track of the free space available. Open a new Finder window go to the View menu and select Show Status Bar. At the bottom of every Finder window you'll see how many items are in the window you are looking at and how much free space is available to you on the entire drive.

Why Clean Your Mac and How Much Space Do You Need?

Cleaning up space on your Mac is generally considered a good thing. Your Mac will run better with more free space on its drive and you (as well as the system and various apps) can utilize the extra space as needed.

One question you're likely to ask is just How Much Free Space Do I Need on my Mac? The answer varies depending on how you use your Mac but for general use when your free space drops below 15% you're likely to start experiencing a few minor performance issues. Let the amount of free space drop even further and you can expect to see those annoying beach balls that tell you your Mac is busy doing something. By the way those spinning beach balls are often referred to as SPOD.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vb25taWx3YXVrZWUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2FkYW1tLXZlaGljbGUtZml0dGluZy1pbi1nYXJhZ2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will that new vehicle fit in your garage?,"This content is presented in partnership with ADAMM.

One thing you do not want to do is spend hours researching a vehicle on the internet find The One buy it and then drive it home to discover that it doesn’t fit into your garage.

Yes that is a thing. And if there is anything we’ve learned from our cold winter it’s that storing your car in a garage has its benefits.

Misjudging whether a car will fit in the garage doesn’t just happen to people who trade in an old car for a different model that’s bigger taller roomier and has more cargo space. It also happens to people who trade in a years-old version of a model they love for a newer one only find out that the latter is taller wider and longer than its predecessor.

MotorBiscuit.com contributor Matthew Skwarczek says garages aren’t getting smaller – vehicles are getting bigger. A couple cases in point: The length of GM’s largest three-row SUV the 2021 Chevrolet Suburban is 226 inches – up two inches from the previous model and seven inches from the one before that. Its slightly smaller brother the Tahoe measures 211 inches making it seven inches longer than the 2020 version.

That’s good news if you’re looking for room inside your vehicle. According to Chevrolet the new Tahoe has a whopping 66 percent more cargo space behind the third row and 10 more inches of legroom for third-row passengers. Suburban’s extra length and some interior design reconfigurations create a 19 percent increase in maximum cargo space.

But will these vehicles fit into your garage?

Many customers do their research before visiting the dealership and often will measure their garage and compare its dimensions with vehicle details listed on the manufacturer’s website. They also are aware when a model gets bigger as the result of a redesign.

Skwarczek says that most automakers have trended toward making many models bigger. Toyota for example added three inches to the length of the Siena for 2021 but also has reduced the minivan’s height by half an inch.

“It’s good to know the size of your garage” says Alex Neuburg sales rep for Wilde Toyota in West Allis. “If you do know that but not the dimensions of any specific model we can easily look it up in a few seconds at the dealership.”

Skwarczek also notes that a model’s height width and length can vary from one trim level to another. Pickups are an obvious example given the huge differences between traditional crew and quad cabs and bed lengths.

There are other considerations to keep in mind though. Skwarczek says the average garage is 20 to 28 feet deep. “Based on this it would appear that even a new Suburban could comfortably fit in most garages” he says. “But will it leave enough room for you to move around or use the garage for storage?”

Because a garage’s size is typically derived from its outside parameters he recommends measuring the inside space which takes into account the thickness of walls and intrusions like steps and built-in or free-standing shelves.

Skwarczek also notes that newer garages tend to be larger than older ones.

Furthermore if there are any pillars make sure the spaces between them and the garage walls and doors are long and wide enough to fit a certain type of vehicle.

And don’t forget to measure the height of the garage’s ceiling and overhead storage spaces and to check how much room there is under the garage door when it’s open.

“Go to your garage with a tape measure and see if the vehicle will actually fit with the door opened and closed” Skwarczek says. “Next lay tape on the ground corresponding to the SUV’s dimensions and walk around it. Can you comfortably move around? Can you still store ladders tools or other things in it?”

If you’re going to want to load and unload the rear cargo area or trunk inside you should also know how far back from the end of the vehicle the lift gate extends as it goes up and down and how high above the top of the vehicle it goes when fully open.

This final consideration is one that many car companies took seriously years ago by making lift gate height adjustable. For example Toyota offers a lift gate that can open to whatever height you want plus several pre-programed settings. Chevrolet is one of several manufacturers that allow owners to choose to open a lift gate to its full extent or limit it to three-fourths open.

If however you can’t seem to find a vehicle you want or need that fits into where you’ll have to park it ask the sales rep for suggestions. Most automakers offer alternatives to meet a variety of needs. And many will allow customers to take the car home on a test drive and pull it into the garage just to make sure it fits.

“If someone wants a Tahoe but it’s too long” one sales rep says “they should consider getting a Traverse. It still has the three rows and plenty of cargo capacity for most people.”

One more thing: If you’ve hung a tennis ball from the rafters to let you know where to stop your current car when pulling in to your garage check to see if it has to be moved before parking your new one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9nYW1lcy9zb255LXJlcG9ydGVkbHktd29ya2luZy1vbi1wczUtc3RvcmFnZS1leHBhbnNpb24tYnktc3VtbWVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sony Reportedly Working On PS5 Storage Expansion By Summer,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://bleedingcool.com/games/sony-reportedly-working-on-ps5-storage-expansion-by-summer/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9nYW1lcy9zb255LXJlcG9ydGVkbHktd29ya2luZy1vbi1wczUtc3RvcmFnZS1leHBhbnNpb24tYnktc3VtbWVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oZXJhbGR0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9idXNpbmVzcy9yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS8yMDIxLzAyLzI4L21vZGVybi1jcmFmdHNtYW4tYXJsaW5ndG9uLXBhcmstc2FyYXNvdGEtbWFya2V0LTkxMy0wMDAvNDU1OTE3MjAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Modern Craftsman in Arlington Park Sarasota on market for $913000,"No commitment required.

The opposition A Partnership for National Unity+Alliance For Change (APNU+AFC) on Friday pledged critical political support to confront ExxonMobil on key issues facing the oil and gas sector.

Contributing to the 2021 National Budget debate APNU+AFC frontbencher David Patterson publicly pledged political support to the governing People’s Progressive Party Civic in get the best from the burgeoning sector.

“We are willing to offer our support in presenting a united position so that jointly we can address the alleged inadequacies of the contract and any other documents including the environmental permit” he said.

The Guyana government since coming to office in August has said that a new model Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) would be drafted similar to efforts that the coalition had been taking.

Mr. Patterson reasoned that once there was political unity it would be harder for the those international partners to ignore Guyana’s concerns. “Moving forward this issue is squarely in the hands of the government. The time for grandstanding and blame is over. The time to act in the best interest of the citizens is now” said Mr. Patterson who is General Secretary of the AFC.

That American supermajor is the only company that is discovering and producing oil from the prolific Stabroek Block offshore Guyana.

Mr. Patterson said while the coalition had been in office the PPPC had never supported the coalition on anything except the border claims a situation he said has created problems for Guyana dealing with some of the problems that the sector was now facing. “The lack of a unified front has allowed various parties to exploit the differences which is not to the benefit of the country and its citizens” he said.

However he recalled that the David Granger-led administration had given ExxonMobil free reign to exclusively brief the then opposition PPPC in “every discovery and development.” In contrast Mr. Patterson said the Irfaan Ali-led administration has not been involving the opposition coalition and has allegedly asked that no information be shared. “This is in stark contrast to our handling of the sector and does not reflect the claim of inclusivity that the government has been speaking about” he said.

Back in the 1970s the then PPP had offered critical support to the leftist Forbes Burnham-led People’s National Congress (PNC) in the nationalisation of the then privately-owned sugar industry when both parties had unabashedly embraced socialism.

At the turn of the 1990s after Burnham died in 1985 the PNC under the Desmond Hoyte presidency had transformed itself to being market-oriented and the PPP on coming to office in 1992 continued those IMF/World Bank-inspired economic policies. The PPP has been sparing no effort in committing itself to private sector-led growth and has been scoffing at APNU+AFC criticisms that its national budgets are pro-business sector.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1bGYtdGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5LzY4NTY4Ni9leHhvbm1vYmlsLXFhdGFyLWFubm91bmNlcy1yZXRpcmVtZW50LW9mLWVtcnEtcmVzZWFyY2gtZGlyZWN0b3LSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5ndWxmLXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS82ODU2ODYvZXh4b25tb2JpbC1xYXRhci1hbm5vdW5jZXMtcmV0aXJlbWVudC1vZi1lbXJxLXJlc2VhcmNoLWRpcmVjdG9yL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ExxonMobil Qatar announces retirement of EMRQ research director| Gulf Times,"He assumed this position in February 2016 where he has been overseeing four research programmes in areas of mutual interest for Qatar and ExxonMobil: environmental management LNG technology water reuse and modern geology.

Dr al-Sulaiti former HSE manager at Qatar General Electricity & Water Corporation joined ExxonMobil Research Qatar in September 2010 where he was appointed water reuse engineering lead. In this role he was responsible for leading the Water Reuse Research Project in Qatar which is aimed at introducing engineered wetland technology to treat industrial wastewater in Qatar.

In 1997 he obtained a PhD in Civil Engineering from Colorado State University. Dominic Genetti president and general manager for ExxonMobil Qatar said: “Dr al-Sulaiti’s contributions to ExxonMobil Research Qatar over the years have been instrumental significant and meaningful. His extensive knowledge of water engineering and environmental management have supported our long-standing partnerships in the community helping expand our global footprint in a safe and reliable manner through leading technology.

""We have all benefited from his track record of strategic thinking and focus on execution and value his leadership and insights in shaping and building ExxonMobil Research Qatar’s team and protecting Qatar’s unique natural environment. I am thankful for Dr al-Sulaiti’s service to ExxonMobil and wish him and his family all the best following his retirement.”

“It has been an honour and privilege to lead ExxonMobil Research Qatar over the years from a successful research team to a renowned and trusted research centre” Dr al-Sulaiti said. “I am proud of all we have accomplished together with our partners in Qatar in support of the energy industry and in protecting the environment. ExxonMobil Research Qatar’s future prospects are vast and I wish my team continued success with their work – I’m proud of each and every one of them.”

Dr Jayanth Balasubramanian EMRQ’s LNG technology research lead will take over from Dr al-Sulaiti as acting research director. Dr Balasubramanian joined EMRQ in 2019 and has over 14 years of experience with ExxonMobil in technical and organisational leadership roles across a range of functions.

He has a PhD in Chemical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University and a Bachelor's in Technology in Chemical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology – Madras.

ExxonMobil Qatar on Sunday announced that Dr Mohamed al-Sulaiti is retiring from his position as research director of ExxonMobil Research Qatar (EMRQ).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yNy9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS9vcHBvc2l0aW9uLW9mZmVycy1zdXBwb3J0LXRvLWdvdnQtaW4tZmFjaW5nLWRvd24tZXh4b25tb2JpbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opposition offers support to gov’t in facing down ExxonMobil,"Admitting that it blundered on critical aspects of the petroleum sector the opposition yesterday offered support to the government for a united stand in dealing with ExxonMobil to correct deficiencies and it also launched a scorching attack on plans for a gas to shore project at Wales.

“While we in the opposition maintain our claim that the 2016 (production sharing) agreement was a vastly improved contract on the 1999 agreement signed by the PPP/C we are willing to offer the government the opportunity never afforded to the APNU+AFC. We are willing to offer our support on presenting a united position so that jointly we can address the alleged inadequacies in the contract and any other documents including the Environmental Permits” Shadow Minister of Natural Resources David Patterson yesterday said.

“The lack of a unified front has allowed various parties to exploit the divisions which is not to the benefit of our country and its citizens. It is our position that once we present a unified position to our international partners the harder it will be for them to continue ignoring our concerns” he added.

Patterson underscored that “moving forward this issue is squarely in the hands of the government” as he emphasized that “the time for grandstanding and blame is over and it’s time to act in the best interest of the citizens of our country.”

He went on to say that while in government the then Minister of Natural Resources Raphael Trotman made it mandatory that Exxon fully brief the then opposition PPP on every new discovery and development a move in their opinion that was necessary for all political parties to be aware of what was happening in the emerging industry

This current opposition Patterson said is yet to enjoy any such briefing by any of the operators here. “The government has requested that no information be shared with us – this is in stark contrast to our handling of this sector and does not reflect the claims of inclusiveness that the government has been making speeches about” he charged.

The third speaker in yesterday’s budget debate at the Arthur Chung Conference Centre Patterson covered issues relating to energy and petroleum the former of which fell under his portfolio when he was Minister of Public Infrastructure.

As he waded into government for its choice of Wales West Bank Demerara as the site for the gas-to-shore project Patterson asserted that Berbice would have been best suited for such infrastructure given that two other wells with vast gas reservoirs are located in close proximity to that county.

Patterson told the House that his government was able to make an informed decision on a location to land the pipes for the gas-to-shore project after embarking on fact-finding studies and consultation with experts in the field.

He said that between September 2015 and November 2019 they were able to engage in studies consultations and discussions with key stakeholders in preparation to make the project reality.

“Mr. Speaker contrast that with what the PPP are doing. No evidence of studies reports or analysis – absolutely nothing. Yet they have decided that they are going to locate the gas to shore project in Wales” Patterson said as he described the government’s action as “a classic case of putting the cart before the horse.”

Window dressing

He argued that the studies that are now being commissioned for the project will be seen as window dressing for a bad project.

According to Patterson a September 2016 study `Screening Evaluation of sites for proposed onshore base to support fledgling offshore oil and gas industry’ by the then government recommended that Berbice was the most suitable location for future onshore bases.

Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo had told Stabroek News in January “We have now settled on the location which is Wales Estate”. He stated that “the critical decisions regarding the geotechnical geophysical and the environmental studies that will advance the project have been made.”

Landing the gas project at Wales is being seen as a path to rejuvenating the communities on the West Bank as they were hard-hit by the closure of the Wales sugar estate at the end of 2016 under the APNU+AFC administration.

Patterson who is at the centre of a raging controversy over whether he should continue as Chairman of Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee stressed that Wales was one of 10 sites examined by a multi stakeholder group and deemed not viable for several reasons.

Listing the reasons he said that the supply of gas to shore will be interrupted for at least 2 – 3 days per year for routine maintenance of the equipment. To keep the plants working he said there will be a need for a steady fuel supply and it is impractical to build storage tanks for natural gas.

“The location makes it very difficult to supply with Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) – the recommended storage capacity is 7 days’ worth of HFO. Compare this to GPL’s 26MW at Vreed-en-Hoop which requires a tanker every 10 days using the largest tanker which is 25000 barrels – Wales at 250MW will need 10 times this amount” Patterson cautioned.

He went on to state that while the Liza 1 and Liza 2 will produce 30 million cubic feet of gas per day enough for power generation additional money will be required to be spent on infrastructure to tap into the gas reservoirs of the Longtail and Turbot wells since they are located closer to Berbice. These wells are expected to be commissioned by 2030.

According to the former minister using the Demerara River for such a project is also unwise as it is one of Guyana’s busiest rivers for commercial activities and fastest flowing.

Pipe dream

“A British expert indicated that it would be an act of lunacy to place a gas pipeline across the mouth of our busiest river. Like most South American rivers – the Demerara River is fast flowing US Army don’t even allow their divers to do salvage work in rivers of this speed”.

Patterson questioned how the power produced will be fed into the national grid while noting that the country has seen the challenges with submarine cables and marine traffic.

Patterson took a jab at the projected completion date for the project by 2023 and said “Hogwash if it is done within acceptable standards – the FEED (Front End Engineering Design) which is done after the completion of the feasibility takes nine months the fabrication of the pipeline alone takes two years laying of the pipeline is another nine months – not to mention the civil works for the power plants as well as the sub-stations for GPL… another pipe dream.”

He labelled the gas-to-shore project as “a sequel to a B rated movie with the same leading actors” Vice President Jagdeo the Minister of Finance Dr Ashni Singh and the former head of NICIL Winston Brassington all of whom he said have delivered failed projects to Guyana.

“These three gentlemen have saddled Guyana with almost US$.5B in worthless projects already and are starting again (Skeldon – US$200M CJIA- US$150M Amalia Falls – US$45M and Marriott – US$90M plus the money owed to NIS for the Berbice Bridge) – and now they are coming … for another US$800M project” Patterson posited.

Disrespectful

Touching on flaring by ExxonMobil Patterson said the response by the oil producer was “disrespectful and insulting to the Guyanese public.”

He said that the company continues to break laws with impunity and repeatedly makes empty promises on rectifying the issue.

“The company started out by saying that there will be no flaring from “day one” then day one became a promise of day 60 which became a promise of day 90” he said as he emphasised that the company keeps regurgitating the same promise without any changes and continues to violate the Environmental Permit.

Patterson stressed that ExxonMobil has given a commitment to its shareholders to cut flaring by a whopping 35 to 45 percent across its global operations but at the same time continues to violate the laws of Guyana.

“Let us not be fooled because in as much as the coalition welcomes Exxon to our shores with open arms their only reason for being here is to make money for Exxon and not because they want to help a poor country” he declared.

Further the opposition member charged that instead of the oil giant living up to its promises and high expectations they are engaged “in what could only be described as a campaign of public misinformation and falsehoods and what is even more distressing is that this administration is being so readily misled by accepting and repeating these falsehoods and misinformation such as the deliberate untruth that Exxon is in compliance with all environmental laws and regulations.”

The former minister stated that while ExxonMobil will only be here for a few decades the environment remains and will be inhabited by generations to come. It is on this note Patterson called on the National Assembly to ensure that they protect with all their might the health and wellbeing of future generations.

“The opposition is ready willing and able to join forces with the PPP/C to fend off the health safety and environmental threats to our people just like we do for national security of our country” he declared.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyb2FkY2FzdHByb21lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JlaW4tc3BvcnRzLXRvLWJyb2FkY2FzdC1xYXRhci10b3RhbC1vcGVuLWFuZC1leHhvbm1vYmlsLW9wZW4tMjAyMS1leGNsdXNpdmVseS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BeIN Sports to broadcast Qatar Total Open in MENA exclusively,"This year’s Qatar ExxonMobil Open will feature tennis superstars Roger Federer and Dominic Thiem.

Its captain David Sanders was an experienced ex-Naxy pilot. First Officer James Tucker was an ex-Navy flight combat instructor. FedEx Flight Engineer Auburn Calloway – also an ex-Navy pilot – didn't know that when he tried to hijack the plane in midair. Calloway was flying for free with the shipment a perk for FedEx employees so it wasn't strange when Calloway informed the officers he would be hitching a ride. What was strange was that the official Flight Engineer for 705 Andy Petersen kept finding the circuit breaker for the plane's cockpit voice recorder turned off. He kept an eye on it pre-flight checks were cleared and the plane headed for San Jose.

A FedEx DC-10 like the one Sanders commanded that day.

At 19000 feet with a total of four passengers Calloway pulled a hammer from his guitar case – it was well before the increased security introduced after 9/11 – and attacked Petersen with repeated blows to the head. Next Calloway assaulted Tucker and readied to attack Captain Sanders. Calloway and Sanders wrestled before Sanders took a blow to the head himself but this gave time for the other crewmen to wake up. Calloway retreated to the back to grab a speargun and with the new weapon in hand ordered them to sit down. That's as far as the hijacking got. Tucker pulled on the controls and pulled the DC-10 into a steep climb. The other three men were tossed out of the cockpit. Captain Sanders and Petersen were wrestling over the speargun with the uninjured Calloway. Petersen had a fractured skull severed temporal artery and profuse bleeding. Sanders was a little better off but not by much. They wouldn't last long. The First Officer and ex-Naxy flight combat instructor took control of the fight by taking control of the helm. He took the plane on its side then upside down. As Calloway hit Captain Sanders in the head again Tucker took the plane into a steep dive. But Tucker's own fractured skull was starting to cause motor problems in his body. He began to lose movement and sensation as the plane plummeted to Earth. Back in the galley Calloway hit the Captain in the head one last time but the Captain had enough. He caught the hammer forced it from the attacker's hands and beat him with his own hammer until Calloway stopped moving. They informed the Memphis air traffic control of the situation requested an ambulance and a SWAT team and headed back to Tennessee.

As the crew flew with the autopilot on Tucker kept the speargun on Calloway. But the moment Tucker's injuries caused the speargun to dip from his hands Calloway attacked again.

They tried to pin him down but their injuries restricted their movements. Once Sanders was able to help his fellow crew mates Tucker beat Calloway with the hammer again.

By the time the captain got back to the cockpit alarms were blaring. The fully-loaded and fully-fueled plane would not have enough room to stop on the runway provided. Even worse Calloway was waking up again so there was no time to do another pass. At the last second Sanders hit another runway that had more room.

Just 300 feet off the ground Calloway was struggling for the hammer one more time. The plane landed hard barely stopping with just 900 feet of runway left. Petersen and Tucker were in critical condition. Luckily all three men survived. Though they received medals for their heroism they were medically unfit to fly from then on.

It turns out Calloway was a martial arts expert and originally planned to be the official flight engineer. He would have only had to kill two people.

The assailant's life had taken a turn in the past four years. He lost his wife and children and was on the verge of losing his job for forging flight documents. So after transferring large amounts of cash and securities to his wife he planned to disable the cockpit recorder then crash a plane so his kids would get his life insurance settlement ensuring they could go to school.

Instead he got two life sentences without parole.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vaG93LXBhc3Nlbmdlci1haXJsaW5lcnMtYXJlLWNvbnZlcnRlZC1pbnRvLWZyZWlnaHRlci1wbGFuZXMtMjAyMS0y0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9ob3ctcGFzc2VuZ2VyLWFpcmxpbmVycy1hcmUtY29udmVydGVkLWludG8tZnJlaWdodGVyLXBsYW5lcy0yMDIxLTI_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How passenger planes get converted into freight airliners for Amazon,"Cargo carriers and e-commerce giants are buying up aging airliners and turning them into cargo jets.

A unique fleet of aircraft is fueling the explosive growth of e-commerce as consumers turn to online shopping during the pandemic and retailers promise faster-than-ever delivery times.

And while air travel remains signifcantly lower due to COVID-19 some former passenger aircraft are avoiding early retirement by finding a second life moving cargo. Logistics giants meanwhile are using the airline industry's downturn to grow their fleets by acquiring aging passenger aircraft for a fraction of what they'd sell for new.

Amazon for example bought 11 Boeing 767-300ER passenger aircraft from Delta Air Lines and Canada's WestJet in January for cargo conversion. While the pandemic had rendered the planes obsolete for flying passengers they're now prime candidates to fly packages instead.

But converting a passenger plane into a cargo carrier isn't as easy as just taking out the seats. The aircraft also needs to be extensively retrofitted to handle the inanimate payload. It's months-long process currently can only be done by a handful of firms around the world and the conversion can often cost as much as the planes themselves.

Clippers All-Star Kawhi Leonard spent more time guarding Ja Morant than he did Thursday.

Consider it respect from a superstar recognizing a young star's potential. But with Leonard unleashed the Grizzlies couldn't muster the fight they brought beating the Clippers 24 hours earlier at FedEx Forum.

The Grizzlies lost 119-99 and were held under 100 points for the third time in four games. Morant's frustration - a combination of poor shooting and Clippers defenders - led to the second-year point guard ejected with 2:18 remaining in the game.

It was his first career ejection and a sign of the Grizzlies' struggles returning a day after the high of one of their biggest wins this season.

Ja Morant had every reason to be upset

Morant had 20 points and five assists but got upset in the fourth quarter when he missed a fastbreak layup and wanted a foul. After the Clippers' Nicolas Batum made a 3-pointer on the next possession Morant was still mad when the Grizzlies (14-15) called a timeout.

He yelled at a referee and promptly got two technical fouls leading to his dismissal. It was a reminder from earlier this season when he pointed out he wanted more respect getting to the foul line.

Morant could be angry after shooting just five free throws. But he also could've been frustrated by Leonard and Patrick Beverley hounding him defensively. Morant shot just 7-for-20 from the field and 2-for-6 on 3-pointers.

3-point blues return

The Grizzlies shot 4-for-5 on 3-pointers in the first quarter. They were a dismal 5-23 the rest of the game.

Credit the Clippers (24-11) doing a better job keeping the Grizzlies out of the paint and forcing them to settle for jump shots. The nine 3-pointers were the fourth time in five games the Grizzlies have made fewer than 10 3-pointers in a game.

The Grizzlies' 3-point shooting defense also returned to its poor form. The Clippers shot 40% from 3-point range (14-35) as Leonard Batum and Paul George made three each.

Poor first-half finish

The Grizzlies closed out the first half on a 10-2 run Thursday. It was the opposite Friday with the Clippers outscoring them 13-1 in the final 2:45 of the half.

Just like the Grizzlies used their first half run to pull away so did the Clippers who led by as many as 20 points. The Clippers held the Grizzlies to 54 paint points compared to 72 points on Thursday and out-rebounded them 47-37.

Leonard finished with 30 points nine rebounds and seven assists. Jonas Valanciunas had 22 points and 11 rebounds while De'Anthony Melton added 16 points off the bench.

Up Next

The Grizzlies face the Houston Rockets on Sunday (7 p.m.) to start their final road trip of the first half of the season. The Rockets won the first meeting 115-103 at FedExForum on Feb. 4

There are still roadblocks before the car hits the market however as the Washington Post reports distribution can't begin until safety tests are conducted and passed.

The car is considered an ultra-aerodynamic electric vehicle and moves on three wheels which takes away a potential loss of energy but also prevents users from collecting a federal tax credit.

The first car mass produced solar car will be sold for as low as $25900 with higher prices attached to higher ranges

The car is able to go from 0 to 60mph in 3.5 seconds with top speeds of 110mph

Aptera Motors is preparing to roll out its solar-powered vehicle by the end of the year

The car is covered by 34 square feet of solar cells which can take the car around 40 miles on a day with clear skies.

Aptera's creators Chris Anthony and Steve Fambro say the car is four times more efficient than the average electric vehicle and 13 times more efficient than a pickup truck that uses gas as fuel.

The design of the vehicle which features notable curves at the front and back helps reduce drag.

'The traditional design process doesn’t allow for breakthroughs' Fambro said to the Post.

The vehicle has notable curves in front and back to reduce the drag of the car

Ultra-light carbon composites and fiberglass make up the frame of the car which can be partially created with a 3D printer.

The car is able to go from 0 to 60mph in just 3.5 seconds with top speeds of 110mph.

For daily use the car is not expected to need any charging making it the first such vehicle on the market.

The vehicle is equipped with a battery pack that provides up to 1000 miles of range much greater than the Tesla Model S’s 370 miles of range.

A market can already be found for these vehicles as evidenced by preorders taken beginning on December 4.

Aptera sold out on its first 330 cars within 24 hours and have since found almost 7500 people willing to put down a deposit for a future order.

The company is also receiving backing from major investors as it continues to scale production.

Last week the company announced that it had raised over $4 million in Series A funding including from Sandy Munro of Munro & Associates Inc.

'I’m betting on a solar future and I’m betting on Aptera' Munro said in the press release.

In February the company moved production design to a facility in Sorrento Valley San Diego.

CAPE CANAVERAL Fla. — Spacewalking astronauts ventured out Sunday to install support frames for new high-efficiency solar panels arriving at the International Space Station later this year.

NASA's Kate Rubins and Victor Glover put the first set of mounting brackets and struts together then bolted them into place next to the station's oldest and most degraded solar wings. But the work took longer than expected and they barely got started on the second set before calling it quits.

Rubins will finish the job during a second spacewalk later this week.

The spacewalkers had to lug out the hundreds of pounds of mounting brackets and struts in 8-foot (2.5-meter) duffle-style bags. The equipment was so big and awkward that it had to be taken apart like furniture just to get through the hatch.

Some of the attachment locations required extra turns of the power drill and still weren't snug enough as indicated by black lines. The astronauts had to use a ratchet wrench to deal with the more stubborn bolts which slowed them down. At one point they were two hours behind.

“Whoever painted this black line painted outside the lines a little bit"" Glover said at one particularly troublesome spot.

“We’ll work on our kindergarten skills over here” Mission Control replied urging him to move on.

With more people and experiments flying on the space station more power will be needed to keep everything running according to NASA. The six new solar panels — to be delivered in pairs by SpaceX over the coming year or so — should boost the station’s electrical capability by as much as 30%.

Rubins and Glover tackled the struts for the first two solar panels due to launch in June. Their spacewalk ended up lasting seven hours a bit longer than planned.

“Really appreciate your hard work. I know there were a lot of challenges” Mission Control radioed.

The eight solar panels up there now are 12 to 20 years old — most of them past their design lifetime and deteriorating. Each panel is 112 feet (34 meters) long by 39 feet (12 meters) wide. Tip to tip counting the center framework each pair stretches 240 feet (73 meters) longer than a Boeing 777′s wingspan.

Boeing is supplying the new roll-up panels about half the size of the old ones but just as powerful thanks to the latest solar cell technology. They’ll be placed at an angle above the old ones which will continue to operate.

A prototype was tested at the space station in 2017.

Rubins' helmet featured a new high-definition camera that provided stunning views particularly those showing the vivid blue Earth 270 miles (435 kilometers) below. “Pretty fantastic"" observed Mission Control.

Sunday’s spacewalk was the third for infectious disease specialist Rubins and Navy pilot Glover — both of whom could end up flying to the moon.

They’re among 18 astronauts newly assigned to NASA’s Artemis moon-landing program. The next moonwalkers will come from this group.

Last week Vice President Kamala Harris put in a congratulatory call to Glover the first African American astronaut to live full time at the space station. NASA released the video exchange Saturday.

“The history making that you are doing we are so proud of you” Harris said. Like other firsts Glover replied it won't be the last. “We want to make sure that we can continue to do new things” he said.

Rubins will float back out Friday with Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi to wrap up the solar panel prep work and to vent and relocate ammonia coolant hoses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjgvaXNzLWV2YS03MS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Astronauts complete spacewalk to prep for station power system upgrades – Spaceflight Now,"EDITOR’S NOTE: Updated at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT) after end of spacewalk.

STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS & USED WITH PERMISSION

Two astronauts floated outside the International Space Station Sunday for the first in a series of spacewalks to upgrade the lab’s aging solar power system assembling a support fixture that eventually will hold a new solar blanket.

The spacewalkers lost time struggling to get a bolt properly tightened and were unable to get as far along as they’d planned with a second fixture. That work will resume next Friday in an already planned spacewalk primarily devoted to station maintenance.

Floating in the Quest airlock Kate Rubins and Victor Glover switched their spacesuits to battery power at 6:12 a.m. EST to officially kick off the 235th station spacewalk since assembly began in 1998 the third so far this year and the third overall for both astronauts.

Both astronauts were equipped with helmet cameras but Rubins made the first use of a high-definition “helmetcam” that provided razor-sharp views allowing flight controllers to follow along as never before.

The goal of the excursion was to install struts at the far left end of the station’s power truss to support new roll-out solar array blankets scheduled for delivery later this year and next. Additional spacewalks will be needed to installed additional support fixtures and eventually new solar array blankets.

The space station is equipped with four huge solar array wings two on each side of the lab’s power truss. Each wing is made up of two 39-foot-wide blankets extending 112 feet in opposite directions. The first two-blanket wing was launched in December 2000 with additional pairs delivered in 2006 2007 and 2009.

The arrays feed power into eight electrical circuits two per wing. When the station is in daylight the arrays charge batteries and deliver power to the lab’s myriad systems. During night passes the batteries feed stored power to the station.

Solar cells degrade over time and NASA is adding six new blankets at a cost of $103 million to the existing power system. Each one of the new ISS roll-out solar arrays or IROSA blankets measure 20 feet wide by 63 feet long when fully extended generating more than 20 kilowatts.

Combined with the 95 kilowatt output of the original eight panels the station’s upgraded system will provide about 215000 kilowatts of power.

“Commercial users are coming on board that are looking for power that that we didn’t even dream of back in the mid 90s” said Kenny Todd deputy manager of the station program at the Johnson Space Center.

“The technology really has gotten to the point that we can do something like these roll out solar arrays. They’re not as big as the ones that we previous deployed and yet we can we can get even more power out of them.”

Rubins and Glover spent the day Sunday working at the base of the far left or port six set of solar arrays which provide power to electrical channels 2B and 4B.

Exiting the airlock the astronauts carried out two eight-foot-long bags containing the struts needed for assembly of triangular support fixtures at the bases of the two P6 arrays.

The first fixture on the P6/2B solar array mast canister went together relatively smoothly but the astronauts had problems completely tightening a bolt holding a strut to the structure. While the fixture was securely attached to the mast canister a bit of play remained.

Rubins backed out one bolt and attempted to re-install it but it again stalled before firmly locking the components flush together. Rubins and Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi plan another spacewalk next Friday and they may make another attempt to tighten the stuck bolt.

In the meantime. Glover pressed ahead with assembly of a triangular section of the support fixture needed for the P6/4A set of arrays. It was tied down on the station’s power truss to await assembly during the next spacewalk.

Rubins and Glover then returned to the Quest airlock ending a seven-hour four-minute spacewalk at 1:16 p.m. Total station spacewalk time now stands at 1478 hours and four minutes or 61.6 days. Rubins’ total through three spacewalks stands at 19 hours and 50 minutes while Glover has logged 19 hours and 20 minutes through his three excursions.

Additional spacewalks will be needed later to install the four additional solar blanket supports and the blankets themselves. The new arrays will be delivered aboard three SpaceX Dragon cargo ships starting later this year. Two spacewalks will be required to install each new blanket.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3RndWFtLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3NvbGFyLWNhcnMtZHJpdmluZy1vbi1zdW5zaGluZS9hcnRpY2xlXzkxMDRmZmVlLTc4ODktMTFlYi05YjdjLTZiMTdlNDEzOTg3Zi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solar cars: Driving on sunshine | Technology | postguam.com,"You have permission to edit this article.

Dorcille Barry was the first to receive the solar lamp kit from Electricians Without Borders on February 25. Senator Annick Pétrus made the presentation.

MARIGOT--Dorcille Barry Mitchel who celebrated her 103rd birthday on January 16 was presented with the first solar lamp kit by Electricians Without Borders (EWB) at her home on Thursday February 25.

EWB launched the project in St. Martin for distribution of 750 solar kits to be prepared for the next hurricane season. These kits from Schneider Electric – an EWB partner – are made up of a photovoltaic panel a box with a battery and four high-power lamps.

They also enable smart phones to be recharged. Saint-Martin Electro Clim (SMEC) offers free delivery logistics and storage on the island. Those who have experienced Hurricane Irma understand the importance of owning such a lamp.

EWB is a partner in the crisis unit of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has intervened in St. Martin to electrically secure houses damaged by the hurricane.

The electricians supplied and commissioned generators and distributed 500 emergency solar lamps to the most vulnerable families in September 2017. They are continuing work in the region repairing electrical circuits and installing boxes equipped with circuit breakers to make homes safer and avoid the risk of fire or electrocution. Once this emergency work is completed the group asks inhabitants to contact a local electrician to finalise their installation.

The presentation to Dorcille Barry was made by Senator of St. Martin Annick Pétrus who is also the godmother of this operation. Also present were EWB volunteers the French West Indies representative from Schneider Electric and the director of SMEC. They explained to Barry and her daughters how to use the lamp kit.

This project is carried out in partnership with Mont des Accords college. Teachers and students will work during the last term on the preparation and distribution of the kits in order to then be able to transmit this information to the beneficiaries and more generally work on renewable energies.

Finally a video and an exhibition will be prepared by the students to be presented to parents at the end of the school year. A survey carried out by EWB has made it possible to target homes with a lack of electricity and they will be the first beneficiaries.

The second beneficiaries will be care staff working in private homes in priority neighbourhoods who are often forced to provide care in poor lighting conditions. This action is coordinated by the Collectif de Solidarité Infirmiere (CSI) responsible for identifying the nursing staff concerned by these needs.

Local associations working with the youth are also partners in contributing to this project. The distribution sites are provided free of charge by Les Compagnons Batisseurs a partner since 2018. The project has been financed by Fondation de France (FDF)."

HIRAM Ohio — Get ready to spot Hollywood stars once again in Northeast Ohio.

3News has exclusively learned that the greater Cleveland area will be the site of an upcoming Netflix film starring Adam Driver (""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"") and Greta Gerwig (""Lady Bird"") and directed by Noah Baumbach (""Marriage Story"" which also starred Driver). The project is an adaptation of the novel ""White Noise"" by Don DeLillo according to IndieWire.

The Netflix project is set to begin filming in June for an approximately 7-month long production. Ohio's film industry hopes the project will be the kickstart the industry needs since the pandemic brought movie making to a standstill.

""It's something we're very excited about because hopefully it'll get people back to work"" said Mike Wendt of the Greater Cleveland Film Commission. Wendt described the project as ""still very hush hush"" and could not disclose any details about the upcoming film but according to the Ohio Development Services Agency a Netflix production in Cleveland was approved last month for state tax credits valued at an estimated $23.8 million.

Meanwhile in the small village of Hiram in Portage County locals have been buzzing about Netflix location scouts who have been scoping out the village and the campus of historic Hiram College where would-be U.S. President James A. Garfield was once a student and later the college president.

""It would be exciting for the community"" said Hiram Mayor Lou Bertrand. He said he spoke to a Netflix representative who told him that the plot of the movie includes an explosion and ""the lead character is a college professor and there's a scene where people are escaping the disaster of the small village"" Bertrand recalled.

Hollywood reports say Driver will play a college professor of Hitler studies at a small liberal arts college in middle America where an explosion unleashes a toxic chemical cloud. He and his wife played by Gerwig face the catastrophe together.

Bertrand is optimistic about what this could mean for his community.

""It would be a great addition to our community economically yes and a big part of our history"" he said.

According to the Greater Cleveland Film Commission the Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit has generated an economic impact of $700-million in the state. Clevelanders have gotten to experience the cool factor of major productions like ""The Avengers"" being filmed around town thanks to Marvel directors Joe and Anthony Russo who are Cleveland natives.

This will be the first movie filmed in Northeast Ohio since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic with past projects including ""Cherry"" and ""Judas and the Black Messiah."" Although they could not discuss details the film commission hoped the project will lead to a bright future for the local film industry.

""2020 took a big hit on the film industry so we're hoping that with a lot more safety precautions in place that it could be a busier 2021"" said Wendt who added that their next goal is to build up Ohio's film infrastructure. He said that would include training for a film industry workforce and building permanent sound stages for movie production. The closed 1.2-million square foot I-X Center in Cleveland is being considered as a potential location.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3B1bi5jb20vbW9yZS90b3Atc3Rvcmllcy9qb2hubnktbWFuemllbC1wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWwtZ29sZi1zcG9ydC1nb2Fs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Johnny Manziel Reveals He Wants To Play Another Professional Sport,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/johnny-manziel-professional-golf-sport-goal on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3B1bi5jb20vbW9yZS90b3Atc3Rvcmllcy9qb2hubnktbWFuemllbC1wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWwtZ29sZi1zcG9ydC1nb2Fs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Giannis Antetokounmpo was too too much for the Clippers on Sunday.

All told the two-time reigning NBA MVP accounted for 17 of his game-high 36 points in the fourth quarter to lift his Milwaukee Bucks to a 105-100 victory their biggest win of the season.

The Clippers’ two superstars couldn’t do what he did down the stretch when Antetokounmpo outscored them and all of their teammates collectively 7-0 in the final 4:01 of play.

While Antetokounmpo turbo’d it through the finish line Sunday the Clippers’ offense ground to a halt in the showdown between conference powers at Fiserv Forum for which 1800 fans were in attendance and a national television audience tuned in on ABC.

“Giannis dominated the last four minutes of the game” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said of the Bucks’ famously agile and aggressive 6-foot-11 240-pound star who extended his streak of 35-plus point games to four.

“He got whatever he wanted.”

And the Clippers got nothing at all in those fateful tentative final four minutes.

The three possessions immediately preceding the drought were promising for L.A.; Kawhi Leonard hit a turnaround fadeaway from 7 feet out he set up Marcus Morris Sr. (11 points) for a 3-pointer and finally Leonard landed a jumper from 13 feet — a sequence that gave the Clippers a 100-96 lead.

But then as the highlight-filled Giannis Show headed for its climax the Clippers no-showed.

Paul George — who scored only two of his 16 points in the second half — missed consecutive 3-pointers.

A poor pass from Patrick Beverley led to a layup by the 6-foot-11 Antetokounmpo over the 6-0 Beverley at the other end — a play on which a slow-rotating Nicolas Batum also fouled the Bucks star in the act of shooting. Antetokounmpo made the ensuing free throw (he went 4 for 6 from the line) to trim the lead to 100-99.

Another Batum foul 37 seconds later sent Antetokounmpo back to the line. He made both free throws and gave Milwaukee (21-3) the lead would stand as the Clippers continued to fire blanks in their third game in four days.

George — who finished 0 for 5 from deep in the final period and made just one of his nine fourth-period attempts from the field — drove and missed from close range before he missed two more 3-point attempts though one of them was a 49-foot heave with time running out.

Leonard missed a stepback 3-pointer over Antetokounmpo and another falling away shot from deep with seven seconds left.

For his part Antetokounmpo — who went 6 for 9 in the last stanza when he also registered three of his four blocks — capped his scoring with a driving dunk through the Clippers’ defense. The jam gave the Bucks a 103-100 lead and sent him galloping joyfully up the sideline with a good feel for who the final 10 seconds would belong to.

“I thought more than we should’ve just played with a little more pace” George said of the Clippers’ late-game stall. “Down that last four minutes we kind of walked the ball up kind of played a slower offense. We didn’t really give ourselves a chance by the time we got halfcourt … we should’ve just pushed the pace — that’s on us.”

Like George Leonard said that wasn’t all Milwaukee’s doing — as well as the Bucks (21-13) played.

It was he said indicative of the Clippers’ ongoing education a prick of pain that growth entails.

“As a team I don’t feel like we’re there yet” Leonard said. “We’re looking to the sideline for plays. I feel like our pace has pretty much slowed down … some teams come down in the flow or pace and know exactly what they’re doing. Those are the teams that usually win. You’re not thinking you’re just coming down getting into a set.

“But we’re all learning each other we’re learning T-Lue so it’s just a learning process.

“It’s one of those nights” Leonard concluded. “You gotta give credit to the Bucks; they closed out the game they played well.”

Leonard led the Clippers (24-12) with 25 points and nine rebounds. Serge Ibaka — who started the game 2 for 8 — picked up some of the offensive burden in the third quarter when he scored 12 of his 15 points and shot 5 for 6.

The Clippers used a 21-7 run that period to more than erase the Bucks’ 11-point lead. Lou Williams (14 points) finished the scoring flourish by popping a 3-pointer over Donte DiVincenzo to extend the lead to 81-77 entering the final quarter in which L.A. was outscored 28-19.

L.A. native Jrue Holiday returned to action following a bout with the coronavirus according to ABC’s Lisa Salters who reported that the guard “felt like he had bricks in his feet” when returned to practice after missing 10 games (a span in which the Bucks lost the first five games before winning the last five contests).

Holiday played 18 minutes Sunday and finished with two points (on 1-for-5 shooting) with three assists.

Projected Starting Lineups

Clippers (24-11): Patrick Beverley Paul George Serge Ibaka Kawhi Leonard Nicolas Batum

Bucks (20-13): Bobby Portis Giannis Antetokounmpo Brook Lopez Khris Middleton Donte DiVincenzo

Injuries/Absences

Clippers: Patrick Patterson (personal reasons) — OUT

Bucks: Jaylen Adams (protocols) — OUT; Jrue Holiday (protocols) — QUESTIONABLE

The Clippers had a tale of two games in recent days as they were absolutely woeful Thursday in a blowout loss against the Grizzlies before they snapped out of it the next night and posted a 20-point win.

Kawhi Leonard was back to his superstar best on Friday posting a 30-point game and the supporting crew came through to keep Memphis at bay despite a game effort throughout.

Patrick Patterson is the only Clippers player who is out for the game heading in the veteran continuing to deal with an undisclosed personal matter.

The situation is a bit unclear for the Bucks who have won four in a row and appear to be on the verge of welcoming back several players. Jrue Holiday remains on the injury report after missing a slew of games due to COVID protocols but ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported Saturday evening that Holiday is cleared to play Sunday and could feature against the Clippers.

ESPN Sources: After missing 10 consecutive games in the league's health and safety protocol Milwaukee Bucks guard Jrue Holiday is likely to return to the lineup against the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday. — Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) February 28 2021

Meanwhile DJ Augustin has been out as well but he also appears to be back in the mix to play for the Bucks so the home team’s squad could be bolstered significantly if the guards are available.

This may sound fairly simplistic but this game could very much come down to execution on both offense and defense for both teams. Defending MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo has been on a tear lately averaging 35.5 points 13.8 rebounds and six assists during Milwaukee’s four-game winning streak per NBA.com and he’s one of the players who can be nearly unstoppable even against a good team. LA will have to look to hit their shots defend well and hope they can keep Milwaukee on their heels. This should be a great game in front of a national audience.",,,,,,,,,

After the gun group missed its January payments the car company's credit arm asked the federal court handling the NRA's bankruptcy to force the group to cancel its leases. Ford said the missed payments indicate the NRA may not be able to keep up with the leases.

""Ford does not have and [the NRA] is not able to offer adequate protection of Ford's interest in the vehicle[s]"" the company said in its filing on Wednesday.

Pat Neligan the NRA's bankruptcy counsel said the filing is ""typical"" for car companies and the group had been current on the payments before it filed for bankruptcy which allows some protections for missed payments in the short term. ""The NRA will continue to comply with the Bankruptcy Code in its ongoing operations"" he told the Washington Free Beacon.

The move by Ford shows one of the dangers of the NRA's bankruptcy strategy. While the gun-rights group has publicly assured donors and creditors it plans to pay its debts in full not all of its creditors believe it. If successful Ford's attempt to reclaim its cars will put a dent in the fleet of cars the group uses for NRA executives and field team members.

Ford wants leases for two 2017 Ford Expeditions and a 2018 Ford Explorer revoked and the cars returned immediately. One of the 2017 Ford Expeditions listed among the NRA's 71-car fleet and costing $799.91 a month was assigned to Wayne LaPierre's special assistant. The other 2017 Expedition cost the group $910.49 a month while the 2018 Ford Explorer cost it $595.07 a month.



Andrew Arulanandam the NRA's managing director of public affairs said the group leases cars for employees who are required to travel for work.

""In some circumstances NRA professionals who conduct a significant amount of work in the field may use a vehicle leased by the organization"" he said. ""As a national organization the NRA naturally makes these accommodations for professionals who travel frequently in support of membership events NRA Foundation activities and gun safety programs.""

The NRA entered federal bankruptcy in an effort to move its charter from New York to Texas and gain some protection for its assets while it fights an attempt by New York attorney general Letitia James (D.) to dissolve the group over accusations of financial impropriety. Experts have described the move as a ""Hail Mary"" with significant pitfalls. Along with Ford's attempt to reclaim some NRA vehicles disgruntled NRA donors have asked for the group's leadership to be removed by the court and James has requested the case be thrown out as an ""end run"" around her prosecution.

NRA leadership has continued to project confidence in the bankruptcy plan and argued it will ultimately prevail in its litigation with James. This week they filed a countersuit against her in state court repeating the claim that James is violating the group's First Amendment rights and prosecuting it for political reasons the group made in a similar suit filed in federal court in August.

The next hearing in the bankruptcy case will be held on March 4.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL21lZGlhLmZvcmQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvZm9yZG1lZGlhL2ltZy9tZS9lbi9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDIvMjgvZm9yZC1lY29zcG9ydF9zLXZpc3VhbGx5LWVmZmljaWVudC1kZXNpZ24tY29tcGxlbWVudHMtZXN0YWJsaXNoZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford EcoSport's Visually Efficient Design Complements Established Family-Friendly On-Road Capability | Middle East,"DUBAI UAE 28 February 2021 — When the Ford EcoSport was launched more than a decade ago Ford wanted it to be both efficient in terms of performance and infused with the company’s efficient design DNA.

The EcoSport’s design also had to appeal to people around the world. From New York to Casablanca and Dubai the EcoSport’s exterior design had to spark the imaginations of Ford fans globally.

The man charged with solving this enormous task was Ehab Kaoud Ford’s chief designer for trucks and SUVs. Now based in Detroit he was previously heading Ford of Brazil’s South American design studio where the EcoSport project was based.

Cover model looks

Faced with a complex task of creating a globally-loved vehicle he encouraged his design team to think big.

“I asked the designers to imagine their vision for the Ford EcoSport on the cover of their favourite magazine” Kaoud explained.



The team worked tirelessly on ideas and was able to create EcoSport’s premium look and maintain Ford’s design DNA all the while conscious of the average compact SUV customer’s budget.

“Take the grille for example; we placed it higher on the front facia giving it a proud strong stance” Kaoud said. “If you look at the profile of the vehicle the hood incorporates itself into the A-pillar and shoots back giving the EcoSport a creative and unique silhouette. The design has the brand’s DNA all over it and when you first look at it there’s no escaping that it is unmistakably a Ford.”

Efficient design

Vehicle efficiency can be interpreted in many ways and the team was keen to explore the term ‘efficiency’ in more ways than simply looking at how much fuel the EcoSport consumed.



“Perceived efficiency is not only about the vehicle’s fuel economy but also visual efficiency. We cut excess materials specifically excess visual weight” said Kaoud. “The headlamps tail lamps and corners of the EcoSport wrap around the body rather than protrude and the wheels are flush with the body making the EcoSport sit planted on the road. It gives it that tough strong appearance when you see it in motion.”

Decluttering EcoSport’s surfaces was also of prime consideration when keeping the vehicle’s design efficient. Take the rear swing gate for example where a door handle could potentially stick out and clutter the overall rear. In an effort to streamline the design the team incorporated the door handle into the taillamp – a unique EcoSport design feature. Simply pressing a button on the door handle will release the swing gate for easy access to the cargo area.

Science in design

Living up to the ‘eco’ in the EcoSport’s name design team also worked to ensure the vehicle ran as efficiently as possible. During the design stages the vehicle was first created in clay to allow engineers and designers to work in unison to refine the vehicle’s aerodynamics.



The rear edge of the vehicle is a great example of this cross-functional collaboration between design and engineering. Edges of the top corner the taillight and rear quarter window incorporated with Kaoud’s efficient wraparound design allows EcoSport to function impressively in the wind tunnel.

Designing with science doesn’t stop with aerodynamics. Safety plays a large part too and is every bit as important to the design process. Going beyond just airbags and seatbelts design teams throughout Ford delve deeper advancing on the prescribed legal requirements of safety and in doing so give customers peace of mind when driving any Ford vehicle.

The A B and C pillars on the EcoSport for instance have added heft to better protect passengers in the event of a rollover. Designers added elements to the pillars in order to create an improved field of view around the vehicle; not to mention providing a less claustrophobic space.



“Science tells us how drivers position themselves and how they might see out of the vehicle. There are certain parameters of the A-pillar which design cannot circumvent but by adding a small window – placed at the bottom of the A-pillar – we give it an airy look and feel. And importantly the surface doesn’t impede vision.” Kaoud explained.

The smart design of the Ford EcoSport no doubt helps it stand out amongst compact SUVs. Efficient both inside and out it was designed from concept to production to display iconic Ford looks and undeniable Ford DNA to be optimised for aerodynamic efficiency and above all else to be a safe and stylish vehicle for families.

To celebrate we’re celebrating women whose ideas tenacity and inventions changed automotive history and the way we drive our cars:

Bertha Benz | Brake pads and the first road trip

Let’s start with the woman who put automobiles on the map.

Photo from Onmanorama

Bertha Benz was born in 1849 in Germany when women were denied access to higher education. She married young engineer Carl Benz and supported his numerous career paths emotionally and financially including the invention of the automobile.

Ad for Carl and Bertha’s Motorwagen | Photo from Mercedes-Benz

No one was very interested in his motorcar until Bertha and their sons took a now-famous road trip. Without Carl’s knowledge Bertha and the boys snuck the car out of Carl’s workshop and took it on the first-long-distance road trip from Mannheim to Pforzheim.

It was a rough ride on roads built for horses and carriages. She made several repairs during her journey and even invented the first brake pad made of leather when the car’s wooden brakes failed.

Her tenacity and determination created the popularity the Motor Car needed to become the world’s most important modern advancements.

Margaret Wilcox | Car heater

Margaret Wilcox was a trailblazer. Born in 1838 she was one of the very few female engineers of the time. In 1893 she received the patent for the interior car heater when she engineered a system that pulled the heat from the engine into the cab.

Wilcox’s work inspired the air heaters found in today’s cars making our cold winter drives more enjoyable.

Mary Anderson & Charlotte Bridgwood |Windshield wiper

Mary Anderson and her patent | Photo from EngineerGirl

We have both Mary Anderson and Charlotte Bridgwood to thank for our windshield wipers that help us to drive safely in rain and snow.

Anderson’s idea for the windshield wiper came to her while riding on a trolley car to New York City in 1903. Due to the snowy weather she couldn’t look out the window and enjoy the sights and the driver had to stop constantly to wipe the snow off the windshield.

Charlotte Bridgwood | Photo from USPTO

Inspired by her less-than-ideal road trip she designed a spring-loaded arm with a rubber blade that would wipe across the windshield and could be activated from inside the car. Building on Anderson’s idea just a few years later in 1917 Bridgwood upgraded the wiper to be electrically operated her design used rollers instead of blades to clean a windshield.

Anderson and Bridgwood were too smart for their time because their patents expired after not getting enough attention from automakers. Little did they know windshield wipers would eventually become a standard feature in all cars.

Florence Lawrence | Auto signaling arms

At one point in automotive history brake lights and turn signals didn’t exist – until silent-film actress Florence Lawrence saw the need.

In 1913 Lawrence invented a device called the Auto Signaling Arm that “when placed on the back of the fender can be raised or lowered by electrical push buttons” she described.

When you pressed on the brake the signaling arm would raise indicating a stop.

Lawrence never received any patents for her design but her idea inspired the necessary turn signals and brake lights we have today.

June McCarroll | Road markings

In 1917 while driving her Ford Model T down a California roadway June McCarroll was inspired to create a safety measure that saves lives to this day:

“My Model T Ford and I found ourselves face to face with a truck on the paved highway” she explained. “It did not take me long to choose between a sandy berth to the right and a ten-ton truck to the left! Then I had my idea of a white line painted down the center of the highways of the country as a safety measure.”

Photo from El Motor

McCarroll launched a letter-writing campaign that gained so much attention that painted lines became California law in 1924. The rest of the country quickly followed.

Katharine Blodgett | Nonreflective glass

Engineer and scientist Katharine Blodgett is who we have to thank for creating non-reflective and anti-glare windshields.

Born in Schenectady New York in 1898 she obtained her bachelors degree at Bryn Mawr College and her masters at the University of Chicago. In 1926 at age 21 Blodgett was the first woman to receive a PhD in Physics at Cambridge University.

In 1938 she developed a liquid soap that when 44 layers were spread over glass would allow 99 percent of light to pass through. Her development paved the way for future engineers to create a more durable coating that wouldn’t wipe off.

Hedy Lamarr | Bluetooth

You might recognize Hedy Lamarr from the World War II film The Conspirators but Lamarr was more than an actress – she was the inventor who created the technology in car’s Bluetooth features.

Photo from Wednesday’s Women

In the 1940s Lamarr invented a device that blocked enemy ships from interrupting torpedo guidance signals. The device would take the torpedo signals and make them jump from frequency to frequency making it near impossible for an enemy to locate the message.

It’s this ‘frequency jumping’ technology we find in the Bluetooth features in our car letting us talk on the phone hands-free or stream our favorite music.

Her technology can also be found in cell-phones Wi-Fi and GPS.

Stephanie Kwolek | Kevlar tires and reinforced brake pads

In 1964 chemist Stephanie Kwolek discovered the synthetic fiber Kevlar. This polymer fiber is five times stronger than steel but lighter than fiberglass. It’s even bulletproof.

Her discovery has saved countless lives as Kevlar is now used to make bulletproof vests and armor.

Today we can find Kevlar in our tires and in reinforced brake pads.

Mimi Vandermolen | Ergonomic controls

In 1970 Ford’s Design Studio welcomed Mimi Vandermolen to the team as one of the first full-time female designers.

After her first project working on the 1974 Mustang II she led the design team for the 1986 Taurus interior.

In the Taurus Vandermolen created ergonomic controls dials for climate function buttons with raised bumps and a curved dash to make it easier to reach controls. Her work made the car more accessible and accommodating to drivers.

She went on to lead all of Ford’s North American small-car designs and the styling of the 1993 Probe inside and out.

Gladys Mae West | GPS

As a mathematician who worked for the U.S. Naval Weapons Laboratory Glady Mae West was the project manager for SEASAT the first earth-orbiting satellite measuring ocean depths.

The work on the 1978 SEASAT project helped West and her team build the GEOSAT satellite creating computer simulations of earth’s surfaces.

Her calculations and work on the SEASAT and GEOSAT helped make the GPS systems in our cars – we’d be lost without her.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlYXJwYXRyb2wuY29tL2NhcnMvYTM1NTU0MDE0L3doby1vd25zLXdoaWNoLWNhci1icmFuZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Automaker Owns Your Favorite Car Brand?,"There are dozens of brands to choose from when you decide to buy a car. Just about every one of them offers an array of models — and a storied lineage to boot. Dive beneath the surface however and you’ll discover a lot of links between brands and vehicles that you might not have realized.

The automotive world has seen rampant consolidation over its 100-plus years of existence. Brands have aligned themselves into multinational conglomerates and share platforms parts engines and infotainment systems. That trend is likely to exacerbate with the era of electrification as carmakers are forced to pour billions into redefinining their lineups and electric motors make individual powertrains less of a distinctive characteristic that defines vehicles and brands.

In one sense consolidation can be dispiriting. A new Lamborghini won’t be as madcap as it was when they were flying solo in the 1970s and 1980s; indeed it’ll have a lot of Audi Porsche and even some VW DNA coursing through its figurative veins. On the other hand the alternative would be losing niche brands like Lamborghini when times go south; and thanks to standardized engines and platforms a new Lamborghini will be more reliable and cheaper to maintain than the eccentric beasts of yore.

So if you’re wondering who’s really behind your new ride — here’s a look at who owns which car brand.

(Note: This list doesn’t include every automotive brand in the world just the car manufacturers that would be familiar to a western audience. For a full accounting of brands associated with each entity check out their respective company websites or Wikipedia pages.)

The Alliance

Gear Patrol

The Alliance (yes fans of The Office that is the actual name) is a strategic partnership between French company Groupe Renault and Japanese companies Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors. Renault and Nissan aligned themselves (don’t call it a merger) in 1999; Nissan then purchased a controlling stake of Mitsubishi in 2016 bringing them into the Alliance as a partner.

The group includes luxury and performance brands like Infiniti Alpine and DS Automobiles. The Alliance also owns Eastern European manufacturers Lada and Dacia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9tb2Jsb2cubmV0LzIwMjEtZm9yZC1leHBsb3Jlci1raW5nLXJhbmNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford Explorer King Ranch Debuts With Swanky Interior & New Tech Updates,"Ford is introducing the first-ever King Ranch edition of the Explorer SUV. The Explorer one of the best-selling SUV lines in America now gets the rugged yet refined King Ranch trim that F-150 buyers have known since 2001. The 2021 Ford Explorer King Ranch continues the brand’s long relationship with the legendary South Texas cattle ranch.

See this is news to me. As a sports car guy I always thought Ford’s King Ranch pickups were just a name. Like there’s the “King” and then the “King Ranch.” Sort of like there’s the “Vente” and there’s the “Grande.”

It turns out the name is from an actual place called The King Ranch. It’s in Texas (of course). A fellow named Captain Richard King (he was a riverboat captain) started the place in the 1850s. And while the history is fascinating what we have here in the 2021 Ford Explorer King Ranch is a very nice and swanky family hauler for the modern-day.

The King Ranch Treatment

With premium features like rich leather and real wood the 2021 Ford Explorer King Ranch is all about meticulous attention to detail.

Ford found after doing lots of customer research that people desired a more refined interior for the Explorer. And for 2021 the Explorer King Ranch delivers with mahogany-colored Mesa Del Rio leather seats with perforated front and second rows. To really put things over the top the seats have that nifty old-timey King Ranch Running W logo. The center console is crafted with a Mesa Del Rio leather armrest and includes a King Ranch logo insert.

There’s more swankiness in the cockpit with leather door trim rollovers a leather-wrapped and stitched instrument panel combined with Sapele wood appliqués as well as a leather-wrapped steering wheel with Norias stitching and a nice Sapele wood insert.

On the outside the Explorer King Ranch is classy too; all decked out with a unique Stone Gray-painted mesh grille insert 20-inch aluminum wheels with a Running W center cap liftgate scuff plate and quad chrome exhaust tips. Capping it all off is signature King Ranch exterior badging.

Tech & Safety Features

Tech? C’mon pardner; this is 2021 not 1851! The available Premium Technology Package includes multi-contour seats with massaging functionality a 10.1-inch center stack touchscreen with swipe and pinch-to-zoom capability. Also included is a 14-speaker Bang & Olufsen Sound System that somehow makes Bob Wills & The Texas Playboys sound even better.

There’s also Ford Co-Pilot360 Assist+ as standard equipment. The package features Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop-and-Go and Lane Centering Evasive Steering Assist and voice-activated touchscreen navigation (also with pinch-to-zoom capability). SiriusXM Traffic Travel Link and Speed Sign Recognition are also along for the ride.

Explorer King Ranch: Engine & Powertrain

Motivation is furnished by the latest 3.0-liter EcoBoost under the hood kicking out 365 horsepower and 380 lb-ft. of torque. The EcoBoost engine is connected to a 10-speed automatic transmission. A standard Class III Trailer Tow Package allows for a max towing capacity of up to 5600 lbs. The Explorer King Ranch can be either rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive your choice.

The enterprise bills itself as the “world’s first large-scale space construction company” and wants to produce everything from space tourism to fuel depots telecommunications satellites and solar power stations “in low Earth orbit and beyond.”

Orbital says it will use robots to construct modular structures in the sky.

Its planned Voyager Station is designed to accommodate 400 people at a time and will have artificial gravity roughly as strong as the moon’s.

A stay in space will offer a low-gravity gymnasium and private spacewalks but it won’t come cheap. Orbital estimates that recreational space travelers will have to have a net worth of nearly $50 million.

AXIOM SPACE TELLS HOUSTON ALL SYSTEMS ARE GO FOR WORLD'S FIRST COMMERCIAL SPACE STATION

To raise capital for its work the company was selling shares at $0.25 in an effort to raise at least $10000 by April 1. It has already met its maximum goal of $1 million according to its page on Netcapital a crowdfunding investment platform for private companies.

Orbital says it already has a team of NASA alumni scientists pilots and engineers as well as patents for space construction equipment.

In a video posted YouTube Orbital architect Tim Alatorre credited advances in the private space industry from firms SpaceX in particular with making launches far less expensive and providing an opening for commercial activity above the atmosphere.

""We haven't seen an explosion of commercial activity in space"" Alatorre said. ""The cost has been about $8000 per kilogram for a long time. But with the Falcon 9 you can do it for less than $2000. And as Starship comes online it will only cost a few hundred dollars.""

The company is not without competition. Axiom Space which plans to develop the world’s first private space station announced a forthcoming 14-acre facility as part of Houston’s Spaceport at Ellington Airport.

This Show Sure Isn't.,"As Fox News attempts to figure out its place in a post-Trump media landscape the network has claimed it is moving “center-right.” A laughable claim critics say—one that is easily disproved by Fox’s far-right primetime screeds but also by the tonal shift of a key noon-hour talk show.

Outnumbered which first debuted in 2014 as a female-led panel show (with a gimmicky “one lucky guy” slotted as the sole male panelist) has always straddled Fox’s increasingly blurred line dividing its “hard news” and opinion wings. But the show has long winked at its “fair and balanced” credentials by featuring a lone liberal pundit among its rotating panel.

However in recent months and as Fox grappled with a ratings plunge—at least in part due to MAGA diehards ditching the network after its news desk made accurate election-night calls for Joe Biden—the noon talk show appears to have benched two key liberal regulars in Marie Harf and Jessica Tarlov.

And instead Outnumbered has taken a noticeably rightward shift stacking its panels with conservative voices and giving more prominent placement to fiery provocateurs like Tomi Lahren. The resulting show is one that like much of Fox’s programming now seems laser-focused on hyping the conservative culture-war grievances of the day.

“ Tomi [Lahren] has no credibility no resumé of experience other than screaming derogatory things on the internet. ” — A current Fox News staffer

“Ratings went down the tank and they want more right-wing voices” one current Fox News staffer told The Daily Beast in assessing the noon show’s new tone especially in light of the network overhauling much of its lineup to add more hours of right-wing opinion commentary.

The prolonged Outnumbered absence of Harf and Tarlov—both of whom continue to appear elsewhere on the network—notably came almost immediately following an intense early-December on-air skirmish between Harf and the show’s permanent host Harris Faulkner over the program’s coverage of the deadly coronavirus pandemic.

Harf a former Obama state department official challenged Faulkner on Outnumbered having spent nearly a full hour talking about Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell’s five-year-old interactions with a suspected Chinese spy or complaining about coronavirus-related indoor dining restrictions all while giving a mere 20 seconds of air to the U.S. surpassing 3000 daily COVID-19 deaths for the first time.

An incensed Faulkner shouted down Harf complaining that it was “offensive” that the liberal panelist “took a shot there.” The host further chided her colleague: “You can’t see my heart and trust me when I tell you it hurts all of us to mourn those Americans and people around the world.”

Prior to Faulkner’s blow-up with Harf the liberal Fox News contributor had appeared in 11 of the previous 24 Outnumbered broadcasts and had been in rotation to appear at least twice a week. Jessica Tarlov another regular Outnumbered panelist had appeared four times during that same span and had been in a once-a-week rotation with the show.

Following that Dec. 10 broadcast however both Harf and Tarlov were yanked from any future bookings on Outnumbered according to two sources familiar with the situation. And since then neither woman has returned to the show.

The only left-leaning panelists to appear on the noon program now are radio host Leslie Marshall a self-described “centrist” Democrat and Johanna Maska a former Obama spokesperson who sat on the panel last week. Fox News host Lisa “Kennedy” Montgomery a self-described libertarian also remains a staple of the show.

Otherwise the show has seemed to increasingly lean on incendiary conservative culture warriors like MAGA youth leader Charlie Kirk reactionary podcaster Dave Rubin failed congressional candidate Kim Klacik and—much to the chagrin of Fox staffers who spoke with The Daily Beast—Tomi Lahren.

The career bomb-thrower—best-known for her bite-sized and breathless rants on Fox’s digital streaming service Fox Nation her oft-hateful tweets (some of which have been publicly rebuked by her own colleagues) and for having been fired by Glenn Beck—has suddenly become a routine presence on Outnumbered.

Lahren recently re-upped her contract with Fox and since December has appeared at least 18 times on Outnumbered co-hosting at least twice per week. Considering her style of commentary and debate being more at home in Fox’s decidedly right-wing primetime hours some Fox News staffers consider her newfound elevation to be eyebrow-raising.

“It’s an absolute joke and further proof that the show shouldn’t be taken seriously” said one current Fox employee who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals from management. “When I was hired I was told that [Lahren] would never be on legitimate shows like Outnumbered or The Five that she was only Fox Nation. I’m just as confused as everyone else. Tomi has no credibility no résumé of experience other than screaming derogatory things on the internet.”

Another Fox staffer suggested Lahren is a logical choice to spice up the network’s daytime programming amid a ratings slump. “She’s good at stirring the pot… all it takes nowadays” the employee said. “Fox likes what rates.”

While the network’s actions—including programming choices that include adding two more hours of right-wing commentary in the 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. hours—indicate a definitive hard-right shift to shore up the hardcore conservative MAGA base Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch somehow insisted the opposite earlier this month.

“We believe that where we are targeted to the center-right is where we should be targeted. We don’t need to go further right” he said while touting the company’s ad-revenue gains. “We don’t believe America is further right and we’re obviously not going to pivot left. All of our significant competitors are to the far left.”

Following last November’s election however the whole calculus for Fox News’ programming changed. Disgruntled pro-Trump viewers ditched the network in droves following Fox’s early call of Arizona for President Joe Biden on Election Night a decision that put a crimp in then-President Donald Trump’s plan to falsely declare victory.

With Fox experiencing slumping post-election ratings—Fox has since witnessed a bounce back and recently returned to number one in primetime—the network made a concerted effort to win back MAGA loyalists by focusing more squarely on conservative opinion and culture-war battles. A key part of that shift included its “hard news” broadcasts devoting ample time to discussing and amplifying the opinion monologues delivered the night before by Fox’s popular pro-Trump firebrands Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity.

The ratings panic became apparent after Martha MacCallum’s now-former 7 p.m. show The Story was beaten on a January evening head-to-head in the ratings by Newsmax the upstart cable outlet that appealed directly to disgruntled Fox viewers by overtly embracing Trump’s bogus “stolen” election ploy. MacCallum’s loss to Newsmax’s Greg Kelly in the key advertising demographic of viewers aged 25-54 scared the network’s bosses “to their core” staffers told The Daily Beast at the time.

And the new direction of Outnumbered ultimately seems to be yet another part of Fox’s overtly rightward shift to combat ratings issues.

“It’s all a complete joke” one Fox News insider told The Daily Beast. “They aren’t even trying anymore to attempt a fair discussion.”

“The token liberal was only there for show” this person concluded. “The liberal opinion was only as useful to them as a tee in tee ball for the rest of the gang to get guaranteed hits their audience wants to hear. Now in their desperation to retain the fleeing audience they are too afraid to have even the slightest opposing view on the show for fear more people will click over to Newsmax.”

For their bravery wit general badassery and unbroken spirit in the face of enormous challenges (be they gender discrimination or acid-hissing aliens) we pay tribute to 87 Fearless Movie Women Who Inspire Us.

How did we arrive at our top 87? With the help of a fearless panel of women critics made up of some of the best writers in the industry including a few on the Rotten Tomatoes staff. Starting with a long list of candidates they whittled down the list to an initial set of 72 amazingly heroic characters and ordered them crowning the most fearless woman movie hero in the process. Want to know more about the ladies who voted? We included their bios at the end! Then in addition to their contributions which make up the bulk of the list we also added a handful of more recent entries chosen by the RT staff.

The final list (you can watch every movie in a special FandangoNOW collection) gives compelling insight into which heroes have resonated through the years women whose big-screen impact remains even as the times change. We have the usual suspects along with plenty of surprises (Working Girl your day has come!) and the only way to discover them all is reading on for the 87 fearless women movie heroes — and groups of heroes — who inspire us!

Alien (1979) 93% #1One of the appeals of science-fiction is the luxury to comment on modern issues and social mores or even eschew them completely. Take a look at the diverse space crews in Star Trek Sunshine or Alien where people are hired based on nothing but competence and none have proven their competence under extreme pressure as well as Ellen Ripley. She’s tough pragmatic and cunning in Alien. Journey with Ripley into Aliens and we get to see her in a new light: mothering and nurturing with hints of deep empathy (Sigourney Weaver was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for this performance) which only makes the Xenomorph-stomping side of her even more badass.

Working Girl (1988) 83% #2And on the other side of the Sigourney spectrum Weaver here plays Katharine a particular kind of woman who’s nasty to the competition: other women. The object of her scorn is her secretary Tess McGill (played by Melanie Griffith) who has her great ideas stolen by Katharine. The plucky Tess in turn pretends to be her boss’s colleague and proceeds to shake things up in this corporate Cinderella story. Who doesn’t dream of one day suddenly arriving in a higher echelon of society? Of course it’s what you do once you get there that’s important and the glowing and tenacious Tess makes the most of it.

Thor: Ragnarok (2017) 93% #3Hard-drinking ass-kicking Valkyrie makes no apologies for her choices and draws solid boundaries. Sure she’s flawed but that’s what makes her successes so sweet. That she’s played by Tessa Thompson doubles the fun.

Black Panther (2018) 96% #4Letitia Wright proved that a sister doesn’t have to sit in the shadow of her sibling simply because he’s king. Her Shuri has the smarts and the sass to cut her own path making her technical genius essential not only to the Kingdom of Wakanda but also the Avengers’ recent efforts to take down the tyrant Thanos.

Hidden Figures (2016) 93% #5Don’t ask us to choose a favorite among Hidden Figures’ Space Race heroines: Taraji P. Henson as Katherine G. Johnson Octavia Spencer as Dorothy Vaughan and Janelle Monáe as Mary Jackson. The Oscar-nominated drama tells the story of a real-life team of female African-American mathematicians crucial to NASA’s early space program.

Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) 97% #6As Imperator Furiosa Charlize Theron blazed a trail for enslaved post-apocalyptic cult wives in skimpy clothing – literally. With an assist from Max (Tom Hardy) soldier Furiosa set the road on fire to rescue her charges from madman Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) leader of the Citadel.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) 91% #7Daisy Ridley gave girls everywhere – and full-grown women in truth – a fresh new hero to adore when she debuted in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Of humble origins scrappy Rey overcomes her circumstances living as an orphan in a harsh environment to become an essential component in the Resistance. It helps of course that The Force is with her.



(Photo by Clay Enos/Warner Bros. Pictures) Wonder Woman (2017) 93% #8Despite her superpowers and privileged background Gal Gadot as Diana – princess of Themyscira and the Amazons daughter of Queen Hippolyta and King of the Gods Zeus – retains her humility and a genuine care for humanity. She’s also the most rock solid member of DC’s boys club of Justice League superheroes.

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) 83% #9Come on…she’s Princess Leia. She leads the Rebel Alliance. She saves the galaxy again and again (with a little help from Luke and Han and Chewy). She eventually becomes a revered general but from the very start – when she first confronts Darth Vader at the beginning of Episode IV – A New Hope – she shows a defiant fiery nature that never dims. In her defining film role Carrie Fisher brings impeccable comic timing to this cosmic princess.

Winter's Bone (2010) 94% #10Before she was Katniss Jennifer Lawrence was Ree the role that made her a star and earned her the first of four Oscar nominations. A no-nonsense teenager Ree dares to brave the dangers lurking within the Ozark Mountains to track down her drug-dealing father and protect her siblings and their home. With each quietly treacherous encounter she shows depth and instincts beyond her years and a willingness to fight for what matters.

The Silence of the Lambs (1991) 95% #11You can’t have any fear when you’re going up against Hannibal Lecter – or at least you can’t show it. He’ll sniff it out from a mile away. But what’s exciting about Jodie Foster’s Oscar-winning portrayal of the young FBI cadet is the way she works through her fear harnessing that nervous energy alongside her powerful intellect and dogged determination. Clarice Starling is a hero for every little girl who thought she wasn’t good enough.

Erin Brockovich (2000) 85% #12Julia Roberts won a best-actress Oscar for her charismatic portrayal of this larger-than-life real-life figure. Erin Brockovich is repeatedly underestimated because of the flashy way she dresses and the brash way she carries herself. But as a single mom who becomes an unlikely environmental advocate she’s a steely fighter. What she lacks in book smarts she more than makes up for with heart. Steven Soderbergh’s film is an inspiring underdog story.

Broadcast News (1987) 98% #13Jane Craig is the toughest sharpest most prepared woman in the newsroom at all times but she isn’t afraid to cry to let it all out when the pressure gets too great. Writer-director James L. Brooks created this feminist heroine this workplace goddess but Holly Hunter brilliantly brings her to life. She’s just so vibrant. Even when she’s sitting still (which isn’t often) you can feel her thinking. And while two men compete for her attention no man could ever define her.

Fargo (1996) 94% #14It would be easy to underestimate Marge Gunderson. Sure she’s in a position of power as the Brainerd Minnesota police chief. But with her folksy manner – and the fact that she’s so pregnant she’s about to burst – she’s not exactly the most intimidating figure. But in the hands of the brilliant Frances McDormand she’s consistently the smartest and most fearless person in the room and she remains one of the Coen brothers’ most enduring characters. You betcha.

Avengers: Infinity War (2018) 85% #15Danai Gurira plays Okoye the leader of the Dora Milaje who specializes in spear fighting and strategic wig flipping. Of late Okoye has been seen keeping company with Avengers.

Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) 80% #16Things Bridget Jones is prone to: accidents fantasizing about sexy coworkers worrying about her weight and running mad into the snow wearing tiger-print underwear. All totally relatable things so it’s no surprise she’s the highest-ranked romcom heroine on this list. It also doesn’t hurt that at their best Bridget’s movies are what romantic comedies aspire to: They’re fun cute and just when it feels like everything’s about to fall apart there’s the exhilarating little twist at the end that leaves watchers feel like they’re floating on air.

Clueless (1995) 81% #17It’s true that Cher is a little oblivious to the world at large but she’s just so earnest and she tries so hard. She discovers a passion for doing good after successfully matchmaking a pair of teachers and after a series of difficult lessons learned she makes an honest effort to escape her privileged bubble and become a better person. Like we all should.



(Photo by MGM Studios)

Thelma & Louise (1991) 86% #18Thelma and Louise best friends who stick by each other no matter what. And when their girls’ getaway weekend quickly turns from frivolous to frightening they find even deeper levels of loyalty to each other. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon have an effortless chemistry with each other and Ridley Scott’s intimate and thrilling film never judges these women for the decisions they make — or for the lengths to which they’ll go in the name of freedom.

The Color Purple (1985) 73% #19Enduring racism misogyny and emotional physical and sexual violence Celie (Whoopi Goldberg in her film debut) transcends her traumatic life in the rural South finding friends strength and her own voice.

A Fantastic Woman (2017) 94% #20As a transgender waitress Marina constantly endures cruelty and confusion from the ignorant people around her. When the one man who loves her for who she truly is dies unexpectedly she finds herself in the midst of an even more emotional personal fight. Transgender actress Daniela Vega initially was hired as a consultant on Sebastian Lelio’s film; instead she became its star and A Fantastic Woman deservedly won this year’s foreign-language Oscar.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) 91% #21Sarah Connor makes many want to be a better mother – or at least get to the gym and work on our triceps. The once-timid waitress crafts herself into a force of nature a fearsome and visceral manifestation of pure maternal instinct. Played most memorably by Linda Hamilton in the first two Terminator movies Sarah may seem unhinged but she’s got laser-like focus when it comes to protecting her son John from the many threats coming his way.

Jackie Brown (1997) 88% #22The return of blaxploitation queen Pam Grier! What’s not to love? Especially in Quentin Tarantino’s killer love letter to South Bay Los Angeles. As Jackie Brown Grier exudes classic cool with a tough exterior.

Zero Dark Thirty (2012) 91% #23Jessica Chastain has made a career of playing quick-witted characters with nerves of steel. Nowhere is this truer than in her starring role in Kathryn Bigelow’s thrilling depiction of the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Maya is obsessively focused in her pursuit of the al Qaeda leader. She’s a confident woman who has to be extra prepared to survive in a man’s world. But when the mission is over and she finally allows some emotion to shine through it’s cathartic for us all.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) 90% #24She’s the smartest kid in the class regardless of the subject. The hardest worker too. And she’s proud of those qualities making her an excellent role model for girls out there with an interest in math and science. But Hermione isn’t all about the books. Over the eight Harry Potter films in Emma Watson’s increasingly confident hands Hermione reveals her resourcefulness loyalty and grace. She’s a great student but an even better friend.

His Girl Friday (1940) 99% #25Howard Hawks’ celebrated screwball comedy benefited from a not-so-small change to the stage play it was based on: In the original The Front Page Hildy Johnson was a male. But thanks to Rosalind Russell’s lively performance as well as a few script changes she personally insisted upon the character blossomed into an early icon of the independent working woman who’s not only just as effective at her job as her male counterparts but also equally adept with a witty comeback.

The Incredibles (2004) 97% #26Elastigirl takes on all the trials of motherhood: She’s got hyper kids a bored husband and has to witness certain parts of her body unperkify. Elastigirl also just happens to be a superhero with the fate of the world resting on her shoulders.

Serenity (2005) 82% #27Fans of the short-lived but beloved Fox sci-fi series Firefly were already familiar with Gina Torres‘ badassery as Zoe Washburne in Serenity. A veteran of the Unification War and second in command of the ship Zoe is a strong and loyal ally who rarely pulls punches whether she’s stating a controversial opinion or engaged in a literal fistfight. With her free spirit and deadly skills it’s no wonder she became a fan favorite.

9 to 5 (1980) 69% #28Dolly Parton is a national treasure and 9 to 5 allows her to light up the screen with her sparkling charismatic personality. But while Doralee may seem like a sweet Southern gal she’s got a stiff backbone and a sharp tongue and she isn’t afraid to use them when she’s crossed. When she finally stands up to her sexist bully of a boss alongside co-workers Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda it’s nothing short of a revolution – one that remains sadly relevant today.



(Photo by Columbia Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)

A League of Their Own (1992) 81% #29The story of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League is one that deserves to be told and it’s Geena Davis‘ Dottie Hinson who grounds this fictional account. She’s a talented local player who becomes the star of the Rockford Peaches and it’s her quick thinking that brings publicity to the sport. When her decision to play in the World Series leads to a spectacular finish she also demonstrates a very human vulnerability making her a strong but relatable heroine.

Pride & Prejudice (2005) 87% #30Jane Austen’s classic heroine Elizabeth Bennet jumps off the page in the 2005 film starring Keira Knightley who gives audiences an intelligent down-to-Earth sometimes literally dirty but uncompromisingly steadfast leading lady.



(Photo by Everett Collection)

Legally Blonde (2001) 71% #31Never underestimate a sorority girl. They are organized and they know how to get what the want. In the case of Elle Woods she goes after her law school goals with a smile on her face a spring in her step and an impeccably coordinated wardrobe. Reese Witherspoon is impossibly adorable in the role with a potent combination of smarts and heart to shut down the naysayers who are foolish enough to judge her simply by her looks.

Edge of Tomorrow (2014) 91% #32Talk brashly and carry a big sword. As Tom Cruise’s character unravels a complex time travel sci-fi story a constant in his fluctuating world is Rita Vrataski aka the killer Angel of Verdun. But Emily Blunt gives life to Rita beyond burgeoning love interest. She takes the lead and makes the movie just as much her’s.

Captain Marvel (2019) 79% #33When Nick Fury sent that mysterious intergalactic text message right before disappearing into dust at the end of Avengers: Infinity War eager fans knew what was in store. As played by Brie Larson Captain Marvel is one of the most powerful superheroes in the MCU — if not THE most powerful — and she’s in such high demand that she spends most of her time battling evil on other planets. She shows up when it counts though and she can rock a mowhawk like nobody’s business.

A Quiet Place (2018) 96% #34Though hit hard by tragedy and seemingly insurmountable odds of surviving an alien invasion mother and daughter duo Evelin and Regan Abbott prove their mettle in A Quiet Place.

Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) 53% #35Played first in film by the groundbreaking star of the Star Trek TV series Nichelle Nichols the role was passed on to Zoe Saldana in the 2009 reboot film. Uhura the USS Enterprise chief communications officer was a critical crew member throughout the franchise in both TV and film.

The enterprise bills itself as the “world’s first large-scale space construction company” and wants to produce everything from space tourism to fuel depots telecommunications satellites and solar power stations “in low Earth orbit and beyond.”

Orbital says it will use robots to construct modular structures in the sky.

Its planned Voyager Station is designed to accommodate 400 people at a time and will have artificial gravity roughly as strong as the moon’s.

A stay in space will offer a low-gravity gymnasium and private spacewalks but it won’t come cheap. Orbital estimates that recreational space travelers will have to have a net worth of nearly $50 million.

AXIOM SPACE TELLS HOUSTON ALL SYSTEMS ARE GO FOR WORLD'S FIRST COMMERCIAL SPACE STATION

To raise capital for its work the company was selling shares at $0.25 in an effort to raise at least $10000 by April 1. It has already met its maximum goal of $1 million according to its page on Netcapital a crowdfunding investment platform for private companies.

Orbital says it already has a team of NASA alumni scientists pilots and engineers as well as patents for space construction equipment.

In a video posted YouTube Orbital architect Tim Alatorre credited advances in the private space industry from firms SpaceX in particular with making launches far less expensive and providing an opening for commercial activity above the atmosphere.

""We haven't seen an explosion of commercial activity in space"" Alatorre said. ""The cost has been about $8000 per kilogram for a long time. But with the Falcon 9 you can do it for less than $2000. And as Starship comes online it will only cost a few hundred dollars.""

The company is not without competition. Axiom Space which plans to develop the world’s first private space station announced a forthcoming 14-acre facility as part of Houston’s Spaceport at Ellington Airport.

This Show Sure Isn't.,"As Fox News attempts to figure out its place in a post-Trump media landscape the network has claimed it is moving “center-right.” A laughable claim critics say—one that is easily disproved by Fox’s far-right primetime screeds but also by the tonal shift of a key noon-hour talk show.

Outnumbered which first debuted in 2014 as a female-led panel show (with a gimmicky “one lucky guy” slotted as the sole male panelist) has always straddled Fox’s increasingly blurred line dividing its “hard news” and opinion wings. But the show has long winked at its “fair and balanced” credentials by featuring a lone liberal pundit among its rotating panel.

However in recent months and as Fox grappled with a ratings plunge—at least in part due to MAGA diehards ditching the network after its news desk made accurate election-night calls for Joe Biden—the noon talk show appears to have benched two key liberal regulars in Marie Harf and Jessica Tarlov.

And instead Outnumbered has taken a noticeably rightward shift stacking its panels with conservative voices and giving more prominent placement to fiery provocateurs like Tomi Lahren. The resulting show is one that like much of Fox’s programming now seems laser-focused on hyping the conservative culture-war grievances of the day.

“ Tomi [Lahren] has no credibility no resumé of experience other than screaming derogatory things on the internet. ” — A current Fox News staffer

“Ratings went down the tank and they want more right-wing voices” one current Fox News staffer told The Daily Beast in assessing the noon show’s new tone especially in light of the network overhauling much of its lineup to add more hours of right-wing opinion commentary.

The prolonged Outnumbered absence of Harf and Tarlov—both of whom continue to appear elsewhere on the network—notably came almost immediately following an intense early-December on-air skirmish between Harf and the show’s permanent host Harris Faulkner over the program’s coverage of the deadly coronavirus pandemic.

Harf a former Obama state department official challenged Faulkner on Outnumbered having spent nearly a full hour talking about Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell’s five-year-old interactions with a suspected Chinese spy or complaining about coronavirus-related indoor dining restrictions all while giving a mere 20 seconds of air to the U.S. surpassing 3000 daily COVID-19 deaths for the first time.

An incensed Faulkner shouted down Harf complaining that it was “offensive” that the liberal panelist “took a shot there.” The host further chided her colleague: “You can’t see my heart and trust me when I tell you it hurts all of us to mourn those Americans and people around the world.”

Prior to Faulkner’s blow-up with Harf the liberal Fox News contributor had appeared in 11 of the previous 24 Outnumbered broadcasts and had been in rotation to appear at least twice a week. Jessica Tarlov another regular Outnumbered panelist had appeared four times during that same span and had been in a once-a-week rotation with the show.

Following that Dec. 10 broadcast however both Harf and Tarlov were yanked from any future bookings on Outnumbered according to two sources familiar with the situation. And since then neither woman has returned to the show.

The only left-leaning panelists to appear on the noon program now are radio host Leslie Marshall a self-described “centrist” Democrat and Johanna Maska a former Obama spokesperson who sat on the panel last week. Fox News host Lisa “Kennedy” Montgomery a self-described libertarian also remains a staple of the show.

Otherwise the show has seemed to increasingly lean on incendiary conservative culture warriors like MAGA youth leader Charlie Kirk reactionary podcaster Dave Rubin failed congressional candidate Kim Klacik and—much to the chagrin of Fox staffers who spoke with The Daily Beast—Tomi Lahren.

The career bomb-thrower—best-known for her bite-sized and breathless rants on Fox’s digital streaming service Fox Nation her oft-hateful tweets (some of which have been publicly rebuked by her own colleagues) and for having been fired by Glenn Beck—has suddenly become a routine presence on Outnumbered.

Lahren recently re-upped her contract with Fox and since December has appeared at least 18 times on Outnumbered co-hosting at least twice per week. Considering her style of commentary and debate being more at home in Fox’s decidedly right-wing primetime hours some Fox News staffers consider her newfound elevation to be eyebrow-raising.

“It’s an absolute joke and further proof that the show shouldn’t be taken seriously” said one current Fox employee who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals from management. “When I was hired I was told that [Lahren] would never be on legitimate shows like Outnumbered or The Five that she was only Fox Nation. I’m just as confused as everyone else. Tomi has no credibility no résumé of experience other than screaming derogatory things on the internet.”

Another Fox staffer suggested Lahren is a logical choice to spice up the network’s daytime programming amid a ratings slump. “She’s good at stirring the pot… all it takes nowadays” the employee said. “Fox likes what rates.”

While the network’s actions—including programming choices that include adding two more hours of right-wing commentary in the 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. hours—indicate a definitive hard-right shift to shore up the hardcore conservative MAGA base Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch somehow insisted the opposite earlier this month.

“We believe that where we are targeted to the center-right is where we should be targeted.

All of our significant competitors are to the far left.”

Following last November’s election however the whole calculus for Fox News’ programming changed. Disgruntled pro-Trump viewers ditched the network in droves following Fox’s early call of Arizona for President Joe Biden on Election Night a decision that put a crimp in then-President Donald Trump’s plan to falsely declare victory.

With Fox experiencing slumping post-election ratings—Fox has since witnessed a bounce back and recently returned to number one in primetime—the network made a concerted effort to win back MAGA loyalists by focusing more squarely on conservative opinion and culture-war battles. A key part of that shift included its “hard news” broadcasts devoting ample time to discussing and amplifying the opinion monologues delivered the night before by Fox’s popular pro-Trump firebrands Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity.

The ratings panic became apparent after Martha MacCallum’s now-former 7 p.m. show The Story was beaten on a January evening head-to-head in the ratings by Newsmax the upstart cable outlet that appealed directly to disgruntled Fox viewers by overtly embracing Trump’s bogus “stolen” election ploy. MacCallum’s loss to Newsmax’s Greg Kelly in the key advertising demographic of viewers aged 25-54 scared the network’s bosses “to their core” staffers told The Daily Beast at the time.

And the new direction of Outnumbered ultimately seems to be yet another part of Fox’s overtly rightward shift to combat ratings issues.

“It’s all a complete joke” one Fox News insider told The Daily Beast. “They aren’t even trying anymore to attempt a fair discussion.”

“The token liberal was only there for show” this person concluded. “The liberal opinion was only as useful to them as a tee in tee ball for the rest of the gang to get guaranteed hits their audience wants to hear. Now in their desperation to retain the fleeing audience they are too afraid to have even the slightest opposing view on the show for fear more people will click over to Newsmax.”

For their bravery wit general badassery and unbroken spirit in the face of enormous challenges (be they gender discrimination or acid-hissing aliens) we pay tribute to 87 Fearless Movie Women Who Inspire Us.

How did we arrive at our top 87? With the help of a fearless panel of women critics made up of some of the best writers in the industry including a few on the Rotten Tomatoes staff. Starting with a long list of candidates they whittled down the list to an initial set of 72 amazingly heroic characters and ordered them crowning the most fearless woman movie hero in the process. Want to know more about the ladies who voted? We included their bios at the end! Then in addition to their contributions which make up the bulk of the list we also added a handful of more recent entries chosen by the RT staff.

The final list (you can watch every movie in a special FandangoNOW collection) gives compelling insight into which heroes have resonated through the years women whose big-screen impact remains even as the times change. We have the usual suspects along with plenty of surprises (Working Girl your day has come!) and the only way to discover them all is reading on for the 87 fearless women movie heroes — and groups of heroes — who inspire us!

Alien (1979) 93% #1One of the appeals of science-fiction is the luxury to comment on modern issues and social mores or even eschew them completely. Take a look at the diverse space crews in Star Trek Sunshine or Alien where people are hired based on nothing but competence and none have proven their competence under extreme pressure as well as Ellen Ripley. She’s tough pragmatic and cunning in Alien. Journey with Ripley into Aliens and we get to see her in a new light: mothering and nurturing with hints of deep empathy (Sigourney Weaver was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for this performance) which only makes the Xenomorph-stomping side of her even more badass.

Working Girl (1988) 83% #2And on the other side of the Sigourney spectrum Weaver here plays Katharine a particular kind of woman who’s nasty to the competition: other women. The object of her scorn is her secretary Tess McGill (played by Melanie Griffith) who has her great ideas stolen by Katharine. The plucky Tess in turn pretends to be her boss’s colleague and proceeds to shake things up in this corporate Cinderella story. Who doesn’t dream of one day suddenly arriving in a higher echelon of society? Of course it’s what you do once you get there that’s important and the glowing and tenacious Tess makes the most of it.

Thor: Ragnarok (2017) 93% #3Hard-drinking ass-kicking Valkyrie makes no apologies for her choices and draws solid boundaries. Sure she’s flawed but that’s what makes her successes so sweet. That she’s played by Tessa Thompson doubles the fun.

Black Panther (2018) 96% #4Letitia Wright proved that a sister doesn’t have to sit in the shadow of her sibling simply because he’s king. Her Shuri has the smarts and the sass to cut her own path making her technical genius essential not only to the Kingdom of Wakanda but also the Avengers’ recent efforts to take down the tyrant Thanos.

Hidden Figures (2016) 93% #5Don’t ask us to choose a favorite among Hidden Figures’ Space Race heroines: Taraji P. Henson as Katherine G. Johnson Octavia Spencer as Dorothy Vaughan and Janelle Monáe as Mary Jackson. The Oscar-nominated drama tells the story of a real-life team of female African-American mathematicians crucial to NASA’s early space program.

Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) 97% #6As Imperator Furiosa Charlize Theron blazed a trail for enslaved post-apocalyptic cult wives in skimpy clothing – literally. With an assist from Max (Tom Hardy) soldier Furiosa set the road on fire to rescue her charges from madman Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) leader of the Citadel.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) 91% #7Daisy Ridley gave girls everywhere – and full-grown women in truth – a fresh new hero to adore when she debuted in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Of humble origins scrappy Rey overcomes her circumstances living as an orphan in a harsh environment to become an essential component in the Resistance. It helps of course that The Force is with her.



(Photo by Clay Enos/Warner Bros. Pictures) Wonder Woman (2017) 93% #8Despite her superpowers and privileged background Gal Gadot as Diana – princess of Themyscira and the Amazons daughter of Queen Hippolyta and King of the Gods Zeus – retains her humility and a genuine care for humanity. She’s also the most rock solid member of DC’s boys club of Justice League superheroes.

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) 83% #9Come on…she’s Princess Leia. She leads the Rebel Alliance. She saves the galaxy again and again (with a little help from Luke and Han and Chewy). She eventually becomes a revered general but from the very start – when she first confronts Darth Vader at the beginning of Episode IV – A New Hope – she shows a defiant fiery nature that never dims. In her defining film role Carrie Fisher brings impeccable comic timing to this cosmic princess.

Winter's Bone (2010) 94% #10Before she was Katniss Jennifer Lawrence was Ree the role that made her a star and earned her the first of four Oscar nominations. A no-nonsense teenager Ree dares to brave the dangers lurking within the Ozark Mountains to track down her drug-dealing father and protect her siblings and their home. With each quietly treacherous encounter she shows depth and instincts beyond her years and a willingness to fight for what matters.

The Silence of the Lambs (1991) 95% #11You can’t have any fear when you’re going up against Hannibal Lecter – or at least you can’t show it. He’ll sniff it out from a mile away. But what’s exciting about Jodie Foster’s Oscar-winning portrayal of the young FBI cadet is the way she works through her fear harnessing that nervous energy alongside her powerful intellect and dogged determination. Clarice Starling is a hero for every little girl who thought she wasn’t good enough.

Erin Brockovich (2000) 85% #12Julia Roberts won a best-actress Oscar for her charismatic portrayal of this larger-than-life real-life figure. Erin Brockovich is repeatedly underestimated because of the flashy way she dresses and the brash way she carries herself. But as a single mom who becomes an unlikely environmental advocate she’s a steely fighter. What she lacks in book smarts she more than makes up for with heart. Steven Soderbergh’s film is an inspiring underdog story.



(Photo by 20th Century Fox)

Broadcast News (1987) 98% #13Jane Craig is the toughest sharpest most prepared woman in the newsroom at all times but she isn’t afraid to cry to let it all out when the pressure gets too great. Writer-director James L. Brooks created this feminist heroine this workplace goddess but Holly Hunter brilliantly brings her to life. She’s just so vibrant. Even when she’s sitting still (which isn’t often) you can feel her thinking. And while two men compete for her attention no man could ever define her.

Fargo (1996) 94% #14It would be easy to underestimate Marge Gunderson. Sure she’s in a position of power as the Brainerd Minnesota police chief. But with her folksy manner – and the fact that she’s so pregnant she’s about to burst – she’s not exactly the most intimidating figure. But in the hands of the brilliant Frances McDormand she’s consistently the smartest and most fearless person in the room and she remains one of the Coen brothers’ most enduring characters. You betcha.

Avengers: Infinity War (2018) 85% #15Danai Gurira plays Okoye the leader of the Dora Milaje who specializes in spear fighting and strategic wig flipping. Of late Okoye has been seen keeping company with Avengers.

Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) 80% #16Things Bridget Jones is prone to: accidents fantasizing about sexy coworkers worrying about her weight and running mad into the snow wearing tiger-print underwear. All totally relatable things so it’s no surprise she’s the highest-ranked romcom heroine on this list. It also doesn’t hurt that at their best Bridget’s movies are what romantic comedies aspire to: They’re fun cute and just when it feels like everything’s about to fall apart there’s the exhilarating little twist at the end that leaves watchers feel like they’re floating on air.

Clueless (1995) 81% #17It’s true that Cher is a little oblivious to the world at large but she’s just so earnest and she tries so hard. She discovers a passion for doing good after successfully matchmaking a pair of teachers and after a series of difficult lessons learned she makes an honest effort to escape her privileged bubble and become a better person. Like we all should.



(Photo by MGM Studios)

Thelma & Louise (1991) 86% #18Thelma and Louise best friends who stick by each other no matter what. And when their girls’ getaway weekend quickly turns from frivolous to frightening they find even deeper levels of loyalty to each other. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon have an effortless chemistry with each other and Ridley Scott’s intimate and thrilling film never judges these women for the decisions they make — or for the lengths to which they’ll go in the name of freedom.

The Color Purple (1985) 73% #19Enduring racism misogyny and emotional physical and sexual violence Celie (Whoopi Goldberg in her film debut) transcends her traumatic life in the rural South finding friends strength and her own voice.

A Fantastic Woman (2017) 94% #20As a transgender waitress Marina constantly endures cruelty and confusion from the ignorant people around her. When the one man who loves her for who she truly is dies unexpectedly she finds herself in the midst of an even more emotional personal fight. Transgender actress Daniela Vega initially was hired as a consultant on Sebastian Lelio’s film; instead she became its star and A Fantastic Woman deservedly won this year’s foreign-language Oscar.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) 91% #21Sarah Connor makes many want to be a better mother – or at least get to the gym and work on our triceps. The once-timid waitress crafts herself into a force of nature a fearsome and visceral manifestation of pure maternal instinct. Played most memorably by Linda Hamilton in the first two Terminator movies Sarah may seem unhinged but she’s got laser-like focus when it comes to protecting her son John from the many threats coming his way.

Jackie Brown (1997) 88% #22The return of blaxploitation queen Pam Grier! What’s not to love? Especially in Quentin Tarantino’s killer love letter to South Bay Los Angeles. As Jackie Brown Grier exudes classic cool with a tough exterior.

Zero Dark Thirty (2012) 91% #23Jessica Chastain has made a career of playing quick-witted characters with nerves of steel. Nowhere is this truer than in her starring role in Kathryn Bigelow’s thrilling depiction of the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Maya is obsessively focused in her pursuit of the al Qaeda leader. She’s a confident woman who has to be extra prepared to survive in a man’s world. But when the mission is over and she finally allows some emotion to shine through it’s cathartic for us all.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) 90% #24She’s the smartest kid in the class regardless of the subject. The hardest worker too. And she’s proud of those qualities making her an excellent role model for girls out there with an interest in math and science. But Hermione isn’t all about the books. Over the eight Harry Potter films in Emma Watson’s increasingly confident hands Hermione reveals her resourcefulness loyalty and grace. She’s a great student but an even better friend.

His Girl Friday (1940) 99% #25Howard Hawks’ celebrated screwball comedy benefited from a not-so-small change to the stage play it was based on: In the original The Front Page Hildy Johnson was a male. But thanks to Rosalind Russell’s lively performance as well as a few script changes she personally insisted upon the character blossomed into an early icon of the independent working woman who’s not only just as effective at her job as her male counterparts but also equally adept with a witty comeback.

The Incredibles (2004) 97% #26Elastigirl takes on all the trials of motherhood: She’s got hyper kids a bored husband and has to witness certain parts of her body unperkify. Elastigirl also just happens to be a superhero with the fate of the world resting on her shoulders.

Serenity (2005) 82% #27Fans of the short-lived but beloved Fox sci-fi series Firefly were already familiar with Gina Torres‘ badassery as Zoe Washburne in Serenity. A veteran of the Unification War and second in command of the ship Zoe is a strong and loyal ally who rarely pulls punches whether she’s stating a controversial opinion or engaged in a literal fistfight. With her free spirit and deadly skills it’s no wonder she became a fan favorite.

9 to 5 (1980) 69% #28Dolly Parton is a national treasure and 9 to 5 allows her to light up the screen with her sparkling charismatic personality. But while Doralee may seem like a sweet Southern gal she’s got a stiff backbone and a sharp tongue and she isn’t afraid to use them when she’s crossed. When she finally stands up to her sexist bully of a boss alongside co-workers Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda it’s nothing short of a revolution – one that remains sadly relevant today.



(Photo by Columbia Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)

A League of Their Own (1992) 81% #29The story of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League is one that deserves to be told and it’s Geena Davis‘ Dottie Hinson who grounds this fictional account. She’s a talented local player who becomes the star of the Rockford Peaches and it’s her quick thinking that brings publicity to the sport. When her decision to play in the World Series leads to a spectacular finish she also demonstrates a very human vulnerability making her a strong but relatable heroine.

Pride & Prejudice (2005) 87% #30Jane Austen’s classic heroine Elizabeth Bennet jumps off the page in the 2005 film starring Keira Knightley who gives audiences an intelligent down-to-Earth sometimes literally dirty but uncompromisingly steadfast leading lady.



(Photo by Everett Collection)

Legally Blonde (2001) 71% #31Never underestimate a sorority girl. They are organized and they know how to get what the want. In the case of Elle Woods she goes after her law school goals with a smile on her face a spring in her step and an impeccably coordinated wardrobe. Reese Witherspoon is impossibly adorable in the role with a potent combination of smarts and heart to shut down the naysayers who are foolish enough to judge her simply by her looks.

Edge of Tomorrow (2014) 91% #32Talk brashly and carry a big sword. As Tom Cruise’s character unravels a complex time travel sci-fi story a constant in his fluctuating world is Rita Vrataski aka the killer Angel of Verdun. But Emily Blunt gives life to Rita beyond burgeoning love interest. She takes the lead and makes the movie just as much her’s.

Captain Marvel (2019) 79% #33When Nick Fury sent that mysterious intergalactic text message right before disappearing into dust at the end of Avengers: Infinity War eager fans knew what was in store. As played by Brie Larson Captain Marvel is one of the most powerful superheroes in the MCU — if not THE most powerful — and she’s in such high demand that she spends most of her time battling evil on other planets. She shows up when it counts though and she can rock a mowhawk like nobody’s business.

Burruss owns Clearlake Outdoors Bait & Tackle Shop

California's previous black crappie record was 4 pounds 1 ounce

As we replace the subzero temperatures experienced across the Midwest last week with more moderate weather this week spring crappie fishing again comes to mind.

But while anglers in the middle of the country were drilling holes in the ice in search of panfish and other species last week — YouTube fishing star Alex Peric of the Googan Squad was even featured catching a bass through the ice in Frisco Texas during a live interview on the BBC (https://youtu.be/JF8sChjzMAk) — one man in California had his sights set on landing a state-record crappie.

Dave Burruss of Lakeport Calif. appears to have broken that record after hooking into a monstrous 4-pound 5.44-ounce black crappie Feb. 17 on Clear Lake where he owns and operates Clearlake Outdoors Bait & Tackle Shop.

The record is pending certification with the previous state-best black crappie tipping the scales at 4 pounds 1 ounce — caught on New Hogan Lake by Wilma Honey in 1975.

Burruss said he was using his live-scan sonar in search of bass and saw a few larger fish on the screen. The three fish were suspended at 6 to 10 feet deep in 25 feet of water and ended up being massive crappie rather than bass as he thought.

“I saw the fish on Garmin LiveScope before I made the catch” Burruss told The Topeka Capital-Journal. “It was caught on a Coolbaits Underspin with a 4-inch Keitech Easy Shiner swimbait. Catching two-pound crappie on this lake is common three-pounders are rare. Four-pounders different story.”

Burruss' crappie measured 17 3/4 inches in length with a 16-inch girth. While he was thrilled by the catch he says bass will remain his bread and butter.

“Very happy to catch the record but I am huge largemouth bass fisherman and that will stay my main focus” Burruss said. “Crappie fishing is my favorite in January and February on Clear Lake. You can catch up to 100 crappie a day and all being 1 to 2.5 pounds.”

This fish is headed to the biologist at Clear Lake to learn more about its age and genetics. He said it will then be mounted and put in his store for people to come see up close.

Those wishing to see the potential new record in person and peruse his wares can visit his Clearlake Outdoors Bait & Tackle Shop at 96 Soda Bay Road in Lakeport Calif. For more information on the store visit https://clearlakeoutdoors.com/ or call 707-262-5852.

On the ice

But just because it was cold that doesn’t mean the fish weren’t biting.

Madison’s Rob McDonald and his sons Mason 10 and Carver 7 hit up an area farm pond to do some ice fishing this past week finding a thick layer of ice that ranged from 8 to 10 inches on top of the water.

The trio found a good haul of crappie while fishing with tungsten jigs and Carver even caught himself a 24-inch largemouth bass on a 3-inch shiner long enough to qualify for a Kansas Master Angler award.

“Ice fishing is a lot of fun because you’re right over the fish and you never know what you’re going to catch” Carver said.

“We were all surprised and excited when this big fish showed up in the hole” Rob McDonald added.

It was good to see all three of them wear ice picks around their neck for safety. Ice picks can help anglers who fall through the ice pull themselves out.

Sadly two Missouri fishermen drowned in southeast Kansas this week while fishing on a striped mine put as temperatures jumped back up into the 70s on Tuesday.

The bodies of Robert Sleep 70 and Stephen LeMasters 71 both of Joplin Mo. were recovered Wednesday at Mined Wildlife Land No. 40 northwest of Columbus.

Stay safe out there folks and I look forward to seeing your pre-spawn fishing pictures over the next few months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbHVld2Fsay5jb20vd3Jpc3QtcGFpbi1za2luLWlzc3Vlcy13ZWFyYWJsZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Skin Issues From Wearables Is A Big Problem Needing A Fix ASAP,"Wrist pain and skin issues from smartwatches and other wearables are not new. Even Apple Watch users have complained of wrist pain and skin problems in the past and now some Apple Watch Series 4 users are joining the earlier complaint thread with similar issues.

Apple Watch blamed for wrist pain and skin issues

Wrist pain and skin problems caused by the Apple Watch date back to 2015 when the company launched its first-generation smartwatch. The issue was highlighted in Apple Watch reviews as well. In response to complaints at the time Apple suggested the issues could be due to the way users were wearing the watch.

“Wearing your Apple Watch with the right fit — not too tight not too loose and with room for your skin to breathe — will keep you comfortable and let the sensors do their jobs” Apple said on its website.

Despite Apple’s advice some Apple Watch users including with Series 4 models are still facing the same problem. One lengthy thread taking up almost 10 pages on Apple’s official forum is filled with complaints and comments from affected users. The thread was started by an Apple Watch Series 3 user but some of the most recent complaints are from Series 4 users noted tech site Piunikaweb.

“Same thing! Love the watch but the shooting pain in the wrist and down the pinky finger can get unbearable at times. In watch series 2 I had the same thing so i started wearing the watch a little looser – with series 4 I get that same feeling regardless of how loose the band is” one user said.

Another Apple Watch Series 4 user stated that he and his wife faced “same neuropathic pain with numbness and tingling on the side I wear these smart watches.” The user said he had tried all major brands — Apple Watch Fitbit and Garmin watches — but the issue remains the same with all.

Skin issues from smartwatches and other wearables not brand-specific

The last Apple Watch user we talked about might actually be speaking the real truth as users of other wearable brands have reported similar issues. It may be that skin issues from smartwatches and other wearables are not brand-specific and they could be due to the design and sensors featured in smart gadgets.

Like the Apple Watch Fitbit users have also been complaining of skin and pain for years now. One of the threads started in 2015 on the company’s official forum is filled with comments and complaints about pain and skin issues from the wearable.

“I stopped wearing it months ago and I have to take anti-inflammatories. I couldn’t even lift a cup of coffee. My pain is not as bad I’m requesting physical therapy at this point. I know I didn’t have this pain prior to wearing this Fitbit” one affected user said.

However like Apple a moderator on the Fitbit forum pinned the blame on “improper use” of wristband trackers. The moderator also suggested going through the company’s guidelines on the “proper placement” of the tracker. Further the moderator said if users continue to experience the issue even after following the instructions they must see a doctor.

Based on this response from the moderator it can be assumed that the company is not going to do anything about it so affected users would eventually have to visit the doctor. It’s kind of interesting and funny as avoiding doctors could have been one of your intentions in buying the fitness tracker which helps you take care of your health.

Samsung’s latest Galaxy Watch has also been blamed for skin rashes burns and even blisters. Again skin issues from smartwatches and other wearables are not a new problem as users have also faced similar problems with the Gear S3/S3 Frontier and Gear Sport smartwatches as well.

Why are wearable makers quiet?

A question that arises now is why despite the growing number of complaints about pain and skin issues from smartwatches and other wearables companies are remaining silent. There can be two reasons for this.

First these companies believe their products are perfect and the problem is users who are wearing it the wrong way or are allergic to it. The second could be that such issues are part-and-parcel of smart wearables and there is nothing that can be done. If that’s the case then wearable makers must know it so they will remain silent on the matter.

It is very important to address such issues with these wearables soon because going ahead these gadgets could become even more important or even an inseparable part of our lives considering the healthcare benefits they have to offer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZ2Vla2N1bHR1cmUuY28vd2F0Y2gtYW1vbmctdXMtYXMtYS1oeXBlci1yZWFsaXN0aWMtYWxpZW4taW5zcGlyZWQtc2NpLWZpLWhvcnJvci1tb3ZpZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch Among Us As A Hyper-Realistic Alien-Inspired Sci-Fi Horror Movie,"Among Us the insanely popular indie game that took the work by storm is now re-imagined as a 3-part hyper-realistic 3D animation.

This is where we shine a light on two Webtoons we are thoroughly enjoying. These stories have had us captivated chapter after chapter each week and we couldn’t pass up sharing them with you! So grab your favorite snacks an electronic device and settle into these sensational stories.

Disclaimer: This post features possible spoilers for Witch Hunt and Annarasumanara. Both series are apart of Webtoon’s Daily Pass Program. This allows readers to catch up on previously completed Webtoons by releasing one chapter for free every day. Check here to learn more about the program!

Witch Hunt

In SSO Park‘s Witch Hunt Gamin swaps schools quite often so he knows how to blend in with the kids. But Garmin has his own little secret. He happens to be a bit handsy with other people’s things. But what happens when he sees something he shouldn’t have? Izzy has been trying to lay low ever since she and her kind have started to be hunted. Don’t talk to anyone don’t make any friends and don’t be seen. Easy right? When Garmin learns her secret and she gives him the opportunity to understand her it nearly causes her death. She goes back into hiding only to meet up with him again four years later. But this time it appears they are both being hunted.

Witch Hunt is a supernatural webtoon that dives into the genres of mystery and suspense. Neither Garmin nor Izzy are extremely likeable in the beginning with Garmin stealing everyone’s things and Izzy being a recluse but over the series you grow to love them. Similar to the characters the story comes off as simple at first. But the further SSO Park’s story expands the more it becomes clear how much depth this Webtoon has. This is a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat as you try and piece together what is really going on. In the end you will question the true intentions of one’s love and how they affected the overall story within Witch Hunt.

Witch Hunt has ended and the entire Webtoon can be read here.

Annarasumanara

Don’t let the title intimidated you! Ilkwon Ha‘s Annarasumanara may sound like a mouthful to say but the story is worth reading over and over. Yoon Ai a girl struggling to feed her and her sister dreams of a life where she becomes a magician. But in reality she’s just a high school student who can’t afford new socks. While chasing down a bit of money that got away she finds herself at an abandoned amusement park that is home to a real magician. When she comes face to face with him he simply asks her “Do you believe in magic?” before she runs away. But what happens if she decides to follow her true dream? Will he be able to help her?

Yoon Ai only wants to be happy. She was forced to grow up prematurely and let go of her dream to be a magician. This isn’t a sugary love story or an action or suspense story. It is a story about change poverty expectations and defying the rules of our societies. Annarasumanara shows us what it is like to lose the innocence of childhood along with the pressures of school and dealing with others’ prejudice and jealousy. This is a wonderful blend of fantasy and reality that work together to give us an insightful tale. And if the story isn’t enough to win you over Ilkwon Ha’s art style is simply beautiful. It focuses on a black grey and white color scheme with pops of color and realistic art at times.

Annarasumanara has ended and the entire Webtoon can be read here.",,,

Over the nearly 46 seasons the Capitals have been in the league the two Eastern Conference teams have met multiple times during the regular season and playoffs. This latest Retro Recap recalls a game from late February 1985.

Going into the game on February 28 the Capitals had a record of 37-16-9 and were battling with the Philadelphia Flyers for the Patrick Division lead with the New York Islanders also in the mix.

The Rangers were having a down season compared to the prior year and were going into the game with a record of 20-31-9. They had just fired Head Coach Herb Brooks the previous month and replaced him with Craig Patrick.

The goalie matchup that night was Pat Riggin for the Caps against John Vanbiesbrouck for the Rangers. The 1984-85 season was Vanbiesbrouck’s rookie season but he had already established himself as an NHL regular. He would be a fixture for the team through the 1992-93 season.

Rod Langway the Caps’ star defenseman was absent from the game due to the flu.

First Period

The game was scoreless until just under eight minutes into the contest. Defenseman Willie Huber of the Rangers pressed his way into the left circle and sent a slapshot past goalie Riggin for his third goal of the season getting assists from Dan Maloney and Mike Rogers.

At 10:46 Tom Laidlaw took a tripping penalty to put the Capitals on the power play however the Caps couldn’t take advantage. But a minute after the power play expired the Caps tied the score at 1-1 when Scott Stevens scored his sixteenth goal of the season getting assists from Bobby Gould and Dean Evason.

With four seconds left in the period Barry Beck the Rangers’ Captain at the time collided with Gaetan Duchesne along the boards and suffered a severe gash under his right eye that required 30 stitches. Beck was taken to Lenox Hill Hospital for treatment.

Second Period

The second period was a rather chippy period that was full of penalties and full of goals. At 5:29 Willie Huber cross checked one of the Caps to earn a trip to the penalty box. Nearly 30 seconds later Mike Gartner scored his 40th goal of the season on the ensuing power play. He was assisted by Scott Stevens and Craig Laughlin. The Caps now had a 2-1 lead.

Over a minute later at 7:19 Bengt Gustafsson added his seventh goal of the season which was unassisted. The Caps now led 3-1.

However the lead didn’t last through the period. At 12:33 Mike Gartner was penalized for hooking and Ron Greschner scored his thirteenth goal of the season on the resulting power play. He was assisted by Mark Pavelich and Reijo Ruotsalainen. Less than three minutes later at 16:12 Anders Hedberg tied the game for the Rangers with his fourteenth goal of the season. He was assisted by James Patrick.

At 17:16 Robbie Ftorek of the Rangers and Bobby Gould earned matching slashing penalties setting up a 4 on 4 situation. Just 7 seconds later Grant Ledyard tripped one of the Caps and was penalized which put the Caps on a 4 on 3 power play. At 18:05 Mike McEwen shot the puck from just above the left circle which travelled between the legs of defenseman James Patrick and finally between the wide-opened legs of Vanbiesbrouck to put the Caps ahead 4-3. That was the score going into second intermission.

Third Period

The first half of the final period was relatively quiet. But then Ron Greschner earned a tripping penalty at 9:38 which put the Caps on the power play. On this power play Mike Gartner scored his second goal of the game and his 41st goal of the year for an insurance goal. He got assists from Larry Murphy and Bobby Carpenter. The Caps now led 5-3.

It turned out the Caps needed that particular insurance goal. At 17:39 Mike Rogers scored his 22nd goal of the season for the Rangers to narrow the gap to 5-4. George McPhee who later became the Capitals’ General Manager and Ron Greschner had the assists.

The Caps held on to win the game 5-4 improving their record to 38-16-9. They had pulled ahead of the Philadelphia Flyers who had lost 6-1 to the Boston Bruins that same day and were now in first place.

Aftermath

Since that game the Caps went 8-9-0 to finish in second place in the Patrick Division and made the playoffs for their second consecutive season. They had the same number of standings points as they did the prior season with 101 points but two less wins and four more ties.

The Flyers lost their next two games after losing to the Bruins on February 28. But then the Flyers got really hot. They lost just one game for the remainder of the regular season which included two straight games against the Caps in early March.

The Caps met the New York Islanders in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs and were eliminated in five games. The Flyers won the first three rounds of their playoffs and went on to meet the Edmonton Oilers in the Stanley Cup Final where they lost.

The game of February 28 placed the Caps in first place in the division but in the end it was a lead they could not hold for the rest of the year.

Gartner estimates that by 2022 40% of AI/ML models will be trained on synthetic data. [1]

Indeed synthetic data is more and more popular — I see this every day working at a synthetic data company. If you feel like it’s time for you to pick up some synthetic data skills please read on. I will tell you about the basics and introduce you to a cool open-source tool you will find handy going forward. Let’s start!

So the basics. Synthetic data is created with a synthetic data generator. A synthetic data generator or synthesizer takes its so-called input or target data and returns output or synthetic data containing the same schema and statistical relationships as the input or target data.

Synthetic data generators can range from trivial to complex. A trivial example would be returning a shuffled sample of the target data. This is highly accurate but violates privacy as it is a direct copy of the target data. A complex example would be a deep neural network. In this case we trade off some accuracy for privacy protection.

Making synthetic data is easier than ever with research institutions continually developing new algorithms but how do we decide which generator is the best?

Best practices for picking a synthetic data generator

Typical ways to measure quality can range from looking at summary statistics or using the synthetic data in a downstream machine learning task. Unfortunately these methods only measure how well synthetic data mirrors the target data. But having too high accuracy can also come with serious consequences in where the synthetic data copies large parts of the original data. A key benefit of synthetic data is the privacy protection of all individuals in the original data. Thus we want to include how well our generator preserves privacy in our quality measurement.

There is no shortage of tools or how-to-guides on creating synthetic data but very little on how exactly to measure the utility/privacy aspect of the synthetic data. One such resource is SDGym — from MIT Data to AI Lab. However we found that we wanted more features than what the library offered so we created the Virtual Data Lab.

Introducing the Virtual Data Lab

VDL is a python framework to benchmark sequential synthetic data generators in terms of accuracy and privacy.

We wanted it to:

Work with pandas (Python’s dataframe library)

Use any possible target data source for generation

Provide a common interface to add new synthesizers

Create dummy data filled with randomly generated numeric types and categorical types

Work with sequential data

Have intuitive privacy metrics

Provide a set of real-world datasets to benchmark on

My team at MOSTLY AI frequently uses Virtual Data Lab for rapid evaluation of modifications to our synthetic data generator. It has empowered us to have a standardized testing analysis and as a result saving us countless hours crafting an ad-hoc single-use report. Along those lines a use case for Virtual Data Lab could be testing various synthetic data generators for a downstream machine learning task. Rather than deploy several expensive to train machine learning models with several different synthetic datasets VDL can be used as a proxy for selecting the dataset closest to the original without being too close.

What’s inside?

In the current release there are three different synthesizers included. Two of the three synthesizers are trivial intended to be a baseline for the metrics. One synthesizer is a simple variational autoencoder implemented in PyTorch. You can write your own synthesizer by following these instructions.

Next we move on to accuracy and privacy metrics. For a deeper dive please check the readme.md

Accuracy is measured by taking the difference in empirical distributions across columns. We summarize the errors by either MAX Error or L1 Distance/Sum (L1D). MAX Error tells us what is the largest error we saw across the datasets whereas L1D provides an overall score of how much error we saw. Looking at empirical distributions gives us confidence in how well the synthetic data captured statistical trends from the target data. Distribution measurement is also used by NIST in their synthetic data challenge.

Privacy is measured by splitting the target data into a reference set and holdout set.

A sample is taken without replacement from the synthetic data that is the same size as the holdout set. Both holdout sets are compared to the reference set with two nearest neighbor based calculations.

The Distance to Closest Record (DCR) measures the distance between a point in the holdout set and a point in the reference set. Bad synthetic data is when the original target data is perturbed by noise. The DCR is intended to capture such scenarios.

NNDR Visualized: Image by Author

The Nearest Neighbor Distance Ratio (NNDR) measures the distance of a holdout point’s first neighbor and second neighbor. The NNDR of a point can range from 0 to 1. A value close to 1 implies that the point is likely to be in a cluster. A value close to 0 implies that the point is likely to be close to an outlier. We calculate the NNDR for every point pair between the target and holdout set to obtain a NNDR distribution. Ideally we want the synthetic NNDR distribution to match the target NNDR distribution. By testing for discrepancies therein we can ensure that the synthetic data is not closer to the training points than we would expect based on a holdout.

These two privacy metrics were designed to provide privacy guarantees on datasets. We can compare these two metrics to differential privacy a popular mathematical limit on the amount of privacy loss. Differentially private mechanisms have to be built in the algorithm’s design. However not all synthetic data generators need to have differential privacy to generate high-quality and private data. By using these two metrics we gain the ability to compare on an even playing field differentially private synthetic data generators to non differentially private synthetic data generators.

You also don’t need to write any code to generate synthetic data. At MOSTLY AI we’ve released a community edition of our product. Synthesizing data is as easy as dragging and dropping your original data into your browser.

Code Demo

The code is also available in a Google Colab notebook.

Using FlatAutoEncoderSynthesizer to generate synthetic data

And there you have it! Generating synthetic data and comparing it to the original synthetic data all in less than 5 lines of code.

Analyzing the results

Interpreting the results is just as easy. Here we look at the generated comparison results for the IdentitySynthesizer and FlatAutoEncoderSynthesizer on the cdnow dataset provided in VDL. This table was created with the virtualdatalab.benchmark.benchmark function. An example of this function in action with more synthesizers + datasets can be found in this Google Colab notebook.

Summary Table : Image by Author

All columns labeled with MAX or L1D are measures of error. A high accuracy corresponds to low values across these columns. We notice that the IdentitySynthesizer has values close to 0. This is no surprise as the IdentitySynthesizer simply returns splits of the target data. However that is also precisely the reason why it failed both privacy tests. In contrast the FlatAutoEncoderSynthesizer has slightly worse error but passed both tests. This makes sense as the FlatAutoEncoderSynthesizer is generating completely new data but maintains a statistical relationship with the target data.

Your criteria of whether or not to use a particular synthetic data generator technique will be based on which metrics are the most important to you. We recommend if you’re optimizing for privacy then be wary of any synthetic data generator method failing the privacy tests.

The release of former General Electric (GE 0.48%) CEO Jeff Immelt's book Hot Seat is naturally drawing attention to the company and GE's future under current CEO Larry Culp. One of the key questions it raises is the role of luck in management. To be fair Immelt has been putting much of the blame for GE's downfall on himself but he's also acknowledging the unfortunate headwinds he suffered during his 2001-2017 tenure. Let's take a look at what happened and more importantly what it means for GE investors right now.

A troubled beginning

Immelt certainly had his unfair share of bad luck as CEO of GE. After inheriting a sprawling empire of businesses ranging from NBC household appliances and plastics to gas turbines aircraft engines and a huge finance arm GE Capital Immelt was immediately hit by the impact of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on aviation.

Moreover the 2000-2010 decade proved to be a moderate one for spending on power and GE Plastics found itself suffering cost increases due to the surge in the price of oil over the decade. At the same time GE's lack of significant oil and gas business meant it missed out on the boom.

Immelt spent much of his first decade trying to grow the financing arm of the business in order to generate the earnings necessary to support investment in the industrial businesses. History and specifically the 2008 financial crisis would not be kind in assessing the wisdom of that strategy and GE took another major hit during the financial crisis.

Moreover the long-term negative ramifications of bulking up GE Capital with unfavorable deals would be felt for years afterwards. For example in 2018 (Immelt left the previous year) GE was forced to take a $6.2 billion charge relating to its insurance portfolio.

After the financial crisis

It gets worse. Turning to the industrial side. Immelt spent the period recovering from the financial crisis by disposing of non-core businesses and pivoting the company toward its industrial businesses.To his credit Immelt was an early adopter of digital technology and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). One of his big ideas was to grow GE's industrial scale in specific businesses apply GE's IIoT solutions and offer customers more productive solutions.

It was a rather simple and compelling big-picture strategy. Industrial businesses in GE's wheelhouse grow scale then sprinkle on the magic dust of IIoT from GE Digital (the company's IIoT business) and watch as GE generates more profitability from the assets.

Horrible acquisitions

Unfortunately it didn't work and it's only in 2021 that GE Digital is set to start generating profit.

Having been underexposed to the rising price of oil in the previous decade Immelt decided to acquire a slew of oil and gas equipment and services companies through the 2010-2017 period. Wellstream (a flexible pipemaker) the well support division of John Wood Group Lufkin Industries (artificial lift technology) and the reciprocating compression division of Cameron International were bought in a multi-billion dollar flurry of activity from 2010-2014. All of it lead to the buyout of Baker Hughes in 2017. Now GE definitely had scale in oil and gas but it also had a major slump in the price of oil to contend with.

It's easy to criticize Immelt for buying these businesses but whomsoever predicted the collapse in oil prices from 2014 to 2020 has the right to cast the first stone.

It gets worse. At the same time as GE was buying oil businesses Immelt oversaw the disastrous acquisition of Alstom's power and grid business for 12.35 billion euros in 2015. Here again the logic of adding scale in order to attach GE's digital capability made sense. Moreover before reaching for stones readers should note that Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries also bid for Alstom's assets. Unfortunately the market for heavy-duty gas turbines would fall by half from 2015-2020.

It all resulted in Immelt spending the remainder of his tenure in 2017 stubbornly tied to the mast of guiding toward $2 in EPS by the end of 2018. The ship the mast and the EPS guidance went down with Immelt in 2017.

So was it all because of bad luck?

The harder you practice the luckier you get

Aside from Immelt's admission of his own failures at GE the strongest argument against pinning the blame on luck is that GE has been unlucky since Immelt left as well. However Culp is doing an admirable job under far worse circumstances than Immelt had at his outset in building a resilient company.

I have two examples for you. The sale of the biopharma business to Culp's former company Danaher (DHR 0.55%) looked like a great deal for Danaher at the end of 2019 but it now looks like a fantastic one after COVID-19 boosted its sales. While GE needed the cash from the biopharma sale it probably would have got a much better price for it after the pandemic hit.

Second the collapse in air travel has crushed earnings at GE's most profitable business aircraft engines and aftermarket sales and service for engines.

That said GE's stock price somehow sits 8% higher than when Culp took over in October 2018 and the company looks positioned to embark on a multi-year recovery in 2021. Much of this is a result of Culp's actions to reduce debt the selling off of non-core assets and the focus on lean management techniques to generate every bit of margin improvement he can out of GE's businesses.

Meanwhile GE is now building a recent history of under-promising and over-delivering on guidance. Unlike Immelt Culp is not betting the farm on big-picture strategic bets that could go wrong if end-market circumstances change.

There's no luck in all of that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL25ld3MvY2hpbmEvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTIzMzg5L3VzLWNoYXJnZXMtaG9uZy1rb25nLWJhc2VkLWJ1c2luZXNzbWFuLXdpbnNtYW4tbmctc3RlYWxpbmctdHJhZGUtc2VjcmV0c9IBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL25ld3MvY2hpbmEvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTIzMzg5L3VzLWNoYXJnZXMtaG9uZy1rb25nLWJhc2VkLWJ1c2luZXNzbWFuLXdpbnNtYW4tbmctc3RlYWxpbmctdHJhZGUtc2VjcmV0cw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US charges Hong Kong-based businessman with stealing trade secrets from GE,"Ng 64 who lives in Hong Kong and has not been arrested faces up to 10 years in jail and a fine of US$250000 the Justice Department said.

Chi Lung Winsman Ng along with an unnamed co-conspirator stole proprietary semiconductor technology in order to set up a competing company on the mainland according to the indictment.

A Chinese businessman based in Hong Kong has been indicted for allegedly stealing millions of dollars’ worth of trade secrets from General Electric the US Justice Department announced on Friday.

It is not clear that the US will be able to apprehend him however given that Washington suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong in August after Beijing imposed the national security law.

“Ng conspired to steal valuable and sensitive technology from GE and produce it in China” said Thomas Relford a special agent with the FBI’s Albany field office. “Theft of trade secrets is a constant and dangerous threat to our American companies.”

Ng planned the alleged theft along with a GE engineer who had worked with the company for over seven years to steal technology called MOSFET – for metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor – and other proprietary information the agency said. It was not clear why the engineer called “co-conspirator No 1” was not identified.

MOSFET is a type of transistor often made of silicon and commonly used in automobile electronics including the power converters used in electronic vehicles. The GE secrets were allegedly incorporated into PowerPoint presentations as part of a business plan shopped to prospective investors.

The Justice Department said that the pair told potential investors their business could be profitable within three years and that their start-up company had tangible and intangible assets worth an estimated US$100 million. Ng and the GE engineer were seeking some US$30 million in exchange for shares in their start-up venture.

According to a LinkedIn profile of someone with the same name Ng has been a vice-president of Tianyu Semiconductor Technology based in Guangdong since 2015. He describes himself as a “strategic thinker with strong leadership skills” possessing “strong business acumen” and a “passion to succeed”.

The Justice Department said it had no evidence that any technology was actually transferred to China.

In 2018 the agency working with the FBI launched a “China Initiative” aimed at countering the theft of trade secrets and national intelligence from companies universities and government agencies. Since then it claims that it has opened a new case every 10 hours on average.

As Beijing’s wealth ambition and obsession with technological achievement have increased so too has its appetite and budget for acquiring foreign technology whether through legitimate or illegitimate means.

Advocacy groups have pushed for an end to the initiative however arguing that it unfairly targets Asian-Americans and sometimes produces indictments only to see cases quietly dropped a few months later.

According to the indictment Ng and the GE engineer tried to start a company to make and sell MOSFET transistors starting in March 2017. The led to a meeting in China in August 2017 in which they allegedly gave presentations to a Chinese investment company considering taking a stake in the start-up.

“Winsman Ng and his co-conspirators allegedly chose to steal what they lacked the time talent or money to create” Assistant Attorney General John Demers said in a statement. “The department will do all it can to disrupt this illegal and economically destructive conduct.”

Ng’s is the latest in a series of indictments of China-connected individuals alleged to have tried to steal technology from GE and other aerospace companies. In 2018 the Justice Department publicised the “unprecedented” extradition of an official with China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) for allegedly attempting to steal trade secrets from GE Aviation and other US aerospace companies after luring the suspect to Belgium.

Two weeks later the department indicted a group of 10 people allegedly led by MSS agents who tried to hack into the computer systems of a US company and a French company that manufacture turbofan engine parts.

""I played almost all the school sports and my family showed Tennessee Walking Horses on weekends. I was really active"" she says. ""I'm competitive by nature and that's reflected in my career path – not settling for 'no' having confidence that I'll figure it out and get it done.""

That's part of the reason Chattanooga orthodontist Keith Dressler named Ford to serve as president and chief product officer of Rhinogram the health care technology company he founded in 2017.

""In a startup you're going to have obstacles"" Dressler says. ""You have to figure out how you get over around or through those obstacles. Kathy has that can-do mindset and is focused on the goal - getting where we want to be and not letting anything stop us.""

But it was far more than Ford's competitive bent that moved Dressler to hire her. Her resumé is dotted with multiple executive roles and stops at Siemens Healthcare and GE Healthcare. Ford also sits on the board of Women Business Leaders of the U.S. Health Care Industry Foundation.

""We're going to be a global company"" Dressler says of Rhinogram ""so you want someone with global experience and that's not easy to find.

""Kathy is a well-recognized global health care executive who's delivered more than 100 impactful solutions to the market. She understands what's required and she's done it"" he says.

And Ford has done every bit of it without a college degree.

""My father was a CEO in the Bay Area"" she says. ""I looked up to him and wanted to climb the corporate ladder as he did. I thought sales would be a great place to spend my career.""

Ford says she chose to pursue a corporate opportunity that came her way while she was an undergraduate. Her initial plan was to go to night school but that plan yielded to her career progress.

""At this stage I've had fantastic opportunities and what I've learned over the years well surpasses what I'd have learned in school"" she says. ""I have no regrets.""

The lack of a degree should have kept Ford from getting her job at GE – but it didn't.

""They had a very strict policy"" she says ""but my boss got special approval.""

It was at GE that Ford not yet 30 at the time was tapped to take part in the company's leadership training institute at Crotonville New York about an hour north of New York City.

""If you're picked to go you're challenged in a number of ways to see if you could be a future leader for a GE business"" she says. ""It's very intensive and you're assessed by other GE CEOs.""

Staff Photo by Matt Hamilton / Under the leadership of Kathy Ford president and chief product officer health care technology company Rhinogram has grown to serve 5.5 million patients increased revenue 200 percent year-over-year and improved client retention from 95 percent to 99.5 percent.



Ford says that before her Crotonville experience she was more focused on execution than the ""social intel"" side of business. It was in that arena she says that she learned a ""career-changing"" lesson.

""I got feedback about how I could interact with people in a more holistic way"" she says. ""You can be the smartest person in the room but if you're not effective at bringing people along if you're not sensitive to how other people learn you'll have unnecessary challenges.

""It was really meaningful and helped shape my ability to lead much bigger teams in many different countries and with many different sensitivities"" she says.

The team Ford leads at Rhinogram has certainly had a good run since she came on board in mid-2018. The Chattanooga-based company which helps individuals use text messages to access health care was named Startup of the Year and High-Growth Company of the Year during Chattanooga's Startup Week in October 2020.

""We started with hundreds of thousands of patients accessing care through our platform and we're up now to 5.5 million"" she says. ""Our revenue is up 200 percent year to year and we've improved client retention from 95 percent to 99.5 percent.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8veW91cnN0b3J5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyL3dpbm5lcnMtYW1hem9uLWFpLWNvbmNsYXZlLTIwMjEtZW50ZXJwcmlzZS1haS1hd2FyZHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the winners of the Amazon AI Conclave 2021 Enterprise AI Awards,"The enterprise world has undergone a tremendous shift in the past decade largely due to the impact brought about by technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).

Nevertheless we have to remember the Gen II HEMI was the one that earned this label a place in the velocity hall of fame and the rendering we have here makes for a digital tribute to the infamous 426 c.i. (7-liter) tower of power.

The pixel portrait not only showcases a classic Challenger gifted with a 426 featuring a supercharger for days but also gives the motor a chance to be featured in other digital builds of the sort.That's because the said V8 is a fresh 3D model coming from an artist named Timothy Adry Emmanuel who constantly makes efforts to bring the muscle culture to our screens.And here's the digital master explaining his brewing operation in an Instagram post : ""I had been looking for this engine setup online and couldn't find it so I decided to build it myself""The HEMI sports a billet roots-style blower from Vintage Dragsters while being fed by 4150 Holley-style dual carburetors with the list of custom bits also including plenty of other hardware as detailed in the Instagram post at the bottom of the story.As for the Mopar machine wrapped around that monster of an engine we're looking at the original 1970 Challenger. To cope with the extra bang the Dodge now sits a bit closer to the road while riding on chrome custom wheels. Oh and let's not forget the extended air dam up front.It was February 1964 when Chrysler introduced the 426 HEMI V8 at the Daytona 500 with this being destined for racing crews running in the NASCAR Grand National series under the Dodge and Plymouth banners. And the release of the monstrous motor helped leave the poor motorsport results of the past way behind with the said racing event seeing 426-powered cars occupying all three spots on the podium.Sure the history of the hemispherical-head engine hadn't started with Chrysler while the the company's Gen I HEMI which had been offered in the 1950s was eventually replaced by the wedged-head V8. However from that point in 1964 on it didn't take much for the HEMI engine to become a go-fast legend on racetracks drag strips and public roads.Oh and did we mention the 426 revival that is the blower-equipped Hellephant crate engine animating insane builds these days?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkZ2VtaWRkbGVlYXN0LmNvbS9zb2Z0d2FyZS85NjI0NS1xYXRhci1yb2xscy1vdXQtaW50ZWdyYXRlZC1kaWdpdGFsLXRheC1hZG1pbmlzdHJhdGlvbi1zeXN0ZW0tb24tc2FwLXM0aGFuYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qatar rolls out integrated digital tax administration system on SAP S/4HANA,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.edgemiddleeast.com/software/96245-qatar-rolls-out-integrated-digital-tax-administration-system-on-sap-s4hana on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkZ2VtaWRkbGVlYXN0LmNvbS9zb2Z0d2FyZS85NjI0NS1xYXRhci1yb2xscy1vdXQtaW50ZWdyYXRlZC1kaWdpdGFsLXRheC1hZG1pbmlzdHJhdGlvbi1zeXN0ZW0tb24tc2FwLXM0aGFuYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFscGhyLmNvbS9tYWMtaGFuZG9mZi1ub3Qtd29ya2luZy1oZXJlcy1ob3ctdG8tZml4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mac Handoff Not Working - Here's How To Fix,"Beginning a project on your iPad and continuing on your Mac is an awesome thing – when it works.

How did this happen you ask? Well it's a long complicated story but basically it involves taking something that's supposed to do one thing and do it well like take off from the ground and fly really fast and adding stuff like being able to take off and land on an aircraft carrier or hover like a hummingbird.

That's why they call it the ""flying Swiss Army knife."" Have you ever tried to use one of the things? First of all you can't find the knife blade hidden as it is among scissors and screwdrivers and can openers and nose hair tweezers and nail files and pliers. The geniuses at the Pentagon decided they needed to replace the aging F-16 fighter and everybody wanted in on it.

The F-16 is what you would call the M1A1 airplane of U.S. forces. The Air Force currently has about 1450 of the planes with 700 of those in the active duty Air Force about 700 in the Air National Guard and 50 in the Reserves. General Dynamics has built about 4600 of them since the plane became operational in the mid-1970s and they are used by allied air forces all over the world. You fill them up with jet fuel push the starter button and take off. It will fly at twice the speed of sound it will carry 15 different bombs including two nuclear weapons it can shoot down enemy aircraft with five different varieties of air-to-air missiles it can knock out ground targets with four different air-to-ground missiles and it can carry two kinds of anti-ship missiles. The thing is an all-around killing machine.

The F-35 on the other hand can't fly at twice the speed of sound. In fact it comes with what amounts to a warning label on its control panel marking supersonic flight as ""for emergency use only."" So it's OK to fly the thing like a 737 but if you want to go really fast you have to ask permission which promises to work really really well in a dogfight. What are pilots going to do if they're being pursued by a supersonic enemy jet?

The F-35 will carry four different air-to-air missiles six air-to-ground missiles and one anti-ship missile but the problem is all of them have to be fired from the air and right now the F-35 isn't yet ""operational"" which means essentially that it's so unsafe to fly the damn things they spend most of their time parked.

Take the problem they have with switches. The developers of the F-35 decided to go with touchscreen switches rather than the physical ones used in other fighters like toggles or rocker switches. That would be nice if they worked but pilots report that the touchscreen switches don't function 20 percent of the time. So you're flying along and you want to drop your landing gear to land but your touchscreen decides ""not this time pal"" and refuses to work. How would you like to be driving your car and have your brakes decide not to work 20 percent of the time like say when you're approaching a red light at a major intersection?

But it gets worse. The heat coating on the engine's rotor blades is failing at a rate that leaves 5 to 6 percent of the F-35 fleet parked on the tarmac at any given time awaiting not just engine repairs but total replacement. Then there's the canopy. You know what a canopy is don't you? It's the clear bubble pilots look through so they can see to take off and land not to mention see other aircraft such as enemy aircraft. Well it seems F-35 canopies have decided to ""delaminate"" at inappropriate times making flying the things dangerous if not impossible. So many of them have failed that the Pentagon has had to fund an entirely new canopy manufacturer to make replacements.

There's also the problem with the plane's ""stealth"" capability which is compromised if you fly the thing too fast because the coating that makes the plane invisible to radar has a bad habit of peeling off making the planes completely visible to enemy radar.

But fear not Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. has come up with a solution. He announced last week that henceforth the Pentagon is going to treat the F-35 as the ""Ferrari"" of the U.S. combat air fleet. ""You don't drive your Ferrari to work every day you only drive it on Sundays. This is our 'high end' fighter we want to make sure we don't use it all for the low-end fight"" he said in a press conference on Feb. 17.

Got it. If an enemy decides to start a war on a Tuesday or Wednesday we'll just ""drive"" our aging F-16's so our precious F-35s can be left in the garage waiting for good weather on Sunday. I'm sure we can get everyone to sign up for the ""we'll only go to war on Sunday"" treaty.

The F-35 can be understood best as a na-na-na-na-na problem. Originally developed for the Air Force the minute the thing was on the drafting table the Navy and Marines started crying ""Hey what about us?"" To quiet the jealous fit being thrown by the other services the Pentagon agreed to turn the thing into the ""Swiss Army knife"" it has become.

A variant capable of taking off from and landing on carriers was promised to the Navy with bigger wings and a tail hook. Except the tail hook refused to work for the first two years it was tested meaning that every carrier landing had to take place in sight of land so the Navy F-35 could fly over to the coast and land safely on a runway.

The Marine variety had to be capable of vertical takeoff and landing because the Navy was jealous of its carriers and would only agree to allow the Marines to have mini-carriers with landing surfaces big enough for vertical use. That meant the Marine version had to be redesigned so it had a big flap under the engine to divert thrust so the thing could land on Marine ships. This meant the Marine version had added weight and space that would otherwise be used to carry weapons.

So you're a Marine and you're flying along in your F-35 and an enemy comes along and starts shooting at you and you shoot back and miss but you don't have another missile because where that missile should be is where your damn vertical landing flap is.

Maybe they should just issue F-35 pilots a bunch of flags to use when they take to the air and then they'd be ready for anything. Tail starts coming off because you went supersonic for too long? Fly your NO FAIR flag. Cockpit delaminating? Grab your JUST A MINUTE I can't see you flag. Engine rotor blades burning up? That would be the OOOPS can't dogfight right now I'm waiting on a replacement engine flag.

Not to worry pilots the Pentagon is on the problem and they have a solution. Brown says they're going back to the drawing board for a ""fifth generation-minus"" fighter jet meaning they want to come up with something that looks like and flies like and has the combat capabilities of the good old F-16. Only problem is if you use the F-35 project as a benchmark it will be two decades before the ""minus"" jet is operational. Until then guys have fun watching your F-35's gather dust on the tarmac while you continue to fly your F-16's which will be older than the average pilot's grandfather by the time the new plane is ready.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZncvbmFtZS9qYW1lcy1pc2hlZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD03MDc0Mzc20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Ishee Obituary (1936 - 2021) - Fort Worth TX - Star-Telegram,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/dfw/name/james-ishee-obituary?id=7074376 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZncvbmFtZS9qYW1lcy1pc2hlZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD03MDc0Mzc20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvY291bGQtdW5kZXJ3YXRlci1udWNsZWFyLXJhbWpldC1iZS11bHRpbWF0ZS13b25kZXItd2VhcG9uLTE3ODk0MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Could an Underwater Nuclear Ramjet Be the Ultimate Wonder Weapon?,"Here's What You Need to Remember: Cruising underwater by sucking in seawater passing it through the reactor and expelling it for thrust the SNR would make up to 100 knots submerged. Like boomers though the SNR would lurk quietly until summoned from the depths. Then the nuclear-powered “water-ramjet” would convert into a rocket as stored seawater heated to incandescence propelled the SNR out of the sea and into the sky.

Aerospace historian Scott Lowther has made a career and a place for himself in his field. Lowther’s steady stream of research illustration publication and design examines the remarkable conceptual fertility of aerospace firms chiefly American during the twentieth century. One concept Lowther recently turned up seems too incredible to be true but is attested to by two briefings and some basic data about a certain conceptual design for a new missile. The idea was straight out of British puppet TV shows like The Thunderbirds: a crewed submersible nuclear ramjet.

That mouthful refers to a concept Convair (now part of General Dynamics) developed as part of U.S. Air Force-funded work on nuclear-powered missiles. Until the “nuclear triad” of crewed bombers land-based ballistic missiles and ballistic missile submarines entered service at the dawn of the 1960s the American military-industrial complex explored many sometimes strange ways of fighting a nuclear war. These included forward-based seaplane strike forces air-launched ballistic missiles and atomic bazookas.

One idea pursued with vigor from 1957 to 1964 was the nuclear ramjet. In this elegantly simple machine a flow of supersonic air from the missile’s flight passes through a nuclear reactor core and is heated to ferocious temperatures. The resulting thrust from the expanding gas propels the missile forward sucking up more air as it flies.

A cruise missile could dispense with the heavy radiation shielding need to protect a crew from the reactor and achieve astonishing performance: 100000-mile ranges at Mach 3+ speeds week-long loiter times bomb payloads greater than a B-52’s. The project was called Supersonic Low-Altitude Missile or SLAM; the nuclear ramjet engine program was named Pluto.

Run out of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Pluto produced two prototype engines tested at the Nuclear Rocket Testing Station at Jackass Flats in the Nevada Test Site. The second prototype TORY IIC delivered some thirty tons of thrust at 560 megawatts of thermal power in 1964.

By then the advent of intercontinental ballistic missiles and the ballistic missile sub both obviated the need for a super-fast viciously radioactive flying weapons platform and SLAM was canceled. But along the way perhaps around 1960 or 1961 Convair considered taking the concept much further—to a crewed aircraft. And not just a crewed aircraft but a submersible one at that.

From briefing materials and diagrams Lowther was able to deduce the basic form and layout for the proposed vehicle. Roughly twice the size of the locomotive-sized SLAM the Submersible Nuclear Ramjet (SNR) would have been the size and shape of a space booster - long thick and narrowly finned—with an aircraft-style cockpit in the nose. The SNR had to be lengthy to keep the crew as far away from the nuclear reactor as possible. It also had to be big to accommodate its propulsion engineering payload and crew. With the magic of nuclear power however size didn’t matter.

This new weapon platform would require basic research of untold complexity from hydrodynamics to selecting materials for the aircraft’s proposed flight profile. Hull alloys reactor components avionics and life-support all had to cope with not only supersonic flight and high radiation but undersea operation as well. This was because the SNR was to begin its deterrent patrols as a submarine.

Cruising underwater by sucking in seawater passing it through the reactor and expelling it for thrust the SNR would make up to 100 knots submerged. Like boomers though the SNR would lurk quietly until summoned from the depths. Then the nuclear-powered “water-ramjet” would convert into a rocket as stored seawater heated to incandescence propelled the SNR out of the sea and into the sky.

Once aloft the crew would fly the SNR in a profile much like the SLAM: high-speed high altitude transoceanic transit then dropping to treetop level at Mach 4 for the attack run. As the crew piloted their doomsday weapon across the Soviet Union and conducted nuclear strikes the engine aboard their aircraft would spew lethal amounts of radiation and fallout while breaking eardrums and starting fires.

But since the SNR had pilots and weapons officers aboard it wouldn’t end its apocalyptic flight with a sacrificial crash. Instead the crew would fly their craft out of the target regions and back out to sea. There perhaps masked by fog or storm the SNR would switch over from ramjet to rocket power again and up-end itself to sit on its tail. The crew would ride the SNR’s exhaust and folding air brakes gently down to the water much as SpaceX boosters do today then into the ocean as empty tanks flooded with seawater. Hiding beneath the waves it would try to escape retribution for the ruin it rained.

One can only imagine the opposition such a vehicle would have encountered had development program ensued. At a time when environmental consciousness was rising the thought of routinely running nuclear ramjets and rockets undersea and overhead already gave pause. As Scott Lowther writes “[f]eeding salt water diatoms kelp fish and all the rest of the junk the ocean has to offer directly through a nuclear reactor seems a bit dubious.”

“Ambitious” seems an insufficient word for Convair’s wonder weapon but the San Diego company always had ambitious ideas and many of them panned out. Along with dreams like the Submerged Nuclear Ramjet and the Model 49 AAFSS Consolidated/Convair produced realities like the PBY Catalina the B-36 and the Atlas missile. California dreaming indeed.

The ministry signed a production contract for 32 mortars and carrier vehicles with General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS)-Mowag and the Swiss company RUAG AG. The value of the contract which also includes 12 trucks ammunition logistics equipment and the adaptation of 16 existing command vehicles is estimated to be approximately €367 million.

GDELS-Mowag will manufacture and supply the Pirhana IV 8x8 armored vehicles while RUAG will manufacture and supply the Cobra 120mm mortars.

According to the Swiss ministry since 2010 when its type 64/91 mortars were decommissioned the combat battalions have not had indirect fire support with 120mm and the ability to shoot steeply has been lost for the benefit of fighting in built-up areas. There is a need to close this gap and with the new 120mm mortar the ministry says the army will regain this capability and have a modern powerful and precise system that is well suited for use in built-up areas.

What's False However it is unclear how realistic this target is and the announcement does not concern GM's heavy-duty commercial trucks.

In late January 2021 General Motors CEO Mary Barra made several announcements concerning the company's desire to become carbon neutral by 2040. One of the boldest statements was that with an environmental group they worked ""to develop a shared vision of an all-electric future and an aspiration to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035.""

To achieve this goal ""more than half of GM’s capital spending and product development team will be devoted to electric and electric-autonomous vehicle programs"" according to Reuters. The company said that they planned to launch 30 new electric vehicles by 2025. Barry Rabe a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan told The Washington Post that “This is a very significant pivot … especially for such an iconic American institution” adding that ""This is more than just a quick flip of the dial … It’s a very wrenching transition.”

Some sectors will take longer than others Barry conceded in the announcement:

We ... recognize that the transition to a net-zero-carbon future will be harder for some than for others. We have a responsibility to our employees our partners our customers and the communities we serve to make this transition as easy as possible for everyone. Our employees have worked tirelessly to bring General Motors to this moment. They know better than anyone that for many of our customers making the transition to an EV is simply not possible right now – either because the appropriate vehicles do not exist or because access to charging is limited where they live and work.That is why it is critical we improve the fuel efficiency of the gas- and diesel-powered vehicles many people still rely on for their families and their livelihoods.

""Heavy-duty vehicles — box trucks tractor trailers utility trucks and some heavy pickup trucks — will continue to run on gasoline"" the company told The Washington Post.

Pontiac

Let’s go back in time a bit to the distant past: the year 2000.

Crossovers as we know them had pretty much only just been invented. They were often called “car-based SUVs.” Automakers started to realize that a lot of drivers didn’t necessarily care (or want) their SUV to have a big ladder chassis or body-on-frame design or large V8 or a heavy-duty four-wheel-drive system. Back then customers liked the sensible sedan and hatchback shapes that automakers were selling. But they also liked the “commanding” seating position and four-wheel-drive that truck-like SUVs offered. So more than one automaker figured “hey why not meet in the middle?”

Besides the original AMC Eagle you could say Toyota was the first—in 1994 the RAV4 based upon the Corolla chassis was released. A couple of months later Honda followed up with its Civic-based SUV the CR-V. Nissan also had one based on the B14 Sunny (Sentra) called the “Rasheen” but it never made it out of Japan. By and large these crossover SUVs were insanely popular almost overnight. All of a sudden it seemed like every automaker needed to have a car-based SUV in their lineup.

General Motors kind of tried to play this game and compete but from the offerings it gave us early on it’s clear the company didn’t really want to. GM half-assed it insisting that the S-10 Blazer of the 1990s was a competitor though it was bigger thirstier and more expensive. It also rebadged the Suzuki Sidekick as the Chevy and Geo Tracker but those cars weren’t as refined as the CR-V or RAV4. The Sidekick Vitara and Tracker were body-on-frame came with solid rear axles and were rear-wheel drive. Those attributes made them generally more capable off-road than the front-wheel-drive independent suspension car-based SUVs but most buyers didn’t care.

The head bosses at Toyota no doubt inspired by the strong sales of the RAV4 and the success of Mercedes-Benz’s brand new ML-Class crossover decided that maybe it should try another car-based sport-utility. What did Toyota do? Took the generally-good (and plenty boring) Camry chassis tweaked it a little put some big blobby tires on it and then sold it in two forms: as the Lexus RX in 1999 and Toyota Highlander in 2001. Those crossovers were immensely successful—in fact I think their success was a harbinger of what we now call the “sedanocoplyse.” Suddenly automakers realized they needed crossover SUVs more than sedans and now they outsell sedans and hatchbacks.

Well GM decided to take another swing at this whole everyday small-SUV idea. Here’s the thing though apparently it didn’t really want to spend money on any new sort of chassis development. So it used what it already had. In this case it meant it took its U-body minivan chassis used on the Chevrolet Venture and its four nearly identical siblings (pre-bailout GM was often a dark place) and cut a little bit out of the wheelbase.

The U-body wasn’t a great base to start on. The Venture vans had been known for playing second fiddle to the Dodge and Toyota vans through the late 1990s. Its design legacy was old; the U-body was first introduced in 1989 starting with the Chevrolet Lumina APV. GM claims that the whole U-body chassis was revised in 1997 but even still none of the vans using this chassis got particularly good reviews. Yeah we ain’t starting from a position of strength here.

Who could forget the legendary Oldsmobile Silhouette? GM

GM took that uncompetitive platform and reworked it into a competitor for the Toyota Highlander and Lexus RX both of which were based on a then-new and competitive chassis. The RX and Highlander are based on the Camry but aside from a handful of parts and an engine or two not much is shared between the vehicles.

The Aztek? Yeah it shares a lot with the Venture van. Honestly it shares too much with the Venture van which was its main problem because the Venture van wasn't good. The engine and transmission are the same sure I’ll let that slide. It doesn’t make any sense to create an entirely new powertrain for two models. And again Toyota did some similar sharing with great success with the Highlander and Lexus RX. But the suspension members that same solid rear axle on front-wheel-drive Azteks came directly from the Venture van. Even the width and way the windshield cowl comes together with the hood is nearly identical to the Venture van. In retrospect GM designers weren't happy about the Aztek being forced to use the U-body chassis either according to an interview with Car and Driver in 2014.

Sure the Aztek's unconventional bi-level front fascia grey plastic cladding and awkward rear don’t do the car any favors but is that really why the car is so ugly? Nah the Aztek’s horrible proportions are far more offensive. The Aztek has a tiny and short hood like a minivan. The Aztek is boxy and slab-sided like a minivan. The Aztek has tiny car-like wheels like a minivan. The crappy proportions are dictated by the minivan chassis it's using. Alterations to that chassis to create a better-proportioned vehicle would have been too much effort for this lazily designed car.

The Buick Rendezvous GM

Car and Driver said that its platform twin the Buick Rendezvous “looked and drove like a gussied up minivan.” Mhm because it was a gussied up minivan.

The 3.4-liter pushrod V6 engine and four-speed automatic worked together well enough but if you’ve driven a Chevrolet Venture or any of its umpteen platform clones you’ve driven an Aztek or Rendezvous. And if you haven't I'll spoil it for you they don't drive very nicely at all.

OK I know that I’ve spent most of this article slagging on the Aztek because it deserves it. It’s not a particularly reliable or well-made vehicle and it’s horribly ugly and indifferently engineered.

Still a lot of people like it including my mom. Her Rendezvous is whisper-quiet. One benefit of that minivan chassis is that the Aztek and Rendezvous’s interior packaging is sublime. I don’t think there’s any modern crossover that has as much usable space in the same footprint that the Aztek and Rendezvous have.

Also the tent option on the Aztek was objectively dope.

Pontiac

GM eventually did decide to dedicate real resources to creating an actual proper crossover and they introduced the Saturn VUE in 2002. Then again I think it cheaped out on that car too because they ended up ditching its own DOHC V6 and opted to use a Honda V6 engine for the VUE from 2003 onward. Oh and GM had to pay a hefty settlement for the Saturn VUEs with CVTs because their transmissions kept exploding. OK scratch that GM didn’t spend enough money on the VUE’s development either.

Eventually a few years and one bailout later GM learned to get it right. Today it offers tons of crossovers in all shapes and sizes—a crossover for every purse and purpose you might say. Pontiac's not around anymore but the playbook certainly is for turning car platforms into bigger people-hauling vehicles with plenty of space decent gas mileage and the up-high seating position that more and more buyers love. The next generation of electric cars that will lead GM to its gas-free future will be crossovers too. In that way the Aztek was a pioneering vehicle. It's a shame it fell down in execution so much.

Listen I get why y’all like the quirky-looking Aztek. If you don't find its ugliness endearing well now you have even more reasons to hate it. But regardless of your position on the Aztek's look let’s just not pretend that it’s a good car OK?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlYXJwYXRyb2wuY29tL2NhcnMvYTM1NTU0MDE0L3doby1vd25zLXdoaWNoLWNhci1icmFuZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Automaker Owns Your Favorite Car Brand?,"There are dozens of brands to choose from when you decide to buy a car. Just about every one of them offers an array of models — and a storied lineage to boot. Dive beneath the surface however and you’ll discover a lot of links between brands and vehicles that you might not have realized.

The automotive world has seen rampant consolidation over its 100-plus years of existence. Brands have aligned themselves into multinational conglomerates and share platforms parts engines and infotainment systems. That trend is likely to exacerbate with the era of electrification as carmakers are forced to pour billions into redefinining their lineups and electric motors make individual powertrains less of a distinctive characteristic that defines vehicles and brands.

In one sense consolidation can be dispiriting. A new Lamborghini won’t be as madcap as it was when they were flying solo in the 1970s and 1980s; indeed it’ll have a lot of Audi Porsche and even some VW DNA coursing through its figurative veins. On the other hand the alternative would be losing niche brands like Lamborghini when times go south; and thanks to standardized engines and platforms a new Lamborghini will be more reliable and cheaper to maintain than the eccentric beasts of yore.

So if you’re wondering who’s really behind your new ride — here’s a look at who owns which car brand.

Based on the GM’s EV-specific BEV2 platform also used by the upcoming 2022 Bolt EUV the Bolt EV is a crossover-like hatchback built at the GM Lake Orion Plant in Michigan. It sells in greatest numbers in the United States as might be expected. Its other top three markets are Canada and perhaps surprisingly South Korea.

Other markets where the Bolt EV is sold include Mexico certain South American countries (like Brazil) and the Middle East.

See running Chevy Bolt EV sales by market

The production version of the Bolt EV was previewed by the Chevrolet Bolt Concept which made its debut at the 2015 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The production Bolt EV went on sale about a year later for the 2017 model year. At the time there was concern that the Bolt might be confused with another electrified GM vehicle produced at the time – the Chevrolet Volt liftback. With the Volt having been discontinued after the 2019 model year the similar names do not seem to have caused much confusion in the real world.

GM planned to give the Bolt EV a mid-cycle enhancement (MCE) for the 2021 model year but it was delayed due to obstacles created by the COVID 19 pandemic. The 2021 Bolt EV which actually went into production was very similar to the 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 models.

Meanwhile the 2022 Bolt EV is identical to the 2021 model both structurally and mechanically. However the front and rear fascias have been redesigned the interior has been revamped and the seats have been overhauled. The updated model will go on sale in the summer of 2021 at the same time as the Bolt EUV which is essentially the same vehicle but stretched six inches (in length) resulting in increased rear seat legroom and more mainstream styling.

The market is expected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of two per cent reaching $28 billion in 2029 according to GlobalData.

GlobalData’s latest report ‘HIV Therapeutics: Global Drug Forecast and Market Analysis to 2029’ reveals that growth in the market will be driven by the entry of injectable therapies that can be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously.

HIV-infected patients are normally managed with oral therapies. One type of treatment regimen involves the administration of one tablet per day. These single-tablet regimens (STRs) are made up of fixed-dose combinations of individual antiretroviral drugs.

Magdalene Crabbe Senior Ophthalmology and Infectious Diseases Analyst at GlobalData comments “The launch of STRs revolutionised the treatment landscape of HIV and met major unmet needs by increasing patient compliance and improving the safety and tolerability profiles of antiretroviral drugs. However STRs are not without their issues. A key component of multiple drugs is tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) which has been linked to osteoporosis and kidney disease. There are also people who don’t remember to take their medication and people who feel embarrassed about living with HIV which lowers compliance.”

To address these issues drug developers have examined the possibility of using injectable anti-HIV drugs that can be administered less frequently than STRs and other oral drugs.

Roche’s Fuzeon (enfuvirtide) was the first subcutaneously-administrable drug to be approved for the treatment of HIV-infected patients. However the fact that the drug is administered multiple times daily has led to difficulties with adherence and the emergence of injection-site related adverse events such as lipohypertrophy erythema and pruritus.

Crabbe adds “By 2029 other injectable therapies will be available in the market. CytoDyn’s leronlimab and Gilead Sciences’ Lenacapavir are expected to become available in the US and European markets. Additionally TaiMed’s Trogarzo (ibalizumab) which is an intravenously administered monoclonal antibody launched in the US in 2018 and in Europe in 2020.”

ViiV Healthcare’s cabotegravir is an integrase inhibitor that has shown inhibitory activity against viruses that are resistant to elvitegravir and raltegravir. Two injectable cabotegravir-based therapeutics launched in Europe at the end of 2020 and are expected to launch in each of the 7MM.

Cabotegravir-based therapies are projected to generate 79 per cent of the sales of injectable therapeutics in the HIV market in 2029 equating to estimated sales of $1.5 billion towards the end of the forecast window.

Most of the drugs entering the market between 2019 and 2029 are expected to be used as salvage or add-on therapies that can be used in combination with first-line drugs. Sales of injectable therapies are expected to exceed $1.8 billion in 2029.

The current activities of drug developers in the HIV space reflect a desire to meet the needs of patients who have difficulty swallowing or remembering to take their pills. Addressing these longstanding unmet needs will drive growth in the HIV market.

Although injectable drugs will be well received by patients a significant number of infected people are unaware of their seropositive status because the disease has few recognisable symptoms in its early stages.

Crabbe concludes “Developing non-oral drugs is one way for pharma companies to diversify treatment options for patients but it is equally critical to improve screening programs and reduce the stigma surrounding HIV and AIDS as this will allow patients to confidently seek treatment.”

One key contributor: Staff shortages in the health workforce—particularly doctors—in rural India. Rural areas account for 68-71% of India’s population but are served by just 34% of the country’s doctors.

Solving this deficit of rural doctors comes with ethical and pragmatic challenges. Doctors—highly educated and skilled professionals—are often apprehensive of practicing in rural areas. Often these posts equate to lower pay reduced educational and professional opportunities inadequate infrastructure limited family support reduced job satisfaction and bureaucratic hindrances among other challenges.

Policies for increasing recruitment and retention of rural doctors should focus on these interconnected issues.

But unfortunately various state governments have instead subscribed to one-size-fits-all policies: mandating periods of rural service-ships—known as ‘bond’—with heavy financial penalties for non-compliance and non-completion. Bonding has failed repeatedly as a good short-term solution. It also fails to address long-term retention issues; doctors who cannot afford the bond penalty complete their mandatory service with no intention of serving long-term in rural public health system. Others sidestep the obligation through hefty payments as high as ₹5000000 (equivalent to $65000) in the case of specialist doctors with smaller payments for MBBS graduates. The bonding approach has been criticized for its paternalistic outlook infringing upon the autonomy of medical graduates and young doctors.

Increasing the number of doctors in rural areas can help solve one India’s biggest health disparity challenges. But first doctors must be empowered as critical stakeholders.

We propose primary policy solutions that focus on motivating doctors to engage in rural service not mandating it.

Medical colleges and associated partners (medical councils and boards) should identify new graduates interested in rural service to become champions for the cause. These ambassadors can then spread the word to their peers about the value of rural service. Harnessing the influence of graduates’ own networks has a better chance of effecting long-term changes in recruitment and retention than punitive bonds. Testimonials by current members of the Association of Rural Surgeons of India show that this approach is realistic and scaleable. Commit to long-term investment in rural doctors rather than short-term incentives (such as one-year bonuses and initial benefits). Need and merit-based scholarships should be awarded for educational and professional advancement activities of doctors serving in rural regions. Funds for their children’s education and opportunities for spouses are crucial for retaining rural doctors. Such provisions would not be any different from those currently made for family members of government officials (armed forces officers railway officers etc.) serving in remote regions. Encourage rural doctors to take on leadership roles  and increase coordination between rural doctors and community stakeholders such as local public health authorities and private vendors. Doctors should administer essential local resources particularly for health programs in keeping with local needs. This would be a departure from the current approach wherein state authorities (mostly non-medical bureaucrats) decide which health conditions are prioritized in a given area often failing to understand the nuances of local demands. This solution is highly cost-effective only requiring a reallocation of already available resources. A more significant role in decision-making would pay dividends increasing doctors’ sense of ownership in their practice and helping them gain patients’ trust. Moreover online inventories and grievance redressal registries can increase involvement without increasing doctors’ workload. Introduce an online portal to showcase all available rural placement options  allowing applicants to choose based on their needs and preferences. Another reason doctors hesitate to work in rural areas is the slow and corrupt bureaucracy that underpins the selection and placement process which currently requires applicants to visit multiple governmental offices across cities without any real say in their placement. We propose instead a transparent online recruitment process. The portal would also serve as a mechanism against corruption and favoritism. Bettering the process of recruitment can also enhance the number and quality of applications.

Choosing policies that empower health workers can help ensure better health for the nation’s people no matter where they live.

Chegg.org commissioned the polling company Yonder to interview 16839 undergraduates across the 21 countries last fall with sample sizes in the various countries ranging from 500 to about 1000.

Seventy-five percent of American students surveyed said their mental health had suffered due to the pandemic second only to Brazil (76 percent) and similar to the percentage of Canadian students who said the same (73 percent). Worldwide across the nearly two dozen countries where students were surveyed 56 percent of students said their mental health had suffered during the pandemic.

Among American students 91 percent said their stress and anxiety had increased during the COVID pandemic 30 percent said they’d sought help for mental health 26 percent said they’d considered suicide 12 percent said they’d self-harmed and 5 percent said they’d attempted suicide.

Just 58 percent of American undergraduates -- the second-lowest of any country after Turkey -- agreed with the statement “In general all things considered I feel happy.” Worldwide 70 percent of undergraduates agreed with the statement.

""The global data also highlights the intense pressure placed upon students around the world compounded by the pandemic"" Lila Thomas Chegg’s director of social impact and head of Chegg.org wrote in a foreword to the report. ""During the pandemic students across the globe have shown great strength focus and determination to keep learning and keep fighting for their future. They deserve huge praise and recognition for never giving up.

Research from the Healthy Minds Network for Research on Adolescent and Young Adult Mental Health has also found increases in reported rates of depression among students during the pandemic. Sarah Ketchen Lipson co-principal investigator of the national Healthy Minds Study and assistant professor of health law policy and management at Boston University said new data from fall 2020 released last week involving about 33000 students at 36 colleges and universities found that 47 percent of students screened positive for clinically significant symptoms of depression or anxiety. And 83 percent reported that their mental health had negatively impacted their academic performance in the last month in what Lipson described as ""a major increase from what we have seen in the past.""

""From a research perspective it's good to have more and more data and sources of information as the pandemic goes on"" Lipson said of the Chegg survey. ""I think all of these sources of data are showing high levels of distress and in particular depression and anxiety among adolescents and young adults. I think continuing to get more and more sources of data is just really valuable for advancing knowledge and for advocating for the need for mental health services.""

The Chegg survey also asked students about how they experienced online learning during the pandemic. About half (51 percent) of all students across the 21 countries said their instructors know how to teach effectively online while 37 percent said they do not. In the U.S. respondents were almost evenly split on the question with 45 percent saying yes and 44 percent saying no (11 percent said they did not know).

Fifty percent of all students across the 21 surveyed countries described their college’s online learning offerings during the pandemic as good while just 35 percent said they’d learned as much or more as they would have with in-person learning.

Seventy-six percent of students in the U.S. compared with 65 percent worldwide said they would prefer their institutions offer more online courses if it meant they would pay less in tuition than they normally pay.

Thirty-one percent of students worldwide and 48 percent in the U.S. said they had a debt related to their studies. Thirty-five percent of students worldwide and 46 percent in the U.S. said they lose sleep due to worry about their debt. Twenty-one percent of students worldwide and 22 percent in the U.S. said it makes them so anxious they have sought medical help.

Over the previous 12 months 30 percent of American students said they’d struggled with rent or mortgage payments 26 percent with utility bills 37 percent with food costs and 23 percent with medical costs.

American students identified the three biggest issues facing their generation as being the widening gap between the rich and the poor climate change and health care.

Sixty-seven percent of American students said they feel their education is preparing them for the job market and 64 percent feel hopeful about their finances in the future.

Forty-eight percent of American undergraduates agreed with the statement “I believe I live in an open and free society that supports diversity the less fortunate and gives everyone equal opportunities.” Seventeen percent were neutral or preferred not to say while 35 percent disagreed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZC1hZnJpY2EtNTYxNjk5MTfSATJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3Mvd29ybGQtYWZyaWNhLTU2MTY5OTE3LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cryptocurrencies: Why Nigeria is a global leader in Bitcoin trade,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRpbWVzLmNuL3BhZ2UvMjAyMTAyLzEyMTY3OTYuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,“With us forever”: Artist’s sculptures pay homage to Chinese heroes,"Artist Liu Baoliang works on his sculptures which portray the five heroes. Photo: Weibo

A set of sculptures portraying the heroes who safeguarded the country during the June 2020 border conflict with Indian troops at Galwan Valley have become internet sensations touching the hearts of netizens on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo.Created by Chinese sculptor Liu Baoliang five sculpted heads vividly capture the faces and detailed expressions of five Chinese heroes: Qi Fabao Chen Hongjun Chen Xiangrong Xiao Siyuan and Wang Zhuoran. Sadly while Qi survived the conflict the latter four sacrificed their lives on the battlefield to protect the country.Liu spent up to six hours each day and a total of four days to finish the group of artworks. The image of those sculptures quickly went viral online and stirred up netizens' patriotic comments.""It is cruel to see those sculptures look so similar to those martyrs. It is confusing to feel like we still have them when they are gone forever. Crying"" wrote one netizen on Sina Weibo.""Please add a tangerine beside Chen Xiangrong's sculpture that's the loveliest thing about him that we will always remember"" noted another netizen referring to the 20-year-old martyr who left the world with a photo that shows him holding a tangerine in his hands while smiling toward the camera.Liu said that as an artist he reckons art has the power to communicate. He noted that he created these works not only because he was deeply touched by and respected those heroes but also he wanted to use such works to carry forward China's national spirit.""I'm touched. As someone who also sculpts I feel realistic works like what he has created can sometimes be quite dry and lack expressiveness. But I really don't think any other interpretation could be better than what he has done in this context -paying homage to the people we love.""There is no need for too much imagination or creativity you just need to do the every move right because every carve here is serious and solemn"" Xiang a young sculptor in Chongqing who is also working on a similar patriotic project told the Global Times on Sunday.""He was absolutely right about the power of art to communicate.

Title: Tom Stoppard: A Life

Tom Stoppard: A Life Author: Hermione Lee

Hermione Lee Genre: Non-fiction

Non-fiction Publisher: Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group

Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group Pages: 896

Tom Stoppard for six decades now one of the world’s most consistently celebrated and successful playwrights used to speak regularly about his “good luck” and “charmed life” – and it was hard to disagree with the humblebrag.

The Czech-born English writer has won twice as many Tony Awards for best new play on Broadway as anyone else living or dead – even though he centres subjects such as quantum mechanics and consciousness or long-dead and little-known philosophers and classicists in his comedies of ideas. His four wins are impressively spread out too – one each in the 1960s (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead) 1970s (Travesties) 1980s (The Real Thing) and 2000s (for The Coast of Utopia trilogy).

The 1990s meanwhile were hardly a fallow period in American approbation for Stoppard: Arcadia largely acknowledged as his masterpiece may have gone over the heads of Tony voters in 1995 but a few years later he won an Academy Award for Shakespeare in Love.

The fear then in embarking on reading a biography of such a figure is that it will be like watching the opening of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern – in which Rosencrantz flips a coin calls heads and wins 92 times in a row – on repeat.

But as Hermione Lee puts it most succinctly near the end of her whopping new biography Tom Stoppard: A Life Stoppard’s claims of a charmed existence have endured “even though he was taken from his home as a baby in wartime his father was killed and many members of his family as he later discovered were murdered by the Nazis.”

Born Tomas Straussler to a Jewish family in 1937 in what’s now the Czech Republic Stoppard fled the German occupation to Singapore with his parents and older brother Peter in 1939. Then in 1942 his mother and the two boys fled again as the Japanese invaded – a last-minute escape by boat to as it turned out India. In attempting to follow them his father was not as lucky the coin finally landing tails for him at sea.

A third and final dislocation to England was at the root of Stoppard’s long-time insistence that chance was on his side – though in reality it was a choice that changed his life that time. In 1946 his mother Marta married British army officer Kenneth Stoppard – and a new Stoppard family was formed in a place Tom would grow up to revere as “the land of tolerance fair play and autonomous liberty of habeas corpus of the mother of parliaments of freedom of speech worship and assembly of the English language.”

For most of his life Stoppard treated his Straussler past as prologue – a compartmentalization abetted by his mother Marta’s reluctance to speak of that time or her family. He blithely called himself a “bounced Czech” and his Jewish roots (which he did not know the full extent of until the 1990s) an “exotic fact.”

He celebrated Englishness in his writings as it is often said only an immigrant could (though the critic Kenneth Tynan suggested curiously he should be viewed as an “émigré”) without being accused of English chauvinism.

In very recent years however Lee writes “what once had been obliterated came back to haunt him” and Stoppard began to feel he had erased his own family – and other victims of the Holocaust – by using words like “lucky” and “charmed” to describe his unrepresentative survival.

In the summer of 2018 after reading Nicholaus Waschmass’s history of Nazi concentration camps K.L he started having insomnia and nightmares. “He couldn’t stop thinking about what happened when he was a child to his family and to millions of others” Lee writes.

Back in the 1970s and onward Stoppard hadn’t been able to stop contemplating what would have happened to him as a writer if his mother had returned to (what was then) Czechoslovakia after the war. This fueled his activism on behalf of Soviet dissidents his close relationship with the Czech playwright – and later president – Vaclav Havel (who he saw as a kind of a double) and the occasional play from Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (1977) to Rock ’n’ Roll (2006). It also partially accounts for why he was “gung ho” for the likes of Margaret Thatcher and Rupert Murdoch in the 1980s.

In his 80s at the end of the 2010s however Stoppard began to examine the actual tragedy long hidden in plain sight in his life as his short-term memory declined and the long term came back into focus. He decided to write about it from a certain angle.

Leopoldstadt opened in London on January 2020 – a three-act drama about an assimilated Jewish family in Vienna set in the same apartment in 1924 1938 and 1955 (just as Arcadia had been set in the same English country house but in 1812 in 1993 – a safe temporal distance on either side of his childhood).

It features a character named Leo who escapes the Holocaust grows up in England after his mother’s second marriage and is very smug about it all. A relative admonishes him (which is to say Stoppard admonishes Stoppard): “No one is born eight years old. … But you live as if without history as if you throw no shadow behind you.”

You couldn’t ask really for a better arc than the one Stoppard’s actual life art – and his shifting viewpoints on both – provides a biographer and Lee has not messed with that. In Tom Stoppard: A Life she first writes her subject’s early years – as he did until the 1990s – almost like a boy’s adventure tale and only lets the readers feel the full the weight of these traumas when Stoppard himself begins to do so ending her book with Leopoldstadt’s sell-out run – interrupted or on pause at least due to the pandemic.

In between that beginning and end there’s over a dozen stylish cerebral plays to sum up and connect to Stoppard’s life myriad screenplays written or rewritten for credit (Brazil Empire of the Sun) or cash (Beethoven 102 Dalmatians an unproduced cartoon of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cats) to document and a new wife or significant other to introduce every decade or two.

Lee doesn’t neglect Stoppard’s radio dramas or his translations and adaptations mostly of Central and Eastern European plays. Briefly dissecting his version of Chekhov’s The Seagull she highlights a line he has put in Nina’s mouth about the artist’s life: “What really counts is not dreaming about fame and glory… but stamina.”

Stoppard certainly has had stamina but children (four in total) and alimony also have had a role to play in keeping him so productive. Lee paints a picture of a man who seems to almost enjoy living on the edge of his financial means – with a fondness for first editions country estates and throwing very expensive parties. Even as a young writer in 1960s London he was selling his blood – or worse reviewing theatre – to pay back the friend or agent he had borrowed from to pay the bills.

Bumbling biographers turn up in many of Stoppard’s plays alongside withering witticisms such as from 1995′s Indian Ink: “Biography is the worst possible excuse for getting people wrong.” Lee quotes these digs at her profession almost with pleasure and seems inspired by them to leave no stone unturned in a 750-page tome that is exhaustive – and only occasionally exhausting.

The eminent British biographer’s previous subjects such as Edith Wharton and Virginia Woolf are as a New York Times profile put it “all novelists all female and all dead.” And though her take on Stoppard rarely seems hampered by him being male or alive (indeed he was the one who requested her services) it is occasionally evident that show business is not her primary area of expertise. Lee seems more interested in print runs of plays than box-office revenue for instance – and in a groaner for Canadian readers mistakenly refers to prominent father-and-son theatre producers Ed and David Mirvish as the “Mirvish brothers.”

Lee does write with authority about the plays if not always about the theatre. At one point she brilliantly connects Rosencrantz with its glimpses of Hamlet from two doomed sidelined characters and The Coast of Utopia trilogy which is about pre-revolutionary Russians and their philosophical debates at home and in exile. She calls them plays about “people caught up in processes which they can’t control who can’t find their way back home and who spend their time trying to understand how best to play their parts in history.”

She engages too (as she must) with that strange old debate about whether Stoppard’s plays for all their obvious intelligence and humour are too aloof.

Lee documents how this view of his work grew partly out of the image the playwright had of himself early in his life expressed privately (in a letter to an early unrequited love: “All my inclinations – artistic personal ethic and moral – prefer reticence to over-explicitness”) and a dandyism cultivated in a brash way publicly (“I burn with no causes. I cannot say that I write with any social objective” he declared in a 1968 interview).

A degree of emotional containment in Stoppard’s private life seems to spring form the survival mechanisms he learned from his mother (rather than the stereotypical English manifestation of that sensibility) – just as his dramatized digs at biographers may stem from his own long-time reluctance to look too closely at his own past.

But Lee makes the argument that his plays are not as standoffish as they are sometimes portrayed. She insists that emotions those of grief in particular swim beneath all of Stoppard’s work – starting with Rosencrantz who speaks of being “born with an intuition of morality.” As objective proof she relishes pointing out how often theatre critics have declared that this new Stoppard play (The Real Thing or Arcadia or The Coast of Utopia) or that revival (of Jumpers or Arcadia) finally showed that he had “heart.”

Occasionally Lee can seem overly protective of Stoppard however. In writing about his early work for instance she’ll sometimes note that his depiction of a female character or tackling of an issue was “very much of its time” – without unpacking the euphemism.

Later cataloguing the less-than-enthusiastic reviews for 2015′s The Hard Problem she turns downright defensive writing: “It was as though critics had forgotten over nine years [without a new Stoppard play] what a Stoppard play might demand of them or how to react to it or even as though they were enjoying having a kick at the ‘greatest living playwright.’”

This spurred me to read the play – which immediately made clear to me why it remains as yet unproduced here in Canada.

Perhaps it’s a testament to the likelihood that Stoppard’s importance will endure that upon finishing a 750-page book about his life and work I was left thinking that Lee’s biography was likely far from the final word on this guy.

For Mr. Downing who was 62 when he died of cancer on Feb. 9  the experience inspired another book in a wide-ranging writing life that included teaching at Tufts University .

The first symptom of his demise he learned would be abrupt and final. A series of doctors “leaned a little forward in their chairs and said the words ‘sudden death’ to me” he later recalled .

At 45 Michael Downing learned that his excellent health was a mirage obscuring a genetic defect that probably had led to his father’s death from a heart attack at 44.

Endlessly curious and equally adept at fiction and nonfiction he wrote nine books that included studies of a Zen Buddhist community in San Francisco and daylight saving time and novels that drew from his experience as a gay man and a teacher of creative writing.

It followed then that his new arduous path — a heart pacemaker went awry a staph infection hobbled him — would lead to arguably his most personal writing: “I wrote ‘Life with Sudden Death’ to answer a simple question: Who has the authority to tell the story of your life?”

And as with life itself health care was not without complications.

“As I entered the strange and secretive world of modern medicine I really thought I was simply choosing to prevent my sudden death” he later wrote.

“But the medical intervention to prevent my sudden death almost killed me — more than once. Five years four surgeries and three implanted devices later I see that I was effectively adopted by a close-knit family of genetic researchers clinicians and surgeons and medical-device manufacturers. I knew I was dependent on them and I soon learned that they were not entirely dependable. But did I really trust my own version of the story?”

Ultimately he could be confident in this and the other narratives he crafted because of his approach to writing. Mr. Downing was a meticulous researcher and in grammar’s structure he saw rules that liberated rather than confined.

A creative writing teacher for some 20 years at Tufts University he previously taught at Wheelock College and had been a popular instructor for Teachers as Scholars a Cambridge-based program that offers professional development seminars to K-12 teachers.

“He loved teaching and he really managed that balance between teaching and writing in the most healthy complementary way of anyone I know. These things weren’t in tension with each other” said his longtime friend Philip Bennett an editor at the PBS documentary series “Frontline.”

Mr. Downing “had this special idea of the classroom as a kind of sacred space” Bennett said. “That sounds kind of silly in some ways but he thought of classrooms as places where things happened that don’t happen in the outside world where confidences were formed and things were shared.”

At Teachers as Scholars “he was a dazzling instructor” said Henry Bolter the program’s founder and director.

“Michael taught not only writing he taught a way to be” Bolter said. “And that was remarkable.”

Mr. Downing “really believed the classroom was the place for as he called it transformative change” Bolter said and he led classes that were “just alive with energy and sort of crackling with joy.”

Building communities among friends in the same way he built trust in classrooms Mr. Downing was renowned for spending the whole day cooking when he and his longtime partner Peter Bryant hosted a gathering.

His gifts with language were as present in conversation as they were on the page.

Books were his preferred form but the time constraints of creative writing classes lend themselves to assigning short stories. He and his friend and former Tufts creative writing colleague Michelle Blake a poet and writer once realized neither had actually penned a short story. They decided to each write one and share their efforts only with each other.

When the time arrived to swap stories “I said ‘I’m afraid it’s so bad you won’t want to be my friend anymore.’ And he said ‘That option has expired’ "" she recalled. “It was so beautiful. He had this tremendous generosity and loyalty to people. If you mattered to him you mattered to him.”

The youngest of nine siblings Michael Bernard Downing was born on May 8 1958 in Pittsfield where his father John F. Downing was a highly regarded leader of business organizations who died when Michael was 3.

Mr. Downing’s mother Gertrude Martin Downing was the guidance counseling secretary at St. Joseph’s High School in Pittsfield.

He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English from Harvard University where “he was one of these dazzling talents” Bennett said. “He decided really early in life that he was going to be a writer. He had the discipline and the talent to do that right from college and as a result lived a kind of simple life in a lot of ways. Writing was at the heart of his professional ambitions.”

Mr. Downing’s novels included the 1997 bestseller “Perfect Agreement” and its sequel 2019′s “Still in Love” which was his last book. His novel “Breakfast with Scott” was adapted into a movie that marked the first time a National Hockey League team the Toronto Maple Leafs allowed its logos and uniforms to be used in a gay-themed movie.

“Spring Forward: The Annual Madness of Daylight Saving Time” published in 2005 turned him into a go-to media interviewee whenever discussions arose about dispensing with the practice.

Mr. Downing and Bryant who had been together since 1982 met in Harvard Square.

“We struck up a conversation and had a cup of coffee. I knew in our first conversation that he was so thoughtful and inquisitive about life. It became a lifelong conversation” Bryant said.

“Michael really encouraged people in a way that was not just patting you on your back. He understood and believed in them” added Bryant who is retired from his position as chief operating officer at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. “And he certainly was that for me. He was my biggest champion in what I do for work.”

They married in 2013 and divided time between their home in Cambridge and a place in Ipswich that Mr. Downing took it upon himself to fix up learning the skills of renovation.

“Nothing ever intimidated him” Bryant said. “He would look at a particular problem and say ‘There’s a way to get at this.’ ""

Services were private for Mr. Downing who in addition to Bryant leaves two brothers Jack of Pittsfield and Joseph of Westborough; and two sisters Elaine Hale and Marie van Luling.

In a 2009 essay for The New York Times Sunday Magazine Mr. Downing examined the lessons his health travails had taught.

He recalled arriving one day at Tufts and kneeling beside his car to in his weakened state struggle to loop his book bag’s strap over his shoulder. As an autumn breeze dried the sweat of exertion he turned his gaze to the world around him and was for a moment transformed.

“I looked up at the true-blue autumn sky through the limbs of a midlife maple its still-green leaves quivering like jazz hands” Mr. Downing wrote.

“Maybe life is not a lesson or maybe I am a bad student” he added “but I knew nothing but how sweet it is to catch an unexpected breeze.”

The gorgeous Aussie actress 53 attended the 2021 Golden Globe Awards on February 28 and was totally dressed to the nines. Nicole was joined by her husband Keith Urban and two daughters Sunday Rose Urban 12 and Faith Margaret Urban 10 during the special telecast. The stunning star wore her hair in an updo and a gorgeous black gown with jeweled detailing running up her torso. Nicole looked so stunning but her best accessories were truly her young girls who were right there to support her along with their dad and Nicole’s adoring husband! They couldn’t have looked more proud.

The Oscar winner is no stranger to impressing fans and audiences during awards season. Just last year Nicole dazzled in a radiant red gown on the Golden Globes red carpet. The strapless dress from the house of Versace fit like a glove on Nicole’s figure and featured a dramatic slit up her leg with a long train. Parts of the fabric created the effect of gathering at her waist where the dress was cinched to accentuate Nicole’s natural beauty.

Tonight though the focus isn’t only on Nicole’s dress. The celebrated actress is nominated for her 15th Golden Globe award! Nicole earned a nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Limited Series Anthology Series or a Motion Picture Made for Television for her work in The Undoing. Of course with the wealth of TV programs that came out in 2020 Nicole is in very good company. Her category is stacked with stars like Cate Blanchett in Mrs. America Daisy Edgar-Jones in Normal People Shira Haas in Unorthodox and Anya Taylor-Joy in The Queen’s Gambit. But this isn’t new territory for Nicole.

There’s honestly very little pressure for the star this time around. The decorated actress has won a slew of awards and accolades during her decades-long career including an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role (The Hours 2002) and a whopping four Golden Globes! This year Nicole is nominated for her work in the HBO limited series The Undoing and it’s a special project for the star.

Nicole actually got to spend some time with her daughters Sunday Rose Urban and Faith Margaret Urban on the set of the New York City production. Nicole has always been very reticent to share photos and details about her daughters both of whom she shares with husband Keith Urban. But after they joined their mom on the mystifying series who knows if we’ll see the girls starring alongside their mom in the future!"

In my case the first major career development opportunity was the Industry Trek to New York City. Applications for the trek opened just weeks after the start of my first semester. After an understandably competitive application process (including video submissions) I was selected as one of the attendees from the Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) program. This is my tale of the trek.

Day 1: FinTech Credit Suisse and more

If you don’t know about the International Business School’s Industry Treks you should. Students travel to and spend several days in a major U.S. city visiting companies in a particular industry and learning from and networking with people in that field. The best thing about it? Treks are paid for by the business school. All you have to do is show up and make the most of it. The New York City trek was focused on finance (which is where my career interests lie). It was a great way to kick-start my career development at Brandeis!

After arriving at our hotel near Times Square the night before the morning of the first day involved a visit to a FinTech accelerator in the Flatiron District. This was an opportunity for our group to discover opportunities in finance that we probably wouldn’t have otherwise encountered. Like Boston New York is a FinTech hub and we heard from several businesses at various stages of development — from a two-man shop developing immersive job experience simulations for students to an AI company (Forward Lane) that practically took up a whole floor of the building. We had Q&A sessions with these companies toured the building and then heard a longer interactive presentation from Forward Lane. This first morning of the trek was an unexpected highlight for me because I learned that there are a variety of businesses and business cultures within New York City’s financial industry. It was exciting and definitely set the pace for the rest of the trip.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzExOGIyOWJhLWYxMTgtNDZmZi1iNjM5LTY3NWNlYjNjMWNmNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goldman bankers join Walmart effort to take on Wall Street,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

By Ronni Newton

LaSalle Road became a one-way street headed northbound when the Town of West Hartford first installed dining corrals in the roadway in June 2020 and although the barriers were removed for the winter the direction of the road and the switch to head-out angled parking have remained in place.

Bike lanes were also added to each side of LaSalle Road.

In November when the dining corrals were removed for the season an additional block of LaSalle Road – between Ellsworth Road and Arapahoe Road – remained open to two-way traffic but transitioned to the head-out angled parking arrangement.

“Unfortunately the new parking configuration has not worked as well as it was intended” Assistant Town Engineer Greg Sommer said and parking between Ellsworth and Arapahoe will be restored to head-in angled parking facing in the direction of the traffic flow early this spring.

On Friday afternoon nearly every vehicle parked on that stretch of LaSalle Road was parked head-in anyway. The vehicles parked on the west side of the road were parked so that backing out to head southbound would create an awkward maneuver – and the drivers had likely pulled into those spaces from the northbound direction after executing a U-turn.

As the roadway has been cleared of snow over the winter the lines that were painted in November have become fainter and the old parking space designations have reappeared creating a cross-hatch of confusing markings.

The intent has been for spaces on the east side of LaSalle to be available to drivers headed northbound on the two-way portion of the road with southbound traffic parking on the west side. Sommer urged drivers not to cross the centerline to park in an empty space on the opposite side of the road.

“This may cause an accident especially when exiting the parking space” he said.

“In the next few weeks or so we will grind off the markings” Sommer said. He’s hoping that the weather will be warm enough for the painting of new lines to take place by mid-March.

Sommer confirmed that the head-out angled parking will remain for the northern portion of the roadway where the traffic will also remain one-way. The town is anticipating dining corrals will be able to return this spring and the traffic pattern will be able to accommodate the traffic flow while they are in place.

According to the town some motorists still occasionally attempt to drive southbound on LaSalle but “Do Not Enter” and “Wrong Way” signs as well as barriers at Farmington Avenue are in place to prevent that.

Head-out angled parking – requiring the motorist to back into the space – gives the driver a greater field of vision when leaving. Head-out angled parking is used in more than 32 major cities and studies have indicated that it is safer easier and more accommodating for loading and unloading town officials said.

Sommer said that head-out angled parking requires the motorist to perform an easy three-step maneuver:

Signal a right turn to other drivers Pull past the parking spot and stop and Reverse into the parking spot in just one move

Head-out angled parking also provides a greater field of vision when exiting the parking space and is safer for the adjacent bicycle lanes. (See graphic below.)

It is also recommended by the Automobile Club of America (AAA) Sommer said.

“Every parking maneuver requires a motorist to either back into or out of a parking space. It is much safer to back into a parking space when a driver can clearly see what’s behind them than to back out into moving traffic with adjacent vehicles obstructing a driver’s field of vision” said Sommer. Backing out of a parking spaces is a common cause of crashes.

Now that a majority of vehicles have rear-view cameras backing into a parking space is easier Sommer said.

“Motorists may not feel comfortable making a car behind them wait while they back in however this is no different from vehicles waiting while a driver backs out of a parking space” Sommer said. “The procedure also requires the same steps to parallel park. Initially it may be a bit awkward to head-out park but with practice drivers will become more comfortable and skilled.”

Other parking configurations are available throughout West Hartford Center including in off-street lots parallel parking spaces along Farmington Avenue and head-in parking along South Main Street.

There are 33 short-term (15- and 30-minute) free parking spaces that remain available for curbside pick-up. They are located on LaSalle Road South Main Street Farmington Avenue Memorial Road and Isham Road.

Kiosks in the Farmington Avenue and Brace Road off-street lots also allow for 30-minute free parking.

Shoppers diners clients and employees requiring longer parking sessions are asked to use the municipal lots and parking garages.

Correspondent

Steve Zalewski it turns out is a hockey rarity.

He is a stay-at-home forward.

Zalewski one of the Worcester Sharks’ all-time leaders in several categories was raised in New Hartford New York just down the road from Utica. Unlike so many of his former Sharks teammates who have opted to settle in warmer places Zalewski still lives in New Hartford in a house about a mile from where he grew up.

His wife Liane is from New Hartford and he works with his dad’s building and remodeling company there.

Zalewski played parts of four seasons for the Sharks and is fourth on the team’s all-time list with 128 points third in assists with 87. He scored 41 goals in a Worcester uniform but his most memorable Sharks-related goal was probably scored against them not for them.

It happened on Feb. 18 2011 in Albany just seven days after he had been traded to the Albany Devils. The Sharks had a 4-1 lead with nine minutes left in the third period and fell apart Zalewski scoring at 19:55 to give the Devils a 5-4 victory.

Incensed at a call that forced a faceoff in the Sharks end assistant coach Dave Cunniff threw a pen that hit linesman Rich Patry in the head and was subsequently suspended.

“I remember that goal yes” Zalewski said. “It was kind of a fun game in general actually. We fell behind and significantly then had that crazy finish where I scored in the last couple of seconds.”

Zalewski arrived in Worcester out of Clarkson late in the 2007-08 season and racked up six points in seven games. His best year with Worcester was in 2009-10 when he played in 78 of 80 games and went 22-40-62 to finish second on the team in scoring to Danny Groulx. Zalewski also made his NHL debut playing three games for San Jose.

That was perhaps the most talented Sharks team to play in Worcester. It won a division title but got knocked out in the second round of the playoffs by Manchester.

“That was definitely a hard thing to deal with” he said. “You try to tell yourself ‘It’s OK you had a great regular season’ but it was tough. We had won the division and were really excited about the playoffs then a lot of our guys went up to San Jose. If we just had a couple of them back we could have gone deeper.”

Zalewski played in Albany through 2012-13 also getting into seven games with the New Jersey Devils. He then spent five years in Europe before retiring after the 2017-18 season.

“You never want to admit when age starts catching up to you” he said “but my last couple of seasons in Germany were down years. And the last year I broke my jaw and missed 2½ months because of that. We were having kids my wife wanted to go home and it got tough.”

A broken jaw? Hockey in Europe is supposed to be somewhat gentler than the North American version.

“Yeah” Zalewski said “but the pucks are just as hard. I got hit in the face with one.”

The Zalewskis were dating during his Worcester years.

“She was just out of college” he said “and was working in Boston so it was really convenient. We definitely have fond memories. Every so often something random will come to mind and we’ll say — ‘Remember when we went to this place or that place?’ It was really fun.”

While with the Sharks Zalewski generally lived in big old spacious apartments with lots of teammates. When Andrew Desjardins arrived in town he moved in without much fanfare.

“We had an unfinished basement” Zalewski recalled “and he went down there hung up a sheet and said ‘This is fine for me.' ""

The Zalewski family has a summer place in Wells Beach Maine so he drives through Worcester almost every year on the way there and occasionally makes a pit stop.

“I have a cousin who lives in Worcester” he said “and he’s always telling me how amazing it is there now. When I was there you could see it just starting to come around.”

He has a daughter Ellie who is going on 2 and a son Rohm 4½. Zalewski has an outdoor rink in his yard and works as a coach with his son and other young players.

“I don’t think you can call it coaching at this point” he said. “I mostly help run the learn-to-skate program with some other dads. And I plan to continue with that but that’s about as much coaching as I’ll be doing.”

Zalewski still plays in a local league. The COVID-19 pandemic has slowed down his work schedule to part time upon which he does some carpentry and almost anything else related to housing. He also manages the company’s books.

So while many of his former teammates are booking January tee times Zalewski is building outdoor rinks and teaching kids to skate in the cold winters of upstate New York.

Toy manufacturer Hasbro stirred controversy immediately after it announced the launch of a ""modern” version of its iconic Mr. Potato Head toy line that will drop the honorific “Mr.” to be more “inclusive” and to let kids create their own type of potato families including two moms or two dads.

“Hasbro is making sure all feel welcome in the Potato Head world by officially dropping the Mr. from the Mr. Potato Head brand name and logo to promote gender equality and inclusion” the company said in an announcement Thursday about the new line that will be released this fall.

Soon thereafter in response to numerous responses on Twitter against the name-change and ""inclusion"" the toy giant updated the announcement: “Hasbro is officially renaming the Mr. Potato Head brand to Potato Head to better reflect the full line. But rest assured the iconic Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head characters aren’t going anywhere and will remain Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head.”

In a promotional video for the new line Hasbro said it's offering a ""modern look for modern families.""

The new version will come with two non-gendered “adult” potatoes one “baby” potato and 42 removable parts like eyeglasses a mustache nose and mouth Bloomberg quoted a Hasbro spokeswoman as saying. That will let kids decide the parents’ gender rather than being told they are “Mr.” and “Mrs.”

“They are looking to broaden the franchise” The Associated Press quoted Robert Passikoff founder of marketing consultancy Brand Keys as saying. “You take the focus of what is essentially one character and now allow it to be a platform for many characters.”

The removal of “Mr.” from the name of the toy line is likely to encourage other companies to not assign genders to their toys Ali Mierzejewski editor in chief at toy-review site the Toy Insider was quoted as saying.

“It’s a potato. But kids like to see themselves in the toys they are playing with” Mierzejewski added.

A prominent gay rights organization the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation welcomed the move.

“Hasbro is helping kids to simply see toys as toys which encourages them to be their authentic selves outside of the pressures of traditional gender norms” Rich Ferraro the group’s chief communications officer said in a statement.

Mr. Potato Head was launched in 1952.

In 2019 GLAAD started pushing for 20% of all television characters to be LGBT by 2025.

In a report called “Where We Are on TV” GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis noted that “less than one-quarter of Americans have a close friend or family member who is transgender” meaning that many Americans “learn about trans people from what they see in television movies and news.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vc3Rhci13YXJzLXZpbnRhZ2UtaWcxMS1sYW5kLWNhbHJpc3NpYW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Star Wars: Lando and IG-11 Join The Vintage Collection,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vc3Rhci13YXJzLXZpbnRhZ2UtaWcxMS1sYW5kLWNhbHJpc3NpYW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9leHBsYWluZWQvbXItcG90YXRvLWhlYWQtcmVicmFuZGluZy1leHBsYWluZWQtNzIwNjk4Ni_SAV1odHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZXhwbGFpbmVkL21yLXBvdGF0by1oZWFkLXJlYnJhbmRpbmctZXhwbGFpbmVkLTcyMDY5ODYvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Explained: Why ‘Mr’ was dropped from ‘Mr Potato Head’ toys,"Toy making company Hasbro has decided to rebrand ‘Mr Potato Head’ dropping ‘Mr’ from the title.

What is Mr Potato Head?

Mr Potato Head is a line of toys that consists of different body parts and accessories such as a hat ears nose shoes pants and a plastic potato-shaped body that children can assemble on their own to form different figures.

According to an archived web page of the Hasbro website the “personality” of Mr Potato Head was born in 1952 and was the first toy to be advertised on television.

However the original Mr Potato Head toy consisted only of body parts including eyes ears a nose and a mouth. This meant that parents had to supply real potatoes or any other kind of vegetable to their children to complete the toy figure. This however changed in the early 1960s when the toy manufacturer started including a hard plastic potato body which replaced the need to attach a real potato.

As per “The Strong” which describes itself as a collections-based museum devoted to the history and exploration of play the idea for the toy was first thought up by toy inventor George Lerner “who figured that vegetables with a little personality might have a better chance (and) created a set of silly face parts as bonuses for cereal box promotions.”

An article published in The Takeout says that at the time Lerner thought of this idea World War II had just ended because of which people such as himself often took potatoes and other sturdy vegetables from the garden to create crude dolls for children in the family.

Lerner’s creation was acquired by Hasbro in 1952 and Mr Potato Head was followed by Mrs Potato Head Spud his brother and Yam his sister. In 1995 and 1998 Mr Potato Head was featured in the animated film series Toy Story and Toy Story 2.

So why is the company rebranding?

News reports suggest the company is changing the name in an attempt to give the brand a gender-neutral makeover. In a press release the company said it is officially renaming the line of toys sold under the brand Mr Potato Head “to better reflect the full line”.

While some have welcomed the decision others have criticised the company saying the move gives more fodder to the conservatives to mock LGBTQ people.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vY2F5bWFuLmxvb3BuZXdzLmNvbS9jb250ZW50L21pc3Rlci1uby1tb3JlLW1yLXBvdGF0by1oZWFkLWdvZXMtZ2VuZGVyLW5ldXRyYWwtMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A mister no more: Mr Potato Head goes gender neutral | Loop Cayman Islands,"Mr Potato Head is no longer a mister.

Hasbro the company that makes the potato-shaped plastic toy is giving the spud a gender-neutral new name: Potato Head. The change will appear on boxes this year.

Many toymakers have been updating their classic brands in recent years hoping to relate to kids today and to reflect more modern families.

""It's a potato"" said Ali Mierzejewski editor in chief at toy review site The Toy Insider. ""But kids like to see themselves in the toys they are playing with.""

Barbie for example has shed its blonde image and now comes in multiple skin tones and body shapes. Thomas the Tank Engine added more girl characters. And American Girl is now selling a boy doll.

As part of the rebranding Hasbro will release a new Potato Head playset that will let kids create their own type of families including two moms or two dads. The Mr and Mrs Potato Head characters will live on in some form Hasbro said but didn't provide details.

Dropping the ""Mr"" from its name could encourage other companies to not assign genders to its toys a trend that has already been happening said Mierzejewski. Barbie maker Mattel released a gender-neutral doll line in 2019. But Mr Potato Head is one of the biggest brands to do so.

""It's setting this new standard"" Mierzejewski said.

Mr Potato Head first hit the toy scene in 1952 when it didn't even come with a plastic potato — kids had to supply their own vegetable to poke eyes a nose or mustache into. Hasbro which also makes Monopoly and My Little Pony bought the brand and eventually added a plastic potato.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vZXVyb3dlZWtseW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjgvaG90LXBvdGF0by1uZXdzLWhhc2Jyby1yZXZlcnNlLWRlY2lzaW9uLXRvLW1ha2UtbXItcG90YXRvLWhlYWQtZ2VuZGVyLW5ldXRyYWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hot Potato News - Hasbro Reverse Decision to Make Mr Potato Head Gender Neutral,"By Matthew Roscoe • Published: 28 Feb 2021 • 15:09

Hot Potato News – Hasbro Reverse Decision to Make Mr Potato Head Gender Neutral.

AFTER initially announcing earlier this week that Mr Potato Head would go gender-neutral Hasbro took back the decision stating that “Mr and Mrs Potato Head are NOT going anywhere.”

A report on Thursday February 25 stating that the toys would be going gender-neutral appears to have been a case of crossed wires within the company.

The confusion started when Kimberly Boyd a GM at Hasbro said: “Culture has evolved. Kids want to be able to represent their own experiences.

“The way the brand currently exists – with the ‘Mr’ and ‘Mrs’ – is limiting when it comes to both gender identity and family structure.”

However a potential U-turn from Hasbro – due to some backlash – was announced via their Twitter account when the company tweeted: “Hold that Tot – your main spud MR. POTATO HEAD isn’t going anywhere! While it was announced today that the POTATO HEAD brand name & logo are dropping the ‘MR.’ I yam proud to confirm that MR. & MRS. POTATO HEAD aren’t going anywhere and will remain MR. & MRS. POTATO HEAD.”

The classic toy has been around 1952 and has gained more popularity since being featured as a regular character in the Toy Story film franchise. In 1953 Mrs Potato Head was also launched with feminised accessories such as hair bows and red high heels.

This latest revelation in the potato drama will hopefully stop Piers Morgan from exploding after the controversial TV host unleashed a rant about the iconic American toy.

Taking to Twitter Morgan said: “Imagine thinking in the middle of a global pandemic: ‘What’s really important is dropping the ‘Mr’ from Mr Potato Head & making him gender-neutral in case we upset a few wokies.’”

A little more than two months ago the first COVID-19 vaccine was given in the U.S. To date more than 44 million Americans have gotten at least one dose.

Besides offering protection for individuals and communities the vaccine is also a shot of hope for health care providers — especially critical care nurses — who’ve been caring for COVID-19 patients nonstop for a year.

Yet even with ongoing vaccinations decreasing hospitalizations and a dropping death rate the pandemic is far from over. In fact nurses say it will take much more than two shots to fix what COVID-19 has revealed to be broken in health care: nurse staffing and retention.

Because despite headlines about “nursing shortages” such claims are the “beginning of a question — not the answer” said Joanne Spetz professor and director of the Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies at University of California San Francisco. In fact such claims should spark an interest in what’s going on “underneath the hood.”

So the Deseret News looked.

During the past three months we talked with 35 Utah nurses — 20 of them intensive care unit nurses — from the four major health care systems in Utah and across 15 hospitals about working in a pandemic. We also consulted health economists workforce specialists and nursing experts about Utah’s place in the national landscape and sought information from hospital administrators.

Here’s what we found:

There is no overarching nursing shortage. While the pandemic has created an acute immediate need for nurses data does not support the idea of a broad nationwide nursing shortage. Instead the country has regional shortages and experience shortages caused by a growing number of baby boomer nurses retiring and hospital decisions about staffing.

While the pandemic has created an acute immediate need for nurses data does not support the idea of a broad nationwide nursing shortage. Instead the country has regional shortages and experience shortages caused by a growing number of baby boomer nurses retiring and hospital decisions about staffing. Utah’s nurses are leaving. Every nurse we spoke to knew at least one other hospital nurse who had left their job within the past 11 months — some knew handfuls. Nurses are retiring early going back to school taking lucrative travel nursing positions or finding a less stressful job.

While Intermountain Healthcare and the University of Utah Health wouldn’t answer questions about turnover we compiled numbers from conversations with nurses and based on staff seniority and scheduling lists for the past 11 months as provided by nurses. They show that Intermountain Medical Center the largest hospital in Utah has lost at least 38 ICU nurses from just two of its five ICUs; Intermountain’s Utah Valley Hospital in Provo has lost at least 27 ICU nurses during that time period. The University of Utah Hospital has lost 68 ICU nurses from its four ICUs.

Turnover is common in nursing especially in ICUs where nurses come to get experience before pursuing higher nursing education but many experienced Utah nurses say the numbers during the pandemic are abnormally high. One Huntsman Cancer Institute ICU nurse has been there for four years during which time roughly four nurses left. Yet since December 2020 her unit has lost nine experienced nurses.

Utah is not a state with a nurse shortage. In fact the number of registered nurses graduating in the state has increased 21% in the past five years — and is continuing to climb.

In fact the number of registered nurses graduating in the state has increased 21% in the past five years — and is continuing to climb. Nursing experience in critical care is dropping. Working in the ICU has been a coveted position requiring years of experience. Yet one 23-year-old Utah ICU nurse who spoke with the Deseret News said he was made a charge nurse in his ICU and considered an expert despite having only two years of experience. As older experienced nurses retire even an influx of new younger nurses can’t replace that experience in hospitals at a time when nursing care is becoming even more complex. Experts call this the experience-complexity gap which if left unaddressed can negatively impact patient safety and quality of care.

One Utah ICU nurse told us she was stretched so thin she had to care for a COVID-19 and a non-COVID-19 patient during the same shift. Many nurses say they’ve gotten daily texts from managers begging them to come in for extra shifts. In addition to their regular schedules ICU nurses at the University of Utah Hospital and Huntsman Cancer Institute are required to sign up for two on-call shifts a month.

Many nurses say they’ve gotten daily texts from managers begging them to come in for extra shifts. In addition to their regular schedules ICU nurses at the University of Utah Hospital and Huntsman Cancer Institute are required to sign up for two on-call shifts a month. Some nurses said they feel devalued. Some nurses described staff meetings as well as personal interactions during the past year where they’ve been told “a nurse is a nurse — anybody can do your job” and “don’t think you’re special” and “be grateful you have a job.”

Some nurses described staff meetings as well as personal interactions during the past year where they’ve been told “a nurse is a nurse — anybody can do your job” and “don’t think you’re special” and “be grateful you have a job.” Nurses said they are underpaid. Utah hospitals have brought in travel nurses to help carry the load with contracts ranging from $3000 to $5000 a week — almost the amount some staff nurses said they make in a month. And when there’s a lull in patients it’s staff nurses not expensive traveling nurses who get sent home without pay. Most nurses report no additional compensation for working on a COVID-19 unit although the University of Utah is now offering $200 and $300 bonuses to those who voluntarily pick up weekday and weekend shifts nurses said.

Intermountain nurses also repeatedly questioned the optics of their employer partnering with the Las Vegas Raiders by retaining naming rights for the $75 million dollar Henderson Nevada performance and training center yet freezing company contributions to their 401(k) accounts for the second-half of 2020. Intermountain confirmed the freeze and said the contributions began again in January 2021. The naming rights fee was not released.

There are zero Magnet hospitals in Utah. Considered the “gold-standard” for hospitals the American Nurses Credentialing Center recognizes organizations that “provide nursing excellence” and “an environment conducive to attracting and retaining well-qualified nurses who promoted quality care.” Utah Nevada and New Mexico are the only three states in the country without any Magnet hospitals.

So how can all these factors coexist?

How can Utah nurses feel overworked in a state that is producing more nurses than ever?

Chris Brown Mahoney a professor of management at Minnesota State University Mankato and former registered nurse puts it quite simply: “You’re filling a bucket that has holes in it.”

Utah’s buckets

The state of Utah has four major health care systems — Intermountain Healthcare University of Utah Health HCA Healthcare (known locally as MountainStar Healthcare) and Steward Health Care which operate nearly all of the 35 acute critical care hospitals in the state (not including specialty or children’s hospitals). Intermountain operates 16 of those acute care hospitals HCA has eight Steward has five and the University of Utah has one.

For comparison’s sake neighboring Colorado has 56 acute care hospitals while Iowa a state with a similar population to Utah has 40.

Intermountain Healthcare in addition to being the largest health care system in Utah is also the state’s largest employer — with more than 20000 employees including 10296 nurses “and hiring new nurses every week” said Brad Gillman a media relations manager with Intermountain Healthcare. Those nurses make up roughly 44% of the state’s active directly involved in health care nursing force of 23000 RNs.

The University of Utah employs 2104 in-hospital nurses according to the university’s health director of media relations Kathy Wilets and HCA has roughly 2000 nurses in Utah said Chris Taylor MountainStar Healthcare assistant vice president of communications.

And it’s a constantly growing workforce.

Between 2014 and 2019 the number of active RN licenses went up by nearly 22% according to a 2020 report from the Utah Medical Education Council titled “Supply of Nurses in Utah.”

In 2017 Utah had 1401 nurse graduates who passed the licensing exam. By 2019 there were 1823 yearly graduates — partly the result of a 2017 Utah Nursing Consortium and the Utah Action Coalition’s initiative spearheaded by Teresa Garrett assistant professor in the University of Utah College of Nursing who holds a doctorate degree in nursing practice.

The group of nursing leaders and community advocates successfully requested more legislative funding for nursing education to boost the number of graduates by 200 every year.

In the first two quarters of 2020 the number of passing graduates is already at 1421. There are also three or four applications for every one nursing school slot and qualified applicants are turned away every year Garrett said.

“If such trends continue the nursing supply is predicted to increase steadily over the next decade” the council’s report proclaims.

Utah by such accounts has no problem filling its hospitals with new nurses. The question is can they keep them there?

Utah’s nurse turnover in the second quarter of 2020 was 3123 — an all-time high and 39% higher than the same quarter in 2019 according to a new Utah Medical Education Council report on RN employer demand.

HCA was the only health care system to comment on its nurse turnover during 2020 noting it lost 150 nurses across eight hospitals — a similar number to 2019 — but hired 250 said Taylor.

“These changes correlate with the economic downturn in response to the pandemic” the Utah medical council report notes. “It will be important to continue to track changes in turnovers and new hires in the near future in order to maintain a pulse on the impact of the pandemic on the state’s RN workforce.”

The razor’s edge

Pandemic or not nurses don’t leave because they’re tired of caring for people said Linda Cassidy strategic advocacy manager with the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses. They leave for reasons that include problems at work such as understaffing low pay and underinvestment from management which can become “insurmountable barriers” to providing care.

In the “Critical Care Nurse Work Environments 2018” study 60% of nurses reported inadequate staffing levels in their hospitals the majority of the time. The study also found that among nurses who planned to leave within the next 12 months 52% said better staffing would very likely make them reconsider leaving.

Another study from December 2019 to February 2020 in New York and Illinois found that nurses’ caseloads were high — especially in New York City — and half of nurses in both states were already burned out before COVID-19 hit.

Such studies clarify the pandemic didn’t create staffing problems — it merely exacerbated a “preexisting condition” said Matthew McHugh a professor of nursing and associate director of the Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing.

Too many U.S. hospitals were using “just-in-time” staffing operating on “the razor’s edge” of having just enough staff to get by in noncrisis times McHugh said.

Such an approach may work for companies that manufacture cars or T-shirts because the amount of work to be done is “knowable and you can plan for it” said Linda Aiken McHugh’s colleague and a professor in nursing and sociology and the founding director of the Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research. “But you cannot specify the amount of care that a hospital might need to provide — it’s unknowable. Anything can happen.”

And it often does which means nurses are often asked to stay later come in earlier pick up extra shifts or extra patients — all things that can lower employee morale while increasing the number of nurses could improve patient safety.

Consider these findings:

A 2018 analysis of more than 175000 ICU patients across six studies found that higher nurse staffing levels reduced a patient’s risk of in-hospital death by 14%.

Adding one more full-time RN in a unit per patient day would result in fewer deaths as well as less hospital-acquired pneumonia cardiac arrest and even 24% shorter ICU stays.

Alternatively each additional patient added to a nurse’s load had a 7% increased chance of dying within 30 days of hospital admission plus they increased the nurse’s chance of burnout by 23% and job dissatisfaction by 15%.

COVID-19 just made everything more difficult.

Front-line fatigue

Of the 35 Utah nurses we talked with nearly every one told us that staffing is a key factor in being able to care for their patients safely — and in many cases had been a struggle before COVID-19. They wanted to share their experiences but were afraid of losing their jobs or being punished by managers which is why we’ve used only first names or initials and few professional identifiers.

Before COVID-19 Eric would spend his entire ICU shift caring for one patient occasionally two. Then the pandemic hit and he said he had five shifts in a row caring for three COVID-19 ICU patients who were sicker than anything he’s ever seen. One night on a 1:1 shift his patient was so ill he said he entered their room and didn’t come out for seven hours.

C. said she leaves her hospital feeling like she can’t do her best for anybody. “I can only be in one place at one time” she said. “But you leave feeling like all your patients were waiting on you the whole day. It’s so unsatisfying — you feel like a bad nurse. Is it because I’m new and not used to everything or is it justifiable to say that we are being overworked?”

One ICU nurse said when COVID-19 hit he ended up working 12-hour shifts six days a week and said he was asked to do even more. He got emails from management encouraging him to take care of himself but in working “all these crazy hours” it felt disingenuous he said. He left full-time nursing in the fall and said many of his colleagues aren’t far behind.

“I’ve talked to a lot of the nurses and they’re really only in it for each other” he said. “After this is done they’re just done with it.”

Sierra started on a hospital unit in January 2020 that was on day 100 of no falls by patients. Yet when the pandemic hit the hospital began rearranging. Instead of caring for surgical patients her unit became filled with higher-need patients but no extra staff. Within four months the number of falls had jumped to 30.

“Everyone’s getting burnout” she said. “It’s not normal to cry going to work and on your break and most of my co-workers were doing that. Management told us to work hard and don’t complain.”

But they did hang a “thank-you sign” in the facility’s break room. Within days it was covered with other messages in red Sharpie: “Stop asking for overtime! We are tired already after our own shifts” and “Please hire more people” a message pointed to by more than eight other arrows.

Sierra said the sign stayed up for nearly a month and a half but nothing changed. She finally broke her two-year contract and paid back $6500 but said she’d “do it all over again it was that bad.”

Sierra never planned to leave the hospital — she had been working on the same floor where her mom began her nursing career in 1987.

“But the whole experience just turned me off to the hospital” she said. “I don’t think I’ll ever go back.”

Garrett with the University of Utah College of Nursing fears such stories may become common.

“We’re taking a job that was already stressful and highly rewarding and we’re adding a layer of stress of the pandemic” she said. “What I worry about in the nursing workforce is how we will get through the pandemic and how many nurses we will have left after the pandemic. What are we doing today to make sure they make it till August or September?”

Pay and morale

National mean pay for RNs is around $37.24 an hour according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Utah nurses told us starting wage is around $26 or $27 an hour while in 2020 the state’s median nurse pay was $37 per hour — up from $30 in 2015 said Clark Ruttinger director of Workforce Research and director of the Utah Nursing Workforce Information Center within the Utah Medical Education Council.

No hospital system would comment directly on nurse salaries and Intermountain Healthcare University of Utah Health and Steward declined to answer questions about whether nurses received any sort of hazard pay bonuses or additional compensation during the pandemic.

Taylor said HCA did provide a one-time bonus to all full-time and part-time facility-based employees in November. HCA’s senior and corporate leadership also took a 30% pay cut in April May and June to fund the company’s pandemic and quarantine pay programs.

Intermountain nurses said those who pick up extra shifts get bonus pay. Aside from that they said they got a $50 gift card.

Salaries are also another pretty clear way to identify a shortage.

“If they don’t have enough people they would raise the wages” said Mahoney from Minnesota State. “That’s what you do when you don’t have enough people. I don’t care if it’s babysitters or computer programmers or engineers you raise the wages. But they’re not doing that are they?”

Breeding discontent

It’s no surprise to Utah nurses the state has low wages.

ICU nurse Kyle Harvey believes it’s a combination of few major employers a service-oriented population and in some cases an incorrect assumption that most nurses are women whose income is secondary to that of their husbands and thus doesn’t need to be higher.

“I do it out of the goodness of my heart” the 49-year-old said “but I should be compensated for it. People are leaving because they can’t afford to stay.”

Those feelings were magnified as he watched travel nurses flood the state — making in a week what a typical staff nurse makes in nearly a month.

He would know.

He traveled as a nurse to California to help during its spring surge. This year his income will be nearly triple what he would have made just staying in the state.

He acknowledges traveling wages are extremely high right now but even in non-pandemic situations a trained ICU nurse hired by a hospital for an eight- or 13-week crisis contract makes more than a staff nurse. Such nurses don’t need to be trained by the hospital or paid a yearly salary and benefits so it’s an expense many hospitals are willing to bear.

Ben Borys said he saw traveling nurses come in droves to Intermountain Medical Center in Murray providing the same ICU nursing care he was. Yet he was getting $27 an hour while they were making around $80 an hour he said.

He appreciated their help but kept hoping for some sort of hazard pay. Even $3 an hour more would have signaled the hospital noticed and appreciated the fact that he was working with COVID-19 patients 99% of the time.

“I just waited and waited for that little bit and it never happened” he said.

So he left and became a traveling nurse himself.

He went to California for a month came home for a needed mental health break then traveled again for another few months. Today he’s back at Intermountain Medical Center as a traveler — making four times what he made as a staff nurse.

When he walked back onto the unit with his former colleagues one of them wryly told him “I hate you for doing this but I love you for coming back.”

Intermountain has hired between 200 to 300 traveling nurses during the pandemic paid for with a blend of federal and hospital funds said Gillman with Intermountain. During a normal year the system only brings on 20 to 30 nurses.

HCA said they’ve contracted with around 100 traveling nurses across eight hospitals with a non-pandemic contract labor force of less than 2%.

Yet for Utah nurses who can’t pick up and travel or don’t want to leave their hospitals the glaring pay discrepancy stings.

“Here we are in the middle of a pandemic and what we need are ICU nurses” one Intermountain ICU nurse said. “How am I gonna live with myself 10 20 years from now when in the moment when we needed ICU nurses and I left? And they know that. They know we’re gonna stay because of our patients and our co-workers. They know the majority of us are going to stay and they can do whatever they want. They don’t have to pay us we’re still gonna stay because we feel that responsibility.”

Yet as soon as she finishes that thought she pauses remembering the panic attacks that she says now precede each night shift.

“There have been so many nurses that ... have said ‘I don’t know if I’m going to be able to be a nurse after this is over’” she said. “That’s been my big thing too. I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this the way that it is.”

Patching the holes

It was 1981 and four expert nurses — Margaret Sovie Margaret McClure Muriel Poulin and Mabel Wandelt — were tasked with solving a pressing national problem.

Hospitals were hiring new nurses but couldn’t keep them. More than 100000 nursing positions were empty and 80% of U.S. hospitals had inadequate staffing.

This new American Academy of Nursing Task Force determined that instead of rehashing the problems of turnover they would study hospitals that were doing it right.

Their landmark study of 41 hospitals identified 14 forces of “magnetism” — qualities that “successfully attracted and retained professional nursing staff in a time of shortage” as well as “shaped environments of excellence” Poulin wrote in 2017.

The forces included quality nursing leadership a management style that values and encourages employee feedback flexible personnel and staffing policies quality of care nurse autonomy and others.

“Most striking was the large number of instances in which the word ‘listen’ was used by both the directors and the staff nurses” according to the original Magnet study report. “It emerged frequently for instance in response to the question ‘What single piece of advice would you give to a director of nursing who wished to do something about high registered nurse vacancy and turnover rates in her hospital?’ Typical of the responses given by the directors of nursing was this statement: ‘Listen to the staff ... the best consultants are on your own staff.’”

That report paved the way for an official “Magnet recognition” from the American Nurses Credentialing Center a subsidiary of the American Nurses Association and roughly 8% to 9% of U.S. hospitals — currently 552 — have earned such a label.

Magnet facilities have been studied for nearly 40 years and the “evidence suggests that no matter what gets thrown at the health care system outcomes are better” in magnet hospitals says McHugh with Penn Nursing. “There is no reason to suspect that COVID is any different.”

In 2005 four of Intermountain’s Utah hospitals were awarded Magnet recognition and the organization expressed an intention to have “all its hospitals Magnet certified.”

Today Utah has zero Magnet-recognized facilities.

When asked about what happened Intermountain replied that it remains “supportive of the principles and goals of Magnet as they represent what is best for patients and caregivers.”

“Most of the nation’s hospitals do not seek the Magnet designation” said Gillman.

(HCA’s Timpanogos Regional Hospital in Orem is the only Utah hospital that has a Pathway to Excellence designation also from the American Nurses Credentialing Center which is a complementary designation to Magnet that “emphasizes supportive practice environments that promote engaged and empowered staff.”)

Achieving Magnet status requires a “rigorous review and intensive survey process” plus it’s expensive. Despite the cost Garrett with the University of Utah College of Nursing said she’s a fan of the status because of the support it extends to nurses.

“Nurses deserve to be paid more. They also want to be treated as professionals and be at the health care decision-making table” she said. “That goes a long way if you’re called in to do an extra shift or in lean times called off a shift and you can’t expect to have 12 hours of salary that you know your opinion and your professional growth are valued and the organization is investing in you and your teammates. That helps raise up the satisfaction level when the salary can’t quite be there.”

Yet as the pandemic continues some nurses worry that not only is the salary missing but so is the the willingness both from the general public and some bosses to listen to them.

Just ask Sean Freeman.

Freeman remembers coming into a hospital cardiac catheterization lab in early 2020 to find his bosses sitting around a table covered in resumes. They were looking at nurses’ backgrounds and deciding where to send people when the surges began.

Freeman who has 10 years of critical care experience was later told he’d be sent to the ICU and required to work 12-hour night and weekend shifts.

He said he went to his director and reiterated that his wife is a physician and his daughter’s day care had strict hours (and was temporarily closed because of pandemic) so he couldn’t work the new proposed schedule. But he still wanted to help — was there anywhere else they could send him?

No.

He applied for temporary leave so he could better arrange child care as their nearest relative is in Wisconsin.

They are wearing masks eye protection X-ray lead gowns and shoe covers and would soon put on gloves. “I hope that if we are able to glean anything from this pandemic organizations will realize you don’t need to hire consultants to figure things out” says Catmull. “Just ask the people who work for you — they’re the best problem-solvers you’ve got. Nurses here need to have a place. We need to have a voice.” | Ronda Catmull

Denied.

Several colleagues including Ronda Catmull who has 21 years of ICU experience said she offered to take his spot in the ICU so he could stay in the lab on the same family-friendly schedule that was the main reason he took the job in the first place.

Nope.

Freeman’s last shift was May 18. He was one of two experienced nurses (out of 15 in his unit) who left.

He said it didn’t have to be this way.

“I loved my job I loved the management I loved every single person that I worked with and what I was doing it just didn’t really matter” the 39-year-old said. “They let me walk out the door.

Quakertown’s undefeated freshman Mason Ziegler polished off his semifinal opponent West Chester Henderson’s Carmen Cortese 9-2 and Pennridge freshman Sam Kuhns who has lost only once this year punched his ticket there with a 4-2 triumph over Spring-Ford’s second-seeded junior Dominic Ortlip during Saturday’s Class 3A Southeast Regional wrestling championships at Council Rock North.

Because of the pandemic CR North hosted weight classes 106 through 138 while CR South had the 145 through 285 classes. Quakertown will host the ""Super Regional"" the last step before the PIAA championships next Saturday.

Ziegler and Kuhns go way back to their youth wrestling days probably squaring off since they were about 6-years old including a final matchup last week at districts a bout won by Ziegler 5-0.

They are not only rivals but have become friends too.

“Nowadays I beat him” said Ziegler “but he used to beat me up pretty good when we were younger.”

Ziegler raised his record to 25-0 with a 1-0 won over Kuhns in the final notching a second-period escape to account for the only scoring.

Three of Ziegler’s teammates will join him at super regionals next Saturday at Quakertown with sophomore Zach Borzio (third at 126) junior Fred Retter (third at 285) and senior Domenic DeFalco (fourth at 138).

“I can’t remember the last time we got four to states and that’s what I’m calling it not super regionals because that’s what it is the first round of states” said Quakertown coach Kurt Handel. “To have four kids qualify in this year of unknown is absolutely amazing. It’s awesome.

“It’s all our school administration. They could’ve shut is down they could’ve said no sports. I am so thankful that they gave us the opportunity to compete this year.”

The Ziegler-Kuhns dynamic is more than just the two wrestlers.

Their fathers have coached them every step of the way and continue to do so now in high school as assistants with Dan Ziegler on Quakertown’s staff and Brian Kuhns with Pennridge.

“Having my dad in my corner is really cool” said Mason. “He keeps me in a lot of my matches. Sometimes when I’m not scoring enough points I’ll get a little frustrated and he’ll calm me down.”

As for what lies ahead next week Ziegler will have some tough customers from the Lehigh Valley waiting in Delaware Valley’s Zach Jacaruso and Nazareth’s Charlie Bunting a pair of sophomore finalists in the Northeast regionals.

“I guess I should have no expectations because I shouldn’t expect to do this and that because when I do I don’t wrestle well. It messes up my mental (state) it makes me wrestle scared. So I’m just going in there I’m a freshman I have nothing to lose.”

Eck ends Bensalem's drought

While his own coaches and rival coaches were pumped about what he had just done Bensalem senior Connor Eck (145) just took it in stride.

""My ultimate goal is to win a state title and that's what I'm shooting for"" said Eck after handing West Chester Henderson's Sam McMonagle his first loss of the season a 3-1 win for the Owl in the finals at CR South.

""This was just kind of another step along the way.""

It was a big step as Eck's victory gave Bensalem its first Southeast Regional champion since Solomon Webb won in 1993.

""It's been a long time and this is great for Connor"" Bensalem coach Donavin Williams said.

""He beat a tough kid and now has his sights set on doing well again next week.""

Oh Eck (now 15-1) also reached another milestone as his 3-0 Saturday pushed his career victory total to 101.

What a difference ...

Neshaminy senior Zac Martin just kind of shrugged and chuckled when trying to describe winning his second Southeast Regional title.

""The whole thing is strange but the whole last year has been strange"" said Martin who defeated Interboro's Dom D'Agostino 8-4 in the title match at 152.

""It's great to win this was a big goal for me but it's so different than last year with no fans and having to wear masks when you wrestle. It's my senior year of high school but I haven't even been to school I'm doing remote learning because I'm trying not to get sick.

""I'll go back to hybrid (learning) after the season but it's just a sacrifice that you make. Everyone has made so many sacrifices and just getting the chance to have a season was something I wasn't sure was going to happen a few months ago.""

The unbeaten Martin (14-0) a PIAA medalist last year who will be looking to make his fourth trip to Hershey became Neshaminy's first two-time Southeast Regional champion since Mike Pirozzola a 2000 graduate.

Pirozzola won three Southeast Regional titles two PIAA titles and remains the only District One wrestler to be a four-time PIAA finalist.

""I really want to get on the top of the podium (at states)"" said Martin a Lehigh University commit. ""But I just need to get ready for next week at Quakertown.

""Next week will be like the first round and the blood round at states. If you make it out of next week (the top four finishers in each weight class qualify for Hershey) you're guaranteed a medal at states.""

Ziegler unbeaten Council Rock North senior Kyle Hauserman (17-0 at 138) Eck and Martin were the Intel/Courier Times coverage-area wrestlers to win titles.

Burke Kuhns CR South's Matt Colajezzi (160) CB East's Quinn Collins (215) and CR North's Max Harar (285) earned silver medals.

""If this were last year you'd already be qualified for states"" Collins said. ""But now we have the ""Super Regional"" at Quakertown to try and get through.

""That's going to be a really really tough tournament but at this point of the season every match is tough.""

Speaking of next week

Quakertown which hosted last week's PIAA District One-North event will also host next Saturday's ""Super Regionals"" which will bring together wrestlers from District One Two 11 and 12.

The ""Super Regionals"" though will have a twist as wrestlers from 106 through 138 will compete in the morning session while the heavier wrestlers (145 through 285) will go in the afternoon.

The morning session is scheduled to begin at 8:30 a.m. with the finals and consolation finals scheduled for 12:30 p.m.

The afternoon session is scheduled to begin at 3:30 p.m. with the finals and consolation finals scheduled for 7:15 p.m.

Again no fans will be allowed to attend.

The top four finishers in each weight class will earn berths in the PIAA tournament which will be held March 13 at Giant Center in Hershey.

The ""western"" half of the state will also have a ""Super Regional"" next Saturday and will send its top four finishers in each weight class to Hershey making for eight-wrestler brackets at states.

So in other words wrestlers that finish in the top four at ""Super Regionals"" are guaranteed a state medal since the top eight finishers in Hershey receive them.

Nicely said

CR South’s Cavan Kinne took the end of his high school career very much in stride. The District One North champ last week he settled for sixth at regionals and will now turn his attention to his next stop Delaware Valley University in Doylestown.

“I had a really good career” said Kinne a PIAA qualifier last season who was unsure of his career win total but put it at 72. “I’m happy with what I did. Obviously it’s a little bit upsetting to not do what you want to do. I was supposed to win the whole tournament I read somewhere.

“That’s not always how it plays out but that’s all right. I’m on to better things. I have four more years to get better doing something I love and that’s all that really matters to me. Hopefully I’ll be a D3 natty (national) champ someday. I’m putting in the work. This isn’t the end.”

Asked how difficult was to wrestle a match for fifth place which is basically an alternate spot should something happen to the wrestlers who qualified for super regionals Kinne was as gracious as could be.

“I have all the respect in the world for my competition” he said. “Cole (Coffin who beat Kinne in the fifth-place bout) deserved my best. He has another three years left and he’s already a good wrestler. I’m the old veteran so if he can learn anything by wrestling me then that’s great.

“I wish all my competition good luck in the future; Tony Burke at (Council Rock) North has one year left and we wrestled each other a lot. I hope he wins it all. I respect everybody I ever wrestled. They always deserved my best and I tried to always give it to them no matter what.”

With this comes a growing need for furniture appliances and accessories suited for smaller-sized homes. Seeing this need Devant has recently showcased three 43” TV models all perfectly-sized for condos and apartments.

At the recent launch event for the 43” Condo TV Devant Product Trainer Kristian Castro unveiled the three models each designed to cater to individual customer needs. First is the Devant 43” Digital LED TV a perfect choice for those on a budget and those who enjoy watching local channels. There is also the Devant 43” Smart TV which is ideal for households that enjoy streaming content from apps like Netflix or YouTube. Another model is the Devant 43” Smart 4K TV which offers the best picture quality and is great for anyone who enjoys watching movies or playing console games in incredible detail with 4K resolution.

According to Kristian “With limited space a quality watching experience should still be a priority. With Devant we have the right TV for that setup! For maximum space saving design Devant comes with a wall bracket in every purchase!” He adds “Devant provides a perfect viewing angle of 178 degree horizontally and vertically.”

But why 43”? Kristian explained that when choosing a TV for your living space bigger is not always better. It has been found that 43-inches is the best screen size for areas that allow for 4 to 10 feet of distance between the viewer and the screen. This TV size can provide both comfort and an optimal immersive viewing experience. Architect Saira Margarita Nepomuceno confirmed this during the launch event. She said “Based on scientific research the ideal size of TV for condo living is 43-inches.”

On where to place your TV in a condo living space Architect Saira said “We computed that the best distance from sofa to TV should be between 4ft to 8.5ft to get that perfect viewing angle. When a person is seated down there is a 30-36 degree optimal viewing angle.”

Devant’s 43” TVs truly elevate the small-space dweller’s home viewing experience. As the Senior Marketing Manager of Devant Lara Lua said “Devant is making it possible for us to have the home theater experience despite the limited space.”

Here’s what you need to know about the new Devant 43” TV models.

Benchling had paid Sweet Farm a 20-acre animal sanctuary to spice up the virtual gathering with a video feed of animals including Paco a 5-foot 9-inch rescue llama. When sanctuary co-founder Nate Salpeter stood up too fast a startled Paco retaliated by spraying him in the face with a mouthful of spit.

“It took everyone off guard especially Nate” said Yujia Zhao an account executive at Benchling. The call erupted in laughter.

“They have quite a range on their spit” Mr. Salpeter said. “It smelled largely of hay.”

Repetitive virtual meetings over the past year have sapped morale in many workplaces. So companies are hiring four-legged guests—sheep goats tortoises llamas bearded dragons and more—to paint smiles back on the faces of jaded employees. Hosting animal video calls has become a lucrative revenue stream for many farms sanctuaries or petting zoos.

The animals don’t always play along. Chickens squawk over guests goats nibble at fingers cows gallop away. So farmers have become experts at pampering their talent. They’ve found themselves shampooing fleeces banning troublemakers blackmailing with treats and belly scratches—anything to keep the animals happy and performing at their best.

“We give the hedgehogs baths which is really cute” Chelsea Phillips founder of Tiny Tails to You said. “We have baby shampoo which is fine for them to use but you also want to follow that up at the end with an olive oil spray because they can get really dried out pretty easily.”

Tiny Tails a virtual petting zoo in Austin Texas provides a full tour—hedgehogs chinchillas rabbits chickens tortoises and more all competing for attention—with hangouts starting at $65. It was a way of boosting revenue when visits stopped last spring.

One of Tiny Tails’ more mischievous animals is Jeffrey the gecko who if held too close to the laptop during calls leaps onto the screen. “He’s a bit of a wild card” Mrs. Phillips said. Now they keep the two-year-old Jeffrey far away so he’s not tempted to dive-bomb the tech.

Stephanie Prevost director of operations at Vendr Inc. which helps companies buy and renew software brought along her three children for a work social with Tiny Tails.

Things got chaotic when tortoise Knuckles Tortellini 13 showed up. “This is so silly but the tortoise at the end was pooping on the table and the adults and the kids were laughing so hard” Mrs. Prevost said. People still joke about it on Slack.

In response Mrs. Phillips said they now feed the animals well in advance to avoid unwanted accidents.

Alison Johnson at Bowbridge Alpacas Scotland in North-East Fife U.K. is constantly chasing after her herd. A trained optician Mrs. Johnson got her first alpacas in 2015. She charges £39 ($55) for a 30-minute tour and an adoption pack.

Six-year-old Balthazar a Huacaya alpaca with a windswept fringe is the herd’s most mischievous member and tends to influence the others. On one call with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. he kept wandering away from the camera. Soon enough the alpacas were chasing each other around the paddock. Mrs. Johnson had to race over to the field’s far end to catch them.

“By the time she turned around they had wandered off to the other side” Kirsi Swinton an executive assistant at Hewlett said.

“It’s keeping me fit and healthy” Mrs. Johnson said.

Mr. Saltpeter’s Sweet Farm has over 150 rescued animals including pigs turkeys cows chickens sheep horses and goats. These days a ten-minute “Goat-2-Meeting”—a pun on GoToMeeting conferencing software by LogMeIn Inc.—with unlimited guests costs $100 helping to raise money for Sweet Farm and a collection of other animal sanctuaries. Sweet Farm has conducted over 8000 calls.

Goats can’t always be counted on to behave either. Farmer Dot McCarthy has used many of them from her roughly 40-strong herd in Zoom calls to raise over £50000 ($70000) for her Cronkshaw Fold Farm in Lancashire England. The money allowed her to hire five new part-time employees. Now she plans to invest in sustainable technology like solar panels and electric vehicles.

People can invite goats to video calls—£5 for five minutes—and even create personalized messages for the goats to eat using edible paper and ink (£10).

Multiple times the goats have shoved her out the way and chewed the paper snack before joining the Zoom. “So if we’re ever late for a call that is why because we’ve had to go and rewrite the note” Ms. McCarthy said. It doesn’t get any easier when the cameras are rolling. The farm uses a smartphone and the goats are constantly nibbling at its biodegradable case. ""I think it’s some kind of plant-based material” she said.

Looking further down the road a new leak highlights a possible fourth generation EPYC ""Genoa"" configuration based on Zen 4  with some interesting details.





Up to this point details about Genoa have been rather scarce. We know it will be built on TSMC's 5-nanometer manufacturing process and that it will power El Capitan  which is set to become the world's most powerful supercomputer when it is fully deployed in 2023. The latter revelation comes by way of a joint announcement between AMD Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).





""El Capitan will be powered by next-generation AMD EPYC processors code-named 'Genoa' and featuring the 'Zen 4' processor core next-generation AMD Radeon Instinct GPUs based on a new compute-optimized architecture for workloads including HPC and AI and the AMD Radeon Open Compute platform (ROCm) heterogenous computing software"" LLNL said last year.







Beyond those tidbits we are left to leaks and rumors. To that end leaker and Twitter user @ExecuFix claims to have the inside scoop on one of AMD's eventual Genoa chips one that wields 96 cores and 192 threads . They say it will also feature 12-channel DDR5-5200 memory support as well as 128 PCI Express 5.0 lanes (160 lanes for 2P configurations) and have a 350W TDP configurable up to 400W.









The leaker also concocted a render of Genoa to show how it might possibly compare in appearance and makeup to Rome (Zen 2) and Milan (Zen 3). This is not a real image mind you but a ""mockup based on the Rome image"" depicted at a 1:1 scale. ""This is what Genoa will look like under the hood compared to Rome/Milan"" @ExecuFix says.





What the mockup shows is a 12-chiplet design each with eight cores to arrive at 96 cores and 192 threads plus a larger I/O die in the middle in a square-shaped package (rather than rectangular). It is a physically large slice of silicon compared to Rome and Milan and it will be paired with AMD's SP5 platform sporting a new LGA-6096 socket design according to the leak.





Supposedly anyway. Another leaker a ""retired engineer and businessman"" who goes by @chiakokhua on Twitter replied to the mockup saying ""Bet you $6 this is incorrect."" This prompted a response by @ExecuFix who said they will ""gladly take your $6.""

Brokers had criticized the NSE over the lack of information after the four-hour shutdown on Wednesday. They said they were forced to close intra-day equity positions on another exchange causing sharp losses to some investors.

India’s largest stock exchange NSE announced on Wednesday it shut at 11:40 a.m. local time because of a telecoms problem. It announced market re-opening at about 3:17 p.m. by which time many brokers had closed their investors’ open positions.

In a social media firestorm traders lashed out at the largest broker Zerodha dubbed the Robinhood platform of India by posting snapshots of trading had communicated the re-opening and extension of trading.

The exchange said it decided to continue with its primary systems and not activate its disaster recovery site on Wednesday after evaluating all options to resume trading “at the earliest with least disruption to market participants.”

It added the processes it followed were in line with international best practices. India’s market regulator has asked the NSE to submit a detailed root cause analysis.

NSE said it has a robust resilient secure and fault tolerant technology infrastructure supported by best equipment from vendors like Cisco HP Dell Hitachi Checkpoint Palo Alto Oracle etc. and aided by able technology service providers like TCS Cognizant Wipro etc.

NSE said it has a strong technology governance process in place wherein the technology infrastructure is reviewed on a regular basis by committees like Standing Committee on Technology which has technology experts and also multiple types of audits by various firms/institutions with specialized expertise.

NSE invests in its technology infrastructure on a continuous basis. NSE has almost tripled its annual cash spend on capital and operational expenses on technology to approximately Rs 900 crore over the last 3-4 years. NSE has a technology workforce of approximately 1500 plus people that include employees and vendor staff.

NSE is the largest derivatives exchange in the world by volumes and it has a demonstrated track record of handling significantly high volumes despite a challenging external environment over the last one year due to the pandemic without any impact on trading.

NSE has multiple telecom links with two service providers to ensure redundancy and it received communication of instability of the links from both the service providers.

While there was no impact on the trading system the instability of telecom links resulted in an impact to the online risk management system of NSE Clearing and other systems. Critical systems such as the risk management system are configured with redundancies such that there is no single point of failure.

NSE did not reveal the name of its telecom service providers. Leading mobile operators in India are BSNL Bharti Airtel Vodafone Idea (Vi) MTNL and Reliance Jio.

Given that the online risk management system was unavailable market functioning could not continue normally on NSE and hence had to be shut down. NSE informed market participants around 11:30am that trading on NSE will close at 11:40am.

Post shut down of trading on NSE NSE considered all the available alternatives on hand including invocation of DR to decide on the course of action that would bring up the market at the earliest with least disruption to market participants and post evaluation a decision was taken to bring up the systems at the primary site.

NSE regularly tests its DR readiness in line with SEBI regulations wherein quarterly drills are conducted and live trading sessions from DR site are conducted twice a year.

(Islands Development Company)

(Seychelles News Agency) - The Seychelles' Island Development Company (IDC) has announced that construction work has re-started on Seychelles' first six-star tourism -- a $100 million development -- and that the Waldorf Astoria Platte Island resort is now expected to open in 2023.

The Hilton group has signed the management agreement for the new resort under the luxury brand Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts currently being built on Seychelles' outer island of Platte a communiqué announced earlier this month.

""Seychelles remains unquestionably one of the world's most desirable destinations for the discerning traveller. We are proud of the role our teams have played in the sustainable development of the Seychelles"" said Carlos Khneisser vice president development Middle East & Africa Hilton. Waldorf-Astoria is the flagship brand within Hilton's portfolio and offers the highest standards of facilities and services.

Platte Island is under the management of Seychelles' Islands Development Company. In a recent posting on its website the company said ""this top-of-the-line brand is a first for Seychelles and IDC is proud to be associated with such a highly reputed brand.""

In an interview last Sunday with the national broadcaster SBC the chief executive of the IDC confirmed that that the company had stopped work on the project after the last French developer left. ""The project has restarted with a new developer associated with investors in Abu Dhabi and with us IDC. We relaunched the project last year and we are finishing buildings for the back of the house"" explained Glenny Savy.

According to Savy these include staff quarters staff facilities water electricity and sewerage. ""This is our first phase and this is expected to complete by March or April.""

Savy added that the company is also constructing a bungalow as a sample which is expected to be completed by March. Once endorsed by the developers the construction of the rest will begin.

""We have spoken to several hotel management teams across the world to manage the hotel as the developers wanted the hotel to be the best hotel in Seychelles. We ended with Waldorf-Astoria the top brand of Hilton"" said the chief executive.

IDC currently owns 20 percent of the development while the investors who have a lease for 70 years own 80 percent. Work on the resort is being undertaken by IDC.

The construction of the resort -- at a cost of $100 million-- is expected to finish by the end of next year with its opening planned in 2023. Once completed the resort will offer 42 seafront villas all equipped with private pools. Guests will have access to six restaurants and bars a spa kids' club outdoor observatory tennis courts and a marine conservation discovery centre – all within the sanctuary of Platte Island.

The island itself lies just over 130 km south of Mahe – the main island of the 115 islands archipelago in the western Indian Ocean - and is renowned as a nature lover's paradise covered with palm forest and surrounded by a coral reef and lagoon.

Platte Island has always been used for tourism where IDC used to run a small guest house. The island which can be accessed by plane boasts a rich ecosystem and offer breeding grounds for a variety of seabirds: The brown noddy white-tailed tropicbird lesser noddy bridled tern and the Madagascar fody. The island is also a popular nesting area for the hawksbill turtles."

“Mini-sponge” device shows potential to treat PPH

announces itsdevice has shown success in stopping postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) quickly. The device is a novel uterine tamponade “mini-sponge.” Contained in an applicatoris comprised of compressed mini-sponges that are inserted into the postpartum uterus. Contained in a porous distensible pouch the sponges expand quickly applying hemostatic pressure within the uterus. After a period of observation the pouch is removed with gentle traction on the removal strand.



During a pilot study reports Obstetrx 9 patients treated at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka Zambia did not respond to conventional PPH management options after vaginal birth but did respond with bleeding resolved in 60 seconds and no adverse events to the XSTAT device. The device was left in place for a mean time of 1 hour and none of the patients required further surgical procedures or blood transfusions. The initial placement time of XSTAT (mean time to placement 62 seconds) was faster than times reported for balloon uterine tamponade devices. The pilot study results were published in Obstetrics & Gynecology.

XSTAT is US Food and Drug Administration–approved to treat high-flow arterial bleeding in prehospital trauma settings and Obstetrx is planning to submit for 510k clearance in 2022 after the conclusion of a follow-up PPH trial in 2021.

Bail was set at $5 million for Joliet murder defendant Derrell Draper. (Mugshot via Will County Jail )

ELWOOD IL —A 38-year-old Joliet man had his bail set at $5 million in connection with Friday's homicide of a 30-year-old Shorewood man at the CenterPoint Intermodal Center in Elwood. Derrell Draper was taken into custody by Elwood police and booked into the Will County Jail around 10:30 p.m. Saturday and charged with one count of first-degree murder.

On Sunday evening Elwood Police Chief Fred Hayes told Patch that homicide victim Robert Bigger of Shorewood and Draper were coworkers at The Home Depot warehouse at CenterPoint and both men had just finished their shift and left work around 3 a.m. Draper pulled up next to Bigger's Chevy Impala while Bigger was driving home on Baseline Road and fatally shot him the chief said.

""We're confident we got the right guy"" Hayes told Joliet Patch Sunday evening. ""This is kind of a big incident for the Will County area so it's all hands on deck."" An Atlanta-based corporate communications spokeswoman for Home Depot reached out to Joliet Patch on Tuesday ""to clarify that neither Draper nor Bigger were Home Depot employees they’re employed by a third party contractor.""

Hayes told Patch he spent Sunday afternoon meeting with the victim's family. He said Bigger had lived in the Shorewood and Joliet area for many years. ""It's clear to me the family is devastated and they are going through a very difficult time so I don't want to say more out of respect to their privacy.""

Hayes said that a gun was recovered from the murder defendant. Draper was captured on Saturday at his girlfriend's house on West 87th Street in Justice Hayes said. The Joliet man was taken to the Will County Sheriff's Office on Laraway Road on Saturday and then put into the Will County Jail.

Hayes was not ready to disclose any possible motives for the killing on Sunday evening other than to say ""they worked together at the Home Depot warehouse and at 3 a.m. both got off. They were coworkers and that's how we were able to develop the suspect as a person of interest originally. There's a lot of details that I can't get into right now."" Around 4:40 a.m. Friday Elwood police learned of the homicide as officers found Bigger dead in his car along Baseline Road closed between Arsenal and Noel Roads. One of the truck drivers rolling through CenterPoint spotted Bigger's car on the side of the road and thought it looked suspicious. When the semi-trailer driver still saw it there an hour later at 4:40 a.m. the trucker called Elwood police.

""That tip was instrumental. That was very important"" Hayes said. Draper's next court appearance is Tuesday in Courtroom 405 of Will County Judge Dave Carlson.

Draper lives in the 800 block of Joliet's Hollow Glen Court which is near Black Road and I-55. He has an extensive criminal history in Will and Cook counties. His criminal convictions include: armed habitual criminal possessing a defaced gun felon in possession of a gun resisting arrest obstruction of justice battery possession of a controlled substance unlawful use of a weapon aggravated battery to a peace officer battery battery causing great bodily harm and robbery. Hayes said that Elwood police are fortunate that they had 15 to 20 investigators from the Will-Grundy Major Crimes Task Force who came to Elwood to help solve Friday's early morning homicide in quick time. The lead investigators on the case were Elwood Police Sgt. Andrew Anderson and Jason Opiola sergeant of investigations at the Crest Hill Police Department. Hayes said the investigation came together very rapidly once authorities learned the victim's name. Hayes said the quick turnaround in solving a homicide on a remote stretch of road in Elwood the town's first homicide since 2009 should send a message to other violent criminals. ""The days of a bunch of Barney Fifes being in a small town (police department) are over"" Hayes said. ""It's a good day when you can take a dangerous person like this off the streets.""

The Home Depot warehouse employee found shot to death in a car near his job in Elwood was killed by a co-worker police said.

“Investigators identified him as a person of interest early on in the investigation” Elwood Police Chief Fred Hayes said of 38-year-old Derrell Draper.

Draper was arrested and charged with the murder of 30-year-old Shorewood resident Robert Bigger.

A truck driver contacted police shortly after 4:30 a.m. Friday and reported a suspicious or disabled vehicle on Baseline Road between Arsenal and Noel roads Hayes said.

The Will-Grundy Major Crimes Task Force was called out Friday morning to assist the Elwood police with a suspicious death investigation. (Justin Virgin)

A police officer arrived at the scene approached the vehicle and saw Bigger dead and slumped over the steering wheel Hayes said. Bigger had been shot multiple times.

While it was established that Bigger and Draper worked together at the Home Depot warehouse Hayes said detectives were still piecing together a motive for the murder.

“We’re still talking to a lot of people” he said. “We’re still trying to find a reason for the altercation. We really don’t have that.”

Hayes asked anyone with information about the killing to call the Elwood Police Department at 815-423-5411. Anonymous tipsters can also call Crime Stoppers of Will County at 800-323-6734.

Draper was captured at the Justice home of his girlfriend where he also sometimes resides Hayes said. Jail records list a Joliet address for Draper.

Officers with the Justice Police Department spotted Draper outside the 87th Avenue apartment of his girlfriend Saturday Hayes said.

“They were asked to temporarily detain him until officers with the Will-Grundy Major Crimes Task Force arrived” Hayes said.

The major crimes task force was assisting the Elwood police with the case.

“We arrested him yesterday in Justice and brought him to the Will County Sheriff’s Department for questioning” Hayes said “and the Will County State’s Attorney’s Office approved murder charges late last night and he was transferred to the Adult Detention Facility.”

Draper remained in custody at the Will County jail Sunday. Records show he appeared in court Sunday morning but no bond information was provided.

The killing of Bigger was the first murder in Elwood in nearly 12 years.

In April 2009 Elwood resident Lee Ponsche was charged with killing 18-month-old Halli Burton the daughter of his fiancee Jessie Evans.

Ponshe and Evans met online in January 2009. Within four months they were engaged to marry and Evans moved from Downstate White Hall with her daughter to live with Ponshe in Elwood. Ponshe struck Halli in the head three days after they arrived killing her.

Ponshe told detectives he hit Halli because was crying through the night. An autopsy revealed she died of brain trauma.

Ponshe now 37 was found guilty in December 2012 of Halli’s murder and sentence to life in prison. The appellate court later ruled the mandatory life sentencing law had been invalidated and sent Ponshe’s case back to Will County.

Ponshe’s life sentence was reduced to 75 years in prison. Records show him serving his sentence at maximum security Menard Correctional Center. Ponshe is scheduled to be released from prison in 2084.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvYnNlcnZhdGV1ci5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yNy90d28tbWFuZGV2aWxsZS1tb21zLXNlbmQtYWJjcy1zaGFyay10YW5rLWludmVzdG9ycy1pbnRvLWEtZnJlbnp5LW92ZXItYmVkZGluZy1wcm9kdWN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two Mandeville moms send ABC's “Shark Tank” investors into a frenzy over bedding product - L'Observateur,"Two Mandeville moms send ABC’s “Shark Tank” investors into a frenzy over bedding product Published 7:03 am Saturday February 27 2021

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Mandeville – Two passionate Mandeville inventors Nita Gassen and Judy Schott recently pitched their revolutionary bed sheet fastener the Better Bedder to the panel of tough investors on ABC’s business reality show “Shark Tank.” The St. Tammany Parish women sent the celebrity investors into a feeding frenzy with three of the Sharks attempting to outbid each other for a stake in Gassen and Schott’s sheet fastener company.

In the end Shark Lori Greiner better known as the “Queen of QVC” came in for the final bite at $150000 for an 18% interest in the company. The budding entrepreneurs who founded the company to make everyone’s bed-making chore “fast easy neat” say they will use their company’s new celebrity-backed cash infusion for marketing to spread the word about the Better Bedder nationwide.

“Just making it onto the show was surreal but to end up having the Sharks fighting over us and coming away with a very hefty business investment by Lori is the biggest imaginable dream come true” said Gassen.

“It’s all been unbelievable” Schott said. “We couldn’t believe we kept getting call backs from the TV producers at ‘Shark Tank’ and then last summer we were stunned to get the call to go to Las Vegas and do the real show in front of the Sharks. And now I can’t believe we just watched ourselves on TV.”



In 2018 Gassen and Schott were working together at the same Covington insurance company when they came up with the idea of simplifying the mundane task of making the bed. Schott a New Orleans native and attorney by trade who serves as COO of the health and benefits management company Gilsbar searched every conceivable way to revolutionize making the bed. Schott had just purchased new beds for a summer house and the beds were exceptionally difficult to make. Schott realized that her son had been sleeping on the couch rather than in the new beds all to avoid having to wrestle with changing the sheets. Feeling determined Schott called Gassen a longtime friend and Luling native who immediately began brainstorming.

While both continued to work full-time jobs the two friends started using their nights and weekends to pursue their mission. First they wandered around a Home Depot together looking for inspiration. Soon the women were on a relentless journey which included lots of trial and error to find the perfect solution. Then Gassen had an idea. She bought a sewing machine and she taught herself how to sew.

Sitting in her living room Gassen pieced together the first Better Bedder which acts as a giant head band that wraps around the bed keeping both fitted and flat sheets in place – and can even serve as a makeshift phone holder. You put it on once and then consider it a part of your mattress. From then on instead of tucking your sheets underneath your mattress you can tuck directly into the Better Bedder no longer needing to lift the heavy mattress. The new imaginative bed band allows for making the bed with minimal effort.

“Once the invention was created we immediately realized this product could dramatically change the morning routine of millions of people who usually resist making the bed” Gassen said. “More than that it could make changing the sheets simple.”

But Gassen hardly a seamstress was not up to the task of churning out Better Bedders. Instead the pair embarked on a search to find a manufacturer. After considering facilities all over the region they found the perfect sew shop in Algiers.

Before long Gassen and Schott were selling Better Bedders at local markets and online. Their adult children began to help them taking shifts at the sales booths and creating their online presence. As their hobby turned into a family affair the positive customer reviews poured in and they realized they were indeed really helping people.

According to the Better Bedder website the invention helps “seniors the disabled neat freaks sleepers who run marathons at night and kick the sheets loose and people who want to make their beds but are too lazy. Now all these folks can make their beds with little effort in just seconds.”

One aspect of the Better Bedder that customers love is that it does not require any special sheets. Customers can use any sheets from any store. Another perk is that sheets will stay in place all night. The corners will no longer pop off and your bed will stay neat.

To date the couple has sold more than 15000 Better Bedders with revenues nearing one million dollars. Now with the success on tonight’s ABC-TV top-rated “Shark Tank” show Gassen and Schott are planning for a major expansion of the Better Bedder’s production marketing and distribution.

COVID has kicked the proverbial can down the road a bit. And according to a growing number of inflight connectivity stakeholders meaningful industry adoption is still years away.

Hughes

Hughes Network Systems has an interesting position in the discussion. Under an agreement forged late last year with LEO satellite operator OneWeb Hughes is to develop and manufacture the core module for OneWeb user terminals – for both electronically and mechanically steered antennas – including for the aero market and other verticals.

Company vice president Reza Rasoulian told Runway Girl Network that while ESA technology “continues to get better and better” and will likely be beneficial to the aero ecosystem in time Hughes expects them to be fielded “over the next three to five years”.

We are eager to add ESAs to our toolkit to help airlines achieve their connectivity needs. We don’t really see any solution in the near-term. There are still some challenges that folks are trying to solve.

Flat panel antennas with a mechanical component such as ThinKom Solutions’ VICTS antennas offer big promise however. According to Rasoulian Hughes has seen “rock solid results” with the GDC Technics-developed Falcon 300 terminal for Texas-based Hillwood Airways a system that builds on ThinKom’s Ka2517 antenna and is paired with Kontron wifi and media server elements. Hughes’ Ka-band GEO satellites power the service.

“The Hillwood aircraft has been flying on our network for close to a year now and we’re seeing fantastic performance” Rasoulian confided earlier this year.

That also bodes well for the new Inmarsat/Hughes GX+ North America solution which uses a GDC Technics terminal comprising the Ka2517 antenna and Kontron hardware.

Inmarsat

Indeed Inmarsat is positioning GDC’s new terminal – with ThinKom VICTS – as not just an integral part of GX+ North America but a global solution for global GX transmissions available alongside Honeywell’s mechanically-steered JetWave hardware for GX.

“In the long term ESA antennas are expected to become the standard for the industry however the date by which a cost effective highly functional ESA solution will be available continues to move to the right. We continuously work with antenna providers including of ESA solutions to test these solutions on the Inmarsat networks” said Inmarsat Aviation SVP inflight business Niels Steenstrup.

For its part Honeywell wants to be out in front of developments in electronically steerable antennas for aviation especially given the build-out of low-latency LEO and MEO constellations but the hardware has got to have the right size power and cost.

“We’re not quite sure that it’s ready yet but it matures every year” said Honeywell vice president and general manager aerospace and connectivity services John Peterson noting that Honeywell has some of the best RF people in the world.

What we’re doing is being very careful to make sure that any hardware investments that we make have to maximize the most market that can be captured. That’s the responsibility of any prudent investor in hardware.

Honeywell isn’t precluded from working with other ESA providers with Peterson noting that the firm “has a couple of things that are secret sauces and one of them is our software. Our ability to track and locate and switch … and we also have a lot of really good software with routing and with managing networks specific and unique to aviation. It’s not unusual for us to see ourselves as a software industrial company.”

With the right ESA hardware Honeywell could be “an amazing software integrator and someone else could manage the hardware. That’s not unusual for us these days.”

Gogo

Intelsat-owned Gogo Commercial Aviation sees a similar timeline for the introduction of viable ESAs in aero.

The entire industry sees ESAs as “the next logical step” in antenna evolution Gogo Commercial Aviation president John Wade told RGN in December 2020 “but we believe they’ve got quite a long ways to go before they’re going to be ready for primetime and even then they won’t be able to offer the same level of performance that we can get from ThinKom’s antennas that we use for 2Ku.”

He continued:

So we think the timeline is longer than … is a little further away than the guys making the antennas at least would have us believe. And it’s not just a question of is it available but it’s a question of what’s the reliability? What is the RF performance etc.? We’re seeing incredible performance from the ThinKom antennas today. They’ve always performed extremely well in terms of their RF performance. But now their on-wing reliability is huge. It’s measured in hundreds of thousands of hours now. You’re very aware we went through the deicing issue a few years ago. And all the lessons we learned from that means we’ve now got antennas which perform better than any antenna I can think of.

Gogo famously white labeled the Ku-band version of ThinKom’s VICTS antenna as Gogo 2Ku. It is interesting that 2Ku will compete with GX+ North America (as well as GX globally) each with hardware from ThinKom.

It is often assumed that business aircraft operators will be the first to adopt ESA antenna architecture but Wade thinks we might see ESAs “emerging first on larger commercial transports” given the limited fuselage space on most business aircraft though he allows that he could be proven wrong.

The Gogo Commercial Aviation president added: “I don’t know which aircraft would take advantage of it first but I think the industry is aligned that whoever leads the way in terms of the flurry of people that are developing the ESAs there will be two or three that stand ahead of the rest…”

Qest

Management at antennamaker Qest disagree with Wade’s prediction vis-à-vis where ESAs will first emerge in aviation. In an interview with RGN Qest chief commercial officer Michael Stobinski and CTO Michael Seifried suggested that phased array antennas for LEO and MEO constellations will initially enable connectivity on smaller sized regional jets and business jets.

Large bizjets have tail-mount or fuselage-mount but a huge number of smaller bizjets only have L-band connectivity today especially outside of North America. “The big strength of LEO systems will be getting the terminals small and really efficient. That’s the big selling point of them in the end.”

Qest’s next generation Ka-band antenna is mechanically-steered but the company is keeping its fingers in the ESA pie as well recently forming a sister company to advance its phased array work. Noting that readiness “really depends on when LEO constellations are ready” Seifried shared his personal opinion that ESA readiness for aero will take at least two years maybe more.

The Qest executives also weighed in on rival ThinKom’s Ka2517 antenna suggesting it might be good for the United States but doubting it’s a good and efficient international terminal “at least from what we know from requirements which come to us from satellite operators”.

That doesn’t mesh with ThinKom’s experience.

“[We] wish to point out that the likes of Gogo and (more recently) Inmarsat Hughes Thales and (soon to be disclosed) others have diligently evaluated the full-range of available (and even ‘soon to be available’) IFC antennas and suppliers including the full spectrum of phased-array and gimbaled flat-plate antenna technologies” said ThinKom CTO Bill Milroy.

“Based on their findings and including all of the key IFC-specific metrics including price performance size reliability power consumption coverage GSO/NGSO interoperability Satellite OPEX weight/drag/fuel-burn etc. they’ve ultimately chosen to go with ThinKom.”

SmartSky

Phasor Solutions which was acquired out of bankruptcy by Hanwha Systems is widely assumed to be among the top aero ESA contenders. The former CEO of Phasor David Helfgott is now the CEO of SmartSky Networks.

While ESAs aren’t specifically relevant to SmartSky’s nextgen air-to-ground (ATG) inflight connectivity solution the company tracks adjacent technologies. For the uninitiated passive arrays are lower cost and lower performing. “They don’t beam form as accurately they don’t scan as accurately. That makes them ill-suited to aviation for sure because you have adjacent satellite interference and the gain of the satcom bandwidth is poor” Helfgott explained.

Active arrays meanwhile such as from the likes of SatixFy Collins Aerospace and Phasor tend to be chip-based actively scanned arrays. Usually they offer higher performance “but they tend to be more expensive and more power consumptive so the trick is can these type of antennas come down fast enough” he noted.

So a compromise is ThinKom’s flat-panel VICTS he said noting that VICTS is very good technology but heavy so you wouldn’t equip it to a classic business jet for instance.

NXTCOMM

A new flat-panel antenna maker on the scene NXTCOMM acknowledged the challenges of cracking into aviation with ESAs when GEO satellite constellations are powering most IFC solutions. But perhaps unsurprisingly the company takes a rosier view of the ESA market for commercial aviation though it’s focusing its efforts on defense in the near-term.

“IFEC stakeholders more likely believe that ESAs may not be the right product to support GEO constellations for the right price. I’d expect today’s ESAs to be cost competitive to mechanically steered antennas with higher reliability. The ESAs promised in the last decade never delivered on their promises and their poor aperture efficiency only made the potential offerings significantly larger than what NXTCOMM envisions bringing to market. Larger sized ESAs almost always equate to more cost and lower reliability as well” suggested NXTCOMM chief commercial officer Stephen Newell.

“The same IFC stakeholders now see LEOs on the horizon and that revolution cannot be unlocked with the current crop of mechanically steered antennas. LEO networks complement ESAs allowing for smaller antennas and more bandwidth. All the IFEC providers see this conundrum: LEOs will be awesome but aren’t here yet and they’ve built out huge networks and deployed thousands of antennas for GEO networks.”

For now however it would seem that ThinKom’s VICTS is sitting pretty.

Learn More ›

When it comes time to replace the manual thermostat in your home the ecobee SmartThermostat is a great option that can regulate the control of your heating and cooling system. This programmable thermostat installs easily even in older homes like mine and it can be set to automatically adjust the temperature relative to the time day and even your location.

Installing a programmable thermostat has been shown to save up to $180 per year on heating and cooling bills. It also saves time by streamlining the operation of your heating and cooling system with multiple ways to interface with the thermostat including a clear digital touchscreen a simple to use app and even voice control when it’s linked with compatible smart home systems. Read on to find out more about my experience with the installation and function of this money-saving device.

Installation

Replacing a thermostat for the first time can seem daunting if you don’t have a lot of experience working with wiring but ecobee makes it easy with multiple video walkthroughs to help simplify the installation.

Due to the age of my house there weren’t enough wires running to the old thermostat from the furnace. The C-wire or common wire was missing which is a requirement for any thermostat that draws power from the furnace instead of a battery.

At first this seemed like a big problem but the ecobee kit prepares you for this situation with an included power extender kit (PEK) that installs directly to the furnace without requiring a full wire run. However it should be mentioned that this installation procedure only works with 120V systems and is not compatible with 240V systems.

Appearance

The ecobee SmartThermostat has a sleek black touchscreen with bold white lettering that’s easy to see from across the room. The menus on the device are simple to use with intuitive commands that allow most users to quickly figure out how to control their heating and cooling system.

The modern design looks great in the house replacing an old worn out thermostat that had a broken cover and wasn’t quite white anymore after more than a decade of use. It also came with an optional extended faceplate to cover up any holes or unpainted drywall left behind when the old thermostat was removed.

App Integration

Once the thermostat is installed it can be accessed through the ecobee app or through a compatible smart home app like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. With the ecobee app the current temperature heating and cooling schedule geofence tracking and alerts can be set and controlled through a mobile device from anywhere with WiFi.

This feature allows you to make changes to the system when you think of it instead of having to remember when you get home from work or back from the store. It also gives you the freedom to program and control the thermostat while relaxing on the back deck or on the couch instead of having to get up walk over to the thermostat and manually change the temperature.

Scheduling

Having an automated program control the heating and cooling in your home can take some getting used to at first and will likely require a few different schedule changes until you find a comfortable pattern. The ecobee allows the user to set schedules based on the day of the week the time throughout the day and even the movement of the people in the home.

In colder months my home’s temperature is set to drop by 2 to 3 degrees at night and when no one is home. In the warmer months my system allows the temperature to climb by 2 to 3 degrees. Preventing excess heating and cooling of an empty home or a home with sleeping occupants is a simple switch that saves money on gas and electric bills.

Smart Home Compatibility

One of the best features of the ecobee for a modern household is the ability to integrate with several different smart home systems including Amazon Alexa Apple Home Kit Google Assistant and Samsung SmartThings. Instead of getting up to manually change the temperature or flipping through menus on the app the smart home integration allows the thermostat and all of its features to be used with voice-commands.

In fact Amazon Alexa is actually built into the thermostat so it can be controlled through voice command as soon as it’s set up. By connecting the ecobee with other smart home devices it can be programmed to work with If This Then That (IFTTT) protocols creating a whole-home network of interconnected devices.

Savings

The initial cost of the ecobee thermostat is definitely higher than a standard manual thermostat due to the various features it offers. However when a consistent temperature schedule is set the savings on heating and cooling slowly begin to pile up with the potential to save up to $180 per year.

The change is subtle at first because the idea is to reduce the heating and cooling output through the course of a day without sacrificing comfort at home. After a few months on the new automated schedule the change should begin to be noticeable and you may even qualify for a rebate from your local utility provider.

Extra Features

Beyond the main scheduling benefits app integrations and smart home compatibility the ecobee also has several additional features that make it more user-friendly. Geofencing technology allows the thermostat to track the GPS movement of a mobile device within a specific range known as a geofence. The ecobee uses this technology to automatically switch between an ‘Away’ temperature and a ‘Home’ temperature when it detects the user’s device within the geofence.

It also comes with a room sensor that can be placed in a different room of the home. The sensor sends temperature readings back to the thermostat allowing the ecobee to make adjustments to the heating and cooling output for more fine-tuned temperatures throughout the home.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vc3RsdWNpYS5sb29wbmV3cy5jb20vbm9kZS81MjcwNzLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elderly woman's vehicle overturns in sea at Pigeon Island | Loop St. Lucia,"An elderly female driver was hospitalized after her vehicle plunged into the sea Sunday morning.

The 6-6 junior transferred to the Gophers from Utah to be closer to family and friends to have them right there supporting him in the crowd.

Because of the pandemic they didn't get to see him play in-person until mid-January. His older brother and cousins were there to see the Gophers upset then-No. 7 Michigan.

But it was all so fleeting. Over the past month Gach and the Gophers have hurtled into a downward spiral punctuated by Thursday's humiliating loss to Northwestern. Coach Richard Pitino appears to be back on the hot seat and in the midst of all this is Gach who is too injured and too flustered to help turn things around.

""Both is really hobbled"" Pitino said of Gach who went scoreless and played just 10 minutes against Northwestern because of a foot injury.

The last time Gach went home to Austin was in the fall. He stopped by to check on his siblings and mother who despite several back surgeries still works nights and long hours to support their family in the U.S. and back in her native country of South Sudan.

""His main goal was to come back and be around family"" said Gach's older brother Gach Gach. ""That he can't do that might be contributing to him struggling in my opinion.""

A game-changing performer for the Gophers earlier this season Both Gach has made it tough for family to watch him now. He's definitely not himself heading into Saturday's game at Nebraska.

Besides the lingering injury it's also been difficult for him to keep his mind only on basketball. His mother's ongoing health issues and her family tragedy in Sudan weigh heavily on him Gach's brother said.

""It's something that brings him down"" he said. ""We're trying to keep his morale and happiness up. But during these times it gets tough.""

Mom's strength

Working late shifts at Hormel Foods in Austin over the years Martha Deng like many Sudanese immigrants in town has spent more time working than at home with her children.

""She means a lot"" Both Gach said. ""There were times where I didn't see her for a couple days because of her work schedule and my school schedule. Always put in the work and never complained.""

Gach's parents escaped a country suffering through its second Civil War when they made it from South Sudan to a refugee camp in Kenya before traveling to New York in 1996. They eventually followed work to Minnesota living in Brooklyn Park and Faribault before setting down roots in Austin.

For as long as Gach and his twin brother Duoth can remember their parents were divorced. Their mother raised five of her seven children mostly on her own. Her oldest boy Gach Gach took his younger brothers to the local YMCA to shoot hoops until the doors closed at 9 p.m.

""We did everything together"" Both Gach said ""Whether it was playing sports or hanging out.""

Things have since gotten harder on his family. Both Gach's grandmother died of natural causes last year. His uncle was murdered during the strife and violence going on in Sudan.

A trip his mother had planned to her homeland for the first time since she departed decades ago had to be canceled because of COVID-19 concerns last year. She now looks after both her own kids and her brother's children. Martha Deng sends money shoes and supplies to help with their school.

""It's been difficult with some family members who passed away"" Both Gach said. ""My mom tries to collect our old clothes and things. And she sends it back to our family in Africa. For us it's about trying to help them out as much as we can.""

'I'm going D-I'

Gach Gach was the first Sudanese high school star at Austin leading the Packers to back-to-back state runner-up finishes in 2013 and 2014.

Playing basketball at West Texas A&M the 6-4 guard went to an NCAA Division II Final Four and became the first in his immediate family to earn a college degree in 2019.

But the elder Gach already could see his younger brothers had the talent and potential to surpass his own.

""I pretty much knew early on"" said Gach Gach who now lives in North Dakota. ""They told me 'I'm going D-I.' I said 'OK let's get to work.' We were trying to inspire a younger generation. Pretty much set your dreams and anything can happen.""

The uber-athletic Gach twins matched their brother's success on the hardwood. They teamed up to lead the Packers to the state tournament and finished runner-up in 2017.

Duoth starred at Lake Region State College in North Dakota but he's back in Austin now working on his academics to be eligible to play Division I basketball.

While he was at Utah for two years Both saw how much they inspired the Sudanese youth in Austin. He was once like them learning the game at the same YMCA — and now he was playing D-I ball.

""There were kids trying to take my shoes off"" Both Gach said about being home. ""They wanted my jersey and all the gear and bags I brought home. I know these kids look at me as their big role model. I just try to tell them to stay focused.""

Staying healthy and confident

Utah fans were wondering what happened to Both Gach last season when a knee injury led to inconsistency in his Pac-12 play.

When Gach finally got healthy he averaged 20 points during a late three-game stretch. That included a career-high 28 points in the regular-season finale last March to help the Utes beat Colorado in overtime. Gach finished the season strong enough that he declared for the NBA draft to explore the process before returning to college.

Could there be a similar turnaround with the Gophers? They need it with junior guard Gabe Kalscheur sidelined by a broken finger. Gach lost his starting job in late January but they've looked to him as a bench spark.

""We saw earlier in the year the amount of good things Both can do"" Pitino said.

Gach complemented point guard Marcus Carr nicely when he averaged 14.7 points 6.4 rebounds 3.6 assists and shot 57% in seven nonconference games. But he's struggled in the Big Ten averaging 4.1 points on 29% shooting in 16 games.

The transfer home hasn't been what Gach hoped for but he's doing what he can to just be on the court carrying the weight of his family's troubles and a hometown that adores him.

""Obviously I haven't been performing how I should be"" Gach said earlier this season. ""For me it's about being confident when I'm out there on the court and putting other things aside.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The luxury coupe from Munich not only gets a series of aftermarket upgrades but also a significant increase in power output. The two models tuned by the German shop are the 430i and M440i. A performance upgrade for the BMW M440d will follow in the future also. The AC Schnitzer performance upgrades for the 430i brings the standard power from 190 kW/258 HP/400 Nm to 220 kW/300 HP/470 Nm. The M440i xDrive also gets a significant power boost: from 275 kW/374 HP/500 Nm to 309 kW/420 HP/600 Nm.

The six-cylinder timbre is further enhanced by the AC Schnitzer exhaust system made of stainless steel with two “Carbon Sport” or “Sport” tailtrims (chromed or black) in right/left combination. An AC Schnitzer sports suspension is also included lowering the car by approximately 15 – 25 mm. This translate into greater agility and sportiness. The pure suspension spring set comes a little deeper even lowering the suspension by 30 millimeters.

Improving the downforce was one of AC Schnitzer’s goals. With front spoiler elements front splitter side skirts rear roof spoiler and a carbon rear spoiler the Aachen-based company supplies components for the production vehicle which provide more downforce at the front and rear axle. AC Schnitzer rear skirt protection foil and emblems (left and right) are also available.

For the wheel sets AC Schnitzer has various options in its range. The AC1 alloy wheels in BiColor Silver/Anthracite or Anthracite (front: 8.5J x 20″ with 235/35 R 20 tires; rear: 10.0J x 20″ with 265/30 R 20 tires) and AC1 alloy wheels in BiColor Silver/Anthracite or Anthracite (front: 8.5J x 19″ with 225/40 R 19 tires; rear: 8.5J x 19″ with 255/35 R 19 tires) are available. All rims can also be optionally painted gloss black.

Now the company has announced that it will be known as Zepp Health from now on. This wholesale re-brand is intended to consolidate its position across all its businesses going forward

4 Reviews

Huami Corporation originally gained recognition as the ODM for the Xiaomi Mi Band line of fitness trackers. It subsequently struck out on its own through its Amazfit line of wearables which now range from the experimental flexible-display X to the broadly-appealing affordable Bip series. Now it has announced a name change that as it believes will keep this success going.

It has announced that it has officially (and legally pending regulatory approval) transformed into Zepp Health Corporation a rebadging that applies to all of its markets worldwide and every aspect of its business: even its New York stock exchange (NYSE) ID is now ZEPP.

This transition has been in the works since it bought the Zepp (a company originating in Silicon Valley with an association with health technology) brand recently: for example Huami wearables have paired to phones using the app of this name for quite a while now.

The company has adopted this name across the board in an effort to underpin the connection between human welfare and technology that as it asserts it represents. Huami - sorry Zepp Health - has also done this to hammer the fact that it is no longer merely a wearables-maker home.

Indeed it asserts that it has also ""developed a platform of proprietary technology including AI chips biometric sensors and health data algorithms"". Using this not to mention its new name it intends to expand into many more areas of health tech including connected health products analytics for insurers and precision possibly actually clinical sensors.

To this end the company has secured ""strategic partnerships"" with companies in these fields such as Hyperfine Promaxo and Prudential Asia to bring these goals to fruition. Finally the corporation has declared that ""Zepp"" is more universal across cultures and languages as well as simply easier to say.

However it has yet to outline the effect this change will have on Amazfit and the brand recognition it has built up not to mention that of its various series which have multiplied to include GTS GTR Stratos and T-Rex to date.

While the eighth-gen Golf GTI is a competent hot hatch on its own its 242 HP output means it is outclassed by rivals such as the Honda Civic Type R and Renault Megane R.S.

As a result there are already quite a few aftermarket upgrades including this one from RaceChip who offers three different states of tune.

All of them are simple software updates with the lesser offering improving the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine’s output and torque by 36 PS (35 HP / 26 kW) and 33 Nm (24 lb-ft). It costs €199 ($243) in Germany and promises up to 10 percent less fuel consumption compared to the stock car.

The mid-range offering is priced at €329 ($401) and brings an extra 45 PS (44 HP / 33 kW) and 42 Nm (31 lb-ft) improving fuel economy by up to 15 percent. For another €50 ($61) customers can get the optional app control and the tune comes with a one-year engine warranty covering damages of up to €3000 ($3658).

RaceChip’s ultimate ECU remap unleashes 55 PS (54 HP / 40 kW) and 50 Nm (37 lb-ft) which means that the Golf GTI now has new GTI Clubsport-rivalling power with a total of 300 PS (296 HP / 221 kW) and 420 Nm (310 lb-ft) 20 Nm (15 lb-ft) more than the Clubsport.

This tune costs €599 ($ 724) and is accompanied by a two-year engine warranty that covers engine damages of up to €10000 ($12193). The company also offers a free one-time re-map in case you sell your car.

The tuner applied the more powerful upgrade to their Golf GTI and strapped it to the dyno revealing that it makes 312 PS (308 HP / 229 kW). They also demonstrated the new 100-200 km/h (62-124 mph) acceleration time on video which has dropped from around 16 to a little over 12 seconds."
HUBB,Hubbell Incorporated,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oZXJhbGR0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvcGdhLzIwMjEvMDIvMjcvbW9udGVycnViaW8tbWFrZXMtc3VyZS12b2x1bnRlZXJzLWNvbmNlc3Npb24tc3RheS10aGVpci10b2VzLzY4NTE0ODEwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Monterrubio makes sure volunteers at The Concession stay on their toes,"BRADENTON - A couple volunteers punching in the player scores electronically during Saturday's third round of the Workday Championship at The Concession Golf Club need more practice on their trigger fingers.

The scores are flashed around the world including to bettors just waiting for a changing number to be posted tardy thereby allowing them to get in a wager and sure winner.

""You got 10 seconds"" said Hugo Monterrubio the volunteer chairman for the tournament. ""But some people don't react well to that stress or pressure. We always have a backup.""

Unfortunately for the well-meaning volunteers their backups replaced them on Saturday one of about 34697 situations of varying importance the 54-year-old Monterrubio has had to involve himself in during his two weeks in the area preparing for the Workday.

It comes with the job and the title. At this event he's the volunteer chairman as he said ""from recruiting to selecting the leadership team and training them. Providing them the tools to operate the whole thing.""

He managed to round up more than 300 not all members of The Concession but that number pales to what was required of Monterrubio when the event was held annually in Mexico.

There he needed about 1200. When he did the events at the Doral Golf Resort day care was available. ""The wives come down to Miami and want to go shopping"" he said. ""What about the kids?"" In 2001 Monterrubio's office was two blocks from Doral when his wife told him Tiger Woods would be playing there and that a friend could get the two tickets.

He wound up meeting the friend who was a volunteer at the tournament. ""Hey that's a sweet gig"" Monterrubio told the guy. So sweet that he ended up volunteering at golf tournaments himself. ""Once you do it the one time"" he said ""you get hooked for it.""

He did events in and around Miami but when the World Golf Championship event was moved to Mexico starting in 2017 Monterrubio was asked to help his air fare and hotel picked up.

That first year ""everything was wrong. It wasn't a culture of golf. I wanted to quit."" But every year he returned to eventually become ""this super volunteer."" He was made the general chairman and ended up working the 2017 Presidents Cup at Liberty National Golf Club in New Jersey.

In looking for leaders the vice-president of sales and marketing for Hubbell Incorporated a company which makes and sells electronic products said it's important to correctly judge character. ""The hardest thing in the world is to manage a team of volunteers"" Monterrubio said. ""What are you going to do if they don't show up to work? Are you going to fire him?""

When the Fort Lauderdale resident realized this year's event would be held at The Concession he was told by the PGA he would have to ""handle everything."" And Monterrubio had just 45 days to do it. He was given just 36 hours to set up a data base for early-bird registration of Concession members for volunteer spots followed two days later for the general public.

He got 65 Concession members. He needed around 300. He opened it up to non-members and within 48 hours more than 300 signed up. ""Never in my life have I ever seen that amount of passion and reaction for golf from a local community"" he said. ""I was floored.""

Monterrubio has 21 chairmen with volunteers under them doing everything from keeping the area clean around the practice range to checking IDs to being involved in player transportation to working in the clubhouse with the caddies and players.

Monterrubio got some pretty impressive volunteers. One guy sent him a picture volunteering at a Masters. ""Ninety-nine percent of the people I picked for leadership positions if I had to run another tournament here in a year or 5 years they would be the exact same people because they are so freaking good.""

Ms. Glenn won a second term in the state House just four months ago defeating Democratic candidate Sarah Schulz in a bitter election.

State Sen. Jim Stamas who was elected in 2018 to a four-year term is term-limited.

The committee Annette Glenn for State Senate was formed on Feb. 23. Organizing paperwork lists Jenell Leonard as the committee’s treasurer. The committee’s bank is listed as Huntington Bank on N. Saginaw Rd. Ms. Leonard is also the treasurer for Ms. Glenn’s other committee Annette Glenn for Michigan.

Midland has a tradition of sending its G.O.P. state representatives to the state Senate in a game of ‘musical politicians’ due to term-limits. Then-State Rep. Tony Stamas was elected to the state Senate after serving in the state House then State Rep. John Moolenaar was elected to the state Senate after serving in the state House before moving on to replace U.S. Rep. Dave Camp; and Jim Stamas was elected to his current post after having served in the state House.

This is a developing story.

Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that State Sen. Jim Stamas was elected last November. Mr. Stamas was in fact elected in Nov. 2018 to a four-year term in the state Senate.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Workers have been job hopping in the hopes of attaining better pay and career mobility in the uncertain Covid-19 economy and it is a trend that millennials and Gen Z are expected to dominate again in 2021. One in four workers plan to switch jobs this year an increased pace compared to last year. Of the one in five workers who switched jobs last year 33% identified as Gen Z and 25% as millennial according to a new study from IBM 's Institute for Business Value. Gallup identifies millennials as the most likely among generations to switch careers and suggests that six in ten millennials are open to new job opportunities. But the idea that millennials and Gen Z created this trend is a common misconception. Every generation job hops in their youth in the search for the right career fit and some data suggests that millennials are job hopping at a slower rate than their previous generational counterparts at the same age. Across the board younger people including those in their 30s and 40s are much more likely to shift jobs and take risks compared to older workers who are more established in their careers according to Gad Levanon vice president of the Labor Markets Institute at The Conference Board. With the worst of the pandemic behind the U.S. and accelerated vaccine rollouts nationwide people foresee a reopening of industries like retail and air travel and aren't as worried about significant layoffs or being the ""first to go"" in a new role. ""It's a period with a lot of changes and combined with strong economic growth people are no longer afraid to switch jobs"" Levanon said. Younger Americans are updating some of the tactics in career switches for a changing world. Not only are younger workers seeking job mobility but they're also looking for flexible and remote work schedules a need that's come to the forefront amid Covid-19. Many younger workers are also incorporating skills training to market themselves as more competitive candidates. The role of millennials in the job market is of growing significance. Based on July 2019 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau millennials have surpassed Baby Boomers as the largest living adult population and made up more than one-third of the U.S. workforce in 2018 according to Pew Research Center. The organization defines millennials as those born between 1981 and 1996 while Gen Z begins with those born in 1997.

Job seekers want good pay and benefits

Some of the most prominent reasons for job hopping include the desire for career mobility and higher wages a growing need as employer pension plans become a thing of the past and workers need to devote more of their incomes to retirement savings. Between 1975 and 2017 pension plans dropped from more than 103000 to just about 46700 according to the Labor Department. Younger workers are also sensitive to lack of recognition or transparent feedback from supervisors which can lead workers to feel undervalued and ultimately move to a new company where they may be in a better position to negotiate pay said Sarah Stoddard a career expert at Glassdoor. Several companies including global staffing firm Robert Half  offer salary calculators to job seekers as a tool to use for negotiations. Glassdoor has its own version called the Know Your Worth tool which offers pay recommendations based on market value. Read more from Invest in You

How three millennials earning over $100000 spend their money

Changing jobs? Consider transfer of 401(k) savings Amid this drive for higher wages and mobility corporations will need to shift how they prioritize and invest in employees to retain talent. For example companies may need to offer flexible benefits based on stages in life and internal mobility said Amy Wright managing partner of talent and transformation at IBM. One of the biggest concerns for workers as indicated in the IBM study is the need for more flexible schedules. Workers want a better work-life balance increased benefits and job support but they are also looking for skills development which can qualify candidates for jobs typically out of their reach Wright said. Fifty-eight percent of those surveyed by IBM said that they plan to take continuing education courses this year while roughly 30% of Gen Z and millennial respondents surveyed said they will enroll in a formal degree certification or badging program. Continuing education and skills building has emerged as a way for job seekers to distinguish themselves. IBM offers SkillsBuild a platform that allows workers to sharpen skills like their computer literacy or data analytics through online courses. Several major companies including Google and Microsoft 's LinkedIn also offer courses for workers as do online education platforms that have boomed during the pandemic including Coursera. The shift to online amid Covid-19 and growth of digital technology within the last decade has simplified the ability to job hop while making it easier for talent to interview and work for companies out of their region. ""It's an availability of opportunity that didn't exist in previous generations"" Wright said.

Switching jobs no longer a red flag

Once deemed a red-flag for recruiters switching jobs has become more common and accepted said Vicki Salemi a career expert at Monster. The pandemic will further destigmatize job-hopping but it also has led to financial stress that may further exacerbate the need to find new employment. With the rise of student loans and an uncertain economy there's a sense of urgency for new workers to find a job that pays the bill which means many individuals entering the job market are settling for jobs that aren't the right fit. ""They may not necessarily find the right fit in the first job or even the next one"" Salemi said. While new job seekers may struggle employers are becoming more open to candidates they may not have considered in the past. Data from the Monster's Future of Work 2021 Global Outlook found that industries including health care and hospitality are becoming more open to graduates without previous experience in the field while nearly half of large businesses surveyed are reporting higher acceptance of candidates living outside their geographic area.

There has long been this maligning of millennials as being job hoppers. I think that that's the wrong story. Job hopping is something we want to see more of.

A shining example of this is the works and life of John von Neumann.

John von Neumann was born on December 28 1903 in Budapest Hungary. From a young age von Neumann was a prodigy because of his advanced ability to compute large equations and memorize extensive lists of numbers. Despite his mathematic abilities he got his first degree in chemical engineering though he later returned to his love of mathematics when he got his doctoral degree in 1928.

Eventually during a politically-stressful time in Europe von Neumann received an invitation from Princeton to visit which led to his lifelong role as one of the first six founding professors for the Institute for Advanced Studies (IAS) mathematics.

Work on the Manhattan Project

During WWII von Neumann was one of the chosen few to work on the Manhattan Project specifically at Los Alamos. His role on the project was to calculate the explosive shockwaves for the Fat Man atomic bomb. To conduct those calculations he utilized a specialized IBM mechanical tabulating machine.

Using the IBM machine von Neumann worked on the atomic bomb implosion design from Seth Neddermeyer. Neddermeyer's design required a hollow sphere that included fissionable plutonium that could implode symmetrically. This symmetry was necessary to get the plutonium into a critical mass at the center.

At this time computers tended to be mostly human-powered with humans doing most of the tedious calculations on a mechanical calculator which usually broke down after extensive use. This issue caused von Neumann to consider the use of mechanical devices that could handle more general computations and led him to design an architecture for such a device––later becoming the von Neuman (or Princeton) architecture.

Von Neumann (Princeton) Architecture

After the war when von Neumann was creating his computer architecture he was inspired by the relationship between a computer and the brain namely the language of mathematics and the nervous system. This way of thinking lead to the concept of the von Neumann architecture including memory a CPU and I/O interfaces.

von Neumann's work with computing was largely reliant on Alan Turing another mathematician at Princeton. Though von Neumann wanted to create the first computer the invention of the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) had already occurred.

Undeterred von Neumann went on to create the first IAS computer which was based on his architecture. von Neumann decided that one major feature of the IAS computer was that future advances were to be public domain. Since this innovation was open to the public it spurred momentum for creating computers and building upon the original creation.

The von Neumann Bottleneck

Though revolutionary at the time the von Neumann architecture has its faults. The von Neuman Bottleneck (VNB) is when a computing system doesn't have an adequate data transfer rate between the CPU and memory. This bottleneck occurs because the CPU must idle while the system is accessing the memory. A way to overcome this effect is to integrate memory and data into a single unit thus allowing the data to be store and utilized at the same time.

Though John von Neumann's work is growing out of use in some applications there is no doubt that his contributions to engineering have helped bring computing where it is today.

Back in November 2020 China North Industries Group Corporation Limited (NORINCO) announced its Golden Eagle CR500 vertical take-off and landing UAV had completed final inspections and been cleared for delivery to an undisclosed costumer.

We now know who that customer is.

According to a report by Chyrine Mezher for Breaking Defense and quoting an anonymous source the UAE army plans to buy a bunch of new Chinese unmanned aerial vehicles.

“The deals could include 10 to 15 Golden Eagle CR500 helo drones fitted with Red Arrow 12 missiles and 20 MR40 unmanned aircraft fitted with BBE-2 bombs” the official said adding that both deals will approximately cost US$9 million and US$7 million respectively.

The UAE is also set to receive “thousands of related missile systems” he added with the CR500 being able carry up to 150KG of payloads. “We expect the first trials to take place in October and deliveries to start within a year.”

IDEX by the way is the only international defence exhibition and conference in the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa) demonstrating the latest technology across land sea and air sectors of defence.

It draws defense firms from around the world and for the first time this year Israel also attended the show.

Although Israel has had quiet dealing with the United Arab Emirates and some Gulf states for years the ability to seek joint ventures and partnerships openly is new National Interest reported.

This has all come about in the wake of the Abraham Accords last year which saw Bahrain and the UAE normalize relations.

According to a Chinese spokesperson the CR500 has an endurance of up to five hours and can fly up to 3000 meters while the MH40 can fly for about 30 minutes over a 5-km range while it performs reconnaissance and research missions Breaking Defense reported.

NORINCO has said the CR500 Golden Eagle is a coaxial rotor helicopter drone designed for multiple missions including battlefield reconnaissance target positioning and illuminating communication relay and battle damage assessment.

“The drone can carry a large payload has a long endurance even when fully loaded and a compact structure that can be easily stored and transported. It can also resist strong winds carry different types of electro-optical pods and payloads and act as a logistics support craft and deliver materials with pinpoint accuracy” the company says.

The MR40-series is equipped with four rotors and could be fitted with search and targeting radars and reconnaissance subsystems and armed with an array of weapons including guided missiles and fragmentation bombs Breaking Defense reported.

This comes in light of a relatively new Emirati-Chinese strategy to work on long-term R&D projects for unmanned systems which was obvious at the show.

Located directly in front of UAE’s agglomerate EDGE Group was the China-Emirates Science and Technology innovation laboratory (CEST) a joint project between UAE’s International Golden Group and NORINCO Breaking Defense reported.

“This project has been going on for more than a year now and focuses on research and development within the field of UAVs” disclosed the Chinese spokesperson. “Being here at IDEX adds so much value to our work and proves our commitment to the UAE defense industry and the region.”

CEST showcased a wide range of Chinese products at IDEX but mainly focused on unmanned systems and their missiles including the CR500 MR40 and MR150 UAVs.

Meanwhile the overall exhibition saw reports of more than US$1 billion in deals announced the first day National Interest reported.

IDEX runs from February 21 for five days.

Omar bin Sultan Al Olama Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence Digital Economy and Teleworking Applications said that the UAE is a country that looks ahead.

“We plan proactively rather than reactively to changes and artificial intelligence will reshape the world as we know it. We are seeing an increasing infusion of systems that are productive and critical to our economies. Defending these systems is as critical as defending the sovereignty of our nation” he said.

According to Al Jazeera Chinese armed drones have made a significant effect on the battlefields across the Middle East and North Africa.

They have been used to assassinate Houthi rebel leaders in Yemen kill ISIL-affiliated fighters in the Sinai and for a time help Khalifa Haftar dominate the battlespace in Libya.

While the US has traditionally refused to sell its latest advanced weapons systems China is not bound by such constraints and has had no problem exporting its drones right across the Middle East and Africa.

Factories under licence to build Chinese armed drones have been set up in Pakistan Saudi Arabia and Myanmar. Exports of Chinese drones are so extensive the sales have made China the second-largest arms exporter in the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5LmFmcmljYS8yMDIxLzAyL2lkZXgtMjAyMS1ydXNzaWEtdW52ZWlscy1icmFuZC1uZXcta29yZC1hc3NhdWx0LXJpZmxlLWZvci1zcGVjaWFsLWZvcmNlcy_SAXNodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxpdGFyeS5hZnJpY2EvMjAyMS8wMi9pZGV4LTIwMjEtcnVzc2lhLXVudmVpbHMtYnJhbmQtbmV3LWtvcmQtYXNzYXVsdC1yaWZsZS1mb3Itc3BlY2lhbC1mb3JjZXMvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IDEX 2021: Russia unveils brand-new Kord assault rifle for special forces,"

DG2 Xe-HPG variants start from 96 EUs and 4 GB GDDR6 VRAM and will top-out at 512 EUs with 16 GB GDDR6 VRAM to take on NVIDIA GA104 and AMD RX 6800 offerings.

Intel recently introduced its first modern dGPU the DG1 or Xe Max for Tiger Lake laptops and select desktop configurations. During the previous Architecture Day event Intel's graphics chief Raja Koduri said that the company will soon launch DG2 or Xe-HPG products aimed at mainstream gamers and content creators. While we've been hearing about Intel DG2 for quite some time now a recent leak points to possible variants slated to launch later this year.

The info comes from several sources including @harukaze5719 @OneRaichu and @hougetsu on Twitter. We've previously reported that Xe-HPG may feature up to 512 execution units (EUs) or 4096 stream processors (SPs) and that Intel is exploring the possibility of scaling it up to 960 EUs as well. While we are still unsure about the 960-EU part we are now getting to see some information about what all SKUs can be expected along with their VRAM capacities.

According to @hougetsu and @harukaze5719 who happened to decode @OneRaichu's cryptic tweet Xe-HPG could be available in at least six variants. These include:

512 EUs (4096 SPs) / 256 bit-bus / 8 or 16 GB VRAM

384 EUs (3072 SPs) / 192 bit-bus / 6 or 12 GB VRAM

256 EUs (2048 SPs) / 128 bit-bus / 4 or 8 GB VRAM

192 EUs (1536 SPs) / 128 bit-bus / 4 GB VRAM

128 EUs (1024 SPs) / 64 bit-bus / 4 GB VRAM

96 EUs (768 SPs) / 64 bit-bus / 4 GB VRAM

The SKUs start from 96 EUs and go all the way up to 512 EUs. Intel already offers a 96-EU part with DG1 so we can expect the corresponding DG2 version to be faster with improved IPC and with GDDR6 RAM instead of LPDDR4x. The 256 384 and 512-EU variants offer double VRAM choices as well with the highest being 16 GB GDDR6 on a 256-bit bus.

Going by available specs alone RTX 3060 Ti/RTX 3070 levels of performance with the 512-EU variant is not improbable at the very least though the RX 6800 is also a potential competitor here in terms of available memory bandwidth.

While other details of Xe-HPG DG2 aren't yet available we do know that the 384-EU SKU is likely to have a die area of 190 mm2. According to Intel DG2 would be made fabbed in an external foundry which we hear will be a TSMC 6 nm node. It is not yet known how these cards would be named but the company may follow a nomenclature similar to NVIDIA and AMD.

No luck for us with ZLUDA yet but we'll keep trying.

ZLUDA Geekbench performance vs OpenCL

Using a graphics processor or GPU for tasks beyond just rendering 3D graphics is how NVIDIA has made billions in the datacenter space. Of course NVIDIA's proprietary CUDA language and API have been exclusive to the company's GPUs since the beginning. There have been tools to port CUDA apps to widely-supported languages like OpenCL but even semi-automated tools like HIPCL require developer intervention. The latest library on the block however promises to run CUDA apps directly on Intel GPUs without any modifications. Sounds interesting right?The developers behind ZLUDA describe it as a drop-in replacement for CUDA on systems with Intel GPUs from the Skylake family and later. The newest release supports both Windows and Linux clients with 6th-generation (or higher) Core processors with integrated graphics. According to the developers ZLUDA should achieve near-native performance but its feature set is limited. At the present time only Geekbench is really running and prospective users are warned to not rely on it for any production-level software just yet.Using ZLUDA on Windows seems easy enough. We grabbed the latest release from the ZLUDA GitHub page and extracted it into Geekbench. The archive we downloaded includes a ""wrapper"" for any CUDA-enabled application to run it with the bundled CUDA DLL. Then just run the wrapper from the command line with the application as an argument. For example if we navigated to C:\Program Files (x86)\Geekbench 5\ in PowerShell and then ran this command:Geekbench tries to fire up. On our Tiger Lake notebook the app exits with an error in the CUDA libraries. That's not much joy for us on Windows right now but once we get some free time the hope is to give a more serious go at it. On Linux the ZLUDA developers have gotten benchmarks for a Core i5-8700K scoring 6333 with CUDA using the onboard UHD 630 graphics compared to 6482 in OpenCL. That's a slight downtick in performance but the aggregate number hides some interesting individual test scores.ZLUDA's GitHub also shows off some individual Geekbench compute scores and comparing OpenCL to this experimental CUDA implementation. While several benchmarks were significantly slower in ZLUDA the Stereo Matching test was around 50% faster using ZLUDA than it was on OpenCL. That seems pretty promising at first glance but the ReadMe file hints that there is hardware support for certain functions missing on all current Intel integrated GPUs. That might mean that some functions will just be slower in ZLUDA than they would be with OpenCL until the ZLUDA developers work out a way to speed things up. This warning is also illustrative that just because different versions of a test or benchmark outputs the same result doesn't mean that the test does it the same way on each API.It's definitely still early times for ZLUDA which is only seeing its second major release and still has a long way to go. However this will be an interesting project to watch. Intel's DG1 graphics cards are already released to OEMs and it seems like a more robust DG2 is right around the corner. While integrated graphics serve as an interesting proof of concept there's no doubt that Intel's discrete graphics are what ZLUDA's developers have in mind as the library matures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9pbnRlbC1jb3JlLWk3LTExNzAway1yb2NrZXQtbGFrZS1zLWFscmVhZHktc2hpcHBpbmctdG8tZmlyc3QtY3VzdG9tZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Intel Core i7-11700K ""Rocket Lake-S"" already shipping to first customers","Intel Core i7-11700K sold and shipped ahead of the official launch

This is not something we see very often. A big retailer offering unreleased products which were even officially presented by the manufacturer.

Intel Core i7-11700K retail processor Source: PCGamesHardware Forums

We have seen products such as GeForce RTX 3060 being sold all around the globe weeks before launch but this product was already presented back in January so it wasn’t very surprising. The Core i7-11700K processor on the other hand has not even been announced by Intel.

Intel Core i7-11700K is a next-gen 8-core and 16-thread unclocked processor from the Rocket Lake-S series. These processor series are now rumored to be announced on March 16th. The CPU manufacturer had not however confirmed the specifications or the pricing of the new series. Technically Core i7-11700K does not even exist.

Enter Mindfactory one of the biggest retailers in Germany already selling the new CPUs and even admitting that no embargo has been breached in the process. Just 2 days after the first reports of the 11th Gen series going on sale we have reports from first customers who already received the processor from said store.

Being a German store which often only delivers products to German customers we have various leaks on Core i7-11700K performance from popular German tech forums such as HardwareLuxx PC Games Hardware or ComputerBase. Each of those forums has its own separate threads dedicated to the Mindfactory’s prelaunch sale of the processor.

The sales of Core i7-11700K are just another development in a very unusual and to this date unseen product launch by Intel. The chaos surrounding the release of Z590 motherboards many of which have only been shown recently others were never sampled to reviewers were supposed to be fully compatible with Intel Rocket Lake-S processors at launch. According to various test results including qualification samples and now retail samples it appears that even Z590 motherboards are not fully capable of unlocking the potential of the processor. Earlier information indicated that Intel is still working on a final microcode update for the launch which is now expected on March 30th.

Meanwhile Mindfactory is still offering the processor granted at a much higher price than the 10th Gen Core series but if anyone is interested in buying a product nearly a month before it was supposed to be sold well here is your chance.

The buyers who are mostly from Germany have posted their unboxing pictures and first performance benchmarks of the retail chip.

Intel Core i7-11700K Rocket Lake Desktop CPU Delivered To First Customers - Unboxing & Performance Benchmarks Leaked Ahead of Launch

The Intel Core i7-11700K Rocket Lake Desktop CPU isn't supposed to be available for pre-order till the 16th of March with a hard launch scheduled for the 30th of March. However one of the biggest retailers in Germany MindFactory listed the chips up for pre-order a few days back and customers have managed to grab the chip a full month before launch.

This is also the first time that we will be looking at the retail chip in action however as detailed before a new microcode update is planned for Rocket Lake CPUs which will be arriving in mid of March to improve gaming and multi-core CPU performance so don't expect these results to be a final representation of the chip at all.

Intel Core i7-11700K 8 Core & 16 Thread Rocket Lake Desktop CPU Specs

The Core i7-11700K features the same core configuration as the Core i9-11900K of 8 cores and 16 threads but comes with reduced clock speeds. The chip is said to feature a boost clock of 5.0 GHz on a single & 4.6 GHz across all of its 8 cores. The CPU will even carry the same amount of cache so nothing has changed but the main difference should come from the clocks and power limits. This lower-binned chip will sit at around 225-250W (PL2) limit while the PL1 limit will be standard at 125W. The PL1 rating has a TAU duration of 56 seconds while the PL2 rating has a TAU duration of 2.44ms.

It will be interesting to see how Rocket Lake CPUs overclock since the minute difference between the Core i9 and Core i7 chips can be overcome by a small overclock. As for pricing the Core i7 will also be cheaper than the Core i9 variant but we don't know yet how Intel will price its 8 core Rocket Lake-S Desktop CPUs yet. There are reports that Intel could aggressively price the chips at around $400 US for the Core i9 and $300 US for the Core i7 which could prove to be a great decision if they really want to go against AMD's Zen 3 based parts in the sub-$500 US segment.

Users from Computerbase PCGamesHardware and HardwareLuxx forums have posted unboxing and package shots of the Intel Core i7-11700K CPU. As expected the retail packaging is more in line with the leaked packages from Videocardz than the ones that we saw a few days ago. The CPU will come in a standard cardboard package with Intel's latest logo design and will have a cut-out to view the CPU itself.

The CPU as always will be packaged within a plastic container and other contents include a black-colored stock Intel heatsink and a warranty manual. Most users are going to dispose of the stock CPU heatsink and go with a high-end liquid cooling solution if they want to make use of the full potential of the Intel Rocket Lake chip.

The three-member investor group is made up of Suzanne Abair the president and chief operating officer at the investment firm Northland Larry Gottesdiener chairman at Northland and the former WNBA star ESPN reports.

In the acquisition of the team Montgomery will be the first former WNBA player to become both an owner and an executive of a WNBA team. Montgomery 34 has been a standout player throughout her basketball career. In 2009 she won a national championship as a member of the University of Connecticut women’s basketball team and she won WNBA titles with the Minnesota Lynx in 2015 and 2017.

After more than 10 years in the WNBA Montgomery opted not to play in the 2020 season to focus on social justice activism and recently announced her retirement from the league.

""My Dream has come true"" Montgomery said in a statement. ""Breaking barriers for minorities and women by being the first former WNBA player to have both a stake in ownership and a leadership role with the team is an opportunity that I take very seriously. I invite you to join me as the Dream builds momentum in Atlanta!""

“We are proud of what we accomplished and wish the team well in their next chapter” former Atlanta Dream team owners Kelly Loeffler and Mary Brock said in a joint statement according to the Washington Post.

Loeffler a 50-year-old businesswoman and former U.S. senator drew the criticism of team players last summer after she vocally endorsed former President Donald Trump and doled out harsh criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement.

After the WNBA committed to supporting the Black Lives Matter movement last year Loeffler penned an open letter to WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert condemning the move as polarizing and divisive. Instead she asked that the league consider incorporating an American flag on all licensed apparel for players coaches and staff as a show of unification.

The former Georgia Republican also refused to meet with Montgomery to discuss the players' concerns within the league and social justice initiatives The Nation reported.

In August WNBA players wore “VOTE WARNOCK” shirts in support of Sen. Raphael G. Warnock who opposed Loeffler in the high profile senate race in Georgia as Blavity previously reported. Warnock eventually won the race and was named the first Black senator from Georgia in January Blavity previously reported.

“We wanted to make sure we could still keep the focus on our social justice movement and funny enough Rev. Warnock is somebody who supports everything that we support and just happens to be running in that seat” Atlanta Dream forward Elizabeth Williams said. “So it just worked out really well.”

As Blavity previously reported NBA star LeBron James tweeted after Warnock’s victory about putting together a group to buy the Dream.

“I’m ready when you are” Montgomery replied to James per the Washington Post.

Following her exit from the WNBA ownership group Loeffler will likely suspend her endeavors in sports to potentially return to business the Washington Post reports. Prior to her senate run Loeffler resigned as CEO of Bakkt a digital investment platform that specializes in cryptocurrency. Loeffler’s husband Jeffrey Sprecher currently works as the CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange which runs the New York Stock Exchange.

As a result the company is now listed on the New York Stock Exchange:

""The Business Combination was approved by Switchback stockholders on February 25 2021. The New York Stock Exchange ticker symbols for the shares of common stock and the warrants of the combined company renamed ChargePoint Holdings Inc. are expected to be changed to “CHPT” (NYSE:CHPT) and “CHPT.WS” respectively beginning on March 1 2021.""

Besides being a publicly-traded company ChargePoint expected to get more than $450 million in net proceeds. The enterprise value is estimated at $2.4 billion.

ChargePoint presentation

In the presentation for investors released by the way of going public ChargePoint highlights its business model which consists of hardware software and associated services:

The company addresses all charging segments including residential (home charging) commercial (public charging) and fleets (depot charging).

The charging solutions include both AC charging points and DC chargers. The ChargePoint public charging network consists mostly of AC charging stations.

ChargePoint business model

ChargePoint has an interesting approach in which a high share of profits comes under the software category.

As we understand once a customer installs a charging station (CT4000 Dual-Port station Level 2 AC for example) he is expected to spend (over a period of seven years) an equivalent of the station cost to remain included on the ChargePoint public charging network.

The company noted some $145 million of revenues in 2019 but expects to achieve $135 million in 2020 due to the COVID-19 impact. The revenues will increase in the future.

The number of charging ports shipped in 2019 amounted to 32136 which is $4514 per unit (but we must remember that many charging stations have more than one port and that a high portion of revenues is not related to the hardware).

The gross margin in 2020 is expected to be 24% which sounds pretty high especially since it should further improve to more than 40% in just several years.

However if we dig deeper into the financial information things are not so rosy. The company was forced to cut costs including salary cuts and bonus elimination as the operating costs were too high compared to the revenues.

In 2019 (year ended on January 31 2020) ChargePoint noted close to $145 million of revenues and gross profit of $18 million but after applying the operating expenses of over $150 million it was actually at a net loss of over $134 million.

In 2020 the expected revenues of $135 million should allow it to achieve a gross profit of $33 million (24%) but the total operating expenses at $140-150 million suggest that the scale of the network is not yet big enough to be profitable. The net losses might be around $107 million.

To become profitable the sales/network size/network utilization would have to be several times bigger than it is now. ChargePoint expect to be profitable around 2025 once revenues reach about $1 billion annually.

Strategic divestitures and cost management reflect a proactive approach to market challenges.

Legal and regulatory hurdles pose potential risks to IFF's operational stability.

Investment in R&D and productivity gains signal a commitment to innovation and efficiency.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) a global leader in specialty ingredients production has recently disclosed its financial performance for the first quarter of 2024. Despite a slight decrease in net sales from $3.027 billion to $2.899 billion the company has shown an impressive increase in gross profit from $964 million to $1.024 billion indicating effective cost management and operational efficiency. As we delve into a SWOT analysis of IFF we'll explore the company's internal dynamics and external market conditions that could influence its strategic decisions and future growth.

Beyond the Balance Sheet: What SWOT Reveals About International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF)

Strengths

Robust Gross Profit Margin Improvement: IFF's ability to increase its gross profit margin from 31.8% to 35.3% amidst a sales decline is a testament to its strong operational management. This improvement suggests that IFF has effectively controlled its cost of goods sold which decreased significantly by $188 million and has optimized its manufacturing processes to enhance profitability.

Strategic Divestitures and Portfolio Optimization: The company's strategic decision to divest certain business units such as the Savory Solutions and Flavor Specialty Ingredients (FSI) businesses reflects a focused approach to streamline operations and concentrate on core growth areas. These divestitures while impacting sales have allowed IFF to reallocate resources and reduce associated costs positioning it for more targeted growth.

Investment in Research and Development: IFF's commitment to innovation is evident in its increased R&D expenses which rose to $166 million. This investment is crucial for the company to maintain its competitive edge by developing new and improved products thereby ensuring long-term sustainability in a rapidly evolving industry.

Weaknesses

Dependence on Global Economic Conditions: IFF's performance is closely tied to global economic trends as seen in the impact of unfavorable exchange rates on its sales. The company's reliance on international markets exposes it to currency fluctuations and economic volatility which can affect its financial results.

Increased Selling and Administrative Expenses: The rise in S&A expenses to $490 million primarily due to higher legal fees and professional consulting costs indicates potential inefficiencies and increased overheads. These expenses if not carefully managed could erode the company's profitability over time.

Story continues

Legal and Regulatory Challenges: IFF faces ongoing legal proceedings and regulatory investigations such as the antitrust investigations into its fragrance businesses. These issues not only incur additional costs but also pose reputational risks and could lead to significant financial penalties.

Opportunities

Productivity Gains and Favorable Net Pricing: IFF has demonstrated the ability to achieve productivity gains and secure favorable net pricing as reflected in the increased Segment Adjusted Operating EBITDA for its Nourish and Scent segments. These achievements provide an opportunity for IFF to further enhance its operational efficiency and pricing strategies to boost profitability.

Focus on Health & Biosciences: The Health & Biosciences segment showed a sales increase indicating strong market demand for biotechnology-derived products. IFF's position in this segment offers significant growth potential particularly in the areas of probiotics enzymes and specialty ingredients which are increasingly sought after in the health and wellness markets.

Emerging Markets Expansion: With sales to Israeli and Russian customers representing a small percentage of total sales there is an opportunity for IFF to expand its presence in emerging markets. By leveraging its global footprint and diverse product portfolio IFF can tap into new customer bases and drive sales growth.

Threats

Competitive Industry Landscape: IFF operates in a highly competitive industry where innovation and customer preferences rapidly evolve. The company must continuously adapt to maintain its market position against competitors who may offer more innovative or cost-effective solutions.

Regulatory and Compliance Risks: The complexity of operating in multiple jurisdictions brings about various regulatory challenges. IFF's involvement in legal disputes and the necessity to comply with diverse regulations can lead to increased compliance costs and potential disruptions to its business operations.

Global Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the potential impacts of the Israel-Hamas war could disrupt IFF's supply chains and affect its sales. The company must navigate these uncertainties while managing the risks associated with its international operations.

In conclusion International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) exhibits a strong financial foundation with improved gross profit margins and strategic portfolio management. However the company must address its increased S&A expenses and navigate legal and regulatory complexities. Opportunities for growth lie in its Health & Biosciences segment and potential expansion into emerging markets. Nevertheless IFF must remain vigilant against competitive pressures and global economic uncertainties that pose threats to its operational stability. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses IFF can capitalize on opportunities and mitigate threats positioning itself for continued success in the specialty ingredients industry.

For the complete transcript of the earnings call please refer to the full earnings call transcript.

Positive Points

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF Financial) achieved volume growth for the first time since Q1 2022 with mid-single digit growth in Q1 2024 driven by strong contributions from Scent Nourish and Health & Biosciences segments.

The company reported double-digit comparable adjusted EBITDA growth benefiting from both volume growth and productivity gains across its businesses.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF) successfully closed the divestiture of its cosmetics ingredients business and announced the sale of its Pharma Solutions business which is expected to complete in the first half of 2025 aiding in strengthening the capital structure and focusing on high-growth areas.

The company is trending toward the upper end of its previously announced guidance ranges for the full year 2024 reflecting increased confidence in its financial outlook.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF) introduced a refocused operating model which is business-led and supported by lean functions aimed at enhancing collaboration driving profitable growth and improving financial performance over time.

Negative Points

The CFO Glenn Richter announced his plan to retire at the end of 2024 initiating a succession plan that could lead to transitional challenges within the financial leadership of the company.

Despite positive volume growth the company noted that pricing was modestly positive and would have been negative without FX-related pricing benefits indicating underlying challenges in pricing power.

The company's Pharma Solutions segment experienced lower volumes due to ongoing destocking trends which could impact short-term performance until the completion of its divestiture.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF) reported a negative free cash flow of $19 million in Q1 2024 although it was an improvement from the previous year highlighting ongoing challenges in cash flow generation.

The company's net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio stood at 4.4x at quarter end indicating a relatively high leverage that the company aims to reduce to 3x following the Pharma Solutions transaction.

The potential is due to the 2019 discovery of the slave ship Clotilda which brought 110 enslaved Africans to the U.S. in 1860. Some predict the region becoming a massive draw that rivals the Equal Justice Initiative’s national lynching museum in Montgomery.

But existing environmental issues that have spanned decades continue to plague the community. Activists believe those issues could be a hindrance to Africatown’s potential and are taking their case to city officials. On Thursday concerns were expressed over a lack of environmental justice that has harmed the community for decades and which should be addressed within the rewrite of Mobile’s zoning and land development code - the first major revision of the city’s codes since the mid-60s.

“As we continue to make plans for Africatown as an African American cultural site and destination I am imagining the tours that will take you past the industrial area surrounding this 150-year-old community” said Lella Lowe a west Mobile resident. “That would demonstrate right now environmental injustice in action.”

Lowe was among the representatives with the Mobile Environmental Justice Action Coalition (MEJAC) and the Mobile County NAACP who participated in a virtual public hearing about the city’s Unified Development Code.

Africatown District

Their comments focused on a chapter of the overall code called the “Africatown Overlay District” which is one of only a handful of special districts listed within the new code. The groups believe the Africatown version of the code is not a strong enough effort by city officials to keep new heavy industry from creeping into or near a community that has long been surrounded by smog-producing paper plants and other facilities that continue to bring large trucks smog and noise to the neighborhood.

City officials argue that the new code is a “living document” that can be changed and adjusted over time. They want the entire code adopted and the city’s planning commission will consider it during a meeting early next month.

The new code replaces one that was last adopted in the 1960s. Only smaller revisions have occurred since then and city officials say it’s past time to move the rewrite forward.

The current proposal represents four years of work and comments from over 1300 residents.

“Our existing 50-year-old code is broken” said Shayla Beaco the city’s senior director of community affairs. “It’s antiquated hard to administer … it does not serve anyone well. The draft (revision) is a giant step forward. We have to start somewhere. We believe this (revision) creates a platform we can build upon.”

The Africatown activists hope the city considers their concerns which highlight the issue of environmental justice and racism in a community of approximately 2000 residents. The community is almost exclusively Black after it was long ago created by the survivors of the slave ship.

“This is a community that has not received justice from the day they arrived” said Herbert Wagner a Mobile resident who has concerns over heavy industry near Africatown.

He added “If we say we are supporting Africatown it’s time we also do that walk and protect Africatown from encroachment of any industry. When I sit on the front porch with friends you hear heavy machinery. All day you hear the trucks coming. People will come to Mobile to see Africatown and what they (will) see is industry and what they (will) hear is industrial equipment. I don’t know how likely they are to encourage their friends to come down and visit.”

Environmental concerns

MEJAC and the NAACP also believe the code is lacking in other areas including fair housing and waterfront conservation. Some of the highlights based on a MEJAC blog posting and from statements made during Thursday’s meeting:

-Weak definitions of protection buffers between the fence lines of Africatown residences and industry. MEJAC believes the code should allow for 10-foot brick or concrete walls separating residents from the neighboring industry and that chain-link fencing is not a suitable buffer.

-Does not do enough to address blight and should implement beautification requirements for non-residential developers.

-Omits waterfront conservation and should address efforts to bolster cleaner water and other efforts to promote tourism.

-Does not adequately protect residential communities – like Africatown – from new coal handling facilities. MEJAC is pushing for coal operations to be taken up separately from the zoning code rewrite.

-Ignores the metrics the city has already set forth in its fair housing goals.

In addition MEJAC is concerned about the lack of stringent prohibitions against new oil storage tanks from locating near Africatown. That issue resurrected what seemed to be resolved issues from about five years ago when the Mobile City Council agreed on a 1500-foot space between new oil tanks and residential areas. MEJAC is pushing to have oil and storage tanks and any hazardous substance storage removed from within the Africatown Overlay District.

How to regulate oil storage tanks became a hot button issue that first surfaced in 2013 when at the time there was growing fears over tank leaks and explosions. The issue sparked heated debates pitting big-business interests and the Alabama State Port Authority against environmental advocates over the presence of oil storage tanks near Africatown.

“Africatown Overlay must prohibit above-ground tank creation in Africatown” said Ramsey Sprague president with MEJAC and president of the Mobile NAACP Environmental and Climate Justice committee. “If we all agree we should be past the petrochemical tank farm episode then let’s please be past it.”

Said Joe Womack an Africatown native and activist for the community “Africatown is what will bring people to Brookley GulfQuest the Convention Center. It will bring people to Mobile to eat dinner and stay in hotels and it will push the revenue up in the city of Mobile. But you can’t have storage tanks anywhere around Africatown.”

The environmental issues raised over the zoning code discussions are rooted in a long and racist history for Africatown. The area remains rooted in generational distrust of the neighboring factories that exist or are long gone. There’s widespread belief for example that International Paper Co. left the neighborhood riddled with carcinogens and other contaminants when it closed more than two decades ago. More than 1000 Africatown area residents signed onto a class action lawsuit first filed in 2017 that accused the massive IP plant of releasing harmful toxins.

The case was settled late last year but the terms have not been disclosed.

The plant was built in the 1920s on land leased by the family of Timothy Meaher who unlawfully smuggled the Africans aboard the Clotilda and whose descendants still own hundreds of acres in Africatown with heavy industry leasing some of that land.

And rezoning by Mobile decades ago opened the area up to the heavy industry.

“For someone like me it comes down to the moral issue of justice for all citizens” said Lowe who has been with MEJAC for seven years. “This new zoning code is a moral code that makes justice happen.”

Correspondent

The history of Ohio’s Scioto River Valley in nineteenth twentieth and twenty-first century cannot be understood without understanding the role of papermaking in the area. Southeastern Ohio is an ideal location for making paper since water and trees are in abundance. A deep underground aquifer Teays River supplies Chillicothe with an almost inexhaustible supply of water and surrounding forests supply a mix of hardwood and softwood trees needed for printing paper manufacturing.

Historical records tell us that the first paper mill in Scioto Valley was established in 1810 on Kinnikinnick Creek on land leased from John Crouse near community of Kinnikinnick. Brothers Hezekiah and Isaiah Ingham Quakers from Pennsylvania established this small paper mill making paper from linen and cotton rags. The Inghams placed the following ad in Scioto Gazette in 1810 “Wanted – Clean Linen and Cotton Rags” offering three cents per pound for the rags for the mill that they called the Venice Paper Mill.

Ingham paper was much in demand as a lot of state printing was done in Ohio’s first capital Chillicothe. In 1852 descendants of Ingham brothers bought a paper mill on Honey Creek in south end of Chillicothe that had been established in 1847 as Entrekin Green and Company. The Kinnikinnick paper mill would operate under different owners until it was discontinued in 1871; the Chillicothe mill would operate as an Ingham mill until 1890 when it was purchased by Colonel Daniel Mead of Dayton at an auction. The following notes about Colonel Daniel Mead are from the book published in 1970 “In Quiet Ways” “While traveling through Chillicothe in December 1890 Mr. Mead noticed a crowd gathering across the street from the railroad station. While his train stopped for a lunch-time break he joined the crowd and discovered it was gathered for an auction of the Ingham and Company property. Mr. Mead put in the successful bid of $30000 and on December 6 1890 The Mead Paper Company became a two mill operation.” $30000 dollars in 1890 is equivalent to $862358.24 in today’s value.

Prophets in 1890 certainly could not foretell the importance to Chillicothe of Colonel Mead’s purchase or that The Mead Paper Company would become an international company. When purchased the Chillicothe mill had not been in operation for over a year and it was in poor shape. Colonel Mead died in 1891 but not before he invested over $100000 to renovate the facility. Papermaking was not new to Colonel Daniel Mead as he had operated along with different partners the Ellis Chafflin and Company in Dayton Ohio since 1846 producing book and printing papers. In 1882 Colonel Mead bought out his partners in Dayton and established he Mead Paper Company. In decade after 1882 the Mead Paper Company averaged annual profits of $22000 reaching $50000 in profits in 1891 the year of Colonel Mead’s death. After his death the management of the company passed to his sons Charles and Harry Mead.

Charles and Harry were not good managers and the company fell on hard times with company in 1905 bordering on total collapse. Charles and Harry and other family members overspent their resources with family members taking huge personal overdrafts against the company and Charles and Harry paying themselves large salaries. A three-member commission was appointed by the bank creditors to try to recover their loans. The commission was headed by Alexander Renick of Chillicothe President of the First National Bank and vice president of Valley Savings Bank. Renick understood the importance of the paper mill to the city of Chillicothe and took measures to keep the plant open. In 1905 the commission brought in Harry Mead’s twenty-seven year old son George Houk Mead to run the company. In the history of Mead corporate decisions this is most consequential for survival of the company. George Houk Mead’s leadership turned the bankrupt paper mill into a successful international business.

George Houk Mead was a remarkable person; he graduated from high school in two years and from Hobart College at the age of fifteen. In 1897 he earned his Bachelor of Law Degree graduating in three years with high honors. At age of twenty-two after spending a year working in the Dayton paper mill he received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Chemical Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology taking a job with silk manufacturing company in Boston. When first approached about becoming the manager of his family’s paper operation he declined but after becoming disenchanted with his job in Boston he agreed to come back and manage the Chillicothe mill in 1905. After taking over he spent the first two years in Chillicothe trying to turn around a facility with dilapidated buildings and equipment and by 1908 paper production was in good shape. During the great depression in United States in late 1920s and 1930s Mead remained financially sound. In World War Two George Mead was a member of several civilian war boards as a representative of the paper industry and met frequently with President Franklin Roosevelt. World War Two carried a special sadness for George and his family as his oldest son and successor to his father George H. Mead Jr. was killed on Guadalcanal in 1942.

George would serve as top executive in company for 43 years passing away in 1963. In those 43 years he had saved a floundering business that was going to be sold if he had not agreed to run the company. The company had grown and changed in so many ways since 1905 becoming an international business with many different acquisitions and assets.

The Mead Corporation as a separate entity no longer exists having merged with Westvaco Paper Company in 2002. The paper mill in Chillicothe since 2002 has been identified as MeadWestvaco New Page Glatfelter and currently Pixelle Specialty Solutions; George Houk Mead would no longer recognize the facility but he would be so proud that the plant he helped save still operates. The old “Ingham” mill on Honey Creek has been the economic “engine” for southeastern Ohio and has provided a good standard of living for Chillicothe and thousands of families in southeastern Ohio. It is fortunate for Scioto Valley that Colonel Daniel Mead lived until 1891 and fortunate that he took the train through Chillicothe in December of 1890.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLTU2MjEyNjY10gEqaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdWstNTYyMTI2NjUuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hotel quarantine: Isolation and brown paper bags,"""I've enlisted friends and family to Zoom with me a lot in the evenings and call me during the day.

If you regularly drive along the west side of Eau Claire over the past few years you have likely noticed a tall structure growing atop Mount Washington. First a column then girders; now in the winter of 2020-21 the 55-meter ski jump has come to full realization. Its inaugural use was for the 89th Annual Flying Eagles Invitational on Feb. 20-21 and years of planning and volunteer work led to the completion of the project.

According to project engineer and manager Matt Gundry planning began more than a decade ago. Prompts were the deterioration of the old 40-meter structure the evolution of the sport and facilities at Mount Washington. Following a donation from the Severson family approval eventually was made and the construction saga began.

Volunteer help was critical in construction. According to the Flying Eagles Ski Club’s Tami Jastrow they had “over 40 club and other divisional club volunteers along with a lot of community support from such groups as the CVTC lineman program students and the Eau Claire Police Department.” Approximately 2000 man hours came from associates of the ski club’s Dan Mattoon and Prestige Auto.

So much of this had to be figured out by trial and error in a hands-on manner.

Challenges were plenty from grading the concrete landing between thunderstorms to dealing with the dynamics of steel and plastic while laying the track assemblies. “So much of this had to be figured out by trial and error in a hands-on manner” Gundry says.

The result is the only 55-meter jump in the United States one that features a clothoide in-run curve. According to Gundry the design optimizes the physics of modern ski jumping. “The improved landing profile results in landing forces that are less than half as hard as designs from a decade ago.”

Gundry notes that the new facility will help local athletes better prepare for new jumps in other locations while featuring infrastructure for better jumping availability and contains industrial-grade composites and galvanized steel to keep it in use for decades.

The next time you drive along Clairemont Avenue or Menomonie Street take a glance up at the new ski jump – when you can do so safely of course. At the top you may see some small figures: the next generation of Eau Claire-area ski jumpers practicing for future glories.

Here’s an expanded Q&A with Matt Gundry of the Flying Eagles Ski Club about the new 55-meter jump on Mount Washington.

Volume One: How was the determination made to build the new jump? Why was the old jump in need of replacement?

Matt Gundry: Replacement of the existing 40m jump had been on the club wish list for over a decade when the initial HS55 concepts were formulated. Although the old jump had served the club well and helped train numerous international level athletes deterioration of the wood ramp structure was becoming a concern. Evolution of hill design standards and jumping techniques over the decades since the 40m had been constructed meant that the old style hill geometry no longer matched up with the modern rendition of the sport. Finally changes to the sizes of the small training hills at Mount Washington resulted in a poor fit for the size of a 40m hill – it was not much larger than the new 30m and yet was less than half the size of Silver Mine. The club felt that a 55 or 60 meter “medium hill” would better fill the gap between the 30m “small hill” and the 85m “normal hill” at Silver Mine.

A very generous donation by the Severson Family prompted the club to develop plans to build a new jump that would “complete” the Mt. Washington training complex. Various alternatives were then explored to try to optimize the jump within the limited space available. After consideration by the club board and with technical support of the International Ski Federation the sanctioning body for ski jumping an HS55 design was finalized. Upon review of the jump plans and additional fundraising the club board approved construction and the four-year odyssey was set in motion.

What was the most technically-challenging part of the overall construction?

In general staging and planning the construction in a manner that allowed the maximum amount of the work to be safely completed by volunteers was challenging. Each new task came with a requisite new set of skills that needed to be learned and practiced on the fly. The materials and methods needed for this project differ considerably from what the average home handyman requires.

Forming and pouring the concrete on the landing was grueling and required some innovative techniques to shape form reinforce and pour the concrete in the very short period of time before the next thunderstorm came along to wash out the sub-grade. However from a technical standpoint mass production and installation of the track assemblies over the past several weeks was one of the biggest challenges. While maintaining the very tight tolerances necessary so that the pieces would fit together well the volunteers also had to solve issues with finicky materials like stainless steel fasteners that would bind easily and plastics that had wildly differing thermal expansion characteristics. So much of this had to be figured out by trial and error in a hands-on manner. We learned a lot in the process and already have ideas for improving the design as we implement the new tracks at other hills in Eau Claire.

What are the most interesting features of this jump?

From the athlete perspective the most interesting aspects of the design are the spiral or clothoide in-run curve and the low-force landing profile. The clothoide in-run begins with a very gradual curve which gets progressively tighter as the athlete approaches the takeoff. The advantage of this new standard (the concept is just over a decade old) over the older style circular curve is that it does not have an abrupt transition at the start of the curve to disrupt the athlete's balance. The tighter curve at the takeoff creates a slightly greater G-force which preloads the skier better for the jump motion but does not subject the skier to prolonged high G-force like the circular curve.

Over the past 15 years or so the International Ski Federation has taken a hard look at the physics of ski jumping to better establish more appropriate biomechanical limits for design of ski jumps. The improved landing profile results in landing forces that are less than half as hard as designs from a decade ago. This reduces the risk of injury in falls or where the athlete out-jumps the hill reduces risk of repetitive strain injury and helps inspire confidence in developing athletes to fly further down the hill. As ski jumping has progressed to become a more inclusive sport this type of safety feature has become ever more important.

For both jumpers and non-jumpers the experience of simply being on this jump is intended to inspire the feeling of flight even if your feet don't leave the ground. The outer railings are barely visible cable railings. The walking surfaces are open grating. The underlying structure is cantilevered so much of the structure is open below. Standing on the start platforms at the top of the new HS55 tower is altogether different than standing on a jump built into the terrain or on scaffolds with solid decking and railings. The panorama extends well below the horizon providing a view seconded only by free falling.

Finally the jump is designed to reduce strain on club resources wherever possible. The new track system follows on the Silver Mine track design implemented by Dave Tomten about five years ago to vastly reduce the amount of snow required to be placed on the tower and shaped. The open stair gratings and cable railings prevent accumulation of falling snow reduce drifting and simplify removal of what little snow does accumulate on the structure. The materials selected for the construction are industrial grade composites and galvanized steel not expected to experience warping decay or significant weathering for decades.

What advantage if at all does the jump provide the ski jumping community in the Eau Claire area?

The new HS55 is the only medium-size jumping hill in the U.S. and one of the few in the world that has the clothoide in-run. It is also one of the few jumps that has been designed for reduced impact forces. Our athletes will be better prepared to compete on new jumps like the large hill being completed in Iron Mountain Michigan and will be able to take more practice jumps with less fatigue and risk of injury. The infrastructure improvements accompanying the new jump aim to increase availability of the jump by reducing the time to prepare the jump at each change of seasons.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzcG90LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy92YWxoZWltLWJvbmVtYXNzLWJvc3MtZ3VpZGUtaG93LXRvLWtpbGwtdGhlLXN3YW1wLWJvc3MvMTEwMC02NDg4ODQyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Valheim Bonemass Boss Guide - How To Kill The Swamp Boss,"Valheim's third boss is Bonemass a giant green blob that makes the Swamp biome its home. Defeating it is tough as the huge boss is relentless and uses massive attacks that are tough to dodge. With the right tools and strategies though you can defeat Bonemass and claim its power. Here's everything you need to know to beat the boss.

You'll need to clear out Eikthyr the Meadows boss and The Elder the boss of the Black Forest biome to get complete access to the Swamps. You'll also want the toughest Bronze armor you have access to before entering the area as the Swamps are full of deadly enemies that can poison you for massive damage. We've outlined the gear that'll give you the best chances against Bonemass even if you're fighting the boss without your Viking comrades.

How To Find Bonemass

Like other Valheim bosses you can only summon Bonemass at specific altars. To find the location of such an altar you'll need to interact with rune stones located in the Swamps. These are found in the Sunken Crypts dungeons in the Swamp--you'll need the Swamp Key earned by defeating The Elder to get into them. Once you find a rune stone and interact with it Bonemass's location will be marked on your map.

The same Sunken Crypts you pilfer for Iron will sometimes contain rune stones that will direct you toward Bonemass's location.

To summon the boss you'll need to make a sacrifice of 10 Withered Bones at its altar. You can also find Withered Bones in Sunken Crypts either lying on the ground or mined from Muddy Scrap Piles.

What You'll Need To Fight Bonemass

Armor: Iron Armor (Upgraded If Possible)

Bonemass does a ton of damage with its attacks but the blob is not the only thing you'll face in the Swamps. It's best to have as much protection as you can get--so it's definitely recommended that you spend the time to mine Iron in the Swamp and craft a full set of Iron armor before trying to go after the boss. Use our Iron guide to get everything you need to upgrade your gear. It's also a good idea to upgrade your armor if you can for even more damage resistance.

Ranged Weapons: Huntsman Bow Frost Arrows

Arrows aren't the most effective way to fight Bonemass unfortunately. The boss is resistant to Pierce damage so normal arrows are pretty worthless in most cases. However Bonemass can be very tough to fight up close so ranged weapons are definitely a must. Bonemass is weak to Frost damage (it is a blob after all) so you can get around the weaknesses of arrows by crafting Frost arrows. You'll need a whole lot of them but the ability to stay away from Bonemass's big powerful attacks is worth the extra effort.

Frost arrows aren't easy to come by though. You'll need to venture into the Mountain biome to get what you need to make them. To survive the mountains you'll need Frost Resistance Mead which you can make with a Cauldron and Fermenter. Frost Resistance Mead Base is made from 10 Honey 5 Thistle 2 Bloodbags (dropped by Leeches in the Swamp) and 1 Greydwarf Eye.

Apart from Wood and Feathers Frost arrows require Frost Glands which you can get by killing flying Drakes that live in the mountains and Obsidian which you can get by smashing Obsidian rocks poking out of the ground with an Iron Pickaxe. You'll likely need 200 or more if you're trying to solo the boss so get plenty of material.

Outfit yourself in as much Iron gear as you can manage before going after Bonemass and make sure you bring Poison Resistance Mead if you expect to fight him up close.

Melee Weapons: Iron Mace Iron Tower Shield

Bonemass is weak against Blunt damage so if you can manage to fight it at close range you can do more damage than you would with arrows. You'll want the strongest weapon you can get which in this case is the Iron Mace--made from 20 Iron 4 Wood and 3 Leather Scraps.

The boss also throws out melee attacks of its own though so if you want to go toe-to-toe with it you'll need to block at least some of the damage. The Iron Tower Shield is the toughest shield you can craft requiring 10 Iron and 15 Fine Wood and should let you block some of Bonemass's melee strikes. But the shield will significantly cut your movement speed--by 20% in fact--and won't help with the Bonemass's poison.

Food

You're going to want all the hit points you can get for this fight so your very best food is essential. Since you've been spending time in the Swamps you should have Draugr Entrails which you can use to make Sausages. Queens Jam is also pretty effective as is Carrot Soup--you'll likely want the stamina boost to help you keep mobile as you fight Bonemass. You should also have the capability to make Medium Healing Mead with a Fermenter and a Cauldron which uses 10 Honey 4 Bloodbags 10 Raspberries and 1 Dandelion. You'll definitely want the ability to quickly heal while you're in this fight.

There's another essential mead you need to survive: Poison Resistance Mead. Bonemass has a seriously horrific Poison attack that can wreck you pretty fast. Make it from 10 Coal 5 Thistle 1 Neck Tail and 10 Honey and keep plenty on-hand--the Bonemass fight will last a long time and you'll need to re-up your protection more than once.'

Ability: Eikthyr

Bonemass is a very mobile boss that will pursue you pretty relentlessly and it does a big area-of-effect attack that's best dealt with by running to get clear. Stamina management is a big part of this fight so use the Eikthyr power to help you run around at less cost.

Rested Bonus Is Key: Make A Portal Or Campfire

One of the more frustrating things about the Bonemass fight is the fact the boss summons a constant rainstorm during the battle. That gives you the Wet debuff which makes healing and stamina regeneration go slower. There's not a lot you can do about the rain but coming into the fight with the Rested bonus from sleeping and hanging out near a fire can help quite a bit. It's also a good idea to build a portal (or at least a covered campfire) near Bonemass's altar so you can retreat through it at intervals to repair your gear and spend a minute or two beside a fire to restore the bonus. Just don't leave Bonemass alone too long or it'll also regain health.

How To Beat Bonemass - Boss Fight Strategies

The hit-and-run approach can work against Bonemass but expect it to take a long time. Be careful you don't trigger other enemies as you play keep-away with the boss.

Bonemass is resistant to arrows but makes the close-range fight very tough with its abilities and attacks. If you can bring a few extra Vikings to help you in this battle it's recommended that you do so. You can work together to kite the boss around and protect each other so that it doesn't simply target you and stalk you until it catches you. It's also helpful to have other players around to deal with another major threat during the fight: other random Swamp monsters who can show up and ruin your day.

At Range

The safest way to deal with Bonemass is at a distance. If you get too close to Bonemass it'll swing at you with its massive arms. Those attacks can be blocked but the boss has a big reach and it's tough to dodge those swings. Worse is Bonemass's Poison attack where it barfs a poisonous cloud that spreads out all around it. The cloud lingers making it tough to stay close to Bonemass at all. You can avoid most of Bonemass's capabilities by staying away from it but it'll occasionally pull off a chunk of its own body and throw it at you spawning a couple of Blobs that you'll have to deal with.

Your Frost arrows will do damage to the boss even though it's highly resistant to Piercing damage so you can just hit Bonemass with arrows until it dies--it'll just take a lot of them. This strategy requires you to stay very mobile though because the boss will pursue you relentlessly. It's also tough to fight this way because Draugrs Wraiths Surtlings and Blobs are likely to get mixed up in the battle as well. The Swamps are also a bit tough to navigate thanks to being flooded so make sure you scout the area and have an idea of how you'll want to move around during the fight. If you can make yourself an area that Bonemass can't reach say by cutting a trench with a pickaxe ahead of the fight you can mitigate the need to run too much--but you'll still have to avoid Bonemass's AOE attack and the Blobs it'll throw at you.

Up Close

Melee fighting is more effective against Bonemass in terms of doing damage especially if you've got a good weapon that deals Blunt damage like the Iron Mace. You can use your shield to power through Bonemass's big melee attacks but you'll probably want to run clear whenever it throws up Poison. There are good opportunities to hit the boss in the middle of its animations though especially when it throws its Blobs out.

If you can get some backup it's possible to keep the boss's attention on one Viking while the others get behind it and attack from the rear where Bonemass can't get you. This is tough to maintain though so expect to spend a lot of time running clear of the boss and repositioning. Even if you're doing a melee-focused strategy you're probably going to want a good number of Frost arrows so you can keep dealing damage even when you're unable to get close to Bonemass.

What You Get For Beating Bonemass

Destroying Bonemass gives you some of what you need to move into the Mountain biome. In order to craft the next tier of armor you'll need to find and mine Silver but unlike Iron Copper and Tin Silver doesn't pop up out of the ground or drop from nodes you can easily spot. Killing Bonemass gives you the Wishbone which reveals secret things hidden under the ground--including Silver Veins. (Check out our Wolf Armor guide for help getting yourself set up to mine and use Silver.)

You'll also get Bonemass's power which is one of the more useful ones in Valheim especially as you head into the tough Mountain biome. Bonemass gives you resistance against physical damage including Pierce Blunt and Slash damage. The ability makes you much more resilient in combat which can help significantly when you're fighting Stone Golems Drakes and Wolves in the mountains. With both Bonemass's drops available to you you're ready to move on to Valheim's next set of challenges.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvb3RvZGF5LmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RhbnlsdWstcGV0ZXItMzQ2NTEwMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DANYLUK Peter - Obituary - Sault Ste.

Well this week we'll be visiting yet another Arkansas Game and Fish Commission facility with a similar mission.

However the J.B. and Johnelle Hunt Family Ozark Highlands Nature Center is somewhat different in a couple of ways. First and foremost it is situated in a totally different environment. Located near Springdale it is in the midst of the jagged Ozarks where limestone bluffs and crystal-clear mountain-fed streams are abundant.

Video not playing? Click here https://www.youtube.com/embed/FQ1zVlgmUiM

It is also worthy to note that the nature center is a far larger and elaborate operation than the one we recently visited in the southwestern section of the state. In fact the J.B. and Johnelle Hunt Family Ozark Highlands Nature Center consists of an impressive building spanning 32000 square feet surrounded by 61 beautiful acres of property.

Of course the facility shares the same conviction to stress the importance of conservation as do the eight other AGFC nature and education centers throughout the state. But it is also its goal as with the others to focus on the section of the state where it is located.

The nature center is rather new to the public as it opened its doors for business on Dec. 11 2020. Although one would suspect that the number of visitors has been somewhat dampened by the present pandemic there were several others visiting the facility during our recent excursion into northwestern Arkansas; all of which appeared to be following the guidelines posted to ensure everybody's well-being.

According to information posted on the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission's website they are confident that the new facility will prove a popular destination and rightfully so.

Located in close proximity to some of the fastest-growing towns throughout Arkansas the nature center will surely prove a popular destination for school groups. But curious nature lovers of all ages will likely gravitate to the facility. In fact the AGFC anticipates an excess of 100000 visitors annually.

We took advantage of the opportunity to visit the J.B. and Johnelle Hunt Family Ozark Highlands Nature Center during a recent excursion into the Ozarks. And I was impressed with the outing.

Entering the building we were greeted by a kind lady at the reception desk who appeared eager to share interesting facts pertaining to the new facility. Although I enjoyed our conversation I was most eager to actually tour the building and see the interpretive stations first hand.

I immediately gravitated toward several terrariums situated within sight of the entryway. Evidently the reptiles and amphibians housed in these enclosures sensed that the outside temperature hovered near the single digits and the stiff winds lent to a chill factor near zero.

They had buried themselves in the thick bark and could hardly be seen. However I suspected they would become far more active and viewable when the bout of winter weather subsided.

I then noticed an overhead display of a flock of Canada geese flying in formation. And I couldn't think of a better display to fit the frigid conditions awaiting just outside the door.

Continuing around the corner I noticed a large aquarium. Of course I made a Bee-line to this live exhibit as native fish were swimming within the perimeters of the large clear enclosure.

It was interesting to get a close-up view of fish species native to northwest Arkansas going about their everyday business. In fact it was most exciting to watch smallmouth bass swimming in the enclosure.

I was also impressed with the virtual creek that appeared to be running from the 2000-gallon aquarium and under the floor. The running water exhibit is fairly technical using video screens inset in the floor and under glass.

According to information I gathered via the AGFC website sensors near the ceiling detect the exact location of visitors and will trigger video and audio responses. The videos might appear as fish turtles or other water-loving creatures in the virtual stream. And those who step on the glass floor are apt to hear splashing sounds as if they are treading water.

Some of the interpretive stations provided information pertaining to all four seasons in the Ozarks. And I was impressed with huge fabricated blades of grass stretching nearly to the ceiling that separated the preschool room from the exhibit hall.

I would suspect that youngsters might also enjoy the cave replica that connects the exhibit room to the hallway. Those making their way through the exhibit will hear audio of dripping water and a ""hallow echo"" to lend to the feeling of entering a true cave.

Entering another room I noticed a variety of native pelts displayed on a row of tables. Although I have seen all of these native mammal species firsthand in a wild setting excluding a badger it was interesting to actually feel the difference in the texture of their coats.

There were several other interactive interpretive stations situated throughout the exhibit hall I was also very interested to see what awaited outside the building. That in mind I donned my gloves and my fleece beanie zipped up my jacket and struck out in the midst of the frigid temperatures.

Those who enjoy shooting their bow would likely appreciate the 3D archery range that is on-site. There was also yet another building that served as an indoor airgun and archery range.

The facility would not be complete without a designated trail system. However very little if any of the property consists of a wooded environment. In turn the dedicated ADA paths pretty much make their way through an open-field setting.

I'll be the first to agree that such an environment is hardly exciting or scenic during the brunt of winter. However I would suspect that a walk along the route would prove somewhat interesting during the spring summer and fall.

In fact one will likely be able to see a tallgrass prairie restoration project during the warmer months of the year. And I anticipate returning when the native plant gardens are making a showing during the spring.

Yep the J.B. and Johnelle Hunt Family Ozark Highlands Nature Center is a destination where I hope to visit again soon. It is a facility where one can learn of the importance of conservation while getting better acquainted with the Ozarks and why many gravitate toward the northwestern section of Arkansas to enjoy a stint in the wonderful outdoors.

There are several routes leading to Springdale. However I will share the route I find most enjoyable. From Hot Springs take Highway 270 west for about 63 miles to Y-City and turn right onto Highway 71 toward Fort Smith.

Remain on Highway 71 for 55 miles and turn right onto I-540 north toward Interstate 40. Go 12 miles and take Exit 1B onto I-40 east toward Little Rock. Travel 4.6 miles and take Exit 12 toward Fayetteville.

Go 51 miles and take Exit 73 onto Elm Springs Road. Go three-tenths of a mile and take a right onto Elm Springs Road. Travel three-tenths of a mile and turn left onto North 40th Street. Remain on 40th Street for 1.5 miles and the entrance to the destination will be on the left.",,,,,,,,,,,,

*GAAP revenue is comprised of services and support and processing revenues (see page 2). Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $843 for the current fiscal year quarter and $6143 for the prior fiscal year quarter results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 6.4% quarter over quarter. There were no non-GAAP adjustments to processing revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023. Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the nine months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $9861 for the current fiscal year-to-date period and $17042 for the prior fiscal year-to-date period and by $2 of revenue from acquisition in the current fiscal year-to-date period results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 7.2% period over period. Reducing processing revenue by revenue from acquisition for the nine months ended March 31 2024 which was $1943 results in non-GAAP adjusted processing revenue growth of 8.5% year-to-date period over year-to-date period. **The VEDIP program expense for the nine months ended March 31 2024 was related to a Company voluntary separation program offered to certain eligible employees beginning in July 2023. ***Non-GAAP adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted operating income by non-GAAP adjusted revenue.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting in the United States. GAAP includes the standards conventions and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted segment income adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income margin non-GAAP earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (non-GAAP EBITDA) free cash flow return on invested capital (ROIC) and non-GAAP adjusted net income.

We believe non-GAAP financial measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals and true operations of our business. Adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income adjusted segment income margin adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses and adjusted net income eliminate one-time deconversion revenue and associated costs the effects of acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net all of which management believes are not indicative of the Company's operating performance. Such adjustments give investors further insight into our performance. Non-GAAP EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to the Company before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for net income before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization attributable to eliminated one-time deconversions acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less capitalized expenditures internal use software and capitalized software plus proceeds from the sale of assets. ROIC is defined as net income divided by average invested capital which is the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and stockholders' equity for a given period. Management believes that non-GAAP EBITDA is an important measure of the Company's overall operating performance and excludes certain costs and other transactions that management deems one time or non-operational in nature; free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions; and ROIC is a measure of the Company's allocation efficiency and effectiveness of its invested capital. For these reasons management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its assessment and management of the Company's performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable with calculations of similar measures for other companies.

Any non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to related GAAP measures are included.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties including but not limited to the issuer.

But in the end the commotion had turned to quiet and all eyes were on Syosset’s Allie Jacobs.

Jacobs was the last competitor on the floor at the Saturday session of Nassau gymnastics team championships held at McKenna Elementary School in Massapequa. All other events were complete by the time she got on the mat. All that was missing from Jacobs’ performance was a spotlight.

""I actually really like it"" Jacobs said. ""It definitely made me more excited. Floor is also my favorite event. I don’t really mind other people watching. It kind of just gives me more pressure to do better and show everyone what I can do.""

They left the spotlight duties to Jacobs who shined with a 9.10 good for first place in the session and second overall in the championships. South Side’s Payton Waller who competed in Friday’s first session had the top floor score (9.15).

""Tumbling is definitely my strong [suit]"" Jacobs said. ""I also just love dancing with the music too.""

Jacobs was second in the All-Around with a 35.75. Port Washington’s Stefanie Carta who also competed Friday won with a 36.05.

Jacobs who was also second on vault (9.15) and beam (9.15) helped Syosset capture the team championship with 171.9 points. Plainview-Old Bethpage JFK was second with a 162.9. The title was extra sweet for Syosset a four-year-old program who won two years ago and fell by less than one point last year.

""Last year was definitely a disappointment and it wasn’t what we were hoping for coming off of a win the year before"" said Olivia Donach a Syosset captain who was eighth on bars (7.75). ""After that we realized we had to put everything we had into this year and really work as hard as we could to make a comeback.""

Donach’s teammate Jenna Kolberg was fourth in the All-Around (34.95) finishing third on beam (8.85) and tied for second with Carta on bars (8.4).

Elsewhere Plainview’s Payton Sack was third in the All-Around (35.05) and scored a 9.25 to tie for first with Carta on beam. Sack said she put together a complicated beam routine knowing she would score with it.

""The level of difficulty was a little harder on the back handspring back tuck"" said Sack. ""It’s more of a dynamic skill and I think that made me stand out…I think it’s not something you see very often and I’m really proud of myself that I went out did it and stuck it. That’s all that matters.""

Sack and her teammate Alyssa Sanborn tied for third on the vault (9.0). Sanborn was also third on the floor (9.05) and fifth in the All-Around (34.05).

""I was actually very nervous for vault because [Friday] I wasn’t doing good vaults at practice"" Sanborn said. ""But I just took deep breaths and thought that my vaults are usually good and I can do it. I took all the bad vibes out and did a good vault.""

Long Beach’s Allison Cohen won on bars (8.55).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ncmFuZGZvcmtzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvbm9ydGhsYW5kLW91dGRvb3JzL2Fsd2F5cy1pbi1zZWFzb24tbWlrZS1qYWNvYnMtaG91c2Utc3BhcnJvdy1udW1iZXJzLWNvbnRpbnVlLWxvbmctdGVybS1kZWNsaW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Always in Season/ Mike Jacobs: House sparrow numbers continue long-term decline,"The birds we see are the most interesting to us but the birds we don’t see also deserve attention. This is the case with the house sparrow a once abundant species that has declined in numbers.

That’s caught the attention of birders far and wide including a doctoral candidate at the University of Maine. His name is Liam Berigan and he was the lead author of a study conducted by the Cornell University Laboratory of Ornithology and published earlier this year in the Wilson Journal of Ornithology. I found it online at Science Daily dated Feb. 11 .

Always in Season/ Mike Jacobs: Snow buntings seem to drift on by As a cold air mass moves down from the north it often brings snow buntings which as much as snowy owls are the quintessential birds of the North.



Berigan and his associates combed through reports of sightings at 12500 feeder sites in North America in a 21-year period from 1995 to 2016. Overall the data show an overall decline of 7.5% in feeder reports and a decline of 22% in the size of flocks of house sparrows visiting feeders.

These findings jibe with experience elsewhere.

European populations have declined as much as 60% in the same time period. If the period is extended to the mid-1960s the rate of decline reaches 84%.

The trend is noticeable locally as well as results of Christmas Bird Counts tell. House sparrows tallied on these annual counts fell from more than 2000 in the year 2000 to about 300 on the most recent counts. That’s a decline of 85%.

Why?

Dave Lambeth the compiler of the Grand Forks bird count offered potential causes in a post on the Grand Cities Bird Club listserv. First among them is a decline in nesting sites. House sparrows – as their name suggests – build their nests in or around buildings. They are especially drawn to small openings such as loose siding. These are less common in modern construction. What’s more starlings which are aggressive birds may have displaced house sparrows in the remaining available nesting sites.

Food sources may be shorter than they were. House sparrows are seed eaters in the main and there is less spilled grain around than there was a couple of decades ago. Grain handling has become more efficient.

Lambeth also notes that dogs have moved indoors. In the past house pets were often kenneled outside but outdoor dogs are no longer as common as they were and their food dishes no longer provide provender for scavenging sparrows.

On the other hand the sparrows may have become food themselves. Cooper’s hawks efficient avian predators have increased exponentially. Berigan and his colleagues noted though that they found no correlation. “Declines were no greater when shinned or Cooper’s hawks were present.”

The Cornell study found that while house sparrow numbers declined in urban areas they were stable in rural areas. This hasn’t been the case in my experience. When Suezette and I moved to our place west of Gilby N.D. after the 1997 flood house sparrows were regular nesters in the sheds around our property. We took an old bunkhouse down – and lost the house sparrows and a colony of cliff swallows.

Rural feedlots still attract house sparrows sometimes hundreds of them as attested to on bird counts at Icelandic State Park near Cavalier N.D. That circle includes some livestock farms and they attract house sparrows.

My guess is that these are holdouts however not typical of the trend overall in our area – and elsewhere.

That’s fine with some birders. House sparrows are not native to North America; they were brought to this continent in the mid-1800s part of what has sometimes been called “a sparrow fad.” The fad spread around the world resulting in large populations in India and Australia – like North America colonial outposts of Great Britain.

The connection is so strong that house sparrows were almost universally called “English sparrows” until the American Ornithologists Union purged most common names linking birds with specific nationalities. That move produced Canada goose rather than “Canadian” goose as well. American crow escaped because it denominates a landmass rather than a nationality.

Today house sparrows have all but disappeared in Britain to the dismay of bird lovers and conservationists. One of the theories put forward there is that the collapse of house sparrow populations may be linked to the ongoing decline in insect numbers. House sparrows are mostly seed eaters as adults – but they feed insects to their nestlings.

Interest in the large prestigious contract was huge and following a competitive due diligence on all participating suppliers (on aspects including capabilities expertise pricing but also value-adds such as social procurement outcomes) a total of 225 firms were selected. The framework agreement runs for three to five years – the initial contract term is three years with two optional one-year extensions built-in.

The winners

Among the appointed suppliers are dozens of leading consulting firms including big hitters such as the Big Four of Deloitte EY KPMG and PwC mid-tier accounting-heritage firm such as BDO Grant Thornton Pitcher Partners and RSM strategy consulting firms McKinsey & Company and The Boston Consulting Group global players such as Accenture and FTI Consulting and home-grown management consulting firms such as Nous Group and Partners in Performance.

Jessamy Kinghorn head of partnerships and engagement at NHS England told a Harrow Council scrutiny committee that one option is to move services to an acute hospital site with Watford General Hospital earmarked as a leading candidate.

She noted it is yet to be confirmed if this is “possible” but following the review and engagement with residents and stakeholders it is seen as an appropriate next step.

Watford is seen as a location that would satisfy the five key criteria when assessing a new site – it possesses an on-site critical care unit offers specialist services and would not significantly increase travel times for users.

A limited consultation with residents in Harrow found most would see this change as acceptable with other locations further north such as Luton deemed less desirable.

Independent advisors found the buildings at Mount Vernon are in a bad state staff cannot always carry out the care and treatment they would like and patient care is sometimes split across hospitals.

Ms Kinghorn explained these “complex” issues mean services “aren’t what they could be” and its long-term suitability must be questioned.

She added this could also lead to staffing issues where some employees might choose to leave as they struggle to carry out their responsibilities due to poor facilities.

Speaking at the committee meeting on Tuesday (February 23) Cllr Chris Mote (Con Pinner South) agreed there needs to be a solution describing the current set-up as “ancient”.

He questioned whether any services would be maintained at the Northwood site even if the majority were to move and Ruth Derrett locality director at NHS England said this is something that could be considered as part of the wider developments.

She explained this would be under the stewardship of Hillingdon Hospitals which owns the site but that possible future uses – such as a neighbourhood hub for cancer patients – have been mentioned.

The future of Mount Vernon has been a key topic for Harrow West MP Gareth Thomas who said it would be a “national scandal” if services were to cease completely.

And last month the NHS denied any suggestion services would be shifted to central London given the high volume of users who live outside the capital."
JNJ,Johnson & Johnson,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21hcmpvcmllLXRheWxvci1ncmVlbmUtc3BlYWtlci1qb2huc29uLXRydW1wLTdiYmU3MWI3ZmMyYWVmMjZkZTMwMzZhMzU0YWYwZDEz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marjorie Taylor Greene Speaker Johnson meet for second day,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Embattled House Speaker Mike Johnson and far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene met for a second day at the Capitol on Tuesday political adversaries trying to engineer an off-ramp from the escalating standoff over her threat for a vote to oust him from office.

The stakes are high for both.

Republican Johnson is hoping to avoid a politically fraught outcome in which he would keep his job but only after relying on Democrats who have pledged their support to save him at least this time.

Greene a top ally of Donald Trump faces her own potentially embarrassing setback if her motion to vacate the speaker fizzles as is expected.

“Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson’s court” said Greene R-Ga. “I am so done with words. For me it’s all about actions.”

In a brazen move Greene has forced her way to the negotiating table and outlined four demands — including no more funding for Ukraine as it fights Russia and an end to the Justice Department special counsel’s legal cases against the indicted former president Trump.

Throughout Johnson has tried to portray himself six months on the job since the ouster of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy as in control of the situation and not beholden to the hard-right forces that have created chaos throughout this session of Congress.

“Look they’ve been very productive discussions. that’s what I’ll say” Johnson R-La. said after Tuesday’s 90-minute meeting.

Johnson downplayed the idea that there was any deal to be made saying the meetings are simply part of his open-door policy to hear out the ideas of fellow Republican lawmakers as is his practice as the new leader.

“It’s not a negotiation” Johnson said.

But it’s clear whether or not Greene proceeds with her plan to call the vote this week — or lets the moment slip away — the threat of removal will trail the speaker’s tenure and force him to consider concessions to the far-right forces to keep members satisfied.

Greene said she had “high expectations” the speaker would deliver.

“This is what people all over the country are screaming for” Greene said Tuesday on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast. “They want to see this vote.”

Another hardline congressman Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has joined in the meetings and warned Johnson not to draw out a decision.

“If his plan is to drag this out so the pressure comes off of this and to drag it out for weeks or days even without making some movement in our direction then he would just be far better off to have this vote and get it behind him” Massie said.

The effort to oust Johnson has been panned by Trump who gave his nod of support to the speaker and it has failed to gain traction among Republicans leaving Greene almost alone with just a few colleagues on her side.

But the demands Greene is making are mostly popular among Republicans and could be difficult for Johnson to ignore. That gives both her and the speaker incentive to embrace a deal — particularly since Trump would almost certainly be supportive.

In a signal of what’s to come Johnson lashed out at the Justice Department’s two cases from special prosecutor Jack Smith against Trump — over mishandling classified documents as well as the effort to overturn the 2020 election in the runup to the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol attack.

Johnson echoing Greene’s claims of sham trials called the Justice Department cases against Trump “election interference” that “has to stop” as the former president is the party’s presumptive nominee in the 2024 race for the White House.

“President Trump has done nothing wrong here” said Johnson who led one of the defeated president’s legal efforts trying to overturn Biden’s 2020 election victory before the bloody Capitol siege.

Johnson said the House will consider the flow of federal funds to the Justice Department and oversight of the special prosecutor’s office. “Stay tuned” he said.

Greene is also demanding that Johnson abide by the Hastert rule named for another former Republican speaker that requires leaders to proceed with voting on bills only when they have support from the majority of their members.

Relying on the Hastert rule could have tanked congressional support for Ukraine since the recently approved $61 million foreign aid package did not have backing from most Republicans. It passed with Democratic support.

Greene also wants to insist on federal spending reductions championed by Massie which would require a 1% across-the-board cut if Congress fails to pass the regular appropriation bills by the Sept. 30 deadline for the end of the fiscal year. A similar deal was struck last year lending support to the idea.

Other Republicans even if they agree with some of the ideas being proposed are wary of Johnson making any deals with a select few.

“I don’t have a problem with him listening but what I will have a problem with and we had this problem with Speaker McCarthy is when you start making special special deals and hidden deals “said Rep. Kevin Hern R-Okla. “And then people not just conservatives but moderates and everybody else says where’s my deal?”

But ultra-conservative Rep. Tim Burchett R-Tenn. said Greene backing off the motion to vacate for now would be a “a wise move.” He said it signals “she’s going to play her best hand and that’s to get what you can get.”

The speaker is working to show he is in control of the House and not being led by Democrats who are in the minority but have outsized influence because they have provided the votes for much of the consequential issues this Congress.

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries the Democratic leader has emerged as an empowered speaker-in-waiting if Democrats win party control in November. He and his leadership team have promised to vote to table Greene’s motion essentially saving Johnson’s job.

But Johnson insisted Tuesday he has no interest in relinquishing the gavel any time soon. Even though some Republicans have said he should step aside Johnson said he intends to continue leading the House Republicans well into next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDcvd2hhdC1tdGctd2FudHMtZnJvbS1taWtlLWpvaG5zb24tMDAxNTY0NTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What MTG wants from Mike Johnson - POLITICO,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/what-mtg-wants-from-mike-johnson-00156451 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDcvd2hhdC1tdGctd2FudHMtZnJvbS1taWtlLWpvaG5zb24tMDAxNTY0NTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA3L21pa2Utam9obnNvbi1tYXJqb3JpZS10YXlsb3ItZ3JlZW5lLWRlbW9jcmF0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Democrats warn Mike Johnson about private meetings with Marjorie Taylor Greene,"House Democrats are aghast as Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) conducts a series of lengthy meetings with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) aimed at defusing her efforts to oust him. Why it matters: Democrats have already vowed to protect Johnson from Greene's motion – leading many of them to ask why he's still trying to appease her.

""He has to be careful here"" said one senior House Democrat telling Axios that ""if he looks like he's just simply going to try to capitulate to her that could affect [the way] some Democrats see him.""

House Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) said Tuesday: ""When Speaker Johnson meets with her for hours the American people should be asking 'what is Marjorie Taylor Greene extracting from the speaker?'""

Driving the news: Greene met with Johnson for several hours this week laying out demands that include no more aid to Ukraine and defunding special counsel probes.

Johnson told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday: ""It's not a negotiation okay this is how I've operated as speaker.""

After their meeting on Tuesday Greene said ""the ball is in Mike Johnson's court"" and that she doesn't have a ""specific timeline."" She previously promised to force a vote this week.

What they're saying: ""I don't know what in the world they could be talking about for hours on end and I don't know why he would waste his time there. We have given enough indication we can help him get back to business"" Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Mich.) told Axios.

Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) told Axios: ""You cannot placate her. The minute you try to appease her she's going to have new demands.""

""I worry that the Republicans are focused more on their internal battles and their culture wars than trying to do what's right for the American people as a whole"" said Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.).

Zoom in: House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) compared Johnson's talks with Greene to the deal former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) struck with hardliners last January.

Included in the deal was a rule allowing any member to force a vote on removing the speaker which led to McCarthy's ouster and now has empowered Greene to bring Johnson to the table.

Between the lines: Democrats are still broadly committed to saving Johnson said Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) but ""three months from now that doesn't necessarily [have to] be the case"" for some of his less committed colleagues.

Another House Democrat told Axios: ""It's fine – sit listen it doesn't cost you anything. But at some point you say: discussion's over shit or get off the pot. This has already consumed way too much attention.""

The other side: Some Democrats see Johnson as just doing what he needs to do.

""What I saw that I liked is he put bills in front of the House to vote on ... if he keeps doing that my only complaints will be policy"" said Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.).

""The concessions that I've heard about they're meaningless ... I don't think she's a threat to anyone"" said Rep. Annie Kuster (D-N.H.).

What to watch: One House Republican predicted Johnson won't give Greene any concessions telling Axios he's ""just trying to give her an exit ramp.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL2hlcmVzLXdoYXQtZ29wLXJlYmVscy13YW50LWpvaG5zb24tdGhyZWF0cy1vdXN0LWhpbS1zcGVha2Vyc2hpcNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL2hlcmVzLXdoYXQtZ29wLXJlYmVscy13YW50LWpvaG5zb24tdGhyZWF0cy1vdXN0LWhpbS1zcGVha2Vyc2hpcC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's what GOP rebels want from Johnson amid threats to oust him from speakership,"The House conservatives threatening to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson R-La. are seeking assurances on government funding and aid to Ukraine Fox News Digital is told.

Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene R-Ga. and Thomas Massie R-Ky. met with Johnson behind closed doors for roughly two hours late Monday afternoon after promising last week to force a House-wide vote on his removal. They declined to give details to reporters immediately after the sit-down but said they would have a follow-up discussion with Johnson on Tuesday.

However Fox News Digital was told they are broadly seeking four points – including no more funding for Ukraine nor special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into former President Trump.

They are also demanding that Johnson vow to block any legislation from getting a House-wide vote unless it has the support of a majority of the House GOP – a longstanding informal provision called the Hastert rule named after a former Republican speaker.

MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FILES MOTION TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON

On government funding the conservatives are also pushing Johnson to adhere to the Massie rule which would require automatic federal spending cuts if an agreement is not reached on fiscal year 2025 funding by the Sept. 30 deadline.

Fox News Digital reached out to Greene Massie and Johnson's offices for comment. A spokesman for Greene declined to discuss the contents of a private meeting.

Meanwhile Rep. Paul Gosar R-Ariz. the third GOP rebel who signed onto Greene's motion to vacate the chair – a resolution calling for a House-wide vote on removing the speaker – suggested to reporters on Monday evening that he wanted Johnson to have some more time to change course.

HOUSE DEMS SAY THEY’LL BLOCK MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FROM OUSTING SPEAKER JOHNSON

""I don't think it's going to happen this week. I hope it doesn't happen this week"" Gosar told reporters. ""I think it would be nice to see him go back to regular order get things coming from committees you get a majority of the majority to get something on the floor.""

Greene is leading the push to oust Johnson amid conservative frustrations over his bipartisan work on critical legislation related to government funding and foreign aid. She and Massie pledged to force the vote sometime this week.

To do so she would have to notice her resolution as ""privileged"" – meaning the House would have two legislative days to vote on the measure itself or first vote on scuttling it via a procedure known as ""tabling"" the resolution.

Democrats have pledged to block the ouster vote by voting to table the resolution whenever it comes up something that could save Johnson while also likely raising more conservative frustrations.

Johnson told reporters on Monday evening that his meeting with Massie and Greene was ""lengthy"" but ""constructive.""

""We have discussed some ideas and we're going to meet again tomorrow"" Johnson said. ""I just want to say and I told them and I've said this repeatedly that I understand the frustration. I share it. I would really like to advance much more of our conservative policy on a daily basis here. But the reality is we are working with the smallest majority in U.S. history with a one-vote margin.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDI0LzA1LzA3L21pa2Utam9obnNvbi1ob3VzZS1zcGVha2VyLW1vdGlvbi10by12YWNhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mike Johnson wants to continue as House speaker despite the hurdles,"Mike Johnson on Tuesday vowed to remain in his job as speaker past the 2024 election  defying a pair of hard-line conservatives who continue to seek his ouster and attempting to retain his shaky grip on an unruly House.

“I intend to lead this conference in the future” Johnson (R-La.) said Tuesday. “We have plans for the next Congress and we’ve been outlining a lot of that. But right now it’s all hands on deck all hands on the wheel and steering the ship upstate so to speak. So I’m honored to be able to do that. I expect I’ll be doing that in the future and am glad to have the support of President Trump.”"

Investors are suddenly obsessed with them in commodities trading,"A surge in commodity prices has Wall Street banks gearing up for the arrival of what may be a new—an extended period during which demand drives prices well above their long-run trend. A major impetus is the massive stimulus spending by governments as they juice up their economies following pandemic lockdowns. The evidence includes surging copper and agricultural prices and oil back at pre-COVID-19 levels. One theory is that this could be just the start of a yearslong rally in appetite for raw materials across the board but the reality is more complicated.

1. What is a supercycle?

A sustained spell of abnormally strong demand growth that producers struggle to match sparking a rally in prices that can last years or in some cases a decade or more. For some analysts the current rally is rekindling memories of the supercycle seen during China’s rise to economic heavyweight status beginning in the early 2000s. Commodities have experienced three other comparable cycles since the start of the 20th century. U.S. industrialization sparked the first in the early 1900s global rearmament fueled another in the 1930s and the reindustrialization and reconstruction of Europe and Japan following the Second World War drove a third during the 1950s and 1960s.

2. What did the last one look like?

From around 2002 China entered a phase of roaring economic growth fueled by a rollout of modern infrastructure and cities on an unprecedented scale. Suppliers struggled to fulfill surging demand for natural resources. In commodities there’s often a time lag to get the product where it’s wanted since adding capacity such as opening a new mine doesn’t happen overnight. For more than a decade materials including iron ore were in tight supply. Copper priced below $2000 a ton for much of the 1990s broke $10000 and oil jumped from $20 a barrel to $140.

3. Who says this is another supercycle?

Among the bulls are analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The commodities rally will be a story of a “roaring 20s” post-pandemic economic recovery as well as ultra-loose monetary and fiscal policies according to JPMorgan. Commodities may also jump as an unintended consequence of the fight against climate change which threatens to constrain oil supplies while boosting demand for metals needed to build renewable energy infrastructure and manufacture batteries and electric vehicles it said. Those include cobalt and lithium. Furthermore commodities are typically viewed as a hedge against inflation which has become more of a concern among investors.Play Video

4. Why might this not be one?

Longer-term trends point to a cooling down for some materials. For example the energy transition that heralds a bright new age for green metals such as copper would be built on the decline of oil. Even producers of iron ore the biggest market of mined commodities expect prices to weaken over time as Chinese demand starts to decline and new supply comes online. It’s an even bleaker outlook for coal with producers looking to exit the market altogether as the world switches away from the heavy-polluting fuel. Iron ore coal and oil were the chief beneficiaries of China’s industrial expansion. Those markets dwarf copper in scale.

5. What’s been happening with oil?

Prices collapsed in 2020 even turning negative at one point but have recovered as demand rebounded more strongly than many had expected. Early in 2021 the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies were holding back crude equivalent to about 10% of current global supply. Market fundamentals have shifted especially in the U.S. with the emergence of shale oil. Haunting traditional producers is the prospect that a prolonged period of high prices would trigger a new flood of supply beyond OPEC’s control. Even so some oil bulls aren’t ruling out the eventual return of prices above $100 a barrel.

6. Which other commodities are rising?

Copper was on a tear in early 2021 thanks to rapidly tightening physical markets as governments plow cash into electric-vehicle infrastructure and renewables. Goldman Sachs BlackRock Inc.

Less than two months after closing the acquisition of 128 Technology Juniper has added WAN Assurance and the Marvis Virtual Network Assistant (both driven by Mist AI) to the Session Smart® networks portfolio as well as enhanced the deployment and management of the SRX secure branch gateway using Mist AI. Additionally building on their leadership in the wired/wireless access space Juniper has added a new cloud-native EX switching platform driven by Mist AI. By continuing to expand the Juniper campus and branch portfolio and bringing it all under a common Mist AI umbrella customers benefit from fully integrated AIOps security and troubleshooting across the WLAN LAN and WAN for lower costs and optimized end-user experiences.

Juniper continues its AI-driven journey with strong momentum

“Juniper is consistently recognized for our experience-first approach to networking where AI-driven automation insight and actions simplify operator experiences and optimize end-user experiences from client-to-cloud” said Jeff Aaron VP Enterprise Product Marketing. “These latest product enhancements underscore our sustained commitment to executing on this vision as well as our unique ability to rapidly deliver new solutions that drive real value to both customers and partners.”

The latest additions to Juniper’s AI-driven enterprise include:

WAN Assurance and Marvis™ Virtual Network Assistant (VNA) for Session Smart SD-WAN. Ingesting telemetry data from Session Smart Routers into the Mist AI engine enables customers to set monitor and enforce service levels across the WAN proactively detect anomalies and gain enhanced insight into WAN conditions to assure optimal user experiences.

Brokers had criticized the NSE over the lack of information after the four-hour shutdown on Wednesday. They said they were forced to close intra-day equity positions on another exchange causing sharp losses to some investors.

India’s largest stock exchange NSE announced on Wednesday it shut at 11:40 a.m. local time because of a telecoms problem. It announced market re-opening at about 3:17 p.m. by which time many brokers had closed their investors’ open positions.

In a social media firestorm traders lashed out at the largest broker Zerodha dubbed the Robinhood platform of India by posting snapshots of trading had communicated the re-opening and extension of trading.

The exchange said it decided to continue with its primary systems and not activate its disaster recovery site on Wednesday after evaluating all options to resume trading “at the earliest with least disruption to market participants.”

It added the processes it followed were in line with international best practices. India’s market regulator has asked the NSE to submit a detailed root cause analysis.

NSE said it has a robust resilient secure and fault tolerant technology infrastructure supported by best equipment from vendors like Cisco HP Dell Hitachi Checkpoint Palo Alto Oracle etc. and aided by able technology service providers like TCS Cognizant Wipro etc.

NSE said it has a strong technology governance process in place wherein the technology infrastructure is reviewed on a regular basis by committees like Standing Committee on Technology which has technology experts and also multiple types of audits by various firms/institutions with specialized expertise.

NSE invests in its technology infrastructure on a continuous basis. NSE has almost tripled its annual cash spend on capital and operational expenses on technology to approximately Rs 900 crore over the last 3-4 years. NSE has a technology workforce of approximately 1500 plus people that include employees and vendor staff.

NSE is the largest derivatives exchange in the world by volumes and it has a demonstrated track record of handling significantly high volumes despite a challenging external environment over the last one year due to the pandemic without any impact on trading.

NSE has multiple telecom links with two service providers to ensure redundancy and it received communication of instability of the links from both the service providers.

While there was no impact on the trading system the instability of telecom links resulted in an impact to the online risk management system of NSE Clearing and other systems. Critical systems such as the risk management system are configured with redundancies such that there is no single point of failure.

NSE did not reveal the name of its telecom service providers. Leading mobile operators in India are BSNL Bharti Airtel Vodafone Idea (Vi) MTNL and Reliance Jio.

Given that the online risk management system was unavailable market functioning could not continue normally on NSE and hence had to be shut down. NSE informed market participants around 11:30am that trading on NSE will close at 11:40am.

Post shut down of trading on NSE NSE considered all the available alternatives on hand including invocation of DR to decide on the course of action that would bring up the market at the earliest with least disruption to market participants and post evaluation a decision was taken to bring up the systems at the primary site.

NSE regularly tests its DR readiness in line with SEBI regulations wherein quarterly drills are conducted and live trading sessions from DR site are conducted twice a year.

NSE was continuously working on resolution of the problem and once the same was resolved NSE made an announcement with respect to re-opening of the markets to its members at 3:17pm. This communication was done only after there was visibility and clarity on resumption of services and any prior communication would not have been appropriate.",,,,,,

The Keurig Dr Pepper and Monster Beverage Analyst: Nik Modi maintains an Outperform rating on Keurig Dr Pepper's stock with an unchanged $37 price target. Modi also maintains an Outperform rating on Monster Beverage's stock with an unchanged $104 price target.

The Monster Beverage Thesis: Monster Beverage posted ""very strong results"" that suggest momentum continued into 2021 Modi wrote in a note. The three main positive takeaways from the company's fourth quarter earnings report are:

1. US net sales growth of 16.3% beat expectations of 8% and improved 720 basis points sequentially to 11.8% on a two-year average basis.

2. International net sales improved by 20.4% in the quarter and 18.5% on a two-year average basis. The performance was ""solid"" as the company was up against difficult restrictive measures especially across Europe.

3. January gross sales were higher by 17.2% year-over-year despite two fewer selling days.

Two negative takeaways that are worth noting are: 1) Net sales were impacted by $15.2 million due to product returns in Europe and a labelling issue in Japan and 2) gross margin contracted by 75 basis points even when the returns are excluded.

Management said it will provide a product update soon although its tone on a hard seltzer launch ""was a bit less optimistic"" than prior commentary Modi wrote. While a hard seltzer launch could come in 2022 near-term products will likely focus on caffeinated and non-alcoholic seltzers.

The Keurig Dr Pepper Thesis: Keurig Dr Pepper saw continued momentum in the coffee category along with gains in packaged beverages Modi wrote in a note. The three main takeaways from the company's fourth quarter earnings report are:

1. Coffee Systems shows a (constant currency) sales growth rate of 8.9% in the quarter while the two-year average sales growth accelerated 4 percentage points since September at 6.5%.

2. Packaged beverages grew 7.9% versus the consensus estimate of 5%. The momentum was driven by volume and price mix and cold beverage market share gains.

3. Management's target market of households that could convert to a single-serve coffee machine stands at 60 million.

Looking forward to 2021 Keurig Dr Pepper expects to exceed its original merger target of 2% to 3% annual revenue growth and deliver synergies of $200 million the analyst wrote. Management is also targeting 3% to 4% sales growth and EPS growth of 13% to 15% in 2021.

Story continues

""We believe KDP has a very unique combination of strong underlying growth and significant balance sheet optionality"" Modi wrote.

KDP MNST Price Action: Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper ended Friday at $30.52 down 1.10% while shares of Monster Beverage were up 2.8% at $87.74.

But they haven't rushed it.,"Student teacher Sophia Bonavolonta left works with reading flash cards with student Suhayla Stinette 7 right at Belmont Charter School Thursday February 25 2021. Belmont Charter School started bringing K-2 students back to classrooms last week this week it reopened for grades 3-5. Read more

Eight fourth graders took deep breaths in through their masks inside Belmont Charter Elementary on Thursday morning as an announcement over the loudspeakers guided them: “Breathe relax and get your head ready.”

As the exercise came to a close teacher Jacqueline Pochadt instructed students in the West Philadelphia school to rise from their desks — marked off with tape and spaced six feet apart — and grab their laptops for a math lesson.

Though the children were quiet Pochadt was struck by their presence in the classroom something neither she nor they had experienced in nearly a year. Of course they had spent time together during months of virtual learning but some barely spoke up when logging on from home.

“I didn’t even know” she said “what their voices sounded like.”

While the Philadelphia School District’s reopening plan has stalled amid a dispute with its teachers’ union over building safety some city charters — which enroll about one-third of Philadelphia’s 200000 public school students — have already brought students back to the classroom. The Belmont Charter Network which runs several West Philadelphia schools brought its youngest students back four days a week earlier this month and has since phased in the higher grades. Sixth to eighth graders are due to arrive this week.

Mastery Schools which operates the largest charter network in Philadelphia will be opening its schools there for K-2 students on Monday while KIPP and MaST schools will also resume in-person instruction.

For years the existence and growth of charters across the city has been a controversial topic among educators and parents. Some charter leaders acknowledge the sensitive positions their teachers may be in when their buildings reopen and the wider district does not.

Unlike the School District the city’s charters are largely nonunionized. Yet while the role of teachers’ unions has loomed large in the charged national debate over reopening schools Philadelphia’s charters demonstrate there isn’t a lone factor dictating who’s back in classrooms and who isn’t.

Some charters have returned to in-person learning. Others have not — and have no timetable to do so. Some charter leaders said their small size made it easier for them to reopen — unlike the district with its stable of old buildings persistent financial limitations and a history of mistrust among staff and parents that only intensified with recent problems over building conditions and unchecked environmental hazards.

But that smaller scale can present its own challenges. With 60 staff members “if we had an infection and had to quarantine four staff members we may not be able to adequately function” said Larry Jones CEO of Richard Allen Preparatory Charter School in Southwest Philadelphia which is teaching some special-needs students in person but has not yet planned a broader reopening for its more than 450 students.

In some cases charter leaders say they found a significant number of parents hesitant about sending their children back — or tolerant of virtual learning while the virus remains prevalent.

“We did not get that parental pressure to open. Some schools have people screaming outside yelling — we just didn’t get it” said Claudia Lyles CEO of Keystone Academy Charter School in Tacony which has about 700 students and has not set a date to resume classroom instruction.

» READ MORE: A debate in the Philly suburbs on bringing more students back to classrooms is ‘as political as the presidential election’

Many students came to the charter from traditional public schools where safety was already an issue for some families Lyles said. “In this pandemic I hear the same sentiment: ‘I want my children to be safe.’”

Opinions on reopening schools diverge along racial and socio-economic lines polling shows. A Pew Research Center survey released last week found that 80% of Black 69% of Hispanic and 72% of Asian adults said schools should wait to reopen until all teachers who want the coronavirus vaccine have received it. Just 51% of white adults felt the same way.

And 67% of lower-income adults said schools should wait compared with 57% of middle-income and 52% of high-income adults.

Philadelphia teachers this month began getting vaccines through the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia — a factor that may shift reopening calculations said David Hardy founder and interim CEO of Boys’ Latin Charter School in West Philadelphia.

Hardy’s school has about 800 students but has not yet set a reopening date. He said some teachers have been worried about returning without vaccines — concerns he understands particularly “without clear medical directives from government.” But he also said that the School District’s dispute with its union carries weight with the city’s charters even though they aren’t governed by the same labor agreements.

“You can’t have something that’s way out of kilter from what they do” Hardy said. “There’s a lot of us that probably could have brought kids back” already and convinced parents in the process he said but “the labor deal ... would have been hard. That’s just a hard reality.”

To ready its 24 schools in Philadelphia and Camden — many of which are in district-owned buildings — Mastery Schools spent more than $3 million on ventilation including installing plasma air filters. It also committed $2.5 million for weekly COVID testing for staff and students; and $500000 on personal protective equipment said CEO Scott Gordon. He said federal grants covered the costs as well as savings the network realized from not operating in person this year.

Just under half of Mastery’s elementary students have opted to return in person. Though the charter network is facing some staffing issues — 15%-20% of its staff have requested work-from-home accommodations Gordon said — he expects to fill those gaps in part by tapping teachers to cover for colleagues.

Other unorthodox arrangements were on display Wednesday at Mastery Cramer Hill Elementary in Camden which welcomed K-2 students back a week earlier. In one classroom kindergartners wore headphones and watched a lesson on their laptops.

Their teacher wasn’t at home but in a separate room across the hallway — so that she didn’t have to wear a mask allowing students to see her lips during reading instruction. Another group of kindergartners participated in the lesson from home joining their classmates in the virtual room.

A second teacher walked through the room and sat down next to a boy covering his mouth with a Paw Patrol mask. “I want to go over your sight words” the teacher Kimberly Clark said pulling out a small stack of index cards.

“It” he read.

“At” she corrected him focusing on the first letter: “A apple ah.”

Clark a literacy support teacher said she had been vaccinated and was comfortable being with students. Even though the return to school is far from normal young children especially “need to have that world” she said gesturing at the laminated alphabet and word posters on the classroom walls. “This is where they’re getting exposed to everything.”

Shawnae Wynn a parent at the school called the decision “very hard” but ultimately sent her son Elijah a kindergartner back to Cramer Hill in person. “I wanted him to be around other kids to show the teacher how smart he is how awesome he is” she said.

She said she had some apprehensions but staff walked her through the school and explained precautions such as how often students would wash their hands. “That made me feel safe” she said.

At Belmont which reopened to third through fifth graders this week CEO Jennifer Faustman said the charter network built trust within its community by sending out weekly reports outlining case numbers. Surveys ultimately found 60% of parents favored returning their children to the classroom — compared with just one-third of eligible families who chose that option in the broader citywide school district.

“We reassured them we were following the science” Faustman said as she entered the elementary Thursday passing tables where staff checked that students had answered COVID-19 screening questions before entering the building.

Like some other city charters Belmont Elementary occupies a district-owned building. The school doesn’t have mechanical ventilation; a number of rooms featured window fans — similar to the airflow fix proposed in other buildings that drew outrage from district teachers.

Faustman said the fans were in line with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations and noted that they were just one of the measures employed by the charter which will also offer weekly COVID testing to staff and students.

While it had pushed back earlier reopening dates due to case rates Faustman felt the momentum had now shifted.

While major American companies such as Qualcomm Inc. and Nvidia Corp. dominate their fields they depend on factories abroad to build the chips they design.

As tensions with China heated up last year U.S. lawmakers authorized manufacturing subsidies as part of an annual military spending bill due to concerns that depending on foreign factories for advanced chips posed national security risks.

By Jonathan Stempel

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett makes mistakes too.

The 90-year-old billionaire on Saturday admitted he ""paid too much"" when his Berkshire Hathaway Inc spent $32.1 billion in 2016 to buy aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp its largest acquisition.

Berkshire wrote off $9.8 billion of Precision's value last August as the coronavirus pandemic sapped demand for air travel and the Portland Oregon-based unit's products.

In his annual letter to investors Buffett said he bought ""a fine company - the best in its business"" and Berkshire was ""lucky"" to have Precision Chief Executive Mark Donegan still in charge.

But Buffett said he was ""simply too optimistic about PCC's normalized profit potential.""

Precision shed more than 13400 jobs or 40% of its workforce in 2020 and only recently has begun to improve margins Berkshire said.

""I was wrong ... in judging the average amount of future earnings and consequently wrong in my calculation of the proper price to pay for the business"" Buffett wrote. ""PCC is far from my first error of that sort. But it's a big one.""

Two years ago Buffett admitted he ""overpaid"" for Kraft Foods when Berkshire and private equity firm 3G Capital merged it in 2015 with their H.J. Heinz Co to form Kraft Heinz Co.

And in his 2008 annual letter Buffett called his 1993 purchase of Dexter Shoe his ""worst deal"" ever saying he had bought a ""worthless business"" and compounded his error by using Berkshire stock rather than cash to fund the acquisition.

""I'll make more mistakes in the future - you can bet on that"" he wrote.

Tom Russo a longtime Berkshire investor welcomed Buffett's candor.

""I admire Warren for taking personal responsibility for Precision Castparts"" he said. ""Few managers are willing to admit their responsibility rather than pass on blame.""

You can opt-out at any time.

Last March when lockdowns began grocery store workers and delivery drivers were rightfully hailed as heroes of the pandemic. Even as restaurants and bars closed to stop the spread of coronavirus grocery store employees risked their health and the health of their families to keep Americans fed while white-collar workers transitioned to home offices. From the very beginning of the pandemic they put on homemade masks to stock shelves ring up customers and keep the supply chain working when everything else shut down.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

At the beginning of the pandemic public respect for grocery workers was overwhelming and unanimous

Rodney McMullen the chairman and CEO of the Kroger chain of grocery stores was effusive in his praise: ""Our associates have displayed the true actions of a hero"" McMullen wrote in a press release acknowledging his staff for ""working tirelessly on the frontlines to ensure everyone has access to affordable fresh food and essentials during this national emergency.""

McMullen backed up his words of support for the heroes on his staff with a bold policy: Kroger the largest grocery chain in the nation and the second-largest retailer after Walmart announced on March 31 2020 that it would ""provide all hourly frontline grocery supply chain manufacturing pharmacy and call center associates with a Hero Bonus — a $2 premium above their standard base rate of pay applied to hours worked March 29 through April 18.""

Kroger's Hero Bonus pay program eventually ended in May two months into the pandemic. But the pandemic has continued unabated and grocery store workers continue to live with a very high risk of COVID-19 infection. A Kroger-owned Fred Meyer grocery store in Seattle had an outbreak infecting 10 workers in December for example.

Although the risks for grocery workers are still very high the hero talk has all but disappeared

And so has the hero pay: Kroger employees from around the country report on Indeed that baggers at Kroger grocery stores earn an average of $9.28 an hour while cashiers report pay of $10.53. (Bear in mind too that those average wages are likely inflated due to cities like Seattle and New York City that embraced a $15 minimum wage .) According to nearly 37000 employee reports Indeed said ""Few people think they are paid fairly at Kroger Stores."" In exchange for putting their health on the line for a full year in thankless public-facing jobs many Kroger workers earn wages that don't even lift them above the poverty line.

This year leaders began to demand that grocery stores pay their employees extra during the pandemic. Lawmakers in Long Beach and in Seattle among other cities passed a $4-per-hour hazard pay bonus for workers at large grocery store chains.

The laws brought some much-needed attention back to workers who have disappeared from the public consciousness and that pressure seems to have worked: After Seattle's City Council approved hazard pay grocery chain Trader Joe's responded by temporarily raising worker pay around the country by $4 an hour.

This is great economic news for everyone: not only are workers being rewarded for performing tasks that white-collar workers would never do but those workers also have extra money in their pockets which they'll spend in their communities — including at grocery stores.

How Kroger responded very differently than Trader Joe's

In both Long Beach and in Seattle Kroger issued press releases announcing that they were closing two stores blaming the hazard pay for the closures.

I suspect the situation in Long Beach is similar but since I live in Seattle I can better speak to the closures here. The two QFC grocery stores that Kroger is closing in Seattle are small underperforming stores in upscale walkable neighborhoods that have other — most would argue superior — grocery options nearby. (The other thirteen QFC stores owned by Kroger in Seattle will remain open as well as Kroger's three Fred Meyer stores inside Seattle city limits where the hazard pay applies.)

And at least one of the targeted Seattle QFC locations had already been slated for redevelopment in the near future. In other words it seems likely that Kroger could be exploiting stores that were failing before the pandemic to make the point they really want made — if city councils elsewhere try to raise wages Kroger will continue to hold their employees' lives and livelihoods hostage in order to keep wages low and profits sky-high.

Giant corporations love to use splashy intimidation tactics like this to create fear-inducing headlines which help to peel support away from worker protections. But make no mistake: Even though Kroger's press releases suggested that the grocery business relies on ""razor-thin"" profit margins Kroger has been making a ridiculous amount of money during the pandemic.

Because people have been working and eating at home over the last year Kroger has boasted of record-breaking profits. For the first two quarters of 2020 reports the Detroit Free Press its net earnings nearly doubled ""to more than $2.031 billion compared with $1.069 billion in the same period of 2019.""

In the third quarter of 2020 Kroger announced operating profits of $792 million

And with grocery spending in Washington state up by double-digit percentages since the beginning of the pandemic it seems highly unlikely that hazard pay is the tipping-point expense that forced Kroger to pull the plug on these stores.

And while Kroger isn't willing to pay the ""heroes'' its leadership loves to praise in press releases the corporation happily opened their wallets for shareholders this year paying out a dividend of 18 cents per share.

Last year Kroger said in a press release ""We have returned approximately $6.4 billion to shareholders via dividends and repurchased shares [also known as stock buybacks] since the beginning of fiscal 2017."" As thanks for returning obscene profits to shareholders CEO W. Rodney McMullen received $21 million in total compensation in 2019 an increase of 76% over the year before and 798 times the median annual Kroger employee salary that same year.

McMullen wasn't the only one who received hero pay a year before the pandemic ExecPay noted: ""In 2019 six Kroger executives received on average a compensation package of $8.7 million a 46% increase compared to previous year.""

While Kroger can find plenty of money for its CEO its executive team and its shareholders the corporation picks up its toys and heads home when city lawmakers ask it to increase pay for the frontline workers who have been putting their lives on the line so that Kroger can boast about their unprecedented profits.

The math is clear: Kroger's coffers are more than full enough to reward its employees for their essential work in the midst of a global pandemic. McMullen and his executive team apparently prefer to keep that ""hero pay"" for themselves.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8va2F0di5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8xLWluanVyZWQtaW4tbGl0dGxlLXJvY2stc2hvb3RpbmctMDItMjgtMjAyMdIBTGh0dHBzOi8va2F0di5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMS1pbmp1cmVkLWluLWxpdHRsZS1yb2NrLXNob290aW5nLTAyLTI4LTIwMjE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,23-year-old shot and killed in Little Rock Kroger parking lot,"A 23-year-old man was shot in the stomach and killed during a drug deal in the parking lot of a Little Rock Kroger Sunday afternoon.

US District Judge Peter Sheridan in New Jersey on Friday February 26 rejected an argument by two California residents who bought Lipitor that they needed a separate class because the lead plaintiffs municipalities and health plans were third-party payors that did not take the drug themselves and so lacked standing to bring claims under California’s Cartwright Act an antitrust law.

The lawsuit filed in 2012 stems from a 2008 settlement of a patent lawsuit filed by Pfizer against Ranbaxy over Ranbaxy’s plan to make generic Lipitor. Under the deal Pfizer agreed to drop a claim for damages against Ranbaxy and Ranbaxy agreed to stay out of the Lipitor market until November 2011.

Retailers and distribution companies claim that the settlement amounted to Pfizer paying Ranbaxy to stay out of the Lipitor market violating antitrust laws. But Sheridan ruled on Friday that their case failed because they did not offer any allegation of the settlement’s dollar value.

The SWFO spacecraft will collect space weather data such as continuous data from coronal mass ejections and solar flares that can damage spacecraft and disrupt electrical power grid and communications and will provide an advanced warning for such events.

Scheduled to launch in 2025 the SWFO mission is planned as a ride share with the NASA Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe.

Plus in related news L3Harris delivered the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) instrument for NOAA’s Joint Polar Satellite System-2 (JPSS2) in January of 2021. The advanced CrIS instrument provides detailed three-dimensional temperature and moisture data from both the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership and JPSS/NOAA satellites. JPSS-2 is the second of NOAA’s latest generation of U.S. polar-orbiting non-geosynchronous environmental satellites.

Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow are two highly regarded figures in American entertainment. The two were married for a brief period in the 1960s and their divorce — and relationship in the decades after that — has been a subject of discussion for years.

Mia Farrow and Frank Sinatra’s whirlwind romance

Sinatra and Farrow met in 1964 when Farrow was 19 and Sinatra was 49. Farrow was a new actor who starred on the show Peyton’s Place while Sinatra was already a giant in the entertainment industry.

According to J. Randy Taraborrelli’s book Frank Sinatra: Behind the Legend their first encounter was awkward yet adorable. Farrow accidentally spilled out the contents of her purse on the floor and was mortified at having the Frank Sinatra help her pick up things such as cat food and her retainer off the floor.

Still Sinatra immediately fell in love. “I was hers instantly” the singer recalled. “I loved that hair man. I think the hair’s what got me.”

Mia Farrow and Frank Sinatra’s marriage didn’t last long

The two tied the knot in 1966 but they both had very different ideas about what marriage should be like. Sinatra wanted his wife to stay at home and be a housewife whose husband provides for her while Farrow was a passionate actor who refused to give up her craft. The couple eventually split two years later after the release of Farrow’s breakout movie Rosemary’s Baby.

“Sinatra divorced Farrow because he demanded that she drop out of filming Rosemary’s Baby after three-quarters of the movie had been filmed to co-star with him in a forgettable movie The Detective” Sinatra biographer Darwin Porter told The Express in 2013. “That was Sinatra being crazy; he’d do things like that. Mia loved him but his demands were unreasonable. She couldn’t do it.”

Sinatra was furious with Farrow and served her with divorce papers on the set of Rosemary’s Baby. It was a low blow but the couple remained friends for years.

“She never stopped loving him” Porter said. “Sinatra was the love of her life. It was a love affair that continued even after their divorce and they remained close till the end. She told friends that she was still very much in love with him.”

Frank Sinatra warned Mia Farrow about Woody Allen

In 1992 Farrow discovered her partner filmmaker Woody Allen had been sexually abusing their daughters Dylan and Soon-Yi. When Sinatra got wind of the situation he was ready to come to his ex-wife’s defense.

According to Woody Allen biographer David Evanier Sinatra offered to have Allen’s legs broken in her testimony during Farrow’s 1993 custody battle with the superstar director. Sinatra himself never confirmed the story but Evanier wrote in his biography that a singer named Frankie Randall secretly told concert producer Len Triola about Sinatra’s anger.

“Frank wanted [Woody Allen] f*cking clipped. Taken out. That’s what he wanted” Triola claimed. “Frank loved Mia. He spoke to three people every day — his wife his daughter Nancy and Mia.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

In April more than 27 million people logged into “Fortnite” to attend a live event produced by the game’s publisher Epic Games Inc. Players used their avatars to dance and explore a custom-designed psychedelic game world as a colossal animated version of rapper Travis Scott performed live.



The in-game performance offered an early glimpse of how concerts and other live events might be adapted to a fully virtual format said Kristen Boesel senior lifestyles and leisure analyst at Mintel Group Ltd.’s Chicago office.



“You can kind of be transported to different scenarios” she said. “In one song you’re transported underwater. These are over-the-top fanciful things that wouldn’t make as much sense if you were just watching them on a screen at a concert.”



With most in-person events off the table because of the pandemic musicians and concert promoters have scrambled to keep fans engaged through imaginative virtual events and intimate concerts live-streamed from theaters studios and homes.



Fueled by innovative Los Angeles companies these livestream performances could persist long after the pandemic subsides.



“Livestreaming is going to explode” said Robert Ellin chief executive of Beverly Hills-based LiveXLive Media Inc. “It’s just going to keep growing. What we’re creating is the next generation of music videos and that drives your artist sales and it drives your ticket sales.”



The concert and events industry has been among the hardest hit by Covid-19. Losses in the United States amounted to more than $26.1 billion in 2020 according to a report by IBISWorld Inc. analyst Kevin Kennedy who said the industry would likely continue to feel the effects of the pandemic in 2021 and beyond.



Not all virtual events staged during the pandemic have been ambitious visually spectacular experiences like the Fortnite performance. But Boesel said the artists and companies staging these events are in a period of experimentation in which they are trying to discover what will resonate with viewers.



“There’s a level of excitement among people to get back out there and see their favorite bands but no one’s sure yet when that’s going to be safe” she said. “In the meantime it’s giving a chance for these virtual experiences to develop and put down roots.”



Virtual shows merchandise

Palms-based WaveXR Inc. and TikTok which has offices in Culver City collaborated on a live event in August featuring singer The Weeknd. Songs were accompanied by mesmerizing animations and viewers had the opportunity to vote in polls that affected elements of the performance.



According to Wave the event drew approximately 3 million viewers.



In October singer Billie Eilish offered fans a ticketed performance using a streaming platform created by Playa Vista-based Maestro Interactive Inc. Video of Eilish performing was supplemented by augmented reality layers seemingly changing the environment around the singer between each song. Attendees could visit a virtual merchandise shop and interact with one another in a comments thread while viewing the performance.



Some of these events like the concerts hosted in Fortnite and on TikTok are free to view though fans are encouraged to purchase digital items and merchandise tied to the shows. Others are ticketed pay-per-view events. The Billie Eilish concert for instance cost $30 per virtual ticket.



Virtual events like these have been successful enough that established music and entertainment industry companies appear to be taking note.



Beverly Hills-based concert promoter and ticketing titan Live Nation Entertainment Inc. announced in January that it had acquired a majority stake in Glendale-based livestreaming company Veeps Inc. which hosted close to 1000 ticketed streaming shows in 2020.



Meanwhile Sony Corp. revealed at this year’s virtual Consumer Electronics Show that it had launched a new Los Angeles-based division called Sony Immersive Music Studios which is producing a series of ticketed virtual concerts with singer Madison Beer set to take place later this month.



This type of investment suggests that virtual and livestreamed concerts may continue to play a major role in the music industry even after in-person shows are safer to attend.



“Livestreamed concerts will be a long-term part of the music market not just a lockdown stopgap” Midia Research lead music analyst Mark Mulligan said in an email. “But for them to fulfill their potential there needs to be an understanding that virtual events are a new video format not a new live format.”



Mulligan cited the Billie Eilish concert as an example of something fans would pay for even during a live tour because it offered an experience that would be impossible to recreate in an in-person setting.



Years before the pandemic LiveXLive had already made livestreaming concerts and events a core part of its business. The company streams hundreds of live events and original shows which viewers can access through a range of membership options.

Andrea Bocelli is best known as a classical tenor but he’s branched out in recent years even singing some Elvis Presley. Back in 2012 the star performed a concert in Portofino Italy with pianist David Foster where he gave a live rendition of the hit track. Before performing Foster said: “We’re going to Las Vegas now. This is so surreal to me to have Andrea Bocelli the great tenor in Portofino under the stars.

Foster continued: “He said to me ‘I want to do an Elvis Presley song.’ “Now Elvis Presley is a Rock and Roller but he did have some great love songs and we’d like to do one of them for you right now.” Bocelli then broke into Love Me Tender accompanied by Foster on the piano and an orchestra. The Italian tenor’s cover of the 1956 Elvis hit features on his 2013 album Passione. READ MORE: Andrea Bocelli: The spectacular first time he sang Con te Partiro

While the melody is adapted from an American Civil War Ballard called Aura Lee. Elvis famously performed Love Me Tender on The Ed Sullivan Show on September 9 1956 before its release. And of course the track’s name was also shared by The King’s acting debut that year too.

Originally the track was written for a female singer and was called Can’t Help Falling In Love With Him. This is why the first and third lines when sung by Elvis and Bocelli ended with the words “in” and “sin”. Most recently Bocelli’s latest album Believe features a cover of Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah plus Christian favourites Amazing Grace and Ave Maria. The record also features a couple of new duets with Alison Krauss and Cecilia Bartoli which had to be recorded remotely due to the pandemic.

Earlier this month her interview with Chris Harrison made headlines after the Bachelor franchise host defended contestant Rachael Kirkconnell's racist actions. After receiving backlash both Harrison and Kirkconnell issued apologies. Harrison would later go on to announce in a second statement that he would be taking time off and not host the upcoming After the Final Rose special with Matt James and his final pick.

On Friday Lindsay's friend and co-host of their Higher Learning podcast Van Lathan posted a video defending the former Bachelorette and telling people to stop harassing her.

""Rachel Lindsay disabled her Instagram earlier today. She did it because that's how much hate she's getting from Bachelor fans who are spamming her with all kinds of rude and hateful things"" Lathan says in his clip adding that people need to ""get a life"" and ""Rachel is not responsible for Chris Harrison.""

""A 49-year-old man who can't read the room in these present 2021 times"" he continued. ""She's not responsible for that. It's not her job to make excuses or provide cover for someone who doesn't understand what the f**k triggers people in today's world.""

He also noted that it's just ""The Bachelor and it's not worth harassing somebody over"" before sending Lindsay his love.

Additionally Lindsay's husband Bryan Abasolo also posted a photo of the two writing her an encouraging message.

""I love you I appreciate you I believe in you and I just wanted to let you know how proud of you I am. Keep going and never stop being you and fighting for what’s right ❤️🙏🏼"" he captioned the photo.

Many Bachelor and Bachelorette alums sent their love and support to Lindsay. Becca Kufrin posted a photo of her and the reality star expressing that online bullying is not OK.

""To Rachel Lindsay: I love you I stand by you and I support you in whatever way shape or form that’s needed"" she wrote in part. ""We live in a world where online toxicity racism racial insensitivity & ignorance bullying and cruelty have become a norm. This is simply not okay.""

Nick Viall also defended his ""friend"" who competed on his season of The Bachelor.

""It’s sad that this even needs to be said but Chris Harrison is in the position he is in because of what he said not because of anything Rachel did"" he wrote in part. ""If you want to support Chris while he is down you should be able to do that without showing hate to anyone else.""

Instagram Story

JoJo Fletcher also wrote in part ""Hearing that Rachel Lindsay had to deactivate her account bc of the horrible bullying taking place is awful and unacceptable. We need to come together and be kinder to one another. Please- if you have ever been on the wrong side of this do better. Be better.""

Instagram Story

In a series of Instagram Stories Kaitlyn Bristowe also spoke about how she didn't care if she lost followers but ""will not stand for"" anyone harassing Lindsay. Her boyfriend Jason Tartick also spoke out in IG Story clips.

Additionally Kirkconnell also posted a new statement about how people need to stop harassing Lindsay.

Just after Matt James' Bachelor premiere in January a TikTok user accused Kirkconnell -- an early front runner on the show -- of bullying her in the past for dating Black men. Then another user accused Kirkconnell of liking racist photos. Pics have also surfaced of Kirkconnell at an Old South plantation-themed party while in college. In his interview with Lindsay Harrison defended Kirkconnell's actions adding that people should offer her ""grace.""

Lindsay recently said she would not be renewing her contract with the Bachelor franchise following this latest controversy. In an episode of Higher Learning with Lathan a couple weeks ago Lindsay did react to Harrison's initial apology.

""He never gave me room to talk and he never gave me room to share my perspective"" she said of her Extra interview with Harrison. ""He wasn't trying to hear it. He was just trying to be heard. And that's because I felt like he had an agenda that he was really trying to push.""

""I'm having a really really hard time reasoning or really taking in and accepting this apology and I'll tell you why"" she said. ""When I finished that interview with Chris Harrison he had no problems with it. He was fine. He texted me after. He appreciated the conversation. He was like 'Yeah I'll probably get a little flack.' He thought it was great that we could disagree but do it in a civil way.""

Yet the person at the very top of the chain Liberty top dog Greg Maffei says F1 is “preparing for a balance sheet that is invincible whatever comes”.

We are used to hearing F1 players insisting bad things are not as bad as they appear. But this contrast between the black-and-white financials and F1’s optimism – particularly for a post-pandemic world – is unusually severe.

Eight ways the cost cap will change F1 this year Read more

F1’s three main revenue streams were hit last year: fans were banned from attending almost all events so F1 had to significantly reduce or eliminate race hosting faces for promoters television broadcast deals were honoured by virtue of the rejigged 17-race schedule but came with lower fees and other one-time negotiations while sponsorship fees and other revenue-generating activities were also reduced.

As a result F1’s annual revenue plummeted from $2022m to $1145m in 2020 a fall of 43% while a $17m profit in 2019 became a $386m operating loss. Debt at F1 level remains at $2.9bn.

Such figures would normally bring a company to its knees. Liberty and F1 are not exactly shrugging them off but its response now bears a passing resemblance to a ‘so what?’.

That’s because of a mix of pre-emptive action taken months ago and genuine optimism about what 2021 has in store.

When the pandemic’s grip started to take hold last year several emergency measures were taken to protect the short-term and long-term interests of the teams and the championship including delaying new technical rules to 2022 a reduced budget cap for 2021 and development freezes.

But there was also a significant development within the Liberty organisation. It renegotiated the terms of its $2.9bn loan – which gave it a stay of execution should its debt levels rise substantially versus its earnings – and it redistributed its assets and liabilities between F1 and its sister company the Liberty SiriusXM Group which made more than $1bn in liquidity available to F1.

The F1 side of the Liberty business effectively traded its Live Nation Entertainment stake part of its share of the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball organisation and $1.3bn in liabilities in return for $1.4bn in cash and a $165m call spread in Live Nation stocks.

At the time Maffei said it gave the business certainty and flexibility to respond appropriately to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was a way to help F1 weather the storm – which it did.

Against all the odds F1 pulled off a 17-race season and while it was done with conditions that contributed to the miserable financial situation outlined above it was infinitely better than no season at all.

Now F1 has emerged the other side of an unimaginably difficult year and is a long way off reaching the maximum level its debt versus earnings ratio can be. Though the pandemic itself is not over there are bullish comments being made about its revenue streams being rebuilt – not just over the coming years but in 2021.

One step will be reintroducing fans which F1 believes will happen throughout the season and potentially result in 100% fan attendance at the end of the year. This will unlock ‘normal’ promoter contracts and also resuscitate F1’s ailing sponsorship and hospitality revenue streams.

Our optimistic predictions for F1 2021 Read more

That means 2021 will not be back to normal but it will kickstart the process.

“I think promotion will still be reduced in ’21 certainly versus what we would have in a non-pandemic year” Maffei admits.

“We will have restricted audiences and restricted fans at some of our events so I do expect that.

“It’ll definitely be impacted the amount to which we’ll see.

“We expect a fairly normal broadcast revenue stream. Our goal was to try and take the pain in 2020 to a degree that we rightly had to make concessions to some of our broadcasters.

“Our goal as much as possible was to make that a 2020 event and bring ’21 back to normal. That is our hope and our expectation.”

Longer-term Maffei (pictured above) made an interesting observation regarding the new Concorde Agreement all 10 teams signed up to last summer. While that has been hailed as having a more equitable distribution arrangement between the teams themselves Maffei says it will gradually “increase profitability” for F1 itself.

“The rates get a little more attractive for us” he says.

“Whether we’ll hit that in ’21 given the risks around pandemic I’m not as confident.

“But in the years going forward as we continue to have a fully healthy business I do believe our share of the margin will slightly increase.”

This will be underscored by F1 moving into a more sustainable competitive future in 2022 when new technical rules (illustrated above) augment the 2021 introduction of the budget cap and other elements like an aerodynamic testing handicap system. A healthier cheaper more entertaining F1 is an encouraging long-term revenue prospect.

Liberty’s overarching optimism is also reinforced by its decision to set up an acquisition company raising $500m through the sale of shares to add a new media or entertainment business to its portfolio.

It’s investing at a time it could have easily been forced to contract presumably seeking cheaper purchases at a time the industry it’s looking at is struggling and then being in a good position to benefit as normality returns.

That means F1 is part of an organisation leaning into a difficult situation which has added a silver lining to the dark clouds lingering overhead for a year now.

Make no mistake the numbers revealed on Friday were miserable. However confident Liberty is for the future there is no escaping that. Teams losing $300m collectively in payments is as unsustainable for their existence as losing almost $900m in revenue is for F1 as a business.

But much like F1’s bosses deserve credit for reacting to the pandemic last year and putting on a world championship Liberty’s resourcefulness in the background has made those numbers survivable. It will adopt similar flexibility as F1 seeks to recover.

“We certainly aren’t in the crystal ball business exactly but we are in the business of trying to prepare to make sure we benefit when it does open” says Maffei.

“And that we’re prepared if that doesn’t happen at the rate of change or pace that we would like.”

That means if F1 can make more money this year it will do so. If it can’t it will weather a second probably slightly smaller storm.

The bottom line is if 2021 comes even remotely closely to F1’s expectations Liberty’s crucial goal of making last year’s financial misery a one-time event will be achieved.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzLmNvLnVrL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbXVzaWMvMTM5ODcyNS9BbmRyZWEtQm9jZWxsaS1ibGluZC13aGF0LWhhcHBlbmVkLXRvLUFuZHJlYS1Cb2NlbGxpLWV5ZXNpZ2h0LWFjY2lkZW50LWV2Z9IBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzLmNvLnVrL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbXVzaWMvMTM5ODcyNS9BbmRyZWEtQm9jZWxsaS1ibGluZC13aGF0LWhhcHBlbmVkLXRvLUFuZHJlYS1Cb2NlbGxpLWV5ZXNpZ2h0LWFjY2lkZW50LWV2Zy9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Andrea Bocelli blind: What happened to Andrea Bocelli?,"Andrea Bocelli performs 'Hallelujah' live with Fiorella Mannoia

Andrea Bocelli’s voice is instantly recognisable for his fans and is responsible for making opera popular in the mainstream market. Celine Dion even once compared his voice to that of God showing how besotted his fans truly are. However one of Andrea’s most distinguishing features is his lost eyesight - so what happened to him?

How did Andrea Bocelli go blind? Andrea had eye problems when he was very young and has even said due to these being suspected his mother was advised to abort him. He told The Daily Telegraph: “...the doctors advised her to abort the child. They told her that would be the best solution because the child would doubtless be born with some kind of disability. “But the courageous young wife decided not to terminate the pregnancy and the child was born. The woman was my mother I was the child.” READ MORE: Garth Brooks wife: Was Garth Brooks married before he met Trisha?

MIDDLE RIVER MD—Lockheed Martin will be consolidating operations and closing its Middle River facility.

The Middle River operations center supports small combatants and ship systems programs including the MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) next generation launching systems ship controls and automation and Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) engineering and sustainment according to FOX 45.

“In our ongoing effort to drive down costs for customers and increase efficiency and value we are consolidating some operations in our Rotary and Mission Systems business to better align employees technology and facilities to meet customer needs” the Bethesda-based defense contractor told The Baltimore Sun.

The company plans to offer the 465 employees at the Middle River facility a chance to relocate or telework.

The transitions are expected to begin in 2022.

Lockheed Martin currently employs more than 3150 people in Maryland.

Like a bolt out of the blue Lockheed Martin’s renown Skunk Works publicly teased one of aviation’s great snark hunts—revealing plans for a successor to the SR-71 the legendary Mach-3 reconnaissance plane designed with slide rules and retired when the millennials were born.

That 59-year old aircraft originally developed as an uber-interceptor still holds the record for fastest sustained supersonic flight at 2100 miles per hour—much faster than a .50-caliber bullet.

But the new plane announced years back the SR-72 will fly twice as fast—so fast that at top speed the very air entering its engines will be moving as fast as an SR-71. Keeping combustion and thrust going under such conditions has been likened to lighting a cigar in a hurricane. The SR-72’s planned ability to go from a standing start to Mach 6 and back again is a hat trick no one has been able to pull off.

Yet an SR-72 demonstrator reportedly first appeared in plain view in California in July 2017.

According to Aviation Week Skunk Works has developed a way to run turbojet engines at high temperatures and power levels high enough to push the SR-72 to Mach 2.5. The ramjet-scramjet second stage requires speeds above Mach 3 or 3.5 to operate a “thrust chasm” which Lockheed Martin says it’s solved … though it won’t say how.

Turbojet? Ramjet? Scramjet? A turbojet spins many blades to compress and heat incoming air before setting it on fire and riding the resulting plume of hot expanding gas. A ramjet moves so fast that the air entering the engine is already hot and compressed enough to ignite the fuel. A scramjet—short for “supersonic combustion ramjet”—is just that a ramjet where the incoming air is moving at supersonic speeds.

At hypersonic speeds there’s no additional sonic boom but the air piles up so fast along the aircraft’s leading edges that they reach blast-furnace temperatures.

The SR-71 heated up so much due to the friction of its flight that its body panels fit together loosely on the ground and expanded snugly in flight.

But the breathtaking potential of hypersonic flight at Mach 5 and above has driven research forward for more than 70 years in good times and bad from Nazi wonder weapons to the Right Stuff and the Pacific pivot. Even before any man-made machine had reached supersonic speeds the hypersonic domain enchanted some remarkable minds.

Das Flug aus die Silbervogel:

Eugene Saenger first tackled the concept of a multi-thousand-mile-per-hour aircraft in his 1933 doctoral thesis; breakthrough work on cooling rocket engines by re-circulating cryogenic fuel through their walls brought him to the attention of Hitler’s regime. Like Wernher von Braun Saenger was encouraged to apply his radical ideas to building the Reich’s might.

Von Braun’s V-2 ballistic missile rammed home the frightful speed and power of supersonic weapons; the citizens of London and Antwerp got no warning of the huge missiles which fell three times faster than the sound they made. Saenger and colleague Irene Bredt’s design the Silbervogel or “Silverbird” in English might have brought stealthy death to New York and Chicago from halfway around the world.

The Silverbird also known as the Antipodal Bomber combined so many crazy ideas in one slick package that it’s easy to understand its hold on imaginations so many years later and why the Reich Air Ministry passed on building a prototype. The Nazi space plane’s final design was a 91-foot-long plank-bellied lifting body sporting stubby wings a monster 100-ton-thrust rocket motor and the fuel and liquid oxygen tanks to feed it.

Mounted on a giant rocket sled traveling down a two-mile-long monorail the single pilot and his single (big) bomb would be hurled into the sky at nearly Mach 2 before the Silverbird’s own rocket took it 70 miles up at Mach 19.

Seem familiar? It’s because the system inspired a certain 1950s science-fiction movie.

As if the launch and boost phase weren’t enough this dieselpunk spaceplane’s flight phase the “skip-glide” technique became a strategic warfighter’s dream. Get an aerospace vehicle going high and fast enough then drop it back into the atmosphere just so and it will skip off the denser air like a tossed stone skipping off a quiet lake.

The skip then carries the vehicle back into space friction slowing the vehicle with every skip. Saenger and Bredt calculated that the Silverbird could achieve a range of over 14000 miles nearly halfway to the Antipodes by skip-gliding around the world from an initial boost in Germany.

Alas later calculations revealed that the Silverbird would more than likely have suffered the fate of the Space Shuttle Columbia sometime during the flight.

Despite its magnificent technical sweetness the Silverbird’s mission was a mix of strategic bombing and pure terror. A four-ton bomb can do a lot of damage and the psychological impact of a continental American city being bombed out of the blue would have been tremendous. Planned strategic targets included aluminum smelters and aircraft plants.

Goering’s air ministry dismissed the Saenger-Bredt concept and pursued other methods of attacking the United States. Joseph Stalin however took the concept seriously enough that after the war he ordered the NKVD to (unsuccessfuly) kidnap Saenger and Bredt from France.

Like many other aerospace rivalries hypersonic research took off in both Cold War superpowers from its start under Hitler.

The Right Stuff:

In the United States flight at Mach 5-plus was fitted into the ongoing national effort that took Maj. Chuck Yeager through the sound barrier.

By the mid 1950s the X-15 program had focused on designs materials and protocols for hypersonic flight and by the early 1960’s X-15 pilots sporting astronauts’ wings were routinely flying into space at Mach 6 from Edwards Air Force Base in California. As Tom Wolfe lyrically recounted in his classic work The Right Stuff the X-15’s winged piloted approach soon gave way to the rounded capsules of Mercury Gemini and Apollo.

The Air Force nearly achieved hypersonic flight half a century ago with the X-20 DynaSoar the great might-have-been link between the Silverbird the Space Shuttle and the SR-72. Designed to soar into space atop a Titan missile orbit like a space capsule and land like a fighter plane the X-20 fulfilled the Silverbird dream only to be killed off by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara.

Space Shuttle engineers in the 1970s relied on X-20 research in designing their spaceship. Today the recently-retired Space Shuttle is perhaps the most familiar hypersonic vehicle in the world. The Space Shuttles soared into space at Mach 23 before leaving the atmosphere—and flew “like bricks with wings“ at hypersonic speeds during their fiery descents.

The tremendous heat experienced by the Shuttle during re-entry gives us a glimpse of the challenges facing the SR-72—the slightest crack in the surface can let in blowtorch heat and wind. And could destroy the vehicle and crew.

All successful hypersonic vehicles to date have been hurled forward by rocket power from the WAC Corporal in 1949 to the X-51 Waverider this spring. Most recent U.S. hypersonic research has been focused on developing prompt long-range strike weapons in the form of air sea and sub-launched payloads boosted up to cruise speed by rocket power.

Indeed SpaceX’s Falcon 1 rocket was funded in part to create a booster for hypersonic payloads.

And that’s what makes the SR-72 really amazing. If Lockheed Martin and its partners call pull it off flight will never be the same. Aerojet-Rocketdyne has a long distinguished pedigree in the propulsion field ranging from 21-foot-wide solid fuel boosters and nuclear rockets to the Saturn V and Space Shuttle main engines.

An aircraft that can take off and land on standard runways fly faster than a speeding bullet—and do so affordably—would quickly find its technology spreading throughout the aviation industry. The V-22 Osprey shrunk Iraq to the size of Rhode Island. The SR-72 and its kin could shrink the Indo-Pacific to the size of California.

How did this happen you ask? Well it's a long complicated story but basically it involves taking something that's supposed to do one thing and do it well like take off from the ground and fly really fast and adding stuff like being able to take off and land on an aircraft carrier or hover like a hummingbird.

That's why they call it the ""flying Swiss Army knife."" Have you ever tried to use one of the things? First of all you can't find the knife blade hidden as it is among scissors and screwdrivers and can openers and nose hair tweezers and nail files and pliers. The geniuses at the Pentagon decided they needed to replace the aging F-16 fighter and everybody wanted in on it.

The F-16 is what you would call the M1A1 airplane of U.S. forces. The Air Force currently has about 1450 of the planes with 700 of those in the active duty Air Force about 700 in the Air National Guard and 50 in the Reserves. General Dynamics has built about 4600 of them since the plane became operational in the mid-1970s and they are used by allied air forces all over the world. You fill them up with jet fuel push the starter button and take off. It will fly at twice the speed of sound it will carry 15 different bombs including two nuclear weapons it can shoot down enemy aircraft with five different varieties of air-to-air missiles it can knock out ground targets with four different air-to-ground missiles and it can carry two kinds of anti-ship missiles. The thing is an all-around killing machine.

The F-35 on the other hand can't fly at twice the speed of sound. In fact it comes with what amounts to a warning label on its control panel marking supersonic flight as ""for emergency use only."" So it's OK to fly the thing like a 737 but if you want to go really fast you have to ask permission which promises to work really really well in a dogfight. What are pilots going to do if they're being pursued by a supersonic enemy jet?

The F-35 will carry four different air-to-air missiles six air-to-ground missiles and one anti-ship missile but the problem is all of them have to be fired from the air and right now the F-35 isn't yet ""operational"" which means essentially that it's so unsafe to fly the damn things they spend most of their time parked.

Take the problem they have with switches. The developers of the F-35 decided to go with touchscreen switches rather than the physical ones used in other fighters like toggles or rocker switches. That would be nice if they worked but pilots report that the touchscreen switches don't function 20 percent of the time. So you're flying along and you want to drop your landing gear to land but your touchscreen decides ""not this time pal"" and refuses to work. How would you like to be driving your car and have your brakes decide not to work 20 percent of the time like say when you're approaching a red light at a major intersection?

But it gets worse. The heat coating on the engine's rotor blades is failing at a rate that leaves 5 to 6 percent of the F-35 fleet parked on the tarmac at any given time awaiting not just engine repairs but total replacement. Then there's the canopy. You know what a canopy is don't you? It's the clear bubble pilots look through so they can see to take off and land not to mention see other aircraft such as enemy aircraft. Well it seems F-35 canopies have decided to ""delaminate"" at inappropriate times making flying the things dangerous if not impossible. So many of them have failed that the Pentagon has had to fund an entirely new canopy manufacturer to make replacements.

There's also the problem with the plane's ""stealth"" capability which is compromised if you fly the thing too fast because the coating that makes the plane invisible to radar has a bad habit of peeling off making the planes completely visible to enemy radar.

But fear not Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. has come up with a solution. He announced last week that henceforth the Pentagon is going to treat the F-35 as the ""Ferrari"" of the U.S. combat air fleet. ""You don't drive your Ferrari to work every day you only drive it on Sundays. This is our 'high end' fighter we want to make sure we don't use it all for the low-end fight"" he said in a press conference on Feb. 17.

Got it. If an enemy decides to start a war on a Tuesday or Wednesday we'll just ""drive"" our aging F-16's so our precious F-35s can be left in the garage waiting for good weather on Sunday. I'm sure we can get everyone to sign up for the ""we'll only go to war on Sunday"" treaty.

The F-35 can be understood best as a na-na-na-na-na problem. Originally developed for the Air Force the minute the thing was on the drafting table the Navy and Marines started crying ""Hey what about us?"" To quiet the jealous fit being thrown by the other services the Pentagon agreed to turn the thing into the ""Swiss Army knife"" it has become.

A variant capable of taking off from and landing on carriers was promised to the Navy with bigger wings and a tail hook. Except the tail hook refused to work for the first two years it was tested meaning that every carrier landing had to take place in sight of land so the Navy F-35 could fly over to the coast and land safely on a runway.

The Marine variety had to be capable of vertical takeoff and landing because the Navy was jealous of its carriers and would only agree to allow the Marines to have mini-carriers with landing surfaces big enough for vertical use. That meant the Marine version had to be redesigned so it had a big flap under the engine to divert thrust so the thing could land on Marine ships. This meant the Marine version had added weight and space that would otherwise be used to carry weapons.

So you're a Marine and you're flying along in your F-35 and an enemy comes along and starts shooting at you and you shoot back and miss but you don't have another missile because where that missile should be is where your damn vertical landing flap is.

Maybe they should just issue F-35 pilots a bunch of flags to use when they take to the air and then they'd be ready for anything. Tail starts coming off because you went supersonic for too long? Fly your NO FAIR flag. Cockpit delaminating? Grab your JUST A MINUTE I can't see you flag. Engine rotor blades burning up? That would be the OOOPS can't dogfight right now I'm waiting on a replacement engine flag.

Not to worry pilots the Pentagon is on the problem and they have a solution. Brown says they're going back to the drawing board for a ""fifth generation-minus"" fighter jet meaning they want to come up with something that looks like and flies like and has the combat capabilities of the good old F-16. Only problem is if you use the F-35 project as a benchmark it will be two decades before the ""minus"" jet is operational. Until then guys have fun watching your F-35's gather dust on the tarmac while you continue to fly your F-16's which will be older than the average pilot's grandfather by the time the new plane is ready."

LOW,Lowe's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxL2ZlYi8yOC9ib3R0bGVkLXdhdGVyLXJ1bnMtb3V0LWZhc3QtYXQtZ2l2ZWF3YXktZXZlbnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bottled water runs out fast at giveaway events,"In response to a cry for help from Pine Bluff residents who have faced water problems after the winter storm several bottled-water giveaways happened over the weekend.

Lowe's hosted a giveaway of 800 cases of water Friday and Saturday.

The need for bottled water was apparent as Lowe's supply was exhausted by noon each day according to Conswellyn Chambers a Lowe's district manager based in Jacksonville.

[Video not showing up above? Click here to watch » https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnIwq9POcY0]

""Yesterday 810 cases were given away and 810 were given on Saturday also"" she said. ""Cars were lining up at 6 a.m. this morning.""

Lines stretched several blocks and Chambers said she was grateful that Sheriff Lafayette Woods Jr. and his team were there to direct traffic.

""I thank Sheriff Woods for the partnership and his staff ensuring that this event was done safely with the volume of traffic that we had"" said Chambers.

Store manager Jose Rodriguez said hundreds of residents showed up more than he expected and that he and his employees were excited about the turnout.

""Our associates were so excited to be a part of this event and giving back to the community because a lot of our associates are from this community"" he said.

Store officials said those receiving the water were appreciative especially because water is a hard-to-find commodity in stores these days.

""Here at Lowe's it is all about our community"" said Chambers. ""We are a part of our community so it is very exciting and rewarding when we get involved with the community actually hands-on and giving back. Our associates love our give-back community projects and were very excited to participate.""

On Friday and Saturday Liberty Utilities also distributed a semitrailer full of bottled water in Pine Bluff. According to a release from Liberty the supply ran out Saturday and a second trailer was on the way.

Another water distribution is scheduled for 7 a.m. to noon today at 1100 S. State St. while supplies last.

The city also will host a water giveaway.

On Monday at 4 p.m. at the Convention Center residents will receive one case of water by driving through the designated area. The bottled water will be provided by Aramark.

On Friday the former Oilers defenceman coach and general manager and current Oilers Entertainment Group (OEG) Vice Chair was announced as one of three Distinguished Honourees of the Order of Hockey in Canada for 2021.

Proud to present Bill Hay @AngelaJames8 and Kevin Lowe as this year's Distinguished Honourees of the Order of Hockey in Canada. The inductees will be honoured at the annual Hockey Canada Foundation Gala & Golf. — Hockey Canada (@HockeyCanada) February 26 2021

The Order is a Hockey Canada initiative that celebrates individuals for their outstanding contributions or service to the growth and development of the sport of hockey in Canada.

Former Hockey Canada president Bill Hay and Angela James a four-time IIHF World Women’s Championship gold medalist with the Canadian national women’s team round out this year’s class.

Headed to the Hall

The distinction from Hockey Canada comes only months after Lowe’s inclusion in the 2020 Hockey Hall of Fame class along with Jarome Iginla Marian Hossa Kim St-Pierre Doug Wilson and current Oilers’ GM Ken Holland announced last June. Last year’s Hall of Fame ceremony was canceled because of the pandemic and the class of 2020 will now be enshrined this coming November in place of a 2021 class.

Related: Looking Back At Kevin Lowe’s Hall of Fame Career

While Lowe is being inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the player category the Order of Hockey in Canada highlights his international accomplishments the greatest which have come off the ice.

Lowe was part of the management group for the Canadian men’s hockey team at four Olympic Winter Games including the gold medalists in 2002 2010 and 2014. Lowe also served as the assistant executive director for the Canadian team that won the World Cup of Hockey in 2004 and he was Canada’s GM at the 2012 IIHF World Championship.

As a player representing Canada Lowe captured a bronze medal at the 1982 IIHF World Championship and won the Canada Cup in 1984.

Lowe played in the National Hockey League from 1979 to 1998 recording 84 goals and 347 assists in 1254 career games. He was a member of all five Oilers’ Stanley Cup-winning teams (1984 1985 1987 1988 1990) and added a sixth ring as a member of the 1994 Stanley Cup champion New York Rangers.

The Lachute Que. native appeared in six All-Star Games (1984 1985 1986 1988 1989 1990 1993) and in 1990 he won the King Clancy Memorial Trophy for leadership and humanitarian contribution.

An essential thread in the fabric of Oilers history Lowe was Edmonton’s first-ever NHL draft pick (21st overall in 1979) scored the team’s first NHL regular-season goal and is the all-time franchise leader in games played both for the regular season (1037) and playoffs (172). He served as Oilers captain in 1991-92.

Following his retirement in 1998 Lowe joined the Oilers’ coaching staff as an assistant for the 1998-99 season and was promoted to head coach for 1999-00 before moving upstairs to become general manager. He held that post from 2000 to 2008 a tenure that included Edmonton’s run to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final in 2006.

Time to Raise No. 4 to the Rafters?

On the heels of Lowe’s Hall of Fame election this latest honour will only further intensify the long-running debate about whether the Oilers should retire his No. 4. Since Al Hamilton had his No. 3 retired in 1980 the honour has been reserved exclusively for Hall-of-Famers a club Lowe is now part of.

Lowe joins Wayne Gretzky Mark Messier and Ryan Smyth as former Oilers players to enter the Order of Hockey in Canada which was founded in 2012 and now includes 33 members. Other members of the Order with Oilers connections include OEG CEO Bob Nicholson and the late Pat Quinn who coached Edmonton for the 2009-10 season.

The 2021 Distinguished Honourees will be recognized in June at the annual Hockey Canada Foundation Gala & Golf alongside the Class of 2020 who had their event canceled last year because of the pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cGxvcmVqZWZmZXJzb25wYS5jb20vZ2FudC1kdWJvaXMtbWFuLXRha2VuLWludG8tY3VzdG9keS1mb2xsb3dpbmctaGlnaC1zcGVlZC1wdXJzdWl0L9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cGxvcmVqZWZmZXJzb25wYS5jb20vZ2FudC1kdWJvaXMtbWFuLXRha2VuLWludG8tY3VzdG9keS1mb2xsb3dpbmctaGlnaC1zcGVlZC1wdXJzdWl0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GANT: Local Man Taken into Custody Following High-speed Pursuit,"DUBOIS Pa. – Michael D. Myers of DuBois is facing charges following a high-speed pursuit with DuBois-based state police that ended in a crash Friday morning.

At 11:33 a.m. Trooper Seth Gould observed a gold-colored GMC Envoy pulling a U-Haul trailer in the area of mile-marker 102 west on Interstate 80.

It was reportedly traveling towards DuBois at 78 miles per hour in a posted 70-mph zone. The trooper observed other equipment violations as well.

Gould pulled out from the crossover in attempt to initiate a traffic stop. However the driver later identified as Myers fled at a high rate off exit 101.

He proceeded through a steady red signal at the end of the exit ramp turning right onto state Route 255 and continuing south towards DuBois.

Gould activated his lights and siren as the vehicle swerved through north- and south-bound traffic. It continued to flee on Midway Drive through the Lowe’s parking lot and back to SR 255.

When the driver turned right the vehicle hit the curb and lost the trailer. The pursuit continued however. The vehicle swerved through traffic until reaching the Industrial Drive intersection.

There state police say it entered the northbound lane striking a minivan occupied by two adults and three children.

The driver lost control of his vehicle which slid backwards up over the curb. He was taken into custody and identified as Myers.

No injuries were reported."

This title is not synonymous with a chief sales officer chief customer service officer or even a chief marketing officer.

The latest position to join the C-Suite is an individual who is solely responsible for owning a brand or family of brands thus the title of Chief Brand Officer.

According to Wikipedia a Chief Brand Officer or CBO “is a relatively new executive-level position at a corporation company organization or agency which typically reports to the CEO or Board of Directors and is responsible for a brand’s image experience and promise. The brand officer oversees marketing advertising design public relations and customer service. Organizations that have established a CBO position include the American Automobile Association Baskin-Robbins Boston Market Citigroup McDonald’s Mattel Lululemon Athletica – to name just a few.”

No matter who owns the brand or brands in your organization there are three key responsibilities for the individual in this role.

This means that all your digital assets including your main website your blog and all your social media accounts reflect the same look and feel; and make sure all your printed collateral also reflects the same look and feel (brochures newsletters flyers annual reports etc.). Make sure they all provide the same description about your company and brand feature the same logo and/or tagline and include the same color palette. For example you would not trust a site with a purple Coca-Cola logo – those iconic red and white colors are as famous as the product they represent.

Second make sure your brand has a clear and defined voice.

If you provide professional services for example legal or financial services you may use formal language that matches your industry. But if you sell consumer products your ads and emails may be full of informal lingo to connect with your audience. Depending on your industry there may be appropriate words that would be considered essential to include in your brand messaging. For example professional sports have terminology that is important in their branding – football ads can easily integrate “touchdowns” and “hail Mary’s” and baseball ads can easily integrate “home runs” and “shut outs.” And if your product is more appropriate for a specific age group keep appropriate words and phrases in mind.

Third create brand advocates.

As the owner of your brand you want to welcome employees into the branding process so that they understand their importance in sharing your brand story with the world. Since all employees are brand advocates take the time to educate employees about your brand’s strengths during the onboarding phase and also re-train on a regular basis. Make the training fun and always have a smile on all leaders’ faces.

According to Ideon Agency “Brands are more decentralized than ever. The brand ecosystem is more complex. A Chief Brand Officer can elevate consumer insights from leading the living brand presence to driving the business forward. The true role of the CBO is not to dictate a brand to consumers rather it is to create the values that earn brands real lasting reputations. A great CBO above all else creates a unified culture that ensures that all of an organization’s wide-ranging efforts are inspired by consumers’ real feedback and aligned with the core brand story design and beliefs. Your CMO can broadcast your message but building a tribe around your brand requires a CBO. Take a page from most Fortune 100 companies: Hire a CBO now.”

So have you updated your thinking? Will you now consider adding a CBO to your C-Suite? And if you serve as the Chief Brand Officer for your organization what do you do on a daily basis to protect your brand promote it and create brand awareness? Please chime in.

The night before his team had lost by seven points at home to a middling Charlotte Hornets squad and the Bucks’ new coach Jason Kidd was angry. Milwaukee who were hovering around .500 were slated to have the holiday off to spend with family but Kidd changed those plans and decided his roster should practice – as punishment. The players had to cancel flights and alert their family of the change – something of course they did not want to do. During the Christmas Eve practice Sanders went full-on. He didn’t lollygag but peeved he also didn’t back away from engaging his coach in confrontation. Afterwards while he was the last one left in the locker room his body started to break down.

“I was cramping from my ears to my toes” Sanders tells the Guardian. “Full body cramps.”

It was the second time that this stress reaction had happened to him during his young career and it forced Sanders to quickly seek medical treatment. Sanders was hospitalized that Christmas Eve and Christmas. He never returned to the Bucks practice facility again despite having signed a four-year $44m contract extension the year before. “I physically and mentally could not get myself back there” he says. “Nothing could get me in the car to go there. I had such a block.” The 6ft 11in center who’d averaged nearly a double-double and almost three blocks per game a few seasons before was now the one stifled. “I didn’t touch a basketball for the next two years. Not a shot not a dribble.”

Sanders was born on 21 November 1988 in Fort Pierce Florida and grew up “in the trenches”. There were gangs seemingly on every street in his neighborhood. His parents split when he was a kid and both suffered from untreated mental health issues. “They had all this trauma” Sanders says “all this pain. They were predisposed to a lot of violence [while] not understanding the power of therapy the power of meditation.”

As a kid Sanders loved to draw. It was his “getaway.” He wanted to illustrate comics and work for Disney. He had a deep interest in the ocean too won a grant to study oceanography and got to ride in submarines. He was tall but didn’t have any particular interest in basketball. But it was a basketball that would save him.

“Because I lived in the projects” Sanders says “automatically where you live there are places you can’t go [due to gang conflicts].” He found that if he rode his bike from his home to his grandmother’s or cousin’s house while carrying a basketball he was left alone. Gangs even brutal ones tend to respect the kids who can use the game to get out of the neighborhood.

“I had a ball everywhere I went” he says. “It was my pass. Like ‘Oh he’s going to play basketball he’s just going to the court. If I didn’t have that ball I would’ve constantly been getting checked. I would probably have had to attach myself to a gang to protect myself. But I didn’t even play.”

It wasn’t until high school that he began to really take to the game. He was already 6ft 6in by the time he was in the 10th grade but he was raw: In his first game he scored on his own basket. But he started watching the pros more. His idol was Tracy McGrady who played for the nearby Orlando Magic. Sanders wore arm bands like him modeled his game after McGrady’s. He soon managed double-digit blocks. Later during his 11th and 12th grades his team was dominant in the region. And as a senior he started playing AAU traveling as far as Las Vegas for games. It was the people he met then that he bonded and later enrolled with at VCU.

Sanders’ college team was a force. During his three years there his squad won 75 games and only lost 27. After his junior year he decided to turn pro and he was selected by Milwaukee with the 15th overall pick. Had he stayed in college he would have played for the VCU team that made the Final Four under coach Shaka Smart. Still he was excited for the NBA. “You shoot a million jump shots and you want to get paid” he says. But in the end the NBA wasn’t what he’d hoped it would be. “It was a blessing but it was also a lot” he says. “I come from nothing and then you become the one that has everything. People who are supposed to guide you become your dependents. And you’re too young for that.”

Sanders lacked a support system in the league and his personal life. “You get fed to the sharks in a lot of ways” he says. “You can find yourself in a very vulnerable position … It can feel like a setup it can feel like a trap. I felt so alone. It was so hard to even express what I was going through. At the time in 2012 no one said they had anxiety or depression – maybe Delonte West but everyone was outcasting him.”

During his second year in the NBA Sanders smoked a joint for the first time passed to him by teammates. The drug helped like medicine. But league drug testing led to suspensions rehabs and ostracization. (Today the NBA doesn’t test for weed.)

“Do I gravitate to some pills and other drugs or do I do alcohol?” he wondered then about substances that wouldn’t be detected. Not only that but his need to be creative was no longer thriving. He felt stymied. “I was yearning for support yearning to be heard. But there was nothing in the manuscript for what I was going through at that time.” Sanders became one of the first players to talk about mental health – though now thanks to others such as DeMar DeRozan and Kevin Love it’s a much more accepted topic. However when you’re the first to do something you’re often judged harshly for it. “There was no way I was the first one [to have mental health issues]” he says. “But I was the first one to speak up.”

Today Sanders is glad he did. Not just vocally but by publicly stepping away from the game. That choice led to conversations people are having now. “I have three sons that could be in the NBA one day” he says. “To have their mental health be respected – sometimes you got to be the one to step out on a cliff. But it’s worth it.” It wasn’t that he didn’t love the game it was that he didn’t have what he needed while participating in it. “My body and my mind are elite” he says. “But my surroundings and my environment just wasn’t.”

When he decided to walk he had two kids and he knew that if he wasn’t in the right state of mind he couldn’t ensure they would be either. Later he went to another rehab facility. This time it wasn’t one selected by the NBA for marijuana – though even in those he made close relationships with patients who were there for additions to heroin and other narcotics. This one was designed around therapy and emotional wellbeing. That was the last facility he’s been to since.

After two years away from the NBA Sanders sought a comeback. He worked out for a few teams and landed a contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016-17 alongside LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. But he still had a rehab stint he’d have to undertake for the league if he was to stay on and the team at the time had its own internal turmoil he says. He lasted only a handful of games before he was waived. Leaving the NBA for good despite still being in his prime in his 20s brought a great deal of criticism. But Sanders doesn’t stress about those comments. His philosophy is that if someone isn’t going to be there at your funeral why care about what they say? “One minute you’re larger than life” he says. “And the next [in their eyes] you’re lower than dirt.”

Still at his peak Sanders who is a member of and continues to work with the NBA Retired Players Association was regarded my many as one of the best defensive players in the league. He was stopping his heroes in the paint players he’d idolized. “I was their nightmare” he says. “I was like ‘I can really play this game. This game is really meant for me!’”

It took a lot to walk away from that. But today though things aren’t always “perfect” Sanders maintains gratitude. He also retains his love of creativity: he has a production company and a publishing company. He’s writing a memoir kids’ books a movie script he runs camps produces music has a foundation and a cannabis line and he even spends summers playing in the Big3. Sanders also keeps relationships with players who deal with their own mental health issues.

“Why I go so hard” Sanders says “is because this has to be a success story. I got to show kids that I made the right choice. That there is a way – more for us to do. That we can be successful without succumbing. All the power’s in the present.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy9jam1rZ253ZW0xcm_SATJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvY2pta2dud2VtMXJvLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Irish police make €3.6m drugs seizure in two operations,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9jcnlwdG8tc2NhbS03MW0td2FsbGV0LWltcGVyc29uYXRpb24tZnVuZC1sYXVuZGVyaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WBTC thief spreads $71M loot across multiple crypto wallets,"Stolen crypto funds linked to a recent $71 million wallet impersonation scam are on the move after six days of silence.

On May 3 an investor sent $71 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) to a bait wallet address falling victim to a wallet poisoning scam. The scammer created a wallet address with similar alphanumeric characters and made a small transaction to the victim’s account.

Like most investors the victim validated the wallet address by matching the first and last few characters and transferred 97% of their total assets to it. However the difference would have been noticeable in the middle characters often hidden on platforms to improve visual appeal.

Hackers often convert stolen crypto to Ether (ETH) which makes it easier to siphon via privacy protocols such as Tornado Cash — and this hacker was no different. The 1155 WBTC was immediately converted to roughly 23000 ETH and sat dormant in the scammer’s wallet for six days.

On May 8 blockchain investigation firm PeckShield noticed some of the stolen funds being laundered. The scammer started breaking down the loot into multiple parts and began sending it to multiple crypto wallets in parts.

The scammer used roughly 400 crypto wallets to dilute the stolen funds and reduce traceability. Eventually the funds in question ended up in over 150 wallets. However all the stolen funds can still be traced back to the unknown scammer at the time of writing.

A new type of scam allows bad actors to drain users’ wallets without transaction approval.

The scam only works on tokens that comply with the ERC-2612 token standard which allows for “gas-less” transfers or transfers by a wallet that does not hold ETH.

However to enable approval-less transactions the user must be tricked into signing a message. Cointelegraph’s investigation found that the scam was orchestrated by a Telegram group that featured a fake version of the Collab.Land Telegram verification system.

After the dull opening of Universal’s Fall Guy Jesus God Saint Mary and Joseph let’s hope those projections stay steady. Apes plans to pull in the under 35 guy demo in a way that Fall Guy did not. Presales stateside of around $3.1M in line with what was the 3-day of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning ($54.6M) indicate a $50M-plus debut. That start in U.S./Canada isn’t far from the $56.2M opening of Matt Reeves’ 2017 movie War of the Planet of the Apes and that would be considered solid. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ has the advantage that it’s opening at a time with less competition than War of the Planet of the Apes. This sequel which takes 300 years after the events of War of the Planet of the Apes is directed by Maze Runner filmmaker Wes Ball. No Rotten Tomatoes reviews yet.

The last three Planet of the Apes movies at 20th Century Fox the latter two directed by Reeves all received A- CinemaScore’s. The Tim Burton directed Mark Wahlberg starring 2001 version landed a B- grade.

The $165M production is booked at 3700-plus theaters boosted by a two-week Imax run and PLFs. The PG-13 movie has advance screenings in Imax and PLFs Wednesday at 7PM and on Thursday starting 3PM.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is rolling out in 100% of its offshore footprint this week beginning Wednesday in France Italy Germany and Korea. Majors joining on Thursday include the UK Brazil Australia and Mexico. China Spain and Japan follow on Friday.

Current projections for the frame are at $80M+ internationally. Broken out that’s $70M from overseas excluding China. That market is increasingly hard to call and is also coming out of a very prosperous five-day May Day holiday stretch which saw three local films excel. What happens with Kingdom will depend on how those hold up — note also that Saturday is a working day. China at this point should be $10M+.

Looking at comps and at today’s exchange rates 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes bowed to $62M internationally ($8M was from China). In 2014 Dawn of the Planet of the Apes did $127M ($37M in China) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes came in at a $130M launch ($56M from China).

The other advantage to those movies were that they had 3D whereas the Ball version does not.

Overall the latest rendition of the franchise tends to perform best in a mix of the mature European majors Mexico Brazil Australia and Korea. While we do expect Kingdom to land several No. 1 openings it is likely in some cases to be topped by the continued play of a strong local title (think Korea for example).

Overseas promotion included a launch event at the BFI IMAX in London on April 25 with Ball Freya Allan Owen Teague and Kevin Durand in attendance. Andy Serkis who memorably played Caesar in the first three films of the recent franchise was also out lending his support to this one.

The recent trilogy of Planet of the Apes movies from 2011-2017 grossed $1.68 billion at the global box office. The first movie based on Pierre Boulle’s novel launched in 1968 and grossed over $32M stateside unadjusted for inflation. Several sequels were spawned in the 1970s. Burton’s reboot only made $362M-plus at the global box office and did not trigger any sequels. All in The Planet of the Apes franchise has minted over $2.1 billion worldwide.

Briarcliff Entertainment has Not Another Church Movie in 1100 theaters this weekend stateside. Pic stars Jamie Foxx as God Mickey Rourke as the devil and Kevin Daniels. Written and directed by Johnny Mack the comedy satire bills itself as “This is not a Tyler Perry Movie.” Expect single digits for the film."

Ted Cruz lost his Marriott Hotel points after traveling to Cancun during Texas storm

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz faced intense backlash following his family trip to Cancun while residents in his state battled a deadly winter storm which was further intensified by the loss of access to power and water for millions.

Following the barrage of criticism on social media — and calls for resignation from the Texas Democratic Party — the Republican senator quickly returned to Texas while his wife and children stayed in Mexico.

As Cruz navigated the public consequences of taking his trip to Cancun an article published on Patheos claims he also lost his Marriott hotel points as a punishment for his trip.

Fact check:ERCOT not Texas Gov. Greg Abbott requested bypass of environmental limits

The article written by Andrew Hall claimed that hotel company Marriott revoked all of Cruz's award points following his decision to leave Texas while the state's residents suffered during the winter storm.

""Marriott International Inc. announced last night that it has revoked the thousands of Marriott Award Points Texas Senator Ted Cruz accrued over the years"" the article reads. ""The drastic move by the company that has over 30 brands 7484 properties and over 1.4 million rooms is due to Senator Cruz jetting off to Mexico while millions of Texans are suffering from the effects of the recent winter storm.""

Article is satirical

While the article is written convincingly it is not a factual report of any events. The article is satirical which Hall writes about in a separate post.

""Under normal circumstances my humble blog is similar to The Onion. As many of you know The Onion publishes satirical stories poking fun at everyday problems everyday people face as well as pointing out the hypocrisy of the rich and powerful"" he said.

While Cruz certainly faced backlash for his decision one of the consequences was not the loss of his Marriott points.

Our ruling: Satire

The claim in the post has been rated as SATIRE. The Patheos article is a satirical piece — which the author confirms in another post — and is not a report of factual events.

While these brands (alongside a few others) are excluded from the Complimentary Enhanced Room Upgrade benefits they don’t participate in the Suite Upgrade Awards system which you can select as Elite Choice either so one should be careful before exercising this option.

Some properties do upgrade Elite members regardless of their exclusion from this policy of the Marriott Bonvoy program and I’ve come across a few great select service hotels over the years such as the Aloft properties in Seoul (Myeongdong) and the Aloft as well as Element in Kuala Lumpur. All of these were very generous with their upgrades.

ADVERTISEMENT

Ritz Carlton properties are likewise exempt from the upgrade rule for Platinum members but at least Titanium members can officially request upgrades at Ritz Carlton hotels.

The problem starts when you want to stay at a particular Aloft/Element (such as the Element in Ubud Bali) and really like a suite upgrade. There is no basis to pressure the hotel for a complimentary upgrade even if their suites are available due to the exemption. The only option is to ask for an upsell to one of their suites.

You can read up on the official T&C on Marriott’s website:

4.3.c. Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Elite Membership Benefits. In addition to all of the benefits Gold Elite Members receive Platinum Elite Members and above are eligible to receive the following benefits: i. Complimentary Enhanced Room Upgrade for Platinum Elite Members. Platinum Elite Members and above receive a complimentary upgrade to the best available room subject to availability for the entire length of stay at the time of check-in. Complimentary upgrade includes suites rooms with desirable views rooms on high floors corner rooms rooms with special amenities or rooms on Executive Floors. At The Ritz-Carlton suites are only included for Titanium Elite and Ambassador Elite Members and rooms with direct Club access are excluded. Enhanced Room Upgrades are subject to availability and are identified by each Participating Property. The Complimentary Enhanced Room Upgrade for Platinum Elite Members and above is available at all Participating Brands except at Marriott Vacation Club Marriott Grand Residence Club Aloft Element and Vistana properties.

Sometimes you come across a Four Points property that makes you want to believe they are exempt from the suite upgrade policy as well – this is not correct and if the hotel doesn’t budge after showing them the T&C I suggest to call Marriott customer care and have them inform the hotel directly.

For qualified Platinum / Titanium Members: You can select you Elite Choice at 50/75 nights and pick the Suite Night Awards.

Unfortunately there are several pitfalls to these awards:

Suite Night Awards can be used on Marriott-Bonvoy-eligible reservations including paid stays as well as Free Night Award stays and Cash & Points stays. Advance Purchase rates are not eligible for Suite Night Awards

Not all hotels participate in Suite Night Awards. Suite Night Awards are not redeemable at the following brands: The Ritz-Carlton The Ritz-Carlton Reserve The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club EDITION Protea Hotels Aloft Element Design Hotels™ all-Suite Hotels Marriott Executive Apartments ExecuStay Marriott Vacation Club Marriott Grand Residence Club properties and Vistana properties. In addition Suite Night Awards are not redeemable at select Participating Properties. Contact Member Support for individual participating property Suite Night Award participation.

The number of excluded brands is truly ridiculous but then remember that Marriott now has a gazillion brands after the Starwood merger. Aloft I can understand these hotels often have like 2-3 suites in the whole hotel but I don’t get the inclusion of Element in this list. Most Element properties do have sufficient inventory to comply with the official Marriott upgrade policy and most definitely with the Suite Night Awards (which might or might not be confirmed by the hotel in advance).

Likewise having Ritz Carlton excluded for Platinum members doesn’t make any sense to me either. I don’t have the slightest idea why Marriott still holds Ritz Carlton in such high regard. Almost all of the RC I’ve ever visited were inferior to the average St. Regis where full benefits apply.

Conclusion

Upgrading at Marriott can sometimes be a minefield. They don’t want to upgrade you in the lower select service tier but then they don’t want to upgrade you in their top tier (Ritz Carlton) either.

Again I had good success being upgraded at a range of hotels especially those where I’m a very frequent guest. As I mentioned previously hotels always tend to to treat their repeat customers better than a one off customer.

The Suite Night Awards might be a viable option if you have no reason to pick another item of the Elite Choice selection at your 50 night level (such as the extra 5 elite qualifying nights). At the 75 level I suggest to better take the free night certificate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlc2luZGlhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3NwZWNpYWwtcmVwb3J0L3F1b3RsdXh1cnktdHJhdmVsLWluLTIwMjEtaXMtZ29pbmctdG8tYmUtZG9tZXN0aWMtdHJhdmVscXVvdC82NjY5OS8x0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"""Luxury Travel In 2021 Is Going To Be Domestic Travel""","Image: Courtesy Marriott

The hospitality sector one of the hardest hit last year has entered a phase of recovery. More and more people are now getting out for short vacations or workations at a location within India given that International travel is still risky and the options are limited. In such a scenario luxury hotels even at places that mostly got traffic over the weekend are now fully occupied throughout the week.

Neeraj Govil senior vice president operations- APEC Marriott International tells Forbes India about the luxury hospitality trends driving the recovery of luxury hospitality in India.

Sustainability has always been an integral part of Marriott’s philosophy. Our operating structures are designed to be environmentally conscious. However in the pandemic there is an increased awareness about sustainability in the hospitality stay aspect as well.

We are localising our supply chains across the board to ensure that food is not travelling too much. We are also looking at saving water and buying energy from the right sources. Imminently we have launched residential amenities in the rooms which help us reduce the use of single-use plastic and eventually eliminate it. Having said that sustainability is a mindset. It is necessary to get all our partners to understand that we need to be conscious about the environment. Once that is done the operations become easier.

Marketing in the pandemic has really been about enhanced engagement more connectivity and transparency.

We are focused on destination marketing. In the past we have been aggressively promoting India as a destination at various global forums. Now it is about promoting a particular destination in India. For instance Goa. We have been talking about it not just in the biggest source markets such as Mumbai Delhi and Bengaluru but also promoting it in say Hyderabad Kolkata and Raipur. We are also marketing our hotels particularly those in the metros in Tier-1 Tier-II and Tier-III cities which has gotten a good response so far.

Moreover being flexible in reservation cancellation check-in and check-out policies is also helping us.

Our goal is to ensure that we get our business back speed up the recovery process and grow the footprint of our Bonvoy programme which currently has a million members in India.

We are potentially looking at opening Ritz-Carlton Mumbai JW Marriott in Bengaluru and Westin in Goa and nine other hotels in India.

The hospitality industry was hit the hardest in the lockdown. It sometimes can be taking two steps ahead and one step back. We however saw pretty good growth in the last quarter. Data shows that pandemic is largely under control customers are gaining the confidence to travel again there is pent-up demand and the macro economy is reviving as well. The second half of the year will see a sharper recovery as compared to the first half and we should reach the 2019 level of business in the second half of 2022.

There is a real pivot to domestic travel. Luxury travel in 2021 is going to be domestic travel. The ability of the affluent to travel abroad to see the world is now restricted. Luxury travelers are looking for new destinations within the country and embracing short micro vacations as the Work from Home trend has enabled people to work from anywhere.JW Marriott Mussoorie Walnut Grove Resort & SpaImage: Courtesy Marriott We have seen hotels in locations that earlier got weekend or group business now receive many many guests during the week. Our hotels in Goa Mussoorie and Mahableshwar are doing very well post the lockdown. Staycation in cities is also a popular trend. People living in metros are checking in to enjoy the facilities of a luxury hotel.Instead of two to three international trips a year people are now opting for five to six domestic vacations.Until October people were not venturing out too much and were feeling boxed in but since November we have seen many more people wanting to get out and indulge in a small vacation. On Republic Day weekend we saw a lot of that play out.This has become crucial today as it is playing out in every aspect of a luxury customer’s hotel stay experience. Right from the time of the booking to the pre-arrival experience and check-in everything has become contactless. At Marriott we have the mobile key which lets you access the room via the code on your phone. Essentially your phone is the key to your room. We are also processing guest requests through online chat. People can order food and different services to their rooms through this service. Digital marketing has also become very important as more and more people are spending a lot of time on screens as compared to on traditional media.Along with top-notch safety and hygiene standards in a luxury hotel people are also seeking authentic experiences that are tailor-made for them. To that end a hotel’s interaction with the guests has increased quite a bit. Guests want to ensure that their personal needs and requests are met which in turn has become an important aspect of luxury service. For instance they now have a choice to be welcomed at a hotel when checking in or go straight to their rooms. Whatever they want we are giving it to them."

What makes them associate this aspect of business with manipulation cheating and lack of ethics? To what extent are marketing professionals responsible for this perception? How can consumers be persuaded to change their opinion about marketing?

If these questions interest you get hold of Raja Rajamannar’s Quantum Marketing: Mastering the New Marketing Mindset for Tomorrow’s Consumers (2021) published by Harper Collins Leadership.

What does “quantum marketing” mean? “It is a time when mistakes are exponentially magnified and success is as fleeting as the consumer attention span. In general scientific terms ‘quantum’ describes an effect that cannot be explained by classical approaches. It has also come to mean an unmeasurable jump in speed or volume” the author writes.

When these aspects are applied to marketing it can be called “quantum marketing”. It encompasses the use of data analytics artificial intelligence blockchain 5G augmented reality virtual reality 3-D printing the Internet of Things drones and more.

The author is the global Chief Marketing and Communications Officer of Mastercard and is also the president of the company’s healthcare business.

Before taking up this role he worked with Anthem Citibank Diners Club North America Unilever and Asian Paints. He is also a member of the board of directors of PPL Corporation a US Fortune 500 company and Bon Secours Mercy Health a not-for-profit hospital system in the US and Ireland. The insights that form the core of his book come from this wide-ranging professional experience.

‘Brand Karma’

Stating that only 34 percent of consumers trust the brands they buy the author admonishes the “marketing community itself” for making false claims about products and deceiving customers through attractive packaging.

Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad

There is an urgent need for soul-searching. He writes “Where do we draw the line between being a smart business practitioner and being a con artist? Shouldn’t integrity and ethics be at the core of our practice? Can’t we be successful without employing exploitative deceptive or misleading tactics?”



These pointed questions can be useful for marketing professionals who feel that the pursuit of commercial success makes them do things they are not proud of. The means are as important as the ends but it can be easy to forget this basic principle when short-term gains become more important than accountability and reputation.

This book intends to remind readers that customers are not fools—they can tell when they are being duped. They will switch to other brands if they are taken for granted or disrespected by marketers.

The author uses the term “brand karma” to emphasise the point that ethical practice is a sound investment. The advice he offers is particularly relevant for marketing departments facing a crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“A crisis is not a time to sell. A crisis is the time to serve…If a brand sticks with people and serves them during their tough and troubled times when the tide turns and the good times come back they will stick with this brand. Crisis is not the time to be opportunistic. Crisis is when trust gets built or broken” he writes.

The examples that back these pearls of wisdom come from his life and would be familiar to many who have faced similar situations.

When the author was working from home during the lockdown he wanted to buy a stand for his tablet. The price of the product was $61 but the shipping price was $211. Before the pandemic it was being shipped free. It is possible to argue that there is nothing wrong in making a profit when customers can be pushed into paying more. The downside is that they will remember how they were treated.

Marketing and data privacy

Ethical behaviour must extend to data collection and data analytics as well. Smartphones digital assistants fitness trackers and connected cars capture “unprecedented levels of data” that can be used to gain insights and design effective campaigns. But what does it mean for privacy? Marketers may find it beneficial to stick to this ground rule. “A brand has no right to snoop and without consumers’ explicit permission to sell. I am a big proponent of simplification of the privacy laws… but nothing is better than self-regulation and having an ethical North Star” says the author.



The book provides a detailed picture of what a Quantum CMO needs to prioritise nurture and grow. In addition to marketing expertise managerial capabilities and business acumen what is also required is the willingness to learn.

The author for instance sets aside six hours a week to catch up with industry news. He also recommends taking mentoring sessions from subject experts. Staying up to speed with new developments is essential to be relevant in a fast-changing world because changes have implications for business.

Another recommendation which seems quite valuable is the one about having a global mindset. What does this mean in practical terms? Quantum CEOs can learn a lot from stints in countries other than their own. The experience gathered can help them understand “how cultures can manifest with different nuances how workforce mindsets are so vastly different from culture to culture how legal and regulatory environments vary”.

These inputs are precious because marketing as this book suggests is both an art and a science. If that sounds too cryptic read the book to unlock the mystery.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmFpdHN0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvaW52ZXN0L21lLW15LWNhcmVlci10aGlzLXBsdW1iZXItb2YtdGhlLWZpbmFuY2lhbC13b3JsZC1lbnN1cmVzLXRoYXQtbW9uZXktZmxvd3Mtc21vb3RobHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Me & My Career: This 'plumber' of the financial world ensures that money flows smoothly,"SINGAPORE - Using financial technology or fintech to disrupt traditional models may seem ""cool"" but Mastercard executive Joseph Tom believes it is as much about solving seemingly mundane problems.

Fintech he notes has begun to improve access to remittance services for migrant workers who otherwise could spend up to 10 per cent of their savings on transfer fees and poor exchange rates.

""It might not look all glamorous compared to global investing cryptocurrencies and roboadvisory but a lot of the value of fintech lies in solving these unsexy problems in traditional banking such as financial inclusion and access to credit"" says Mr Tom a director for business development at Mastercard.

""A senior executive told me fintech professionals often consider themselves the plumbers of the financial world fixing the pipes and infrastructure that lead to more efficient flow of payments investments remittances and so on.""

Mr Tom who has spent 11 years in banking fintech start-ups and venture capital investing hit a roadblock en route to his current ""dream job"" after being retrenched last April amid the pandemic.

The MBA-holder faced multiple disappointments in his job search often reaching the last stage of interviews just to be ""ghosted"" by firms that stopped responding.

Mr Tom 34 eventually approached Workforce Singapore. A coach at one of the statutory board's career matching providers Ingeus sent him job opportunities and helped him prepare for interviews and salary negotiation.

The free programme also included use of a shared working space at the Lifelong Learning Institute a professional headshot and business cards.

He secured his current role within a month at a higher pay than his previous job and started work last December.

""I am keen to pay this forward in whatever way possible such as volunteering to mentor young job seekers and hiring talent through this programme in future"" he says.

Ashwin unhappy with the rigid definition of 'good pitch' in cricket

by Cricbuzz Staff • Published on

The third Test finished inside two days in Ahmedabad © BCCI

Ravichandran Ashwin the Indian off-spinner has hit out at critics for crediting the pitch at Motera for India's victory in the third Test of the series against England. The pink-ball encounter was wrapped up in less than six sessions making it the shortest Test since the second World War. 30 wickets fell across two days with Indian spinners - Axar Patel R Ashwin and Washington Sundar - bagging 19 of them in less than 69 overs. The victory not only helped India take a 2-1 lead in the series which kept their hopes alive for a berth in the World Test Championship final but dashed that of the visitors.

England registered scores of 112 and 81 across the two innings. Even as the hosts were bundled out for 145 in their first essay which included a fifer for Joe Root leading to questions over the quality of the pitch for a five-day encounter. Even as Virat Kohli the Indian captain had said that irrespective of the conditions being conducive for the bowlers the batsmen didn't apply themselves well enough as majority of the wickets fell to deliveries that went straight instead of turning.

However Ashwin pointed out the other instances for India's pink-ball matches - against Bangladesh in Kolkata and against Australia in Adelaide - and said that on each occasion the games have ended in less than half the time allotted to the contest.

""There have been some people who have messaged me and said the match has finished in two days"" Ashwin said in a press conference on Saturday (February 27). ""What about all the three pink-ball Test matches we've played everything's ended within three days' time. I do not know what to say because when somebody just throws an opinion out there about the surface - and having had played the game - unfortunately maybe they've not played the pink-ball Test matches so they do not understand this facet of the game. My angst against the whole thing is the fact that when people say something there are so many of them who are watching the same picture but are not able to paint a different one compared to somebody who is driving and selling a certain case to us and this needs to stop.""

""The bowler wants to win the game. The batsman needs to bat well to get runs. No question about it. What makes a good surface? Who defines this? Seam on the first day and then bat well and then spin on the last two days? Come on! Who makes all these rules we need to get over it and not talk about whatever picture you want to paint. If you're asking if it is a good Test surface I don't see any of the players coming from England having an issue with the surface. They want to improve they look like they want to have a contest. Is it the players and the people who are reporting back that want their players to not complete and complain about the pitches? Because we have never done that on any of the tours. ""

""Why would you talk about the surface to us time and time again? Has there been any instance where the surface has been spoken about at any other place any other country we have played games in? I somehow find it very very funny that when they speak about the surface it immediately gets quoted all over in our press. And that is the issue here. Because there have been instances... we went to New Zealand and both Tests got within five days. A total of five days for two Test matches and nobody quoted it. There is a video that's doing the rounds where Virat in South Africa is saying that I'm not here to talk about the pitch. That is how we have been taught to play cricket and I don't know why we indulge in such thoughts promote such thoughts. That's why I say let them sell it buying is always our choice.""

This comes at the back of a series of tweets the offspinner made on Friday. He had stated ""Products are sold using various marketing strategies and that's an accepted practice! We now live in an era where ideas are also being sold to us and it's a classic example of ""outbound marketing"" however I would like to add that buying ideas being sold to us is like telling us ""you can't think on your own"" and here we will teach you how to think and also help you think the way we want you to think.

""After having played the game at this level for a decade I can safely say that ""As long as we are going to buy it they will shove it down our throat"".Finally. We can always have and stand by our opinions even if it's against the majority as long as we know that it is our own and not the one that's been sold to us! ""The choice is always ours"".""

Even as many confused it to be a dig at Yuvraj Singh for claiming that Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble would have taken 800-1000 wickets if they had played on such pitches and some even going to the extent of comparing it to his stand on the Farmers protest Ashwin clarified himself and said his words with regards to the credit being taken away from the team for their victory.

""Thoughts being put across and planted to people is really hilarious and I find it heinous to a point where you have a thought process and you want everyone to follow that and think that and condition it"" he said. ""With thoughts what happens is you condition people into believing in a certain way so you watch a match you watch India win the game and at most everyone's saying I'm happy India won. You don't want people to go back home and say 'India is not winning the game it's the pitch that's winning game'. That's not what I want people to do. Anyway I know that's going to come up these are conditioning that's happening and it has happened for a long time. It's important people sell things but we must know what we must buy.

""The reason behind my tweets were definitely not in context to anybody in particular. When I read Yuvi pa's tweet I actually didn't get affected at all because I didn't find that he was telling us anything trying to suggest anything. It just felt like a really plain tweet saying 'we were good and'. For me the state of mind I am in I didn't find it anything wrong or agenda-driven or anything like that. I know Yuvi pa for a long time and I have the utmost respect for him.""

Madhya Pradesh opener Venkatesh Iyer missed out on a well-deserved double ton as he was run out two runs shy of the mark in his team's big 105-run win over Punjab. Andhra Tamil Nadu Jharkhand and MP finished equal on 12 points from five matches but Andhra emerged on top thanks to higher net run-rate and secured a place in the knockout phase. Tamil Nadu Jharkhand MP (all 12 points) finished second third and fourth followed by Punjab (8 points) and Vidarbha (4).

Tamil Nadu defeated Vidarbha by five wickets chasing down the target of 151 in 11.2 overs to improve their net run-rate. However Andhra overhauled Jharkhand's score of 139 in just 9.5 overs to nose ahead on NRR.

Sent in to bat Jharkhand struggled with only four batsmen reaching double figures. Skipper Ishan Kishan made 38 (68 balls 3 fours) the highest score while medium-pacer M Harishankar Reddy was impressive with a four-wicket haul for Andhra.

Ashwin Hebbar (44) and Ricky Bhui (57) went on the attack from the start with the Jharkhand bowlers having no respite. The duo added 82 in 5.5 overs before Hebbar fell to Shahbaz Nadeem (1/26). Bhui continued with his aggressive ways and despite losing captain Hanuma Vihari (4) he saw the team home in the company of Naren Reddy (16 not out).

In another match off-spinner B Aparajith (3/10) and medium pacers J Kousik (3/22) and M Mohammed (3/33) starred as Tamil Nadu bundled out Vidarbha for 150 in 41 overs. A few of the Vidarbha batsmen got starts but could not quite go on to make a big score as the TN bowlers kept a tight leash.

In reply skipper Dinesh Karthik (19) opening the batting fell in the third over going for quick runs but N Jagadeesan smashed a 18-ball 48-run knock and helped Tamil Nadu post a win in 11.2 overs with Mohammed (37) weighing in with a quickfire knock.

Meanwhile Madhya Pradesh rode on a blistering innings of 198 by Venkatesh Iyer to post a massive score of 402 for 3 in 50 overs before restricting Punjab to 297 in 42.3 overs.

Mamelodi Sundowns proved too strong for 10-man CR Belouizdad as the Tshwane giants claimed a 5-1 win in their Caf Champions League Group B game on Sunday afternoon.

Themba Zwane (brace) Peter Shalulile Lebohang Maboe and Kermit Erasmus all scored for Masandawana while Amir Sayoud netted the White and Reds' consolation goal.

The White and Reds were undefeated in their last 16 matches across all competitions having started their Group B campaign with a 0-0 draw against DR Congolese giants TP Mazembe.

Gaya Merbah who kept a clean sheet against Mazembe in Lubumbashi DR Congo started in goal for coach Franck Dumas' side while former Al Ahly star Sayoud was deployed in midfield.

On the other hand Masandawana were enjoying a 20-match unbeaten run across all competitions having won their last five matches including their first Group B clash against Sudan's Al Hilal Omdurman.

Sundowns head coach Manqoba Mngqithi named a strong starting line-up as he kept his faith in Zwane who was enduring an eight-match goal drought while Ricardo Nascimento captained the team.

Masandawana were awarded a penalty just two minutes into the match after Zwane's goal-bound effort was deliberately handled by Chouiab Keddad who was given a straight red card.

Zwane then beat Merbah from the resultant penalty to make it 1-0 to Sundowns and the PSL champions launched attacks after taking the lead as they looked to take advantage of their numerical superiority over Belouizdad.

However the White and Reds defended very well with Mohamed Bouchar and Chemseddine Nessakh looking solid at the heart of the hosts' defence - making some important clearances and interceptions.

Belouizdad began pushing forward in numbers after the half-hour mark and Sundowns goalkeeper Denis Onyango had to come off his goal-line to deny Rayen Hais Benderrouya with a smart save.

However Onyango was beaten in the 44th minute when Sayoud was sent through on goal and he scored to make it 1-1 heading into the half-time break with Zakaria Draoui providing the assist.

Masandawana started the second-half brightly with Kennedy Mweene having replaced an injured Onyango at half-time and the visitors restored their lead through their hard-working striker Peter Shalulile.

Lyle Lakay's corner-kick found Shalulile unmarked in the box and the Namibia international made no mistake as he headed past Merbah to make it 2-1 to Sundowns in the 48th minute.

Sundowns were soon 3-1 up in the 55th minute when Gaston Sirino's delightful pass found Zwane who then beat Merbah with a first-time finish from a one-on-one situation.

The White and Reds looked to launch attacks down the wings and deliver crosses into the box but they were either cleared away or easily gathered by veteran Zambian goalkeeper Mweene.

Masandawana regained control of the match towards the end of the game and Lebohang Maboe put his name on the scoresheet in the 75th minute when he scored with a low shot to make it 4-1 to Sundowns after being set-up by Erasmus.

Erasmus then sealed Sundowns' 5-1 win with a simple tap in from Zwane's cross and Masandawana opened a four-point lead at the top of the Group B standings. They are set to face TP Mazembe in Lubumbashi on March 6.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi7QFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2RlbC12cy1yanMtZHJlYW0xMS10ZWFtLXByZWRpY3Rpb25zLWZhbnRhc3ktY3JpY2tldC1oaW50cy12aWpheS1oYXphcmUtdHJvcGh5LW9kZC1jYXB0YWluLXZpY2UtY2FwdGFpbi1kZWxoaS12cy1yYWphc3RoYW4tZHJlYW0xMS1waWNrcy1wcmVkaWN0ZWQteGlzLWdyb3VwLWMtamFpcHVyaWEtdmlkeWFsYXlhLWdyb3VuZC05YW0taXN0LW1hcmNoLTEtNDQ1Nzk0Ni_SAfEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWEuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9kZWwtdnMtcmpzLWRyZWFtMTEtdGVhbS1wcmVkaWN0aW9ucy1mYW50YXN5LWNyaWNrZXQtaGludHMtdmlqYXktaGF6YXJlLXRyb3BoeS1vZGQtY2FwdGFpbi12aWNlLWNhcHRhaW4tZGVsaGktdnMtcmFqYXN0aGFuLWRyZWFtMTEtcGlja3MtcHJlZGljdGVkLXhpcy1ncm91cC1jLWphaXB1cmlhLXZpZHlhbGF5YS1ncm91bmQtOWFtLWlzdC1tYXJjaC0xLTQ0NTc5NDYvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DEL vs RJS Dream11 Team Predictions Fantasy Cricket Tips Vijay Hazare Trophy ODD Elite Group D: Captain Vic,"Home

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey leads GOP rival in Pennsylvania Senate race: Poll,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4630466-pennsylvania-senate-bob-casey-david-mccormick/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTkvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvZGF2ZS1tY2Nvcm1pY2stZmFybS1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This G.O.P. Senate Candidate Says He Grew Up on a Family Farm. Not Exactly.,"David McCormick’s origin story goes something like this: He grew up in rural Pennsylvania southwest of Scranton. He baled hay trimmed Christmas trees and otherwise worked on his family’s farm. And from those humble beginnings he rose to achieve the American dream.

“I spent most of my life in Pennsylvania growing up in Bloomsburg on my family’s farm” Mr. McCormick now a Republican candidate for Senate told Pittsburgh Quarterly in 2022.

“I’ve truly lived the American dream” he wrote in a fund-raising appeal in October. “My life’s journey — from growing up on a farm in Bloomsburg to graduating from West Point and serving in the 82nd Airborne Division growing a business in Pittsburgh and serving at the highest levels of government — reflects that.”

“I grew up on a family farm from the time I was a kid” he said at the Pennsylvania farm show in January."
MCD,McDonald's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvZmVtYWxlLW1jZG9uYWxkcy1lbXBsb3llZXMtYWNjdXNlLWZhc3QtZm9vZC1jaGFpbi1vZi1hYnVzZS1oYXJhc3NtZW50LWluLXdvcmtwbGFjZS_SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9mZW1hbGUtbWNkb25hbGRzLWVtcGxveWVlcy1hY2N1c2UtZmFzdC1mb29kLWNoYWluLW9mLWFidXNlLWhhcmFzc21lbnQtaW4td29ya3BsYWNlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Female McDonald's employees accuse fast-food chain of abuse harassment in workplace,"Young women from across the country with remarkably similar accounts of workplace abuse and harassment at one of America's largest most iconic fast-food restaurant chains: McDonald's:

""He would make comments on my body and other workers' bodies saying like 'I would have sex with you I wouldn't have sex with her'"" said Emily Anibal.

""First he was like 'You have nice hair' started touching my hair"" said Jamelia Fairley. ""Then he was like physical; then he actually started grabbing my butt.""

Kat Barber said ""Any woman that he could get his hands on or be near he was taking advantage of that moment.""

Kimberly Lawson said ""It kind of made me feel isolated. I thought I was the only one this is happening to right now you know what I'm saying? So I just felt like completely alone.""

Lawson Fairley Barber and Anibal have all either filed discrimination charges or filed suit against McDonald's corporate restaurants or their independently-owned franchises. Each tells a story of persistent and unwanted harassment from male co-workers.

Dozens of women have filed complaints alleging workplace abuse discrimination and harassment by male co-workers at one of America's largest most iconic fast-food restaurant chains. CBS News

Barber said ""The tongs that we used to make the food he'd use those to like grab my breasts.""

""48 Hours"" correspondent Erin Moriarty asked ""Did he do that when it was just the two of you or did other people see this going on?""

""He didn't try to hide it at all"" she replied. ""It was in front of everybody.""

Gillian Thomas a senior attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union said ""It is hard to believe that in this day and age that it's still happening this egregiously this out in the open.""

Thomas said hundreds of female employees have been subjected to sexual harassment at McDonald's restaurants as described in as many as 100 lawsuits and charges of discrimination.

""The other piece that's especially shocking at McDonald's which of course bills itself as America's best first job is how young the victims are – 15 16 17 years old"" Thomas said.

""You're not saying this only happens at McDonald's?"" asked Moriarty.

""Oh far from it. The food service industry generally is one of the worst for sexual harassment claims.""

Last year in a survey of nearly 800 female workers at McDonald's restaurants and franchises three-quarters said they were harassed at work. In that same survey commissioned by unions a majority (71%) said that they suffered consequences for reporting the behavior.

But a company spokesman disputes the findings saying the sample size was too small and ""not consistent with what we are seeing in McDonald's restaurants.""

And yet there are stories like Jamelia Fairley's. She told Moriarty that after she reported the harassment ""they gave me 11 hours to 15 hours. And I couldn't work with those hours; it wasn't enough it wasn't helping me keep my place.""

In late 2018 Fairley then 24 years old and a single mom was working at a corporate-owned McDonalds in Florida when she said a new co-worker began making lewd comments and touching her.

""When he first touched me I told him to keep his hands to himself like 'Don't touch me'"" she said.

""And what was his reaction when you said that?"" Moriarty asked.

""He thought it was a joke.""

""Did other people see this happening?""

""Yes"" Fairley replied ""and he was doing it to other women at McDonald's as well. I wasn't the only one.""

Fairley reported the behavior to both a supervisor and the general manager and yet she said that didn't end the offensive behavior: ""It even got worse to the point where he pushed me like he grabbed me into his groin area. Managers were standing there watching him do it like and they didn't do nothing about it.""

He was eventually transferred to another store she said but not until Fairley reported another incident with a different co-worker: ""This particular comment he like really made me really upset. … He had asked me how much would it be to have sex with my daughter at the time and she was only one years old.""

That employee was fired.

Fairley stayed. She said she needed the job ""so that I could provide a roof over her head.""

In a corporate video McDonald's new CEO Chris Kempczinski says the company wants to be a leader when it comes to values: ""That's why now is the right time to have this conversation … We do the right thing for the right reasons. I love that phrase because it hits you in the gut. Everybody knows what it means to do the right thing.""

In late 2019 the company did put out an extensive new policy for dealing with sexual harassment in its corporate stores. But 95% of McDonald's are independently-owned franchises and there the policy is only a ""resource"" – not a requirement.

And this is how some past employees describe the sexual harassment training they received:

Kimberly Lawson who worked at a McDonald's franchise in Kansas City in 2017 and 2018: ""My orientation was a lady she sat across from me. She had a stack full of papers. She said 'Here we're gonna run through this really fast. I need you to just sign and date everything so we can get this done.'""

Moriarty asked ""Do you know whether you signed something that did list the policy having to do with complaints like sex harassment and what you do if you do encounter it?""

""I have no idea"" Lawson replied.

We heard the same story over and over again.

Fairley said ""I never got taught any training on that at all.""

Emily Anibal said "" I don't remember any training on that or hearing about that.""

Kat Barber said ""There was a page in the policy book that I signed but no one you know went through it with me.""

The ACLU's Gillian Thomas said ""So a policy that's on a piece of paper stuck in a handbook that is never actually lived in the work environment is worthless.""

Which may be how a worker in a McDonald's franchise in Mason Michigan was able to harass colleagues there for years.

Eve Cervantez an employment lawyer suing McDonald's and the franchise said ""This is a case where there was a serial harasser a serial predator. He harassed you know every woman who was there basically.""

Anibal was 17 years old when she went to work at that McDonald's in April 2016 and encountered Shawn Banks a shift manager.

Moriarty asked ""How often would he be making comments or touching somebody?""

""Pretty much every shift for most of the shift"" Anibal replied.

""Did you think you just had to put up with it?""

""Yeah that was kind of the environment I think that was built at that restaurant is that 'This is normal. And if you don't like it then you can leave.'""

She finally did leave in the spring of 2017. Five months later when Barber (then 18) starting working there Banks was still a manager.

She told Moriarty ""He used to call me 'bitch' a 'c***' 'ugly.' I was 'fat' I told him to stop.""

""And would he?""

""No"" said Barber. ""If anything it would make him persist more.""

Barber said she reported the behavior to the general manager: ""I normally would either get a laugh [or] get told that I was being dramatic.""

In September 2018 she too quit her job.

Moriarty asked ""In the end what made you leave?""

""It was way too much to watch not only others get sexually harassed but also get myself get sexually harassed"" Barber said. ""It was causing such an impact in my life personally. Even when I was looking for new work I was having anxiety about whether someone at that work was gonna be sexually harassing me.""

Shawn Banks did not respond to CBS News' request for an interview. The owner of the franchise through an attorney declined to answer written questions.

Moriarty asked attorney Eve Cervantez ""Isn't this just a matter of one bad apple?""

""It's really not about one bad apple. The problem is not just that you have a harasser; it's that you have an harasser who is not being stopped.""

After Anibal and Barber – along with several other women – filed suit the franchise owner sold its stores.

Moriarty said ""McDonald's could say 'How are we going be able to monitor the environment in every single one of these McDonald's?'""

""First of all McDonald's actually does impose a great deal of control on its franchises' Cervantez replied. ""You go to McDonald's anywhere in the country they manage to have the exact same hamburgers and fries. So they do actually have a lot of control. So McDonald's corporation could certainly be training these general managers about sexual harassment and about how to handle it.""

In its statement to CBS News McDonald's said that it ""makes training available ... to its franchisees"" ... and has ""made a hotline available for all franchisees to provide to their employees.""

If McDonald's is held liable in the cases filed by these women the damages may not be substantial; none was making more than $14 an hour.

But in a job that some see as inconsequential Jamelia Fairley said she is finally being seen and heard.

Moriarty asked ""Do you have regret sometimes about complaining?""

""No I have no regrets about complaining at all"" Fairley replied. ""I feel like I stood up for myself. I stood up for my daughter. I stood up for other women who he was bullying. I feel like I was making a difference.""

For audiences watching the old-fashioned way as it is broadcast on television it could not stand as more of a contrast to BBC One’s Bloodlands its main opponent in the schedules. This is British crime drama with a cartoonish glow and it is practically allergic to bleakness.

“I never go anywhere without my latex gloves” says DS Dodds played by Jason Watkins. If Watkins had delivered that sentence in Line of Duty in which he played the doomed Tim Ifield it would have been chilling. Here it is an endearing character quirk.

This is very much not Line of Duty – in fact this first episode is more Midsomer Murders. Five “firm fast and famous friends” go up in a hot-air balloon. Only four of them safely reach the ground. The survivors claim it was an accident then that it was a case of suicide as an act of chivalry. The balloon was too heavy and someone had to go over to save them all from impending death. But the body and several irregularities in the balloon suggest that there is far more to it than that as do the variously cold or delighted reactions of those left behind.

The first thing DCI McDonald (Tala Gouveia) and Dodds ought to investigate is why the balloon ride CGI is so ropey but when the balloon is filled with Martin Kemp Patsy Kensit Rupert Graves and Cathy Tyson – each playing a grotesque former celebrity still riding high on the profits of their 80s heyday – they can just about get away with it.

Kemp is Mick once a music mogul; Kensit is Barbara a former pop presenter; Graves is Gordon a “cultural commentator”; and Tyson is Jackie a former NME/the Face hack turned Telegraph columnist turned – I think – anti-feminist provocateur. They live in luxury flats in Bath bought with the profits of the Notting Hill house they shared as youngsters.

The deceased is Frankie Marsh a friend from the old days a one-time drummer in a new wave band and a former roadie for Japan. He also lived in their block of flats despite seemingly lacking the prestige or finances to do so. On his body the police find a picture of his four friends – a photocopy of a magazine from the 80s showing them off as “shooting stars” in their glamorous youth.

It turns into a surprisingly scathing indictment of the 80s yuppie culture and loadsamoney greed which sneaks nicely under the radar of the twisty and knowingly daft plot. (Do police officers really walk up to their suspects in random places repeatedly to confront them with every new bit of evidence?) “What made you so selfish?” asks McDonald confronting Gordon as he reminisces about the good old days when he was a founding member of the Groucho Club. “I blame Thatcher. What made you so wholesome?” he fires back.

The relationship between the leads anchors the madcap nature of it all nicely. She is the straight-talking boss with little patience for dilly-dallying. Dodds meanwhile is the bumbling details man who has an eye for maths and precision and keeps his rough terrain shoes – much the same as his regular terrain shoes – in the boot of McDonald’s car.

For a while it becomes McDonald & Dodds & Gilbert as the duo expands to a trio. As the death has involved a hot-air balloon an air-accident investigator is tasked with sending a report about it to the Home Office. Rob Brydon is Roy Gilbert the first person to say “surfing the net” without irony since 2009. Like Dodds he knows when health and safety procedures have been followed and when they have been thwarted. His expertise is invaluable although his military background and sudden rage towards the suspects suggests he has more than a passing interest in the Famous Four.

The appeal of McDonald & Dodds lies in how it spreads its charms. Bath looks lovely from the air and on the ground and the eponymous duo are great balancing each other’s flaws. I found the plot complicated enough not to guess who was responsible until a good way into the episode which is becoming increasingly rare. Sometimes a lightness of touch sits uncomfortably in a crime drama but the fact that this doesn’t take itself too seriously really works.

In his new role Gonda “will ensure a consistent voice drive authentic content to better connect our positive impact with consumers to drive brand trust and assure communication readiness for all issues that impact McDonald’s” chief global impact officer Katie Beirne Fallon wrote in a LinkedIn post detailing the range of changes.



Gonda who joined McDonald’s from Chobani two years ago is the chain’s first CCO since the departure of Robert Gibbs in September 2019. Gonda and VP of US communications Dave Tovar each assumed some of Gibbs' responsibilities at that time.



Tovar has also been promoted. He will now serve as chief corporate relations officer ""responsible for leading corporate relations and leveraging the resources of the COEs to drive a positive impact across the US McDonald’s largest market"" Fallon wrote.



In addition Dionne Parker a 10-year veteran of McDonald’s comms function has been named head of international communications. Senior director Rodney Jordan will lead the company’s new office of strategic planning alignment & operations.



McDonald’s three other new Global Impact Centers of Excellence are its sustainability & ESG team led by chief sustainability officer Jenny McColloch; global government relations & public policy team led by VP Genna Gent; and Ronald McDonald House Charities Inc. led by CEO Kelly Dolan.



“We’ve embarked on a multi-decades-long commitment to making a difference in the world but our impact is not universally known. I suspect it’s one of the reasons why many people that visit our restaurants are reluctant to say they feel good about it” said Fallon who was named McDonald’s first global impact officer in October.



“Part of the challenge of the new global impact team will be to better connect our words and actions around the world — to get that pent-up goodwill off the sidelines and form stronger partnerships with our communities” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjExYWxpdmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC93b29kc3RvY2svbWNkb25hbGRzLXNob3RndW4tdGhyZWF0LXdvb2RzdG9jay84NS01NGY0NGZhNi1kMDRjLTQ0NzEtYjI2OS1kNDg1YjU4Njk1N2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woodstock McDonalds shotgun threat after Pokemon meal mishap | 11alive.com,"Authorities said the young men left their food on the floor and were approached by employees

WOODSTOCK Ga. — Woodstock Police are asking for help identifying two men tied to an unusual crime that almost took a violent turn.

According to a statement released on Friday the department is investigating an incident that happened weeks earlier on Feb. 10 at a McDonald's on Highway 92.

According to police two male suspects entered the store and bought 10 Happy Meals allegedly with the goal of finding the Pokemon toys inside them. The men then left the food from the meals on the floor of the restaurant police said.

It's when they were confronted about the act that the incident allegedly took a much more dangerous turn.

""Store employees approached the men about it in the parking lot and in return one of the males pointed a shotgun at the store employees before leaving in what is described to be a black Honda or Kia sedan.""

Because of this alarming end to the situation police have now issued an alert for the two suspects described as white males in their late teens to early 20s.

One was wearing a sleeveless shirt and appeared to be using a fanny pack or satchel slung over his shoulder.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdHJhaWdodC5jb20vY292aWQtMTktcGFuZGVtaWMvbmV3cy9iYy1hbnRpbWFzay1hY3RpdmlzdHMtZGVjcnktbWNkb25hbGRzLWdlb3JnZS1zb3Jvcy1hbmQtb2ZmaWNpYWwtaGlzdG9yeS1vZi1zZWNvbmQtd29ybGQtd2Fy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,B.C. antimask activists decry McDonald's George Soros and the official history of the Second World War,"1 of 1 2 of 1

One of Vancouver's more vocal antimask advocates has made an unproven allegation about McDonald's restaurants.

In a livestream over Facebook on February 27 Odessa Orlewicz alleged that ""child meat"" was found in the company's warehouses. She based her claim on an article she'd read and a documentary that she had seen.

""Why is this not on every front page of every newspaper?"" Orlewicz declared as she was doing the livestream on Hornby Street. ""Why is this not on Global News? The coverup is so insane.""

There's been no independent confirmation of this by any government organization. Back in 2014 the fact-checking website Snopes declared that a claim of human meat in an Oklahoma City McDonald's outlet was false.

Orlewicz hosts shows on Canadian Liberty Talks which offers an online forum for other antimask advocates.

She's also part of the ""Great Reset Summit"" which premieres live on March 2 on the librti.com site. It will feature various antimask campaigners as well as People's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier.

This isn't the first time that Orlewicz has made startling allegations. In a Canadian Liberty Talks presentation she talked about how there's a ""crazy spiritual war"" taking place—with elites infiltrating religions and trafficking children through tunnels.

""And so the horrificness that we cannot believe is happening and we cannot believe how many people are involved in this—guys it all comes down to money"" she said. ""Money and fear. Briberies. Lies.""

In addition Orlewicz revealed earlier this month that she's a ""sovereign citizen"". In the tweet below she talked about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ""kidnapping people"".

Orlewicz isn't the only antimasker who thinks elites are conspiring against the masses.

Danielle Kinchella-Pistilli who backed the recent Freedom Rally World event at the Vancouver Art Gallery has alleged that six people own all the media in the world. Moreover she purported on Facebook that the ""horrible George Soros"" is ""one of the biggest puppeteers in this game"".

""He and the sick bastards that report to him have an awful agenda to control all of us and to also depopulate the planet"" she claimed.

Last year the anti-hate organization ADL issued a report detailing the degree of online misinformation about Soros who funds Open Society foundations.

In a sample set of social-media messages Soros was mentioned in ""an astounding 39 percent of all tweets targeting Jewish incumbents that were labeled Problematic"" the report stated.

""These tweets push a series of debunked antisemitic conspiracy theories tied to Soros—namely that Soros is funding and organizing the political careers of Jewish incumbents the media and BLM and Antifa protests in order to assert a Communist or 'Jewish supremacy' agenda in the United States"" the report stated.

Another of Vancouver's antimaskers Alicia Johnson has also made disparaging comments about Soros—as well as the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds.



""I didn't know that in 1913 the Rothschilds actually bought the United States of America"" Johnson said on Bitchute.

She added that ""the U.S. Treasury is not owned by the U.S. it's owned by the Rothschilds.""

Yet another antimasker Raoul Taylor van Haastert has criticized ""Zionist media"".

He's not alone in this belief. The Straight has previously reported that a man who led an antimask protest last year has declared that he's a ""Holocaust disbeliever"".

""If you guys can't see the relation between what they did to Hitler and what they're doing to Donald J. Trump I don't know what to tell you"" Marco Pietro declared on his Facebook account.

Meanwhile of the 212 people identified by the ADL as being involved in the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol 52 have direct ties to right-wing extremist groups.

Six were linked to the Oath Keepers another 17 to the Proud Boys and 14 to the QAnon conspiracy theory.

QAnon believers are under the impression that Donald Trump will be inaugurated as U.S. president on March 4 according to Vox."

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results."

Leung who runs a pet supply shop in Hong Kong founded the group in 2013 and since then it has become a platform for the city’s cat lovers to meet exchange ideas and report sightings of stray cats. At the time of its suspension it had more than 230000 members.

It was days before he got an explanation but after he complained to local media and lawmakers Facebook told him that the suspension occurred because someone had reported that Cat Is Cat violated its policies on the animal trade. “Absolutely ridiculous” he says. “It has always been our goal to advocate cat adoption and we have never allowed anyone to sell cats in our group.”

Since massive pro-democracy protests broke out in Hong Kong in 2019 seemingly arbitrary suspensions of Facebook pages have become commonplace and the company’s policies have become more “ambiguous” Leung said. Cat Is Cat is apolitical but its members have often posted images in support of the movement including an image of a cat wearing a coat emblazoned with “Liberate Hong Kong” and criticism of the police’s liberal use of tear gas.

“Some people may see us as a political group because many of our members like to publish content that criticises the government and I cannot prevent them from doing so” he said adding that he has always followed Facebook’s guidelines barring discrimination personal attacks and insults. “Similarly I did not stop pro-China users from using cats to condemn rioters because I believe in freedom of speech and everyone should be entitled to their opinion.”

While Facebook said the suspension was not for political reasons Leung was annoyed at the company’s lack of transparency and decided to look for a plan B. “Facebook’s monopoly has become very serious and we wanted to look for a second choice” he said. “At that time people started to talk about MeWe so we decided to open a group there.”

Since November tens of thousands of Hong Kong social media users have set up accounts on MeWe a U.S.-based social media platform that bills itself as a privacy-first alternative to the established platforms with the tagline “No BS. No Ads. No Spyware.” Many of the digital migrants are pro-democracy supporters abandoning Facebook and its messenger service WhatsApp. In January WhatsApp announced that its privacy policies would change to allow it to share data with its parent company.

But just as pro-democracy supporters are moving away from the mainstream platforms so too are their counterparts in the pro-Beijing movement who perceive a bias on Western social media against users sympathetic to China. A growing number of them have embraced the mainland’s most popular platforms WeChat and Weibo where they believe they will be treated more fairly.

While it remains to be seen whether the migration will be permanent it shows the deep divides that have opened up between the pro-Beijing and pro-democracy camps in Hong Kong.

“If more people decide to follow the trend in the long run” said Fu King-Wa a journalism professor at the University of Hong Kong “Hong Kong’s social media landscape could become even more segregated.”

The mass migration from Facebook in Hong Kong first began during the U.S. presidential election in 2020 according to Wong Ho Wa a data scientist and a pro-democracy candidate in last year’s legislative elections in Hong Kong. The social media company had labeled and removed content — including that produced by then-president Trump — that it deemed to be damaging to the democratic process. “Many people became concerned [over] whether Facebook has started to undermine freedom of speech” Wong said adding that around a quarter of his social media contacts have already opened MeWe accounts.

Facebook said that it needed to proactively moderate content in order to prevent the spread of misinformation but some Hong Kong users likened the move to their own government’s censorship.

A sweeping national security law imposed in 2020 to crimalize “secession subversion terrorism and collusion with foreign forces” has been used to arrest journalists and civil society activists for vocally supporting the huge pro-democracy protests that began in the summer of 2019. Even mentions of the movement’s slogans — such as “Liberate Hong Kong” — are against the law. Police have shut down a number of Telegram channels popular among protesters. More than 50 pro-democracy politicians were arrested after holding an unauthorized election primary. Authorities have ordered internet service providers to block access to a protest-related website.

Some pro-democracy groups on Facebook have been suspended including in December a neighbourhood page called Tai Po which had 120000 members and frequently hosted messages supportive of the protests. On LIHKG a Reddit-like forum popular among protesters netizens raised fears — without evidence — that Facebook could be cracking down on anti-China messages as it attempts to access the Chinese market prompting them to switch to other platforms that appear to have fewer rules for content moderation. Facebook did not respond to several requests for comment but it said last July that it had stopped processing data requests from the Hong Kong authorities in light of the National Security Law.

The rumors further undermined trust in Facebook within the pro-democracy movement. One pro-democracy district councillor — who did not want to use his full name over privacy concerns — said he has used Facebook for more than a decade. He was elected in 2019 at the height of the protests and runs a page that provides information for his constituents but he recently set up a MeWe account. Since late last year he has seen engagement drop off on his Facebook page and he now frequently posts to MeWe first and shares it on Facebook later.

“We don’t want Facebook to dominate the mainstream voice — right now it has been controlling what we can see and determining what is right” he said. “I am still a bit wary of MeWe but what we don’t want to see is for one single company to monopolize the market.”

“I am still a bit wary of MeWe but what we don’t want to see is for one single company to monopolize the market.”

But Facebook groups set up in support of the Hong Kong government and police have also been suspended or blocked. One of the most popular pages Save HK had more than 200000 followers when it was suddenly shut down by Facebook in early December. Adrian Ho a Hong Kong businessman who founded the page told pro-Beijing media site Silent Majority that he was “shocked” because Facebook had accused his group of violating rules on “regulated items” which he said was totally unfounded.

The suspension raised concerns among government supporters that Western tech giants might be suppressing China-friendly voices says Horace Cheung an advisor to Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and vice chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) the city’s largest pro-Beijing party.

“Even before Save HK was banned we had already received complaints [from our supporters] that they were unfairly treated on mainstream social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube” he told Rest of World. “Many people are concerned whether staff members working for these social media companies are putting politics first and so we began to think we should avoid putting all eggs in one basket.”

Shortly after Save HK’s suspension Cheung’s party DAB published a Facebook post urging its supporters to follow its account on WeChat one of the biggest social media platforms in mainland China. “The suspension overnight has shaken normal citizens who love Hong Kong” DAB wrote in the post. “To prevent losing contact with you all of a sudden please follow the ‘DAB Hong Kong’ WeChat profile immediately and inform friends around you.”

Some Hong Kong politicians and police officers have already attracted greater support on mainland Chinese social media platforms than Facebook. Junius Ho a radical pro-Beijing lawmaker who once called for pro-independence activists to be “killed without mercy” has more than 1.1 million followers on Weibo China’s version of Twitter. Lau Cha Kei a police sergeant who rose to national fame after he was filmed pointing his shotgun at protesters does not run a Facebook page but has more than a million followers on Weibo.

Cheung said that he expects that more people will join WeChat as Hong Kong becomes more closely aligned with the mainland. “Once there is closer integration” he said “Hong Kongers will have to learn and get used to using WeChat for everyday communication.”

Fu the journalism professor said that these alternative platforms have a long way to go to challenge Facebook’s dominance and that most people have kept their Facebook accounts open. However they show how social media users’ priorities are diverging from one another. “For example Facebook’s selling point may be its comprehensive global network; MeWe may emphasize protecting freedom of speech; while other platforms may have different strengths” he said.

Cat is Cat’s operator Leung said that Facebook has a long way to go to win back trust. “This situation was created by Facebook itself” he said. “Facebook has been using its monopoly power to impose its will on us and I believe this is what really angered many Hong Kongers.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vY3BpLXBvc3RzL2JyYW5kZWlzLW9wZW5zLXBhcmlzLW9mZmljZS10by1yZXByZXNlbnQtdmljdGltcy1vZi1jYXJ0ZWxzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brandeis Opens Paris Office To Represent Victims Of Cartels,"Dutch litigation practice bureau Brandeis has opened a Paris office staffed by four senior EU and French competition experts to represent victims of cartels and other antitrust infringements.

The office will seek to take advantage of reforms in the EU to enable stronger public recourse to claims for damages for breaches of competition law including by way of class actions.

The team is led by chief executive Marc Barennes who spent 15 years working for the European competition authorities including as a senior court advisor (référendaire) with the General Court of the European Union and legal officer with the European Commission (DG Competition). Subsequently he had a two-year spell as an executive director at Luxembourg boutique CDC Cartel Damage Claims before this latest move.

He is joined by partners Sarah Subrémon a former Deputy Rapporteur General of the French Competition Authority David Reingewirtz formerly a partner at Paris litigation boutique Kadran and Philippe Zeller who was a partner at DS.

In a statement the quartet said “Our relationship with bureau Brandeis Amsterdam allows us whenever it is in the best interest of our French and EU clients in pan-European cases to offer them the option to bring their damages claims before either the French or the Dutch Courts which are notorious for being very favourable to antitrust victims.”

It enables users to interact with blockchains — most notably Ethereum — allowing them to send transactions create addresses and swap cryptocurrencies. It is especially useful when one intends to work with DeFi platforms or any dapp in general.

What You’ll Learn

What MetaMask is

How MetaMask works

The platforms supported by MetaMask (browsers and blockchains)

How to install MetaMask

What functions MetaMask provides

How to use MetaMask to interact with dapps

How MetaMask Works

MetaMask provides a bridge between your browser and a blockchain. It is marketed as an “Ethereum Wallet in your Browser” though the app can support other blockchains as well; there is no argument that it is mostly used to interact with the Ethereum network.

Supported Platforms

You can find all supported platforms on the Download page. At the time of writing the extension is available for Chrome Firefox Brave and Edge; there are also mobile apps for iOS and Android.

By design MetaMask’s purpose is to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. However you can work with other networks as well if developers have added support; for example you can use MetaMask to interact with the Avalanche mainnet.

How to Install MetaMask

First of all download and install the extension from the here. Once the installation completes a new tab will open in your browser:

Click the Get Started button.

Click the Create Wallet button. MetaMask will then ask you if you want to help improve the app by providing usage data. Make your choice and move on to creating your password:

Type up a secure password agree to the Terms and click the Create button:

This is the most important step so pay attention. There is no forgot-my-password action in MetaMask no reset password email no way to recover your vault aside from your secret phrase. As suggested by MetaMask you need to store the phrase securely be it on an external drive or on a piece of paper; make sure you’re the only one that has access. Once you have backed up your secret phrase click the Next button:

In the final step of the vault creation process you are required to arrange your secret phrase in the exact order. The purpose of this step is to make sure that you have backed up your phrase. Arrange the words in the correct order and click the Confirm button. Congratulations you’ve successfully created your MetaMask vault.

How to Work With MetaMask

Before we elaborate on the functions of MetaMask let’s first do a walk around.

Walk Around

Click on the tiny fox icon in your browser extension list:

This is the general interface of MetaMask the “homepage” of the extension.

Changing Network

The dropdown at the top allows you to switch between networks. By default the Ethereum mainnet and four testnets — Ropsten Kovan Rinkeby and Goerly — are available. There’s also a Custom RPC option which can be used to set up access to another network e.g. Avalanche.

Account Management

The circle icon next to the network selection dropdown allows you to manage your MetaMask accounts:

You can have as many addresses as you need in your vault. You can create new ones or you can import existing ones with a private key or a JSON file. You can also connect MetaMask to a hardware wallet e.g. Ledger or Trezor.

MetaMask Functions

There’s three things you can do with MetaMask:

Send and receive cryptocurrency Buy and swap cryptocurrency Interact with dapps

Sending & Receiving Cryptocurrency

Receiving cryptocurrency is self-evident — copy your account address by clicking on it and make sure the sender uses it as the recipient.

If you want to send cryptocurrency you need to click the Send button from the MetaMask interface:

You can either paste an address or select an address from your vault.

In the next step select the asset you want to send — you can send ETH and ERC20 tokens — and the amount you want to send as well as the gas price you are willing to pay. Click Next:

Review the transaction and click Confirm. You can follow the progress of the transaction on the Activity tab:

Buying & Swapping Cryptocurrency

The two functions are accessible through the Buy and Swap buttons.

You can buy ETH and load it directly into your MetaMask account via Wyre. Just click the Buy button and follow the instructions.

To swap assets click the Swap button:

In the first step you need to specify the assets and the amount you will be swapping. You can control the slippage in the Advanced Options (it is collapsed by default). Click Review Swap when satisfied with the parameters (you will see how much you will get of the asset you are purchasing in the third step):

In the second step you need to wait for MetaMask to get a quote for the swap from seven different exchanges:

Uniswap AirSwap 0x API 1inch Paraswap Totle dex.ag

Once it finishes it will automatically move onto the next step:

This is where you can review the entire trade. You can also review the quotes from all exchanges by clicking on the light blue heading:

Once you are satisfied with the trade parameters click the Swap button and wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

Interacting With Dapps

In order to interact with a dapp you first need to connect to it. Dapps usually have a “Connect to a wallet” button which opens a modal panel. Select MetaMask from the options; a window will then open:

Select the accounts you want the dapp to have access to. Click Next to see what permissions you will be granting:

In this example I am connecting to Uniswap and I can see that I am granting viewing permissions to the exchange (be mindful and approve only trusted dapps). Click Connect to complete the process.

If you’d later like to revoke access to a certain dapp you need to click the Connected text on the MetaMask interface:

From there you can see all accounts connected to the dapp. Click the kebab menu and select the “Disconnect this account” option to revoke access.

Once connected to MetaMask you can interact with a dapp. For instance you can swap cryptocurrency on Uniswap join a liquidity pool on SushiSwap farm BNT on Bancor open a leveraged position on Alpha Homora etc.

The interaction happens through transactions that are generated by the dapp and sent to the Ethereum blockchain via MetaMask. In essence all you need to do to interact with dapps once you connect them to your MetaMask is to approve transactions.

Summary

MetaMask is a powerful tool that enables seamless interaction with blockchain-based apps. It is secure in that you are in full control of your vault keeping up with the core values of decentralization. It enables fundamental functions of Ethereum and other blockchains from the comfort of your browser (or mobile phone) allowing users to buy swap and store cryptocurrency as well as interact with dapps.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndvcmxkb2ZyZWVsLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjEvMy92b3B2NWtkbWFmc241bXAwY2E0eHdrb3ZicWUwaXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Streaming Platforms For Classic Films Lovers — World of Reel,"Netflix

We can only assume that is one of the reasons why a couple of decades ago the CIA actually created a robotic catfish which they called Charlie and used it for intel gathering operations.

Not much is known about Charlie the Catfish robot at this point in time as details of its missions are still classified. However what we do know about it is that for at least one of its purposes it was used to collect water samples in an area. The robot was controlled using a line-of-sight radio handset and as you can see in the video above it actually looks somewhat realistic if you’re not paying too much attention.

It’s not surprising that the CIA would choose a robot shaped like a fish for its operations. After all there have been many instances where man-made technology has been inspired by nature. We’ve come across tons of examples in the past like robots designed to swim like jellyfish and robotic tunas made by Homeland Security to help protect American harbors.

It is unclear if the CIA might have already retired Charlie the Catfish but given that they have published some of its information and a video about it they probably have.

MU,Micron Technology,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAyLzI4L2JldHRlci1idXktbWljcm9uLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktdnMtd2VzdGVybi1kaWdpdGFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Micron Technology vs. Western Digital,"Which memory and data storage leader is a better all-around investment?

Micron Technology (MU -0.77%) and Western Digital (WDC -1.53%) are both major players in the memory and data storage market. Micron mainly sells DRAM and NAND (flash) memory chips while WD produces NAND chips flash-based SSDs (solid-state drives) and traditional platter-based HDDs (hard disk drives).

Both companies struggled with declining memory chip prices throughout 2019 as sluggish shipments to smartphone and PC makers caused a global glut of chips. DRAM and NAND prices gradually stabilized in 2020 but that recovery was throttled by pandemic-related disruptions in the first half of the year.

However investors have been much more bullish on Micron than WD over the past 12 months. Micron's stock price rallied more than 50% as its memory chip sales improved while WD's stock price remained nearly flat as its weak HDD business largely offset the growth of its NAND business. Will Micron remain a stronger investment than WD throughout the rest of the year?

The key differences between Micron and WD

Micron generated 70% of its revenue from DRAM chips another 27% from NAND chips and the rest from other types of memory last quarter. That business model makes it the only ""pure play"" on memory chips in the U.S. market.

WD which significantly expanded its NAND business by acquiring SanDisk in 2016 generated 52% of its revenue from flash products last quarter. The remaining 48% came from its legacy HDD business.

WD's HDD business has been shrinking as more PC makers have shifted to SSDs which are pricier but also smaller faster more power-efficient and less prone to damage than platter-based drives. It's trying to counter that secular shift by selling higher-capacity HDDs to enterprise and data center customers but the segment's revenue and margin will likely continue to decline for the foreseeable future.

WD and Micron rank third and fifth respectively in the global NAND market according to TrendForce's latest numbers. Samsung and Kioxia (formerly known as Toshiba Memory) rank first and second respectively and SK Hynix ranks fourth. However SK Hynix will likely jump to third place after it closes its forthcoming takeover of Intel's (INTC -0.94%) NAND business.

In the HDD market WD shares a near-duopoly with Seagate Technology (STX) which hasn't aggressively followed its lead into the NAND market yet.

Which company is growing faster?

Micron's revenue declined 8% to $21.4 billion in fiscal 2020 which ended last September as it grappled with low DRAM and NAND prices in the first half of the year. But its revenue rose in the second half of the year thanks to rising sales of PCs during the pandemic the production of new 5G smartphones and gaming consoles and robust orders from data center customers.

Those accelerating tailwinds boosted its revenue and adjusted earnings by 12% and 63% respectively in the first quarter of 2021. Its DRAM revenue jumped 17% year over year and its NAND revenue grew 11%.

Micron expects DRAM and NAND prices to rise throughout 2021. Based on these catalysts analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 17% and 47% respectively for the full year -- which are impressive growth rates for a stock that trades at just 11 times forward earnings.

Western Digital's revenue rose 1% to $16.7 billion in fiscal 2020 which ended last July. However its adjusted earnings plunged 37% as weak NAND prices crushed the flash unit's margins and its HDD margins continued to contract.

WD's fortunes didn't improve in the first half of fiscal 2021. Its revenue dipped 5% year over year to $7.9 billion during those six months as its weak HDD business offset its rebounding flash revenue.

WD's HDD business struggled as weak demand from data center customers offset stronger demand from PC makers during the pandemic. The HDD segment's declining margins also partly offset its expanding flash margins.

However WD's adjusted earnings still rose 40% thanks to lower spending during the pandemic and an easy year-over-year comparison to the first half of 2020. Unfortunately analysts expect its revenue and earnings to both decline about 4% for the full year before turning positive again in fiscal 2022.

WD's stock also trades at 11 times forward earnings but it deserves that discount valuation a lot more than Micron. It also suspended its dividend last May and probably won't reinstate those payments anytime soon. Micron hasn't paid a dividend since the 1990s.

The winner: Micron

I recently said Western Digital was a better investment than Intel since it has a clearer path to a turnaround than the struggling CPU maker.

But WD definitely isn't a better buy than Micron which is recovering at a faster rate while trading at the same forward P/E ratio. Micron isn't as diversified as WD but its streamlined exposure to the DRAM and NAND markets along with its lack of a legacy HDD business clearly make it a better overall investment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAyLzI4L2J1c2luZXNzL3VzLWJpZGVuLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItcHVzaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How idled car factories supercharged a push for U.S. chip subsidies,"When U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday stood at a lectern holding a microchip and pledged to support $37 billion in federal subsidies for American semiconductor manufacturing it marked a political breakthrough that happened much more quickly than industry insiders had expected.

For years chip industry executives and U.S. government officials have been concerned about the slow drift of costly chip factories to Taiwan and Korea. While major American companies such as Qualcomm Inc. and Nvidia Corp. dominate their fields they depend on factories abroad to build the chips they design.

As tensions with China heated up last year U.S. lawmakers authorized manufacturing subsidies as part of an annual military spending bill due to concerns that depending on foreign factories for advanced chips posed national security risks. Yet funding for the subsidies was not guaranteed.",,,,,,,,,

The company has issued a cumulative Windows 10 update that brings together a range of upgrades and fixes in one package to make it easier for customer systems to install.

It is hoped that this new method of bundling and releasing Windows 10 updates will increase the success rate of download and installs as well as preventing possible upgrade issues sometimes seen in the past.

All change

Microsoft does sometimes issue servicing stack update (SSU) downloads which incorporate important changes to the update process itself on special occasions binding together upgrades and fixes for any issues that might prevent a bundled Windows 10 update installing correctly.

""Servicing stack updates (SSU) makes sure that you have a robust and reliable servicing stack so that your devices can receive and install Microsoft updates"" the company noted in its latest update release notes.

The company revealed last year that it would include SSUs as part of its usual cumulative updates for the operating system as SSUs were previously installed separately sometimes leading to a situation where a cumulative update couldn’t be installed on a PC because the relevant SSU was a prerequisite and wasn’t present.

This is a problem more likely to be encountered by a system administrator overseeing a bunch of machines and dealing with the complexities therein although a single PC user could potentially encounter this pitfall when manually installing updates.

The first such combined release released to the public via Windows Update was the Windows 10 2004/20H2 optional KB4601382 cumulative update preview.

""Starting with this release Microsoft will combine the latest servicing stack update (SSU) for your operating system with the latest cumulative update (LCU). To utilize this improvement install the most recent standalone SSU (KB4598481) before installing this LCU"" Microsoft said in its release notes.

Yang Hou a former senior vice president at Qualcomm will take over for Alain Crozier as the chairman and chief executive officer for Microsoft Greater China Region says a company announcement released Monday.

After eight years at Qualcomm where he led sales and business development Hou will spearhead strategy sales and operations for Microsoft in the Greater China region. Hou was credited for achieving 3x revenue growth for Qualcomm’s semiconductor business and fostering partnerships in the smartphone industrial and automotive industries in China according to the announcement.

A native of northeast China Hou had a five-year stint at McKinsey & Company after he graduated from the University of Michigan and Peking University.

Crozier joined Microsoft back in 1994 and will officially pass the torch to Hou in July. His next step is yet to be announced.

Crozier is resigning at a time when China is racing to outpace the U.S. as the global technology leader. The ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute has shaken the global supply chain jacking up manufacturing costs for American hardware makers. Meanwhile a number of legacy U.S. tech giants are scaling back their presence in China where historically they have maintained research teams to better grasp the flourishing Chinese market.

In 2019 Oracle laid off hundreds of staff at its R&D center in China. Last year IBM closed its R&D center in China after 25 years in part due to increased labor costs former employees told TechCrunch.

The Microsoft counterpart Microsoft Research Asia is widely respected and regarded as the “West Point” for China’s artificial intelligence scientists. Famed alumni include ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming and the founder of autonomous driving unicorn Momenta.

Compared to its fame in China’s tech industry Microsoft’s revenue in China is modest as a result of rampant piracy and competition. In a 2018 interview former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said 90% of companies in China were using the Microsoft operating system but only 1% were paying for it.

On the new business front Microsoft has tried to peddle its Azure cloud computing product to Chinese enterprises but has so far been dwarfed by domestic players Alibaba Tencent and Huawei.

China contributed less than 2% of Microsoft’s annual revenue or around $2 billion president Brad Smith said in January 2020.

Like other foreign tech firms operating in China Microsoft is often caught in the middle between local authorities and free speech advocates. Its professional social network LinkedIn and search engine Bing have both been criticized for censoring content considered sensitive by the Chinese government.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9NaWNyb3NvZnQtU3VyZmFjZS1MYXB0b3AtNC13aXRoLVRpZ2VyLUxha2UtSW50ZWwtQ29yZS1pNS0xMTM1RzctcHJvY2Vzc29yLXNwb3R0ZWQtb24tR2Vla2JlbmNoLjUyNTYxNy4wLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 with Tiger Lake Intel Core i5-1135G7 processor spotted on Geekbench,"A Surface Laptop 4 operating with a Tiger Lake-U processor has been spotted on Geekbench 5. The upcoming device featured an Intel Core i5-1135G7 in this case although multiple SKU choices are likely including some from AMD’s Ryzen 4000/5000 series. The Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 with its i5-1135G7 delivered a decent single-core result.

4 Reviews

Recently we reported about 2021’s Microsoft Surface Laptop appearing on Geekbench with an AMD Ryzen processor that could indicate that the Surface Laptop 4 will arrive with either Ryzen 4000 or Ryzen 5000 chip options. Now another Surface Laptop-related Geekbench listing has turned up but this time around it’s an Intel Core i5-1135G7 at the heart of the device. While the multi-core result was hardly spectacular the single-core result is promising for a business-focused machine like the Surface Laptop.

The Surface Laptop 4 Geekbench 5 listing shows the 4-core 8-thread Intel Core i5-1135G7 operating from 2.42 GHz to 4.2 GHz and joined by 8 GB RAM. The multi-core score was 5214 points (unsurprisingly lower than the 6-core Ryzen example mentioned above) and the single-core benchmark score was a healthy 1384 points. We have achieved similar scores with the i5-1135G7 in tests with various devices such as the Dell Inspiron 15 7505 2-in-1 and Lenovo Yoga 7 14 while it can go even higher in laptops like the Schenker XMG Core 14.

Microsoft currently offers the Surface Laptop 3 with either an i5-1035G7 processor or i7-1065G7. Now it seems the Surface Laptop 4 will be moving on to Intel’s 11th Gen series it is probable that a more powerful option will also join this i5-1135G7 model likely in the form of an i7-1165G7 variant. If Microsoft also goes with Ryzen 4000/5000 options for the Surface Laptop 4 then shoppers will get the best of both worlds in terms of processor choice.

White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Sunday he would take the newly approved Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine and urged Americans to take whichever shot is available when they are eligible.

The Food and Drug Administration approved J&J's vaccine on Saturday giving the U.S. a third tool to fight the pandemic following vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer. The company expects to deliver 20 million doses by the end of March.

""All three of them are really quite good and people should take the one that's most available to them"" Fauci said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

""If you go to a place and you have J&J and that's the one that's available now I would take it"" Fauci said. ""I personally would do the same thing. I think people need to get vaccinated as quickly and as expeditiously as possible.""

The J&J vaccine is different from the others because it's a one-dose regimen and does not require patients to return for a second dose. It can be stored at refrigerator temperatures for months. The shot has demonstrated 66% effectiveness overall 72% in the U.S. and 57% in South Africa which has seen a rapid spread of the B.1.351 variant.

Though the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines showed higher efficacy rates in trials using two doses versus J&J's single-dose vaccine Fauci insisted that the J&J shot is not a weaker vaccine and said trial data shouldn't be compared for the three shots because they were tested at different times.

""You now have three highly efficacious vaccines for sure"" Fauci said. ""There's no doubt about that.""

While the country is seeing a decline in new coronavirus cases and an improvement in the vaccination rate Fauci warned states not to prematurely loosen pandemic restrictions a move which could lead to another surge in infections.

Cases have plummeted from 300000 a day to roughly 70000 a baselines that's still too high Fauci said.

""We don't want to continue to prevent people from doing what they want to do. But let's get down to a good level"" Fauci told CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""Let's get many many more people vaccinated. And then you could pull back on those types of public health measures.""

""But right now as we're going down and plateauing is not the time to declare victory because we're not victorious yet"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9tb2Rlcm4tZmVycmFyaS0yNTAtZ3RvLWdyZWVubGl0LWZvci1wcm9kdWN0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Modern Ferrari 250 GTO Greenlit For Production,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9tb2Rlcm4tZmVycmFyaS0yNTAtZ3RvLWdyZWVubGl0LWZvci1wcm9kdWN0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

The Keurig Dr Pepper and Monster Beverage Analyst: Nik Modi maintains an Outperform rating on Keurig Dr Pepper's stock with an unchanged $37 price target. Modi also maintains an Outperform rating on Monster Beverage's stock with an unchanged $104 price target.

The Monster Beverage Thesis: Monster Beverage posted ""very strong results"" that suggest momentum continued into 2021 Modi wrote in a note. The three main positive takeaways from the company's fourth quarter earnings report are:

1. US net sales growth of 16.3% beat expectations of 8% and improved 720 basis points sequentially to 11.8% on a two-year average basis.

2. International net sales improved by 20.4% in the quarter and 18.5% on a two-year average basis. The performance was ""solid"" as the company was up against difficult restrictive measures especially across Europe.

3. January gross sales were higher by 17.2% year-over-year despite two fewer selling days.

Two negative takeaways that are worth noting are: 1) Net sales were impacted by $15.2 million due to product returns in Europe and a labelling issue in Japan and 2) gross margin contracted by 75 basis points even when the returns are excluded.

Management said it will provide a product update soon although its tone on a hard seltzer launch ""was a bit less optimistic"" than prior commentary Modi wrote. While a hard seltzer launch could come in 2022 near-term products will likely focus on caffeinated and non-alcoholic seltzers.

John Barsby Secondary School students will be among the beneficiaries after Mosaic Forest Management donated $25000 to five Vancouver Island schools for meal programs.

The south-end Nanaimo school’s allotment will go toward its food security program according to a press release as the COVID-19 pandemic has led to “set scheduling requirements” for students. This in turn is leading to new “structural barriers to accessing meal programs” it said. The money will allow vulnerable students to receive nutritious meals in their classroom via a student-run meal program.

School staff were grateful for the donation.

“Mosaic’s donation offers us the financial stability to provide a much-needed food program that kids can rely on” said Holly Knox teacher and food security program coordinator in the press release. “The need for inclusive access to nutritious food has never been greater and we are deeply grateful to know that with this funding we will be able to support our food program and our students through the year.”

In the press release Domenico Iannidinardo Mosaic Forest Management’s vice-president and chief forester said the company has a long history of supporting communities near its working forests and is confident its donation will contribute in the battle against child hunger on the Island.

“Schools are increasingly working hard to support students beyond their basic academic needs and supporting this established school-led program will have a lasting influence in the daily lives of kids that just want to focus on learning” Iannidinardo said.

John Barsby Secondary School applied for the money through Vancouver Sun Children’s Fund Adopt-a-School program.

The world of complex jet engines and the delicate craft of felting have more in common that you might imagine says a new business owner.

Sarah Hodgkinson set up Crafty You Crafty Me in July 2020 after taking voluntary redundancy from the aerospace division of Rolls-Royce to pursue her dream.

The 37-year-old has built a business out of felting kits mosaic packs and crafting sessions and has been more successful than she ever hoped for.

""The mosaic packs have been really popular” said Sarah who lives in Hilton with husband Phil and their two children.

""I’ve sent packs to Brownie groups in Newcastle a Guide group a little closer to home and will be felting a yogi sloth with a yoga class who have been using craft kits in their online sessions.""

She says that crafting together has been hugely popular and that her customers adore her party kits which encourage groups to create patterns together.

""Once the lockdown rules in England are eased I’m planning on outdoor classes followed by indoor ones later in the year"" says Sarah.

Before England entered its second and third lockdown Sarah had run outdoor workshops in Hilton and Tutbury Castle which were attended by people from across the county.

Her career change may raise eyebrows but Sarah says that crafting and engineering have quite a lot income.

""The general product design so how you take an initial concept and turn it into an actual product are pretty much the same"" she says. ""Crafting a final design from individual parts uses a similar logic.""

Not only are they similar but Sarah believes crafting is incredibly therapeutic. "" It’s great for mental well-being and I find nothing more relaxing than crafting in an evening or creating felt animals – as long as you don’t stab yourself with the felting needle!""

Sarah has loved crafting from an early age and says that she would often visit wool shops in her home city of Bristol. She now frequents Wren's the family business in Allenton.

She jokes that there is a long-standing family debate over who taught her to knit aged six.

What is certain is that her new business is already creating a lot of excitement. Marketing Derby named her as one of the businesses that stood out as innovative when it was selecting its ""Rising Star"" award.

Her wide range of crafting kits from mosaic coasters to felt bunnies include step-by-step instructions to guide her customers through the process.

""The kits we produce are perfect for beginners of the more intermediate crafters” she said “with lots of different crafts available there really is something for everyone.”

Last week it was reported that Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) is talking with lidar companies for its long-rumored electric vehicle and self-driving efforts.

Bloomberg reported Apple would outsource some of its production to partners. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives gave it an 85% chance that Apple will partner with an existing automotive company on the project which could influence the lidar partner selected.

Here is a look at six lidar companies that have gone public via SPAC merger or are in the process of merging via SPAC.

Velodyne Lidar: Shares of Velodyne Lidar (NASDAQ: VLDR) fell recently as it was unveiled that Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) took profits and sold its stake in the company.

Velodyne had over $970 million in customer agreements through the year 2024 as of September. A tweet from SPAC researcher Daniel Johnson shows the company trading at 14.3x its 2022 price divided by sales the lowest multiple in the industry.

The company forecast fiscal 2021 revenue of $152 million and fiscal 2024 revenue of $684 million. Based on company estimates gathered by Johnson Velodyne ranks first in the peer group for estimated revenue for each of the next three years.

Ouster: Lidar company Ouster is going public with Colonnade Acquisition Corp (NYSE: CLA). The company counted Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford as an investor prior to the SPAC deal. The company trades at 25.6x its 2022 price divided by sales. The company is forecasting revenue of $34 million $107 million and $323 million for the next three fiscal years. These totals trail only Velodyne. For fiscal 2024 Ouster’s projected revenue of $818 million is the highest in the peer group.

Luminar Technologies: Lidar company Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ: LAZR) has the highest market capitalization of the six SPACs featured in this article. As of February 19 the market cap was $10.9 billion. That gives Lumina a price-to-sales multiple of 311.7 for fiscal 2022 highest in the peer group. The company estimates revenue of $26 million and $35 million over the next two fiscal years. The company is forecasting $418 million in revenue for fiscal 2024 ranking third in the group.

Aeva: Lidar company Aeva is going public with InterPrivate Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ: IPV). The company is trading at 118.7x 2022 price divided by sales. The company is forecasting revenue of $11 million $35 million and $75 million for the next three years. In fiscal 2024 the company projects a big jump to $286 million in revenue.

Innoviz was the first company to win an OEM production contract for L3 lidar. Partners include Samsung Softbank BMW and Aptiv (NYSE: APTV). The company trades at 84.4x 2020 price to sales. Revenue estimates are $9 million $23 million and $79 million over the next three fiscal years.

AEye: CF Finance Acquisition III (NASDAQ: CFAC) is bringing AEye public in the latest announced lidar SPAC merger. AEye is backed by Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) and Continental AG Europe’s second largest car parts supplier. AEye ranks last in projected revenue for each of the next four years. The company trades at 204.7x 2022 price divided by sales which makes it the second highest valued lidar SPAC based on the multiple.

The terms of the settlement in the Delaware Court of Chancery were not disclosed publicly. Citing people familiar with the matter the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Neumann was set to receive an extra $50 million windfall and other benefits as part of the agreement.

SoftBank Group did not release further details of the deal that puts to rest a bitter dispute emerging from the Japan-based firm’s 2019 decision to bail out WeWork once regarded as a soaring unicorn but which quickly spiraled into deep troubles as it lost cash and canceled its eagerly awaited share offering.

Neumann was forced out as WeWork chief executive in September 2019 as the company’s value plummeted and amid heavy criticism of his behavior and management. In October 2019 WeWork was taken over by SoftBank which spent over $5 billion on the move. Neumann walked away with nearly $2 billion.

But some investors and Neumann were not satisfied with the monetary deals offered and they then sued SoftBank claiming the investment firm breached its obligations by backing out of a $3 billion rescue plan.

Under the settlement of the dispute the Wall Street Journal reported SoftBank Group would buy about $1.5 billion of stock from other investors including nearly $500 million from Neumann roughly a half of what it originally planned to buy.

The deal would give the controversial founder a $50 million windfall another $50 million to cover his legal fees and extend by five years a $430 million SoftBank Group loan according to reports.

“With this litigation behind us we are fully focused on our mission to reimagine the workplace and continue to meet the growing demand for flexible space around the world” said Marcelo Claure executive chairman of WeWork and SoftBank Group International chief executive.

Neumann who was born in Israel and partially raised on a kibbutz had taken the tech startup world by storm with his company in the 2010s. At the height of its popularity WeWork was a dazzling unicorn valued at $47 billion and SoftBank’s founder Masayoshi Son had openly hailed Neumann’s vision.

When it agreed to the SoftBank bailout its valuation stood at around $8 billion.

SoftBank has remained a majority shareholder in WeWork whose bumpy results especially amid the coronavirus pandemic has dented SoftBank’s financial results.

SoftBank says WeWork holds potential especially in markets like Japan where office space is costly and workers’ commutes tend to be long. SoftBank also invests in artificial intelligence internet services sustainable energy and IoT.

Offering an alternative to more traditional payment methods PayPal came to prominence in the early 2000s as a facilitator of payments for online auction site eBay. Operating out of California in the United States the company continues to be one of the most innovative companies in the financial technology (fintech) sector. as demonstrated by their recent adoption of cryptocurrency into their ecosystem.

What is Paypal Holdings Inc (PYPL)?

PayPal was established in 1998 by two individuals with software engineering backgrounds and one lawyer by training. Originally known as Confinity Max Levchin Luke Nosek and Peter Thiel's new company was created in order to develop security software for handheld devices. After finding little success in this area they pivoted their strategy opting instead to build a digital wallet. This new product was launched almost a year later in late 1999. Soon after a merger took place between Confinity and X.com an online bank established by Elon Musk. Although the new firm originally kept the X.com name they opted to rebrand and clarify their product and service offerings. The company settled on the name PayPal in 2001 and the company eventually went public with an IPO in 2002.

Soon after the IPO eBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion. At this time the company's growth was impressing investors. Over 70% of eBay auctions accepted payments through PayPal and approximately 25% of closed auctions were using this innovative new payment solution. In just 8 years PayPal grew to over 100 million users across 190 territories offering services using 25 different currency options. In September 2014 PayPal opted to split from eBay and focus on other avenues for growth. Although the two continued to work closely together in early 2018 it was announced that PayPal would cease processing card payments for the online auction site for 2020. Today PayPal is very much a separate identity from its former owner.

Why does Paypal Holdings Inc (PYPL) Matter?

Despite coming into existence two decades ago Paypal's ability to keep up with change has allowed it to remain highly relevant in the modern era. This ability has allowed the company to now serve over 350 million customers and merchants in more than 200 territories. With the goal of making financial services cheaper more convenient and more secure they have continued to innovate. In 2019 a partnership with social media giants Instagram saw the launch of Checkout on Instagram allowing for secure checkouts using the Paypal platform within the application.

An early strategic acquisition came in 2013 when Paypal acquired startup Braintree for $800 million. As part of Braintree's portfolio Paypal acquired the technology behind Venmo a mobile service payment app that has now grown to over 40 million users. More recently the company made another major move purchasing shopping rewards platform company Honey in a deal worth over $4 billion their largest takeover to date. Honey is a money-saving tool that is popular among millennials with over 17 million active users. Paypal states that it plans to further integrate Honey into Paypal and Venmo platforms allowing the company to further grow its network and attract more merchants.

Paypal made a big splash in 2020 by announcing support for cryptocurrencies within their platform. All users would now be able to buy hold and sell cryptocurrencies from their Paypal accounts. This opened up the possibility to make transactions through their platform using popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum with payments made with crypto being converted into the national currency of the vendor's choice. This adoption will allow for a new and innovative way to make payments to any of the company's 26 million worldwide merchants. Originally offered just in the United States this service will expand to the Venmo platform and into international markets in 2021. While competitors such as Square's Cash App have already allowed crypto transactions for some time this move creates an opportunity for one of the largest vendor networks in the world to begin its integration into the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Paypal Holdings Inc (PYPL) Prospects

Despite the positive recent announcements and strategic moves a growing number of competitors are entering the space and could potentially threaten Paypals's position in the sector. Tech companies like Google Apple Amazon and Facebook all developing their own payment systems. In anticipation of increased competition Paypal has put considerable effort into building out core aspects of their business such as Venmo. As a result the mobile application has have evolved from simple P2P money transfer tools into a modern well-rounded financial services application. While peer to peer transfers within the app do not generate revenue newer features such as Instant Transfers and the Venmo Credit Card are avenues that have been monetized. With a 2019 survey confirming that over 20% of Americans have used Venmo over the past year there is a clear and present opportunity to leverage the monetization ability of the platform.

Paypal has also looked towards foreign marketplaces with the goal of expanding its user base. In 2019 Paypal acquired GoPay a payment platform operating in China. The move made Paypal the first foreign payment platform to operate in that country. Although the marketplace in China is dominated by domestic giants such as Alipay gaining access to one of the largest markets in the world was a step in the right direction. With careful planning and execution this acquisition has the potential to pay off in a huge way.

Despite this potential competition from giant technology firms PayPal has been at the top for more than 20 years. Their global network is massive and they remain very well placed to fend off any challenges in the coming years.

As the world continues to move away from more traditional payment methods such as cash and credit cards in favour of e-commerce and digital payments few companies are in as good of a position as Paypal is to capitalize. The company is continuing to innovate creating a broad and diverse payments ecosystem that engages both consumers and merchants. Their network is huge and truly global making it tough for any new entrant to the market to rival them. The company is constantly on the lookout for new avenues to expand into as is evident by its recent foray into the cryptocurrency space. With the ability to adapt and remain relevant the future remains bright for Paypal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzUyMDdjYzE1LWYwNmUtNGQzNy1iMzhmLWNiODMxZmJjM2Q1YdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Staying private: the booming market for shares in the hottest start-ups,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Oatmilk brand gears up for US stock market,"“Here comes the post milk generation” is the slogan emblazoned on the side of the electric trucks of the alt-milk brand Oatly. We will soon find out if that’s true as the Swedish oatmilk juggernaut heads towards a mega US stock exchange listing.

The Swedish company said this week it had begun work on a flotation in New York which some analysts think could value the fast-growing business at as much as $10bn (£7.1bn).

Oatly is following the money to the US where investors have poured cash into companies such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods which have helped plant-based nourishment enter the mainstream thanks to high-profile deals to supply McDonald’s and Burger King respectively with vegan burgers.

After the upheaval of the pandemic some business leaders think 2021 could be a watershed moment for plant-based foods. Oatly with the might of the US private equity firm Blackstone behind it perhaps thinks so too.

The consumer trends are clear. In the UK sales of plant-based foods broke through the £1bn sales barrier last year with 13 million shoppers buying meat-free substitutes and alt-milk according to the grocery market analysts Kantar. And despite the hardship of lockdown nearly 600000 people around the world attempted Veganuary up from about 400000 in 2020.

Unilever the FTSE 100 company behind brands such as Hellmann’s and Marmite now says expanding its vegan range is a top priority with its chief executive Alan Jope describing plant-based foods as as an “inexorable” trend.

“We are seeing in every single country in the world shift towards more plant-based diets even in emerging markets” said Jope who is pushing the company to turn out vegan versions of its well-known products ranging from mayo to Magnum ice-creams.

Morten Toft Bech the founder of the Yorkshire-based Meatless Farm which is one of the UK’s fastest-growing plant-based meat brands says if a company wants to “make it big” it has to go to the US because of the “tremendous” valuations that businesses achieve there.

Beyond Meat which has had a rocky ride as a listed company has a market value of $9bn compared with $1.5bn when it listed almost two years ago.

Meatless Farm’s sales are on course to hit £50m this year and Toft Bech hopes it too will become a “unicorn” – a City term used to describe young firms valued at more than $1bn – like Oatly.

Food companies that crack the US can grow very fast Toft Bech said. “A lot of the US investors I speak to about Meatless Farm are so focused on the US they hardly understand anything else because they don’t need to. The US [alone] has enough sales to become a unicorn.”

Toft Bech said the prize for alternative meat brands is 50 times bigger than for dairy given a $1.2tn global meat market. “You don’t need to produce more than burgers and a few sausages like Beyond Meat are doing to be big” he says. “It’s so humongous that even with 1% you are a huge company.”

US consumers spent about £1.6bn on plant-based milks in 2020 which was about 25% more than in 2019. In UK supermarkets sales of plant milks have increased by 16% to £278m in the past year according to the data firm Nielsen. Within that oat milk sales more than doubled to £73m (although a reality check should be provided in the £3.5bn of cow’s milk sold).

Over the past decade Oatly’s chief executive Toni Petersson has given the company which had spent several decades in the Swedish wilderness a makeover which has managed to make oats appealing to under-40s trying to make sustainable food choices.

When one first-time drinker said “it tastes like shit!” the company printed the view on its cartons to start a conversation. Petersson has also featured in Oatly’s ads including standing alone in a field with a synthesiser singing “Wow no cow!” The company has also moved into yoghurts spreads and ice-cream.

Last summer Oatly sold a 10th of the company to a group of investors that included Blackstone Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z in a deal valuing the business at $2bn. The change in its ownership triggered a backlash from climate and political activists who object to the presence of Blackstone headed by the Trump donor Stephen Schwarzman.

An interesting road now lies ahead for Oatly as it is forced to toe an increasingly corporate line to raise the cash needed to build a global network of factories.

Emma Clifford an analyst at the market researchers Mintel says one barrier to the growth of plant-based foods is the price as they generally cost more than what they are trying to replace. However with the pandemic fuelling a sustainability kick she thinks the environmental benefits will “become an even more persuasive selling point”.

Consumers have certainly got a taste for oat milk and as Oatly starts meeting potential shareholders it will become clear whether investors are thirsty too. The naysayers argue we are less than five years away from peak plant milk. While oat milk sales are booming the demand for soy and almond milks has already plateaued in the UK.

Petersson told the Guardian last year that oat milk was not a fad. “Ten years from now when generation Z and millennials have the strongest spending power globally I don’t think anybody is going to say ‘Why don’t we start consuming more animal-based products?’”"
NTAP,NetApp,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbGNhbGlzdGVjaC5jb20vY3RlY2gvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMCw3MzQwLEwtMzg5NjAzNCwwMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seven months after being acquired by NetApp Spot CEO says he has no regrets | Ctech,"What can a company possibly do as a follow-up act after being acquired for $450 million? Well for starters it can register its best results ever. That is exactly what Spot.io did last year after it was purchased by NetApp an American hybrid cloud data services and data management company for almost half a billion dollars.

Spot formerly known as Spotinst was founded in 2015 by Amiram Shachar the 31-year-old CEO who currently operates it out of California Liran Pollack the company's chief architect and Aaron Twizzer its chief technologist. The company began its journey at the Faculty of Computer Science of the College of Management in Rishon LeZion as Shachar's final project.

NetApp which is traded on Nasdaq at a valuation of over $13 billion offers hybrid cloud data services for the management of applications and data across cloud and on-premises environments. It recognized a golden opportunity to bolster its offering with Spot's cloud computing optimization services to software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies. Using machine learning algorithms Spot's product monitors the availability and pricing of computation power offered by cloud services to optimize use by clients. The company evaluates server costs for its customers offering them the best prices they can find in real-time. In addition the major cloud companies often use the services of the Israeli company to optimize the use of their services and retain customers.

Shachar told CTech that Spot was surging prior to the acquisition by NetApp last July as so many organizations were already changing their priorities and moving to the cloud following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. And despite the difficulties that often hamper newly acquired companies Spot has only gone from strength to strength since. ""We made more revenue this year than in the previous five years combined. Companies want to be more cost-efficient in the cloud and they're looking for solutions and we were at the center of everything"" Shachar told CTech. ""We saw a big uptick from existing customers and from new customers. Obviously the acquisition helped us a lot. But in most cases when companies get acquired they go on to have their worst quarter ever since it is a defocusing process and requires a lot of integrations with other parts of the organization. So it was really really nice to see that this didn't happen here.""

NetApp has seen its share price rise by around 50% over the past five months reporting revenue of $1.42 billion for the three months that ended in October 2020. NetApp also said its revenue from public cloud services on an annualized basis reached $216 million in the quarter triple the rate from a year earlier. Shachar believes that is no coincidence.

""I don't want to be arrogant but I think that the rise in NetApp's share price is connected to two things. Firstly NetApp is a very responsible company when it comes to its cash flow. It is a profitable company that creates cash and hands out dividends which is quite rare in the tech world"" Shachar said. ""In addition you can see NetApp's commitment to the cloud and the way in which it is growing its business. NetApp tripled its revenue from cloud services increasing it by hundreds of millions of dollars within a year. Had a cloud services startup reported such results it would have been valued at over $10 billion just for that. But because this is part of NetApp's massive operation it goes relatively unnoticed. Right now they have one of the fastest-growing cloud businesses. You just almost don't see it because it's wrapped into the billions of dollars of revenue that NetApp is already generating.""

While Spot's technology is complex its offering is quite straightforward. ""The client is getting an API that is a better API than the cloud API. So instead of telling the cloud 'hey I want 10 servers' the client tells us ‘hey I want 10 servers' and we'll go and run our algorithm and get the client a better 10 servers than the client would have gotten independently"" explained Shachar.

Spot is continuing to operate as an independent unit within NetApp and while Shachar highlighted this as a smart decision he also admitted that this plan will be reevaluated every six months. ""It's really about looking and deciding if it makes sense now to make Spot part of the global sales of NetApp. Does it make sense now to change this process? And I can tell you it also works the other way round does it make sense to take Spot's existing process and apply it to the global NetApp? So these are also the conversations we're having"" said Shachar.

Shachar said he believes that the changes brought about by the pandemic are here to stay noting that ""I still don't know if it will continue happening at the same pace but it's definitely set a new normal.

""I do think it's a permanent change because from my experience in the last six years of working in the cloud industry I've never seen people going back from the cloud. Once you set your infrastructure on the cloud the question is are you going to accelerate it by a 100% a year or 80% a year?""

Shachar said Spot has increased its team from around 190 to 250 since it was acquired by NetApp with around 200 of the employees based out of Israel.

""I have big hopes for the next couple of years because right now we're under a bigger umbrella so we can scale our sales faster we can scale our go-to market faster and we can actually keep up with this pace of growth. It's not easy with these numbers but it's possible and this is the goal"" said Shachar.

Shachar experienced the problem Spot came to solve first hand when he was running cloud infrastructure as part of his entry-level position at a previous company he had worked at. ""I saw how expensive it is and it got me thinking people don't have good tools because I was trying to get tools and there weren't any good ones available. And I said you know what if I can bring this better tool to everybody on the planet to use? It's a Cinderella story because VCs told me the idea didn’t make sense. When people heard about it they said 'it sounds good. But no'. But when I talked to people that were using the cloud they said it was brilliant and that they would love to use it. And that's what always guided me.""

Spot has expanded its product portfolio over recent years. It started with a simple API but has since essentially grown into a platform. ""I call it 'the journey from visibility to actionability'. Basically if you're a client you will connect your cloud account to us. And then the first thing we'll do is send you an analysis of all of your cloud infrastructure all of your cloud workloads. And we'll tell you how we see it and what optimization opportunities we identify. This is the gateway to our APIs to our automation products and then customers can select to take a workload and optimize it"" explained Shachar.

Shachar said that it was always important to him to build a healthy company ""unlike a lot of startups that you see that maybe they're growing on the technology side and raising a lot of money but you know they're also burning a lot of money.”

""I always wanted to build a company that can live on its own cash a company that is really good to its customers and whose clientele keeps expanding and growing. As a CEO my job was always to give the board and the shareholders optionability which is if we want to keep the company we can keep the company. If we want to raise more money we can raise more money. If we want to be acquired we can go and find a great buyer. We always had options and when NetApp came in we just looked at the options and made a decision.""

Shachar said that the timing of the acquisition at the start of the pandemic surely played its part even if only subconsciously. The valuations of many tech companies have skyrocketed since but Shachar insisted that he doesn't regret ""for a second"" being bought by NetApp and also questioned the validity of some of the valuations that have been making so many headlines recently.

""I think we landed at a really great company and I think we've made a really good move"" said Shachar. ""I am seeing this uptick in valuations and to me it feels like a little bit of a bubble. All these companies with all these really huge valuations either somebody needs to buy them or they need to go public. And the truth is that in all likelihood 90% of them won't be publicly traded and won't be acquired. And this is where I'm like we'll see how this is going to play out in the next few years.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Only minutes into the first episode you see that someone has been killed and for the rest of the first season you have to figure who the killer was. Every episode I was 100 percent sure it was one character and then the next I was like ""No I'm completely wrong it's definitely this guy!"" (Spoiler alert: I did not see the true killer coming.)

The show's blame game gave me major Gossip Girl How to Get Away with Murder or Pretty Little Liars vibes. Each character was so quick to have an alibi or point fingers about who could be the killer. While that's the central focus of the show it wouldn't be a teen drama without adding a spice of high school problems like mean girls blackmail love triangles and identity crisis to name a few.

I knew what I was getting into the second there were three regular students (Samuel Christian and Nadia) transferring to an elite secondary school (aka an exclusive private school) and the popular (and super wealthy) kids were not happy. This only fueled the fire when we found out who was killed.

The second and third season only brought more drama and more gasps from my couch. If you thought only one person was going to get murdered then you don't know thriller dramas at all—don't get comfortable with any of the characters (and Game of Thrones taught me that.)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZXcuY29tL3R2L25ldGZsaXgtY29udGVudC1tb3JlLWluY2x1c2l2ZS10aGFuLXRoZWF0cmljYWwtZmlsbXMtc3R1ZHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix content is more inclusive than theatrical films study finds,"Netflix is outperforming traditional studios in terms of inclusivity according to a new study commissioned by the streamer though there is still significant progress to be made on several fronts. A report by the University of Southern California's Annenberg Inclusion Initiative released Friday showed increases in representation for women Black cast and crew and women of color in Netflix movies and series over a two-year period.

""Over the years we've seen that to drive real change we need to approach our work with an 'inclusion lens'"" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a statement announcing the study's release. ""That means asking more questions like: 'whose voice is missing? Is this portrayal authentic? Who is excluded?' This lens directly impacts who is being hired both above and below the line as well as the stories we make for our members.""

The study examined 126 movies and 180 series released during 2018 and 2019 and found that 35.7 percent of these films featured leads from underrepresented groups compared to 28 percent of top-grossing theatrical films during this time. Fifty-two percent of the streamer's movies and series featured girls or women in leading roles and the percentage of female directors writers and producers on Netflix projects also outpaced the industry at large. Meanwhile 15.2 percent of lead characters and 19.5 percent of the main cast of all Netflix content during these two years were Black.

However racial and ethnic inclusion varied and not all groups were represented proportionally. Notably 68.3 percent of the projects assessed did not feature a single speaking role for a Latina and 96 percent did not include any women identified as American Indian/Alaskan Native or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. Only one director of a Netflix film and only 1.7 percent of series leads in these two years were Latinx.

Representation also fell short for LGBTQ characters and characters with disabilities with only 2 percent of speaking characters in films and 3.3 percent in series identified as LGBTQ. Less than 1 percent of series leads had a disability.

Sarandos said inclusivity reports for the streamer would be released every two years through 2026. ""Our hope is to create a benchmark for ourselves and more broadly across the industry"" he added.

THUNDER BAY – A fourth case of COVID-19 has been detected at Newmont’s Musselwhite mine about 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay.

The case was first detected through ongoing PCR testing being conducted on site at the fly-in gold mine after two workers were first confirmed positive on Feb. 21.

That result has now been confirmed by the Thunder Bay District Health Unit.

A third confirmed case was announced on Feb. 23 which Newmont stated was not connected to the previous two.

In a release Friday evening announcing the fourth positive test the company did not say whether it was believed to be tied to previous cases on site.

As of Wednesday the first three individuals to test positive had been relocated to isolate off site along with any high-risk close contacts the company said.

“We continue to offer our care and support” the company said.

The mine continues to operate under heightened protocols.

It aimed at exposing the participating farmers to best practices and innovations in the use of planting materials which could help sustain their livelihood.

The University of Energy and Natural Resources (UENR) Kokoo Pa Farmers Association a farmer-based organization and KIT Royal Tropical Institute facilitated the programme.

It was on the theme: “Planting Materials: Farmers’ Perception Challenges Opportunities and Innovations.”

Participants were from the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana (CRIG) Forestry Commission Bioversity International and Ministry of Food and Agriculture.

Professor Elvis Asare-Bediako the Vice-Chancellor of UENR in an address at the opening session said the training adopted an ‘innovations from below’ approach to enable the farmers to improve their practices based on their existing knowledge.

He explained that a variety of innovations were considered ranging from seed preservation producing planting materials crop protection to the survival of planting materials.

The Vice-Chancellor said studies had shown that some key developments affecting planting material production access and usage included climate change which had resulted in erratic rainfall and high temperatures as well as compact soils and loss of soil fertility.

Others pertained to the loss of forest cover excessive use of agro-chemicals invasion of pests diseases and weeds and also shift in farming methods and practices resulting in loss of planting materials and high mortality rates.

Prof Asare-Bediako advised the farmers to take a keen interest in creating learning platforms to foster the exchange of ideas technology transfer and the adoption of acceptable practices.

He also entreated them to open up and embrace new ideas to enhance efficiency in their work.

Dr Atta Ofori a research scientist and breeder at the CRIG said the Ghana Cocoa Board through the Institute had invested a lot in cocoa seed development and seedling nurseries.

This he noted was to ensure the availability of quality planting materials for farmers stressing that hybrid seeds had a better survival rate than those open-pollinated seeds from farmers’ plots.

Additionally hybrid varieties had an early bearing rate and high yield reaching peak yields by the eighth year and also were more resistant to cocoa diseases and pests than the early ‘Amelonado’ introductions by the late Tetteh Quarshie.

Mr Fred Amponsah Chief Executive of ‘Kokoo Pa’ in an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA) said the participating farmers were drawn from Nsuta-Nyamebekyere Mmoroben and Aponoaponoso within the Mankranso Cocoa District.

Dr Jacob Ulzen a Resource Person of Bioversity International a global research-for-development organization speaking on the objectives of the ‘Cocoa Target Project’ said it sought to accelerate access to planting materials for cocoa farmers in Ghana.",,,,,,,,,

A suburb as vibrant and diverse as Brunswick deserves to have its own local media

Wednesday February 28 2021

LIKE many other areas of Australia Brunswick has been abandoned by the media over the past decade.

Big publishers once distributed local newspapers throughout the suburbs of every major city in Australia and for a long time there was a fierce rivalry for readers and advertisers between News Corp Fairfax and independents.

These newspapers employed thousands of journalists and printers around the country. They gave many kids their first job delivering them to every letterbox. But more importantly they were a voice for their community.

Whether it was shenanigans in the council chamber planning issues crime sport or just a 50th wedding anniversary local newspapers covered their communities in both breadth and depth. They played a role in fostering grassroots democracy they curated important debates and they recorded history as it happened.

Brunswick was no different. Until a couple of years ago three newspapers were delivered each week but as the quality began to deteriorate and some publications became little more than glossy vehicles for property advertising the writing was on the wall.

Now Brunswick has no local media. The News Corp owned Leader group effectively shuttered all of its mastheads in mid-2020 using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to cut back on coverage of local communities.

Over the years media owners have deserted Brunswick and the wider city of Merri-bek because their big shareholders see no value in small local media. Local newspapers have either shut down or sold up acquired by multinational giants like News Corp who have no interest in covering small eccentric communities like Brunswick.

Producing a print paper is expensive so it may have been understandable if the Leader group had invested in producing a quality online product instead. But a quick glance at the so-called website of the Moreland Leader will tell you that it has no reporters in the area and delivers no value to the community. Worse still to access the Leader you must subscribe to the Herald Sun online.

The Leader’s Twitter account has been inactive since 2019 and its Facebook page contains little more than generic fluffy features and some crime briefs.

The reality is that delivering local news is a low priority to Rupert Murdoch’s beancounters in New York. Local print media has no value to a global conglomerate that derives most of its income from television and movies. They just aren’t interested.

The withdrawal of News Corp and other media has left a gaping hole in Brunswick that needs to be filled.

Ours is an exciting thriving suburb on the fringe of Melbourne’s CBD. It is a suburb steeped in history as one of the oldest established areas in post-colonial Melbourne: once a manufacturing hub it was transformed by postwar migration from southern Mediterranean nations and has always had a vibrant artistic and cultural community because of its proximity to Melbourne University.

Modern Brunswick is the home to young families who nestle alongside traditional Italian Greek Turkish and Lebanese migrants. It is a place full of university share houses which are a haven for indie bands writers film makers and artists. Sydney Road hosts hundreds of businesses ranging from wedding dressmakers to artisan bakers while the backstreets hum with the sounds of espresso machines and microbrewery fermenters.

With annual events such as the Sydney Road Festival and the Brunswick Music Festival this small suburb within a five kilometre reach of the Melbourne CBD has it all except . . .

. . . except a local media voice.

But there are so many stories to be told here. Behind every local business every club or organisation is a fascinating story. Behind the walls of so many houses are migrant stories of survival and redemption while within those share houses are the future of our cultural and artistic communities. Books are being written; songs are being recorded; paintings are being sketched out. These stories deserve to be told.

This our mission as Brunswick Voice. We are unashamedly hyperlocal. We live in Brunswick and we work in Brunswick. We are part of this community and we love it with a passion. And we want to share it with other people who live in Brunswick.

We will scour every corner of Brunswick for news and bring those stories to life with innovative lively informative and entertaining journalism.

Ultimately Brunswick Voice is your voice. May it be heard loud and clear.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvaW5zaWRlLWthdHktcGVycnktYW5kLW9ybGFuZG8tYmxvb21zLTE3LW1pbGxpb24tY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1tYW5zaW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom's $17 million California mansion - realestate.com.au,"Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom have begun to settle into their new California home which they moved into five months ago.

While overshadowed by some of its Nike Basketball counterparts the Nike Air Raid seems ready to leave its mark on 2021 as it’s recently emerged in a “White/Black/University Red” colorway last seen in 2014.

Tamer than the “Live Together Play Together” pair created for Spike Lee’s namesake campaign from 1993 the forthcoming pair features a predominantly “yin-and-yang” color scheme across its upper and sole unit. Hits of “University Red” enter the mix throughout the model’s signature “X” straps taking over “AIR RAID” text on the lateral ankle. Elsewhere the scarlet tone animates pull tabs on the heel in the same fashion it did six years ago. All together the color trio delivers a look rooted in the silhouette’s 1990s attitude while being from its retro cycle.

Buying sneakers has become an exercise in futility. Every time there is a big release you can immediately go to Twitter and see the wave of complaints from people who literally want to buy ONE pair of the coveted kicks to wear them only to lose out.

Every weekend people ask why is buying a pair of Jordans Dunks or YEEZY’s so damn hard? When did sneaker shopping become more akin to playing the lottery than actually purchasing something? Why is Nike’s SNKRS app so trash? Who’s to blame?

There is plenty of blame thrown around and Nike and adidas deserve their share of it but honestly the companies are not completely at fault here. Now before you react hear us out. Everyone always says that Nike and adidas should make more sneakers to meet the insane demand but that’s honestly not going to happen all of the time. The sneaker game was always an exclusive circle. The whole idea was to feel like you got a pair of kicks that someone else didn’t have and if you got them before the release date you were in elite company.

But here is where the game got twisted. When trying to get the latest Air Jordans you really had to compete with two types of people the sneakerheads plus mom and pop sneaker store owners who would flock to a store like NikeTown or Foot Locker to buy up a good size run in the hottest kicks to sell them at a marked up price. At the time all you had to be was dedicated to the game put in some leg work and you could nail down a pair of those Air Jordan 11s (Bred) or (Concords). But now you have to compete with bots and they are honestly batting 1.000.

Thanks to the sneaker reselling business and how profitable it has become resellers with the help of these machine learning tools are scooping up the sneakers quicker than your human hand can input your credit card information. A Bloomberg piece highlighting how kicks have become “bona fide assets” is currently being called out for showing how the game is being “whitewashed” but it also clearly shows how the game is rigged.

In the piece it follows one reseller named Joe Herbert who owns a basic-looking online store called West Coast Streetwear and how he and his crew successfully snatch sneakers right out of your online carts thanks to the help of bots and describing it as “easy.”

Per Bloomberg:

“It’s easy to get a lot of this style and they pretty much always sell” he said in one of a series of conversations we had last year about his business.”

“What Hebert meant by “easy” was this: The day these Yeezys were released he’d awoken at 3 a.m. signed on to the messaging platform Discord and rousted 15 members of his “cook group” a term sneaker resellers use to describe their allies in arbitrage. When the shoes went on sale an hour later Hebert’s team swarmed the Yeezy Supply website using specialized computer programs such as Cybersole Kodai and GaneshBot each prepped with Hebert’s credit card information and capable of gaming a system meant to limit purchases to one pair per customer. By 6 a.m. the shoes were sold out and Hebert’s bots had rung up $132000 on his American Express.”

So unless you’re equipped with your own set of bots it’s pretty much a losing game that Nike adidas or any online sneaker retailer can’t really do much to stop at the moment. The companies can only do so much using methods like surprise drops or trying other methods like moving raffles to emails but that isn’t foolproof either. Just look at what happened with Marcus Jordan Michael Jordan’s son and his Trophy Room Air Jordan 1 release which was an absolute mess thanks to bots.

Albert Einstein once said that insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different result. Call us sneaker lovers insane every weekend. We subject ourselves to the madness that is trying to cop kicks religiously. This weekend isn’t any different. SNKRS is currently trending because sneaker enthusiasts we’re not able to land a pair of the Air Jordan 4 “Taupe Haze.”

So if you really want to “unrig” the system you’re going to have to hurt the resellers in the process which means punishing them by not spending over retail for the kicks they are hoarding. Let them sit on all of those kicks they bought using bots don’t shop at sites like GOAT or StockX.

Are you willing to go that far? If not this broken record will continue to play for the foreseeable future.

*Update Mar. 1*

Ann Hebert the mother of sneaker reseller Joe Herbet that Bloomberg highlighted in its piece on the ridiculously profitable sneaker reselling game has resigned from her position at Nike Complex reports. In an email sent to the website the sportswear company confirmed her resignation stating “Ann Hebert VP/GM North America geography has decided to step down from Nike effectively immediately” Nike states. “We thank Ann for her more than 25 years with Nike and wish her well.”

The company also released a press released and it stated “Ann Hebert made the decision to resign from Nike.”

Herbert’s resignation comes after it was revealed the credit card that her 19-year-old son revealed he used to make his purchases was under her name. When Bloomberg ran the stories it was immediately met with outrage with many claiming that Herbert had an unfair advantage when it comes to landing kicks due to his mother helping him and her connection to Nike’s SNKRS app.

The young reseller insisted to the story’s author that his connection to a Nike exec (his mother) not be mentioned as a condition for his involvement in the piece.

Nike’s company policy forbids its employees from participating in the sneaker resale business and purchasing sneakers whether at a discount or retail price to sell them at a higher price point. According to Bloomberg a spokesperson for Nike confirmed that Ann Herbert disclosed information about her son’s business to the company in 2018 and there was “no violation of company policy.”

There was some speculation that six pairs of the extremely-limited Nike Air MAG sneakers that Herbert claimed he found in a storage unit in January 2020 were obtained through some shady means. Another source claimed that Joe Herbert would use his mother’s discount to purchase large quantities of Nike footwear from factory stores.

As we said folks it’s rigged.

In this interview with Daily Trust he identified citizens’ cooperation as a major factor in winning the war against banditry and insurgents. He however attributed lack of this cooperation to the loss of confidence in the country’s security agencies as well as the failure of governments to deal “decisively” with the masterminds and perpetrators of violence among many other issues. Excerpt:

Daily Trust: As a historian what is your take on the security challenges facing Nigeria especially if there is anything that we need to learn from history?

Professor Mahmoud Hamman: The most serious security issues facing this country today are insurgency and banditry and both involve heinous atrocities like terrorism arson kidnapping and murder which inevitably lead to massive displacement of communities and the dislocation of the economy. For over a decade now the various security agencies particularly the Nigeria Army and Police have been tackling the perpetrators and degrading their capacities but they are still active and causing havoc especially in the Northeastern Northwestern and parts of the North central geo-political zones of the country. The pertinent question is why are the insurgents and bandits still active in these areas in particular in spite of the tremendous efforts of the security agencies to contain them? The answer to this question may be found in our recent history.

The collapse of public administration at the state and local government levels from 1980 to date is one of the factors contributing to our current security woes. The foundation of peace and security in every society is effective governance as reflected in the extent to which the constituted authorities have clear knowledge of the day-to-day affairs of the people under their jurisdiction and developed appropriate policy mechanisms to regulate their conduct or behaviour.

Until the 1980s the northern states of Nigeria were known for their relative stability and peace compared to other parts of the country. This was partly the result of the development over the centuries of state systems that were characterized by well-defined hierarchy of authority from the center to the lowest level of society.

The weakening of public administration at the state and local government levels in the North began to manifest in the early 1980s as a result of some monumental errors in political and administrative decisions of the Northern states. For example in 1980/81 the government of Kaduna State under Alhaji Balarabe Musa decided in the context of the oil boom euphoria and the restoration of democratic practice in the country to abolish the Jangali (Cattle Tax) and Haraji (poll or head tax) ostensibly to reduce economic burden on the masses.

DT: How can the decision taken only by Kaduna State be said to have impacted the entire northern states?

Hamman: This is because shortly thereafter the various governments of the Northern states followed suit obviously for political reasons. However it did not occur to them that throughout history exactions like tax tributes levies etc that are imposed by states or sovereigns and which have economic value are fundamentally instruments of administrative and political control that serve to maintain the loyalty and obedience of the subjects. Hence their sudden and uncritical abolition may have even security consequences for the nation-states.

In the case of the states of Northern Nigeria this oversight by their governments in 1980 has today proved to be extremely costly in terms of security of life and property. This is because various processes and procedures that have very important security implications for the states usually preceded the annual collection of both Jangali and Kharaji. They effectively checked the excesses of the highly mobile and restless herdsmen and sedentary rural and urban dwellers.

DT: It is amazing for taxes to be counted as security measures?

All right let us begin with the Jangali. The process started with the enumeration of cattle population across the entire Northern region on the basis of individual herds under the jurisdiction of Native Authorities (NAs). During this exercise the herdsmen and their settlements (ruggage) were registered. The size of each herd of cattle was determined by counting the animals therein. The migratory orbit of each pastoral family was also documented on this occasion. This exercise constituted the first phase of official contact between the herdsmen and local authorities.

After a few months the actual cash payment was made by individual herdsmen as per the registered cattle population of each herd. This exercise involved the district heads the village heads and the various Ardo’s (pastoral leaders) of the herdsmen and it constituted the second phase of official contact between the herdsmen and various local authorities.

The third phase of official contact between them was when the annual compulsory but free inoculation of cattle was conducted by veterinary personnel against epidemics like Rinderpest and Bovine Tuberculosis. Every herdsman would naturally want his herds to be inoculated and therefore needed no persuasion.

As a result of all these annual official contacts every herdsman and his residence were documented and information on them was available in public records. So no herdsmen would think of committing heinous crimes and expect to get away with them undetected by public authorities and therefore criminality amongst them was reduced to the barest minimum.

However with the abolition of Jangali in the Northern states over 40 years now no public officer would know the identity and whereabouts of the herdsmen and hence they operate as faceless freelance and can commit any offence in one area and escape to another undetected. It is therefore no wonder that going by the testimonies of the victims of banditry in the northern states the herdsmen seem to be some of the principal actors in this matter.

DT: Are you advocating for the restoration of Jangali and other pastoral practices before the 1980s?

Yes restoration of Jangali with all its annual protocols and procedures in all the Northern states of Nigeria will be one of the solutions to our present challenges. However it is pertinent at this juncture to draw attention to the issue of pastoral infrastructure whose provision will definitely enhance the containment of crimes perpetrated by herdsmen. All grazing reserves in the country about 415 should be revived and forests which now serve as safe havens for bandits should be reclaimed by government to create new grazing reserves in order to accommodate the numerous herdsmen in the country and promote the modernization of the country’s meat and dairy industries.

In the case of Haraji or poll tax it affected adult males only; men above 18 years old and were registered annually on the basis of Wards (Unguwanni). Every ward head (Mai Unguwa) with the assistance of a scribe was responsible for the annual registration of the residents of his ward for purposes of tax collection. Like the Jangali the Kharaji collection was also preceded by some procedures and processes that had very important security implications regarding the identity address and occupation of the eligible citizens of the ward.

When the poll tax was abolished in the northern states most ward heads did not know the residents because the annual tax registration exercise was stopped. Hence the male inhabitants of the ward both young and old can now easily operate in their neighborhood or elsewhere as criminals and gangsters undetected since the ward heads not to talk of the district heads and local government chairmen and councilors have no official basis of interaction with them and know their identity. Against this background one may also recommend the restoration of Kharaji and all its annual protocols and procedures throughout the Northern states in order to enhance the formal interaction between the populace and constituted authorities even for reasons of security alone.

DT: Before ward heads could discharge these responsibilities they need to be recognised by the country’s extant laws….

Yes this is why the issue of marginalization of local administration and security architecture of traditional rulers at district village and ward levels since the abolition of Jangali and Kharaji must be addressed. The phenomenon of redundancy of traditional leaders at the grassroots level obviously have grave security implications. The common adage that ‘the idle mind is the devil’s workshop’ applies here. These traditional leaders have not only political and administrative value in modern administration but even more seriously security/intelligence relevance throughout this country because they are closest to the people.

With regards to the Boko Haram insurgency in the Northeast the incorporation of local hunters in the military effort is relevant especially in the Sambisa forest which have been their hunting grounds for centuries. However the announcement by Yobe State Government that it would not repatriate the almajirai to their various states of origin and reunite them with their parents is counterproductive as it would only facilitate the recruitment of Boko Haram foot soldiers in the state. Indeed the practice of Almajiranci in the whole of the Northeast geopolitical zone should be banned in order to deprive the insurgents of the opportunity to reinforce their ranks.

DT: Many stakeholders are canvassing for the use of community policing mechanism to fight the security challenges in different parts of the country?

The issue of community policing has been debated in this country for long and there is now apparent consensus on its necessity. The question however is how quickly could it be implemented especially in the northern zones where insurgency and banditry are rife.

The significance of community policing in the context of overall improvement of the security architecture of the country can be to strengthen intelligence operations based on their deeper knowledge of the local environment. It can also help to reduce the bureaucratization of security matters by eliminating red-tapism in security reporting and enhancing response time to emergency alerts. It is also important in identifying the bases and networks of criminals in the localities and the criminals’ methods of operation.

DT: Community policing may be only effective in known settlements but bandits and insurgents operate in the bush and they largely use motorcycles as their main mean of mobility?

It is important to completely ban the use of motorcycles for several months in the states where banditry has assumed serious dimensions so that the movement of the bandits can be detected and reduced to the barest minimum thereby diminishing their ability to elude security forces.

It is widely reported that the most important vehicle for bandits in the Northwestern and Northcentral geopolitical zones now is the motorcycle. When they embark on major operations against targeted rural settlements each motorcycle carries up to three armed riders. It is reported that the bandits reinforce their tyres with dry camel or donkey skins by inserting their tubes inside the skins before inflating the tyres. This tactic enables them to operate even on the roughest bush paths and on top speed thereby eluding security agencies easily.

DT: It is said that bandits are now recruiting from pastoral families…

Yes it is true. Bandits who dominate the Abuja area are imposing a levy of young boys on the various pastoral families in their areas of operation. Each family is supposed to send one boy to join their gang or else their security and that of their cattle could not be guaranteed. The life of the Ardos (pastoral leaders) of the herdsmen who seem to be cooperating with the security agencies in their moves against the bandits are also threatened and some have even been killed already.

The bandits are also said to have started interfering with the social life of the pastoral communities by compelling some girls to marry people who are associated with them. If the parents of such girls resist their security and that of their cattle will be in jeopardy. It is therefore very necessary and even urgent for the security agencies to devise ways and means of penetrating the pastoral communities and detect the bandit masterminds by trailing their recruits and other associates through the forced marriages.

DT: What do you think can be done in the Northeast to address the myriad of security challenges?

In the Northeastern zone where Boko Haram insurgents are active it will be advisable for the Nigeria Army to overwhelm them by massive mobilisation of troops both on the ground and air in the Sambisa forest and Lake Chad region. A whole division should be deployed against them at once in each of the theaters of war. That means encircling the insurgents by about 10000 troops in one fell swoop. This strategy worked in the Republic of Chad when under the Command of their President Idris Derby 9000 soldiers swept across the lakes in response to Boko Haram attacks. By the end of the operation over a thousand Boko Haram insurgents of the Al-Barnawi faction were eliminated and thousands of firearms were seized.

It was reported that many of the insurgents escaped into the Nigerian territory as fugitives in Sambisa and other parts of the Borno area. A similar move on the part of the Nigeria Army in concert with their multi-national allies could easily mop them up and bring to an end the menace of the insurgents in the Northeastern geo-political zone.

DT: It seems you have forgotten the Mambila-Plateau imbroglio.

Yes theirs is more serious and devastating. The terror and arson perpetrated by the Mambila ethnic militia on the Mambila-Plateau against the pastoral Fulani community since 1979/80 culminated in the June 2017 genocide that claimed over 1000 lives of pastoralists and about 25000 of their cattle killed or rustled without any consequence so far.

More than 25000 refugees escaped into the Cameroons and so far many of them have not returned to Nigeria. This scandalous incident was the most documented of its kind in the history of this country and its gravity was first brought to the notice of the world by a very senior Military Officer namely Brigadier General Benjamin I. Ahanotu GOC 3rd Division Nigeria Army Jos. He was dispatched by the Federal Government to stop the carnage.

In spite of the directive given by the then Acting President Professor (Yemi) Osinbajo none of the perpetrators was apprehended and prosecuted as he directed. The well-known leaders and masterminds of the Mambila militia both in the Taraba State government and the Sardauna local government area council as well as their principal foot soldiers and field commanders during the genocide are still walking freely and openly boasting that they will still do it again.

Neither the state government nor the Federal Security Agencies are treating the matter with the seriousness it deserves. This unfortunate situation may be sending the wrong signals to troublemakers in the country. Such heinous offences should not be left hanging for too long because they may provoke counter measures by victim communities.

Hence it is very important that the Nigeria security agencies revisit this spectacular incident and bring the culprits to book as a deterrent for criminality in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cnVzdC5jb20vOS1mb3Jlc3RzLWdvdmVybmVkLWJ5LWJhbmRpdHMtYi1oYXJhbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Things You Need To Know About Forests 'Governed' By Bandits Boko Haram,"The state has large forests that have become safe haven for criminals. The armed men use the forests straddling many states as cover

Nine forests linking almost the entire northern part of Nigeria and some neighbouring countries are being governed by bandits thus worsening the insecurity challenges bedevilling the region Daily Trust report.

Ismail Mudashir Idowu Isamotu (Abuja); Lami Sadiq (Kaduna); Shehu Umar (Gusau); Habibu Umar Aminu (Kano) & Misbahu Bashir (Maiduguri)

Bandits terrorists and kidnappers have taken over many forests from where they are reportedly launching attacks and subsequently keep kidnapped victims hostage. While civilians see the forests as ‘dead zones’ such places have remained mysterious for security personnel.

The nine forests include Sambisa Alagarno Kamuku Kuduru Kuyambana Burwaye Ajja Dajin Rugu and Sububu have become the hotbeds of insurgency and banditry and therefore a no-go area.

Analysts told the Daily Trust that unless the forests are ransacked reclaimed and properly guarded authorities would never get it right in terms of securing the people.

Kamuku Kuduru: Birnin Gwari’s deadly forests

What started as local criminality and cattle rustling around communities surrounding large forests in Kaduna’s Birnin Gwari and Giwa local government areas have over the years snowballed into full banditry and terrorism that have led to the killing of hundreds of villagers while thousands have been displaced. Criminals in Kaduna’s Birnin Gwari and Giwa LGAs have over the years found shield within the Kamuku and Kuduru forests.

For residents of the affected communities Kuduru and Kamuku forests have come to be identified as the two deadliest bandit enclaves that have become a nightmare for residents around the area. The Kamuku National Park criss-crosses five northern states of Kaduna Katsina Niger Zamfara and Kebbi states even though a large portion of the forest is situated within Kaduna’s Birnin Gwari LGA. With a total land area of about 1121 square kilometres Kamuku is said to extend to Chikun Kajuru and Giwa LGA within Kaduna State.

With Kuduru forests also situated west of Birnin Gwari LGA communities have over the years faced some of the most gruesome attacks.

Residents’ harrowing tales

Our correspondent reports that the banditry activities have largely ravaged dozens of villages in Giwa LGA with at least 30 villages becoming ‘danger zones’ with bandits operating freely.

“Bandits come from Kuduru forest transact their business activities fully armed in Girya Goburawa Karshi Garke and Uguwan Idi villages and many others unchallenged” said Ishaq Tanimu from Giwa.

Shehu Ibrahim who lives around Dogon Dawa in Birnin Gwari said presently dozens of communities including big ones such as Damari and Saulawa have been vacated due to activities of bandits linked to Kamuku forest.

“They travel on motorcycles hundreds of them sometimes two or three on motorcycles and heavily armed they attack our communities steal our farm produce and animals kill the men and abduct the women and children” he said.

He added that major towns such as Birnin Gwari town and Dogon Dawa are today heavily fortified with security teams at all locations while residents have taken up to vigilante teams to defend their communities.”

Our correspondent reports that Kamuku as a park was established in 1936 as the Native Authority Forest Reserve Birnin Gwari under the Northern Nigerian Government. It was later upgraded from a state game reserve to a national park before it was closed down due to increasing cattle rustling and banditry.

In 2015 the governors of the affected states which share boundary with Kamuku had collaborated in a joint operation involving the army air force mobile police and other security agencies to launch an operation that will exterminate and arrest suspected terrorists and bandits within the forest. This however has not resulted in the expected dislodgment of bandits.

Inside Zamfara’s Kuyambana Burwaye Ajja Sububu forests

Zamfara State has suffered a series of deadly raids by armed bandits and cattle rustlers in the past 10 years. Hundreds of residents have been killed and thousands of cattle stolen across the 14 local government areas of the state.

The state has large forests that have become safe haven for criminals. The armed men use the forests straddling many states as cover thus making it possible for them to carry out their activities with ease. Forest such as Kuyambana Burwaye and Ajja have become hiding places for the bandits.

The armed bandits have made Kuyambana forest their abode. They launch major attacks on hapless rural communities from there.

The deadly Kuyambana forest in Maru LGA extends to Birnin Gwari in Kaduna and Kebbi states.

Our correspondent reports that the bandits from the forest move to neighbouring villages on motorbikes with guns unchallenged.

A resident Malam Sani Yar’galadima said Kuyambana is the most dangerous forest after Sambisa.

“The reason why I told you this is that no one dares to inch towards his farm without him or her getting killed kidnapped or at least have his or her money or property robbed. It has happened to many of us here” he said.

Another deadly forest in Zamfara is Burwaye forest in Anka and Bukkuyum LGAs of the state.

The forest has also become a hiding place for armed men who have been terrorising residents of rural communities in the area for quite a long time.

“There is nothing mystical about these forests except they have been allowed to become lodges for criminals. Before these forests became what they are today we used to go deep in to get logs for wood and clear lands for farming but now all these are practically impossible” said a resident Aliyu Kawaye.

In Birnin Magaji and Zurmi LGAs of the state also lies an expansive dangerous Ajja forest. It extends to Batsari and Safana LGAs of Katsina State.

Then another forest called Sububu lies between Shinkafi and Maradun LGAs of Zamfara State and Isa and Sabon Birnin LGAs of Sokoto State.

Armed bandits had carried out several deadly attacks on herding and farming communities of the local governments using the forest as an operation camp.

Sambisa Alagarno as BH enclave

The notorious Sambisa Forest used to be a game reserve where wild animals such as elephants strayed in from other countries but constant hunting and other human activities drove most of the wild animals away.

The forest is located at the northeastern tip of the west Sudanian Savanna and the southern boundary of the Sahel Acacia Savanna about 60 km south east of Maiduguri. It occupies parts of Borno Yobe Gombe Bauchi Jigawa and some parts of Kano state farther north.

The name of the forest comes from the village of Sambisa which is on the border with Gwoza in the East. The Gwoza hills in the East have peaks of 1300 meters above sea level and form part of the Mandara Mountains range along the Cameroon-Nigeria border

Considering its size and convenience the Boko Haram insurgents driven out of major towns by both the military and civil defence forces have sought refuge in Sambisa and the nearby Mandara Mountains from where they sneak out to launch attacks on their targets.

The military had traced some of the insurgents’ camps to the forest on different occasions and dislodged them; yet the terrorists move deep into the forest to evade arrest.

A military source said there were villages located in Sambisa before the advent of insurgency with people living peacefully. In the middle of Sambisa National Park was a village called Njimia.

“The insurgents have mixed up with locals and succeeded in persuading them into sympathising with their ideology. The inhabitants were used in obtaining and transporting essential commodities from other towns to the insurgents hiding around them; locals who failed to join them either leave the communities or risk being killed” he said.

He said herders who moved their cattle and other types of domestic animals were made to pay taxes on their animals to the insurgents.

Alagarno forest on the other hand covered parts of Borno and Yobe states and is also a hiding place for insurgents.

Sources said Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau has over the years been shuttling between Sambisa and Alagarno forests launching attacks on communities in Yobe and Borno states.

My take on Sambisa – IBB

Responding to a question in an interview with this paper on the forest last year former military president General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (rtd) said he took the national guards to the Sambisa forest to secure the place and the country.

He said he was not happy that a positive idea was misconstrued because some people thought his plans for the Sambisa Forest and the people that would be trained there was to perpetuate himself in power.

“We looked at the country generally to get an area where they could be trained (national guards) and one of our brightest young officers who was a governor in Borno at that time told us that there was a place (Sambisa) where they could be trained.

“I feel bad that it has been taken over if there is anything like that; but I also feel vindicated. If the guards were there doing their training it wouldn’t have been possible to take over the forest” he said.

Good news from Falgore forest

In Kano the Falgore Forest is located about 150 kilometres from the city and cuts across three local governments of Tudun Wada Doguwa and Sumaila.

Falgore Game Reserve started as Kogin Kano forest reserve which was developed during the British colonial period in 1940s. The forest reserve was only upgraded into a game reserve in the 1960s and subsequently called Falgore Game Reserve.

Kano State is one of the few states in northern Nigeria not seriously affected by terror attacks although it shares boundaries with Katsina and Kaduna states both heavily affected by banditry.

However some remote villages in the state have recorded cases of kidnapping and other crimes in recent times.

The forest was becoming a den of criminals but the collaboration between the Nigerian Army and the Kano State government halted it. It has been converted to a military training ground to forestall criminal activities.

Recently about 500 million was set aside for the construction of the first phase of the military training facility at the forest.

Dajin Rugu gradually becoming bandits’s den

Dajin Rugu is a thick forest that stretches from Birnin Gwari in Kaduna State through parts of Katsina State and ending in Zamfara State.

Twenty years ago the famous Dajin Rugu was home to wild animals such as lions elephants hyenas gorillas and zebras among other wild animals. The forest was also famous for its rivers dams and rocks which make the forest a beautiful tourist site.

However a recent visit to Rugu forest by our reporter shows that this famous tourist attraction is diminishing due to neglect by the government. There are no access roads to the forest not to talk of the roads leading to tourist attraction sites within the forest.

The only road leading to Rugu forest from Tambari village is also dilapidated causing major difficulties to motorists and visitors into the forest.

It was observed that aside from being a haven for wild animals Dajin Rugu has turned into a camp for Fulani cattle herders thieves and armed robbers. Even the Fulani Daily Trust Saturday observed are currently migrating from Rugu with their herds because of lack of water and grass for the animals.

“During the dry season it is difficult to find food and water for our cows or for us to drink and cook our food” said Malam Adamu Dantsoho a herdsman who was born in the forest.

Dantsoho told Daily Trust that “I was born in the forest and I am still living there with my family and animals. But I have resolved to migrate from the forest to Tiga Area in Kano State because I learnt there is water and grass over there.

Daily Trust Saturday gathered that the only surviving dam in Rugu as of now is Kirya dam. On a daily basis about 3000 animals go to quench their thirst at the dam. Adamu Dantsoho said “As they drink we also drink too. I mean we drink from the same pond with our animals including dogs snakes and monkeys.”

Like Yankari and Falgore Game Reserves in Bauchi and Kano states respectively Dajin Rugu is a potential tourist site which if utilized can attract tourists not only from within Nigeria but from all over the world.

The forest is blessed with dams and rocks as well. Kurgyel Mai-Magurzai Kangurtsa Yi-Naka Tsamre Kirya and Zobe were among the popular rivers and dams in Rugu forest while Kauni Rugu and Dagwarwa are the famous rocks that beautify Dajin Rugu. This is in addition to various hills and smaller rocks situated at different locations within the forest.

Recover territory to end insecurity – Ex-DSS director

A former Assistant Director of the Department of State Services (DSS) Dennis Amachree urged the Federal Government to comb the forests and remove criminal elements from there.

In an interview he also called on the villagers not to confront the bandits and other criminal elements occupying the ungoverned spaces but ensure they provide necessary information to the government and military.

He insisted that negotiating with criminals living in the forests or paying them ransom would only compound Nigeria’s woes.

He said: “Those places are called ungoverned places and what we need to do is for the government to comb those places. The military is already involved in internal security so the military should go there and rout them out.

“There is no need to negotiate with them; there is no need to pay them ransom. We know where they are then we should remove them immediately. We hear that they are not even Nigerians. That is better. They should throw all the military men there and remove them by force. That is the only way out.

“Honestly our country will be safer if these guys are routed out of the forests” he said.

Speaking on the implications of criminals’ presence in those forests the former DSS official noted that allowing those criminals in the forests would accommodate more foreign criminals who might at the end destabilise the country.

According to him “The implication of bandits’ presence is that these ungoverned spaces have been occupied by foreigners who are giving us problems. This led to a spike in kidnapping rape and other criminalities. The government should just go there and remove them.

“What locals can do is to always give information to government. They are not going to fight them. Any available information they have they should try to give government.”

However troops have gained access into the Alagarno forest which was hitherto infested by insurgents a soldier said adding that “a super camp which served as an operational base was built by the army there.”

He further said the troops have also gained access into the Sambisa National Park and driven away insurgents from various locations and apprehended many.",,,

Ever since the U.S. launched the first armed drone strike in 2001 these machines have been a constant presence on the battlefields across the world and things will probably get even more intense.

For instance Northrop Grumman announced earlier this month it has received an initial operating capability (IOC) declaration from Supreme Allied Commander Europe for the RQ-4D Phoenix Global Hawk drone. The machine will become part of the so-called NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) force after it became the first large drone to get the military type certification from the Italian Directorate of Aeronautical Armaments and Airworthiness (DAAA).AGS is made up of five aircraft plus the supporting ground facilities and sensors. It will operate from the Sigonella Air Base in Italy and it will be tasked with deploying drones in support of ground troops and civilian populations border control crisis management and humanitarian assistance.“NATO AGS will help the Alliance with persistent regional defense and deterrence” said in a statement Jane Bishop vice president and general manager autonomous systems Northrop Grumman.“The commitment of the entire AGS team partnership – both government and industry – has shown incredible dedication working across cultures time zones and languages all aiming toward one goal – providing the Alliance with this critical capability.”The RQ-4D Phoenix Global Hawk first flew in 1998. It is powered by a Rolls-Royce turbofan engine that can take it to speed of 357 mph (575 kph). The thing can go for extreme distances in a single outing as its range is rated at 10112 miles (16113 km) being capable of staying in the air 32 hours at a time.Because it is a surveillance aircraft it lacks strike capabilities but can aid other military hardware by helping with targeting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpcmdpbmlhYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvb24tdGhlLW1vdmUtMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,On the move,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/on-the-move-2/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpcmdpbmlhYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvb24tdGhlLW1vdmUtMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL2RhaWx5cHJvZ3Jlc3MuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYnVzaW5lc3Mvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLXByb3Bvc2VkLWZvci11LXMtMjktYWNyb3NzLWZyb20td2FsbWFydC9hcnRpY2xlX2FhYWI4NGIwLTc5ZWEtMTFlYi1hMzM1LTlmODkxZTM0N2FhYy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks proposed for U.S. 29 across from Walmart,"Another Starbucks could be coming to Albemarle County.

A developer is proposing to build a Starbucks with a drive-thru on U.S. 29 across from Walmart.

The county’s Architectural Review Board will review the initial site plan for the project at its virtual meeting Monday.

There is currently an office building on the site which is about 0.7 acres. Early last year the property at 2231 Seminole Lane was rezoned from Commercial Office to Highway Commercial but a proposed use for the property was not given at the time.

County staffers recommended that the ARB which regulates the design of development along entrance corridors recommends approval of the initial site plan without conditions. Staff also recommended a number of revisions to the proposed plan before any final approvals including more specifics about the building and landscaping.

Currently Starbucks locations at Pantops Fifth Street and the former Wells Fargo bank off U.S. 29 near Best Buy also have drive-thrus.

Last year the county’s ARB also approved changes to the 29th Place shopping center Starbucks at the intersection of U.S. 29 and Berkmar Drive. The store will be relocated to the other end of the building and a drive-thru will be added.

The ARB has a full agenda Monday including six regular review items and a work session.

In addition to the Starbucks the board also will review changes to the Charlottesville Albemarle Airport’s parking lot elevator and stairs an auto dealership on the corner of Rio Road and U.S. 29 and changes to a Holiday Inn Express on Pantops.

It also will review an initial site plan for an ExtraSpace storage facility in Hollymead along Worth Crossing. It will be visible from U.S. 29 behind the Exxon gas station.

The Board of Supervisors in December approved changes to the site to allow for additional square footage beyond what was approved in the original rezoning as well as different building footprint locations.

County staff recommended the ARB recommend approval of the initial site plan without conditions. Staff also recommended a number of revisions to the proposed plan before any final approvals including that the applicant provides renderings of the building from both directions on U.S. 29 with and without landscaping.

The ARB will also have a work session about architectural revisions to a proposed Sheetz at the intersection of Airport Road and U.S. 29.

The meeting is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. on Zoom.

NASA's newest technology demonstration which launched on Northrop Grumman's 15th commercial resupply services mission is designed to improve water recycling on the International Space Station and boost the efficiency of water recycling for the Artemis generation.

The space station's regenerative life support hardware called the Environmental Control and Life Support System provides clean air and water for station crews. A new Brine Processor Assembly (BPA) will be tied into the system and allow more water to be recovered from crew urine. This new piece of technology ultimately will help scientists build better systems that can be used on future Moon and Mars missions and habitats.

ECLSS has enabled more crew members to live aboard the station for longer expeditions with fewer resource shipments. The key components of the regenerative ECLSS are the Water Recovery System and the Air Revitalization System.

The Air Revitalization System cleans the circulating cabin air by removing any contaminants including carbon dioxide and produces oxygen and replaces any oxygen lost to airlock depressurization and experimental use.

The Water Recovery System provides clean water for astronaut use by recycling urine cabin humidity condensate from crew sweat respiration and hygiene and water recovered from the Air Revitalization System. The Urine Processor Assembly part of the Water Recovery System was designed for 85% water recovery from crew urine and has been improved over the last year to now recover 87% because of analysis that showed there was still a margin against calcium sulfate precipitation. ""That distillate is combined with the condensate and processed through the Water Processing Assembly (WPA) which recovers 100% of the water it processes"" says Layne Carter International Space Station Water Subsystem Manager at Marshall. ""As a result our overall water recovery is about 93.5%.""

Astronaut crews on long-duration exploration missions will need ECLSS systems to recover closer to 98% of the water they bring along at the start of their journeys.

""To leave low-Earth orbit and enable long-duration exploration far from Earth we need to close the water loop"" says Caitlin Meyer deputy project manager for Advanced Exploration Systems Life Support Systems at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. ""Current urine water recovery systems utilize distillation which produces a brine. The brine processor will accept that water-containing effluent and extract the remaining water.""

Once installed in the station's Tranquility module the BPA will pump brine from the UPA's Advanced Recycle Filter Tank Assembly into a dual-membrane bladder. This bladder will pass water vapor selectively into the cabin atmosphere. Once in the atmosphere the water will be pulled from the air using another part of the Water Recovery System the condensing heat exchanger. The heat exchanger will send that moisture back into the Water Processing Assembly where it will be converted back into drinking water. The BPA's used bladders containing the resulting dried brine will be removed and stored and eventually discarded or returned to Earth for study.

""With this new brine processor assembly we'll recover additional water from the urine brine produced by the Urine Processor such that the overall water recovery is closer to 98%"" says Carter.

""With the new BPA and the Universal Waste Management System launched on the prior Northrop Grumman resupply flight the evolution of the ISS Water Recovery System into the Exploration Water Recovery System is nearly complete"" said Laura Shaw International Space Station Exploration ECLSS manager. ""We will have some additional component upgrades to improve reliability but now have all the assemblies in place. This is a big milestone for the Exploration ECLSS.""

The brine processor ultimately will help enable long-duration crewed exploration missions and reduce the need for water resupply from Earth. The technology demonstration's ability to improve the recovery of water from urine brine also has potential use on Earth in harsh and remote settings with limited access to water.

Paragon Space Development Corporation of Tucson Arizona developed this technology demonstration in cooperation with NASA's Johnson and Marshall Space Flight Centers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdWNzZGd1YXJkaWFuLm9yZy8yMDIxLzAyLzI4L3doeS1pcy10aGUtbWlsaXRhcnktZnVuZGluZy1zY2llbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why is the Military funding Science? – The UCSD Guardian,"Government entities are investing into research at UC San Diego. With the military entering the fray scientists face the ethical ramifications of their research eventually being militarized.

Scientific research touches some part of every person’s life. You are reading this article on some screen right now on a device with that plugs into a wall to “charge.” Science has evolved so rapidly that it would be impossible to explain that last sentence to someone who lived in the 18th century. Even excluding physical innovation the impact of research pervades our culture constantly reshaping the knowledge humanity generally regards as proven facts.

Science for example has revolutionized how mental health is viewed and treated today in the United States compared to 65 years ago when people were institutionalized for any hint of neurodivergence.

Due in part to advances in psychology experts have changed what they categorize as mental illness and helped develop new more constructive types of therapy. Further understanding of neurology has changed how mental illness is described and treated. Not to mention understanding the physical causes of mental illness has helped reduce the stigma around mental health as a whole.

Without research into chemistry and biology scientists could not develop safe and effective medications to treat mental illness.

UC San Diego is world-renowned for its scientific research. In 2019 UCSD took in $1.35 billion in research funding. Of that total $101 million came from the Department of Defense.

This huge influx of resources opens the door for the development of innovations that improve people’s lives. Yet in all the eagerness to push the limits of scientific achievement questions about the influence of the sponsors of research have gone unanswered.

Charles Thorpe a professor of the sociology of science and technology at UCSD provided some insight into the repercussions of increased military funding of scientific research. He drew attention to the practical difficulties in truly parsing out the influences of military spending on research. Authors of press releases about research tend to word the statements in ways that can be difficult for individuals outside the discipline to understand and often the practical uses of such research are not clearly stated.

To explain this phenomenon Thorpe borrowed a term from Jeff Schmidt a physicist who coined the phrase “social significance concealment game.”

Schmidt used the phrase to evaluate the purpose of the sometimes very technical but also vague language scientists use to explain their research. Schmidt noted that this strategy was especially utilized by scientists involved in potentially controversial research like weapons development.

They can describe all the minute details of their research in cell imagining and the reader still might not know if they specialize in botany or immunology.

Possibly scientists are not at liberty to say what they are actually researching but the unclear nature of their language could also be intentional. With the lack of transparency abstracts describing projects directly related to the development of weapons will read the same as research into coral life cycles.

“Scientists involved in weapons research conceal from their academic colleagues and students and from the public the actual military nature of that research giving descriptions of it that sound like it’s basic blue skies academic research when in fact when you read an account of it by the military agency that funds the research you see its real social purpose which is the production of weapons” Thorpe told the UCSD Guardian.

If the true aim of research is concealed to a certain extent more context clues can help discern what research has been militarized. One helpful indicator of the true uses of research is who chooses to foot the bill. According to their website The Department of Defense’s mission is to “provide the military forces needed to deter war and ensure our nation’s security.” Yet the connection between this aim and all of the research they fund is not always abundantly clear.

For example a neurobiology research project focusing on cell morphology received a grant in the form of research equipment from the Department of Defense. In a bulletin from UCSD Shelley Halpain a professor of neurobiology was celebrated as a recipient of a (DURIP) award from the Department of Defense.

“She and her colleagues are using advanced fluorescence microscopy to measure energy demand within single synapses which are less than one femtoliter (500 times smaller than a single grain of salt) in volume” UCSD wrote in the bulletin. “Their findings may help inform the design of efficient bio-inspired information processing systems.”

The description provided by UCSD relayed few specifics or details that would relay the applications of this research. This could be an example of the “social significance concealment game” at work. There are details given about the method of study fluorescence microscopy and how refined the procedure is but what could be meant by “bio-inspired information processing systems” is not clarified.

The person best suited to interpret this announcement is one of the principal researchers. Halpain explained that her research seeks to understand neuroplasticity: the brain’s ability to modify change and adapt both structure and function. While the real world impact of her research is not clearly stated in the description above the positive effects it could have on individuals’ lives is profound.

“Understanding what causes neurons’ synapses to form and what causes them to become destabilized is very fundamental to lots of brain diseases and it’s not just limited to the degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s but there’s you know more and more evidence that that synapse perturbations are also fundamental to mental disorders like autism and to psychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder” Halpain told the Guardian.

For individuals who need better treatment options for their bipolar disorder or whose cognition continues to rapidly deteriorate as a result of their Alzhimer’s there may be no cost that could outweigh the benefit of this research. But for those of us who are not currently impacted by this research the potential for it’s weaponization might be a more pressing concern.

Halpain could only speculate on why the military might be interested in this particular research.

“So they [the DOD] expressed an interest in understanding how nervous systems how it is that nervous systems are able to use their very limited energy supplies in an efficient way to store vast amounts of information” Haplin said. “Now why might the military be interested in this question? Well I am not an expert. I don’t really do like you know weapons research or you know that type of stuff but you can imagine that a lot of advances in technology require that computer systems operate extremely efficiently and you can make computers more powerful and and tinier.”

This neurobiology research along with its potential medical uses could aid the Department of Defense in creating more sophisticated technology modeled after biology. But has the Department of Defense’s involvement in this research influenced its goals or approach? Fortunately checks and balances are in place to prevent research aims from being moved in a certain direction due to pressure from the organization funding them.

At UCSD there is an entire office for addressing conflicts of interest with the goal of maintaining research integrity. That way for example any entity with a vested interest in certain research producing a targeted outcome would be barred from directly influencing scientific procedures.

Additionally there are strict guidelines for the manner in which funding is awarded and the parameters for both the organization providing capital and the research group. Halpain shed some light on this complicated and somewhat rigid system.

“A grant application can be structured to be like we’re partnering with you in this research or they can be structured as we want to give you the money we’re not going to have any influence whatsoever in your research right and that’s those sort of things have to be clear” Haplin said.“I think these days ethical rules are very well spelled out.”

Potentially instead of pressure being applied throughout research and development to generate a particular outcome influence may be exerted in terms of who gets funding in the first place which could account for why in her experience Halpain hasn’t observed the goals of a project being restructured over the course of development.

The Department of Defense allocates more of their research and development funds to technology defensive health and applied research sectors rather than basic research. Basic research seeks to expand knowledge in general and “does not have immediate commercial objectives.” With this allocation as an expression of its priorities the Department of Defense might be more likely to fund a project if they see utility in it.

While Halpain argued there exists enough separation between benefactor and researcher there are instances in the past where the motivation to receive funding has shifted the proposal of research projects.

Vera Kistiakowsky previously a physicist professor at MIT found that certain projects realigned their interests in order to serve one of the Department of Defense’s areas of interest..

“Interested researchers typically will [contact DoD program managers … These interactions will help potential proposers to decide whether their ideas coincide with DoD research needs” Vera Kistiakowsky found in her study. “In instances where ideas do not initially fit DoD programs the potential proposer may with information provided by a research administrator modify his or her approach to accommodate DoD needs.”

It is a mutually beneficial situation; the project receives funding and the DoD gains innovation.

But the sponsor-researcher dynamic opens the door for a potential conflict between what the student body believes is morally permissible and the real-world impact our research has.

The Jacob’s School of Engineering currently partners with those in the arms industry — including Raytheon Technologies and BAE Systems.

One of these past partnerships involved the Jacob’s School department of structural engineering working with Northrop Grumman a defense contractor to create the Hunter MQ-5B drone.

The drone that became the Hunter MQ-5b started out as a reconnaissance drone primarily focused on information collection and suited for operations like search and rescue. The Jacob’s School of Engineering helped turn it into a more efficient weapon.

“The Jacob’s School research here was aimed at increasing the payload – the amount of weight of a drone could carry” Thorpe told the Guardian. “So part of that research facilitated transforming that drone from a reconnaissance drone into a lethal arms drone that could carry laser-guided munitions.”

How Northrop Grumman spoke of the ultimate outcome of this project confirms this.

“The increased takeoff weight gives the U.S. Army the flexibility to add additional communications intelligence and weapon payloads to the Hunter expanding the capabilities of the warfighter” a lead engineer from the project representing Northrop Grumman said in a statement. “This flexibility will expand the aircraft’s multi-mission role on the battlefield.”

The Jacob’s School of Engineering through this partnership enabled this drone to carry additional weight making it better equipped for war. That research has come to fruition: “The US Army’s first lethal use of an armed drone was in Iraq in September 2007 when a Hunter MQ-5B dropped a Northrop Grumman laser-guided Viper Strike munition.”

Defendants of drone warfare argue that their ability to reduce human error ensures fewer civilian casualties and their use distances soldiers from conflict which reduces the loss of life to American troops. While the use of drones is continually debated UCSD was directly involved in developing one the Hunter MQ-5B that was put to use.

The Department of Defense is not the only government branch that contributes to militarized research. The Department of Energy oversees nuclear weapons development; there is a lot of overlap between what is necessary to build a nuclear power plant and a nuclear bomb.

Not even the Department of Agriculture can be underestimated. According to a study by Reeves and Voenky biological weapons research might have been conducted under the guise of agricultural genetic technology research.

No field of science is above investigation. Just like in biological research breakthroughs in chemistry could inform the refinement of chemical weapons.

Another complication is that the line between defensive and offensive research is sometimes blurred. A lot of the knowledge that would be needed to create a more efficient and deadly chemical or biological weapon is the same as would be needed to create a more effective anetidote to the same weapons.

For example botulinum toxin is one of the most lethal toxins in the world and therefore is a very likely agent to be used in biological warfare. But researching how to better treat botulism could also shed light on how to make more potent botulinum toxin.

These potential consequences of scientific research are complex. For one research that has genuine humanitarian uses can be harnessed by military agencies to make weapons. On top of that funding that pours in from these military-oriented agencies and companies may be shifting the focus of research — either directly by repositioning goals or indirectly by simply being selective about the projects that get funding.

That being said the benefits are self-evident. Without scientific research people would simply die if they stepped on a rusty nail and would not be able to fly home to visit their families for Thanksgiving. There would be no Roombas roaming or politicians tweeting. Without the green revolution most of us would have starved to death 30 years ago.

For the scientific knowledge on the brink of discovery today the investment from these agencies is undoubtedly crucial. Halpain explained that funding from the government not excluding the Department of Defense makes a lot of her research possible. Individuals or firms just don’t have the same capacity to take on the risk of investing in projects that could hit dead ends nor do they have the sheer volume of capital that the government does.

Still Thorpe argued that we have lost more innovations as a result of this funneling of research than we have gained.

“Military funding of science diverts science into narrowly militaristic purposes when it should be going into other spheres” Thorpe said.

The state of scientific research is left in a position without an obvious choice. The money that government agencies like the Department of Defense provide allows scientists to discover new phenomena which can have humanitarian and consumeristic value. The Department of Defense however will use some of those discoveries to further advance the military and perpetuate violence.

“And while still early in the booking cycle we are very encouraged and very pleased by the strong booking activity driven by pent up demand across all three brands for 2022 voyages. Volumes during January and February sequentially improved by over 40 percent from November and December 2020 and as an added bonus over 80 percent of these bookings where new cash bookings” said Frank Del Rio president and CEO speaking on the company’s fourth quarter and year-ending earnings call.

Del Rio stressed that pricing continues to be in line with pre-pandemic levels.

“For the first half of 2022 and for all of 2022 in fact our load factor is currently well ahead of pre-pandemic levels with pricing at each of our award-winning brands inline to up mid single digits when excluding the dilutive impact of future cruise certificates” he continued.

“Consumer appetite for global travel abode our 28 ships but 28 vessels is so strong that even with limited marketing investments we are yielding outside results and we are experiencing record demand with our launches for our future itinerary and global voyage collections” he said.

Later in the call Del Rio said that the ability to fill company ships at strong pricing was not among his concerns.

“And to be able to do what we’re doing in terms of the load factors and new bookings new cash bookings with the (minimal) amount of marketing that we’re doing with the travel agency system being less than 100 percent is truly remarkable. And again points to what we’ve been saying for years the resiliency of the consumer the resiliency of those who love to cruise. It’s a great value that hasn’t changed. And people are eager to get back to the high seas. There’s no question about that.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

No luck for us with ZLUDA yet but we'll keep trying.

zluda_with -- geekbench5 --compute CUDA

ZLUDA Geekbench performance vs OpenCL

Using a graphics processor or GPU for tasks beyond just rendering 3D graphics is how NVIDIA has made billions in the datacenter space. Of course NVIDIA's proprietary CUDA language and API have been exclusive to the company's GPUs since the beginning. There have been tools to port CUDA apps to widely-supported languages like OpenCL but even semi-automated tools like HIPCL require developer intervention. The latest library on the block however promises to run CUDA apps directly on Intel GPUs without any modifications. Sounds interesting right?The developers behind ZLUDA describe it as a drop-in replacement for CUDA on systems with Intel GPUs from the Skylake family and later. The newest release supports both Windows and Linux clients with 6th-generation (or higher) Core processors with integrated graphics. According to the developers ZLUDA should achieve near-native performance but its feature set is limited. At the present time only Geekbench is really running and prospective users are warned to not rely on it for any production-level software just yet.Using ZLUDA on Windows seems easy enough. We grabbed the latest release from the ZLUDA GitHub page and extracted it into Geekbench. The archive we downloaded includes a ""wrapper"" for any CUDA-enabled application to run it with the bundled CUDA DLL. Then just run the wrapper from the command line with the application as an argument. For example if we navigated to C:\Program Files (x86)\Geekbench 5\ in PowerShell and then ran this command:Geekbench tries to fire up. On our Tiger Lake notebook the app exits with an error in the CUDA libraries. That's not much joy for us on Windows right now but once we get some free time the hope is to give a more serious go at it. On Linux the ZLUDA developers have gotten benchmarks for a Core i5-8700K scoring 6333 with CUDA using the onboard UHD 630 graphics compared to 6482 in OpenCL. That's a slight downtick in performance but the aggregate number hides some interesting individual test scores.ZLUDA's GitHub also shows off some individual Geekbench compute scores and comparing OpenCL to this experimental CUDA implementation. While several benchmarks were significantly slower in ZLUDA the Stereo Matching test was around 50% faster using ZLUDA than it was on OpenCL. That seems pretty promising at first glance but the ReadMe file hints that there is hardware support for certain functions missing on all current Intel integrated GPUs. That might mean that some functions will just be slower in ZLUDA than they would be with OpenCL until the ZLUDA developers work out a way to speed things up. This warning is also illustrative that just because different versions of a test or benchmark outputs the same result doesn't mean that the test does it the same way on each API.It's definitely still early times for ZLUDA which is only seeing its second major release and still has a long way to go. However this will be an interesting project to watch. Intel's DG1 graphics cards are already released to OEMs and it seems like a more robust DG2 is right around the corner. While integrated graphics serve as an interesting proof of concept there's no doubt that Intel's discrete graphics are what ZLUDA's developers have in mind as the library matures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3djY2Z0ZWNoLmNvbS9udmlkaWFzLWNtcC1jcnlwdG8tbWluaW5nLWdwdXMtZGV0YWlsZWQtOTBoeC1iYXNlZC1vbi1hbXBlcmUtZ2ExMDItd2hpbGUtNTBoeC00MGh4LTMwaHgtYmFzZWQtb24tdHVyaW5nLWdwdXMv0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYXMtY21wLWNyeXB0by1taW5pbmctZ3B1cy1kZXRhaWxlZC05MGh4LWJhc2VkLW9uLWFtcGVyZS1nYTEwMi13aGlsZS01MGh4LTQwaHgtMzBoeC1iYXNlZC1vbi10dXJpbmctZ3B1cy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA’s CMP Crypto Mining GPUs Detailed – 90HX Based on Ampere GA102 While 50HX 40HX & 30HX Based on Turing GPUs,"The CMP series has been talked about a lot but no one really knows what the GPUs are actually based on aside from the official information that NVIDIA has posted. VideoCardz has just worked with a close source to confirm the specifications of the silicon on the CMP series cards and it looks like only the top variant will be featuring the Ampere architecture while the rest will be based on the Turing design.

NVIDIA's Dedicated Crypto Mining CMP 90HX GPU Based on Ampere GPU Rest Based on Turing GPU Architecture

The NVIDIA CMP (Crypto Mining Processor) series of GPUs were announced a few weeks back in a bid to tackle miners from grabbing GeForce gaming GPUs. Four GPU variants were announced with the sub-40 MH/s designs launching this quarter followed by the higher-end designs in Q2 2021. But we never got to know what the exact specifications of these GPUs were until now. In addition to the source Kopite7kimi also unveiled the exact GPU configurations for the CMP lineup which we have detailed below.

NVIDIA CMP 90HX With Ampere GPU

The NVIDIA CMP 90HX is the only card of the four to feature the Ampere Architecture based on Samsung's 8nm processor. The card is based on the PG132 board and has GA102-100 GPU. The board is actually the same as the board for the RTX 3080. On top of that it will also have 320W and 10GB but the memory type is unknown. It is likely that while the core specifications will be slightly different than the GeForce counterparts the memory configurations will remain the same but still that remains to be seen.

The NVIDIA CMP 90HX launches in Q2 2021 and will feature a price slightly lower than the GeForce RTX 3080 but will lack some essential features such as display connectors and most probably disabled GPU units which are not required for crypto mining which means they will end up being useless after their mining life has ended.

NVIDIA CMP 50HX 40HX 30HX With Turing GPUs

The NVIDIA CMP 30HX 40HX and 50HX are all based on the Turing architecture featuring 12nm silicon. The 50HX is based on the TU102 GPU-100 GPU and has a board very similar to the PG150 seen on the RTX 2080 Ti. It features 10GB of memory. The 40HX is based on the TU106-100 GPU and the PG161 board. It features 8GB of memory. The 30HX is based on the TU116-100 and PG161 board. It features 6GB of memory. The 30HX and 40HX have both been confirmed through the driver update. The 50HX and 90HX are both expected to launch in Q2 of this year.

The specifications of the NVIDIA CMP Turing mining card are also not going to be very comparable to their gaming counterparts and even those specifications aren't fully set in stone. The CMP cards can be expected to feature some form of nonfunctional or broken Tensor RT TMUs or ROPs. This doesn't allow for the cards to be gaming graphics cards but does allow them to be implemented in mining grade cards.

We receive a confirmation from a board partner that only one CMP model is based on Ampere.

We have a solid confirmation on the CMP series from our source. Only one out of four CMP HX graphics cards will feature Ampere architecture which means that only one card will utilize Samsung 8nm process. The CMP 90HX is based on a PG132 board (the same as RTX 3080) and it will feature GA102-100 GPU. This model will have 320W and 10GB by default. Our source has no information on the memory type yet nor how many CUDA cores does this chip has.

Meanwhile CMP 30HX 40HX and 50HX are all based on 12nm Turing architecture. We have already seen confirmation on 30HX and 40HX through the driver update. NVIDIA has already provided the support for these two mining cards while CMP 50HX and 90HX are not expected to launch till Q2. The 50HX is in fact based on TU102 GPU-100 GPU and the board design is a derivative of RTX 2080 Ti (PG150).

The name of new CMP mining GPUs reflects what we saw during the previous mining boom. Nearly 3 years ago NVIDIA launched its mining-oriented P104-100 and P106-100 models which were only available through the board partners.

NVIDIA mining cards do not offer the same specifications as their gaming counterparts. The specifications are not set in stone but we are trying to get more details on that. It is expected that mining GPUs have unfunctional or broken Tensor RT TMUs or ROPs. Which renders them unfit for the GeForce badge but still good enough to serve as a salve in a mining farm doing complex mathematical equations rewarded in cryptocurrency.

NVIDIA based mining cards lack display connectors and often offer the cheapest cooling solutions that the manufacturer has a surplus of.

Before the NASCAR Cup Series season began Christopher Bell had realistic goals for himself in his second season on the top circuit and first with Joe Gibbs Racing.

Compete for top-10 finishes early in the season and work toward challenging for victories down the stretch.

With a win in his second race of the year — at the Daytona road course — Bell’s modest goals went out the window.

Now the 26-year-old from Norman is locked into the playoffs with 24 races left in the regular season to build his experience in his second Cup season beginning with Sunday’s race at Homestead-Miami Speedway at 2:30 p.m. on Fox.

Q: You haven’t had a lot of experience on road courses over your career. What was the key to your victory?

A: Just seat time. Just being able to do it more and it seems like I’ve been able to get a little bit better at it. And I think my car was pretty fast too. I definitely wasn’t comfortable with road courses when I started my stock car career. We had one race a year in Canada in the Truck Series. The first time we went there I was OK but definitely needed to get better. By the second time I went there I was pretty competitive so I feel like I’ve gotten better over the course of the years and doing it more has helped out.

Did your first Cup win come a little quicker than you expected?

I would say yeah. I think if you asked anybody they wouldn’t have expected me to win at a road course on the second race of the year. But I was really fast on the road courses last year so I knew we could be competitive going in. I didn’t know we would win the race but I expected to be competitive and you just never know how things are gonna play out. I definitely think that going to Homestead and Vegas looking ahead at the races on the schedule there’s no reason why we aren’t gonna be competitive for the weeks to come. So I think we should have a shot at a couple more of these things.

Does the win change your approach or strategy for the rest of the season?

Yeah it helps us out because we’re able to be more aggressive and try and win more races now that we’re locked into the playoffs. Essentially we have 24 more races to try and get bonus points. That’s the only thing we’re focused on at the moment is getting those bonus points.

You’ve won a lot at every level but went through a winless season as a Cup rookie last year. Did that long layoff make this victory even sweeter?

Oh man absolutely. You know 2020 was the one of the lowest points of my career. That was extremely disheartening last year not running as good as everybody expected us to. So it’s good to be able to start off strong here in 2021.

What was this week like for you with all of your family and friends and fans in Oklahoma who were part of your growing up experience wanting to share in the excitement of your victory?

Yeah it’s been pretty hectic man. I’ve just been trying to take it all in and enjoy every minute of it. It’s something I’m gonna cherish for the rest of my life for sure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG93ZWVrLmNvbS9yYWNpbmcvbmFzY2FyL2EzNTY3MzY4Ni93aWxsaWFtLWJ5cm9uLW5hc2Nhci1uZXh0LWJpZy10aGluZy1ob21lc3RlYWQtY3VwLXNlcmllcy13aW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'You Better Get Used to It' or How Byron Is Ready to Break Out,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.autoweek.com/racing/nascar/a35673686/william-byron-nascar-next-big-thing-homestead-cup-series-win/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG93ZWVrLmNvbS9yYWNpbmcvbmFzY2FyL2EzNTY3MzY4Ni93aWxsaWFtLWJ5cm9uLW5hc2Nhci1uZXh0LWJpZy10aGluZy1ob21lc3RlYWQtY3VwLXNlcmllcy13aW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzI5MzM4NDktbmFzY2FyLWF0LWhvbWVzdGVhZC1taWFtaS0yMDIxLXJlc3VsdHMtd2lsbGlhbS1ieXJvbi1lYXJucy0ybmQtY2FyZWVyLXdpbtIBhQFodHRwczovL3N5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmJsZWFjaGVycmVwb3J0LmNvbS9hbXAvMjkzMzg0OS1uYXNjYXItYXQtaG9tZXN0ZWFkLW1pYW1pLTIwMjEtcmVzdWx0cy13aWxsaWFtLWJ5cm9uLWVhcm5zLTJuZC1jYXJlZXItd2luLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASCAR at Homestead-Miami 2021 Results: William Byron Earns 2nd Career Win,"Wilfredo Lee/Associated Press

William Byron coasted to a win in the Dixie Vodka 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway on Sunday.

The 23-year-old has all but sealed a place in the NASCAR Cup Series playoffs.

The 2.777-second gap between him and the next closest driver doesn't accurately portray how straightforward the result became. He slowed up a bit in the last few laps to play it safe and stay away from the wall.

Byron dominated the final stage and led 102 total laps. He showed impressive composure considering how little he had been tested in these kinds of circumstances.

With the No. 24 comfortably ahead of everybody else the battle for second place became the in-race storyline to follow. Kyle Larson Martin Truex Jr. and Tyler Reddick were only within a few car lengths of one another.

Reddick edged out Larson and Truex to finish runner-up for the second time in the NASCAR Cup Series.

Byron's win continues the trend of unexpected winners to open 2021 on the circuit. Michael McDowell earned his first-ever NASCAR Cup Series checkered flag in the Daytona 500 on Feb. 14 and Christopher Bell followed suit a week later on the Daytona Road Course.

Barring an unforeseen calamity down the stretch the result was telegraphed well before the end as Byron paced the field. Prior to his moving into first place nobody could enjoy a prolonged stretch of control. The lead changed hands on 19 occasions and nine drivers enjoyed the top spot.

Denny Hamlin claimed the pole earlier in the week but had to start from the back of the field after his team made unapproved adjustments to the No. 11 car.

Hamlin slowly worked his way up the leaderboard and nearly took the second stage. With Hamlin blocking off Truex Byron slid by on the inside.

Kyle Busch wrecked on the last lap of the Daytona 500 and labored to a 35th-place finish the next week in the O'Reilly Auto Parts 253 At Daytona. Busch's luck wasn't much better Sunday as he seemed to have trouble with the No. 18 car all race.

The 2020 season fell short of the two-time points champion's expectations as he ended the year tied for seventh with Truex. With three events in the books he must be wondering if a similarly frustrating campaign is in store.

Defending champion Chase Elliott didn't factor too much in the outcome winding up in 14th. His day could've gone much worse had the racing gods not smiled on him in the second stage.

The No. 9 car looked destined for the wall only for Elliott to regain control and remain on the track.

Busch and Elliott will be looking to atone for their showings when they're back behind the wheel.

The NASCAR Cup Series moves to Las Vegas Motor Speedway for the Pennzoil 400 presented by Jiffy Lube on March 7. Joey Logano was the victor in last year's event.",,,,,,

""I thought tonight was the complete game that we didn't play last night"" said ODU head coach Jeff Jones. ""We had terrific energy our defense was outstanding and we had a lot of different guys contribute at different times. So to finish the game in a positive manner I thought was a good sign and left us feeling good about ourselves after this series.""

Austin Trice went for 11 points and a game high eight rebounds. Also in double-figures for ODU was Malik Curry who scored 10 points in 13 minutes.

Old Dominion only turned the ball over eight times on Saturday night and led for a total of 34:46 of the total 40 minutes.

Over a 5:46 span ODU went on a 13-2 run to take an early 17-11 advantage in the first half. Old Dominion ended the opening frame outscoring the Blue Raiders 32-13 claiming a 36-22 lead heading into the locker rooms at halftime.

The Monarchs defense held Middle Tennessee to 9.1% (1-11) shooting from deep and 32.1% (9-28) in the opening 20 minutes. Malik Curry scored a half-high 10 points. For the half ODU held advantages for bench points (17-7) points in the paint (22-14) and fast break points (7-0).

Old Dominion will return to action for its final two games of the regular season when the Monarchs travel to Bowling Green Kentucky for a pair of games against Western Kentucky on Friday March 5 at 8 p.m. EST and Saturday March 6 at 5 p.m. EST.

The Hilltoppers currently sit in first place in the Conference USA East division while ODU sits alone in second place. Western Kentucky (15-5 8-2 C-USA) received votes in the most recent AP Top 25 poll.

Seniorjoined the Charlotte women's basketball 1000-point club but her exploits on Senior Day were not enough as the 49ers were unable to complete a second-half comeback in falling 71-68 to UTEP Saturday afternoon inside Halton Arena.The sharpshooter from Goose Creek South Carolina led all players with a season-best 24 points just four off her career high to become the 26th player in program history to tally at least 1000 career points. She is the eighth player under head coachto reach the milestone and the second this year joiningwho hit her mark Feb. 10 at Old Dominion.A big part of Linney's 24 points was a career-high tying five 3-pointers on seven attempts as she matched the Miners' team total. Her five triples raise her career total to 160 overtaking Peaches Harris (2001-04) for fourth on the school's all-time list. Three of the top four have played for Consuegra joining career leader(2014-17) and second-place Hillary Sigmon (2012-15).Linney also has 496 career attempts from behind the arc also fourth on the charts. Gregory and Sigmon rank one-two on that list with Traci Ray (2006-09) placing third in both categories.The incredible scoring run by fellow seniorcontinued with a 23-point contest as she converted 8-of-17 from the field including her lone 3-point attempt and 6-of-8 at the charity stripe. She has tallied at least 21 points in five-straight contests and has surpassed the 20-point plateau seven times.With Linney and Jett-Wilson each crossing the 20-point mark it marks the first time since Jett-Wilson's 34 and24 against Old Dominion Feb. 13 in which two Charlotte players netted at least 20 points in the same game. Saturday's performances were the only double-figure scoring games for the 49ers.The program's other senior finished her night with only four points but it came on 2-of-2 shooting. She hauled in a game-high tying six caroms to go along with two blocks and an assist.Charlotte connected on a season-best 53.2 percent of its field goals draining 25-of-47. Two of the quarters exceeded the 60.0 percent threshold including a 69.2 percent (9-of-13) effort in the third stanza and a 62.5 (5-of-8) performance in the opening period.Both teams finished with low numbers on the boards but the Niners still won the battle 27-to-24. It marked a season-low rebounding total for Charlotte and for its opponents.The 49ers held an eight-point cushion 59-51 with 7:30 to play but UTEP used an Isis Lopes trey – one of three she hit – a minute later to start a 14-0 run. Lopes finished off the surge with another 3-pointer and two free throws putting the visitors on top 65-59 with 3:37 remaining.With a limited roster Charlotte was still able to win several statistical categories including a 38-to-28 points-in-the-paint despite not having the services of one of its better post players.Charlotte: 9-8 8-4 C-USAUTEP: 16-7 13-5 C-USAThe 49ers return to Halton Arena to close out the regular season with a rescheduled series against Florida Atlantic.

Both the United States and China recognize this.

China’s designs on self-sufficiency explicitly include not only self-sufficiency but a pre-eminent role in semiconductor technology. Indeed its controversial “Made in China 2025” push included a goal to domestically produce 70 percent of the chips demanded by domestic firms. Such a drastic shift would certainly ripple through global markets but progress toward that lofty goal has proven elusive despite the billions poured into the industry. In fact only 6 percent of semiconductors used in 2020 by Chinese firms were made in China.

Meanwhile the United States has increasingly employed every incentive it can in order to bring semiconductor manufacturers to U.S. soil to avoid disruption to the industry amid supply chain shocks. Further Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer has explicitly stated that semiconductors are an industry in which the U.S. must “out-compete China.” Overall this suggests that the dynamics of Sino-American competition have not in fact been augmented significantly by the change in Oval Office occupant.

At the heart of the China-U.S. tug of war in tech is the island of Taiwan. This is especially so in the semiconductor industry as Taiwan’s largest company Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSMC) is perhaps the most critical firm in the entire industry. As such aspects of political and economic concentration risk have come to overlap and perhaps make microchips the catalyst for macro problems on the horizon between the world’s great powers.

Small Chips Big Impact

First it is important to stress the importance of semiconductors to the global economy. In this regard one can consider these chips as the oil upon which the economy of the future runs.

Beyond the existing demand for chips to power computers data centers that undergird modern cloud computing and the rapidly expanding gaming industry the future of self-driving vehicles artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) advancements all rely on the promise of how much these small chips can do. Almost anything that has technological capability relies in some way on semiconductors as reflected in the doubling of the overall industry’s revenue since 2009.

This dynamic is of course only amplified by ongoing transitions to 5G networks and many of the advancements in technology already noted express an ever-greater demand for semiconductors. Adding to the impact on supply and demand is the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic which has hurt global supply chain dynamics while also ramping up demand to accommodate an increasingly online economy.

As a result semiconductors are in short supply at a time when they are demanded most and by nations racing frantically for supremacy in the modern tech-defined economy.

Washington Weighs Its Options

The latest executive to open an examination of the issue as it reaches a crescendo is newly minted President Joe Biden. In a statement from the White House this week semiconductors figured into the categories most needing strategic review to prevent significant economic disruption as the U.S. continues in its post-COVID-19 recovery.

“The United States is the birthplace of this technology and has always been a leader in semiconductor development” the statement read. “However over the years we have underinvested in production—hurting our innovative edge—while other countries have learned from our example and increased their investments in the industry.”

The situation for semiconductors that the administration is likely to find does reflect underinvestment and a loss of first-mover advantage. The shift is based upon the failure of U.S. titans in the industry and years of outsourcing-based “fabless” business models which has wrought an overwhelming reliance on East Asian firms. In fact according to the Semiconductor Industry Association the U.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturing has steadily declined from 37 percent in 1990 to just 12 percent in February 2021.

The waning importance of U.S. manufacturers is partly a result of strategy wherein major semiconductor players like Qualcomm and Nvidia pursued the “fabless” model of manufacturing wherein only design aspects of chips are handled in-house and manufacturing is outsourced. As a result the manufacturers or foundries arose as a crucial part of the industry as it become unmoored from prior vertical integration. Perhaps the greatest winner in this dynamic was TSMC which quickly filled the market gap for foundries.

Accelerating its rise to the top was also the floundering of U.S. tech titan Intel whose delays in manufacturing of both 10 nanometer and 7 nm chips has left it well behind its Taiwanese competitor in manufacturing to the point of considering ceding the business itself to TSMC.

In order to assuage concerns on this front the Trump administration had fostered a stronger relationship with TSMC as part of its somewhat scattershot efforts in the China-U.S. trade war most notably an agreement to establish a $12 billion foundry in Arizona. In short much of the problems that arose in offshoring and losing an initial lead in the industry are now being remedied by luring international companies namely TSMC and Samsung to U.S. soil.

China’s Big Chase

China on the other hand has the arguably more arduous task of playing catch-up in an incredibly dynamic industry.

China’s national champion foundry Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) remains years behind its competitors in South Korea the United States and of course Taiwan. For reference SMIC has been unable to complete manufacture of 10 nm chips largely due to U.S. sanctions on specialized equipment export to the company. By comparison TSMC is already manufacturing 5 nm chips leading the bleeding edge of technological advancement perhaps a decade ahead of China’s best foundry.

The laggard nature of China’s semiconductor manufacturing is not for lack of effort either as investment in the industry from the government has been enormous. Additionally the concern over pilfering of intellectual property has been rampant not least with TSMC. In fact SMIC was charged with stealing trade secrets from TSMC at various times for the better part of a decade prior to the institution of certain equipment bans amidst Trump’s trade war.

Indeed the trade war had choked off critical components to China’s nascent semiconductor fabrication industry as key technology imports from the Netherlands-based ASML Holdings were cut off and crucially fabrication from TSMC was blocked for key firms such as Huawei and its HiSilicon fabless semiconductor subsidiary.

As shortages begin to significantly impact the industry the embargo on TSMC technology at the behest of U.S. sanctions is likely to exacerbate existing issues for Chinese firms amid the supply and demand dynamics. Likewise the United States is not likely to rescind such practices as the curb on Huawei’s hulking demand for chips helps alleviate the issue for U.S. and European firms by freeing capacity at firms like TSMC.

Trade War Grows Tenser

The issue that arises from this dynamic is rather distressingly one that could easily move from macroeconomic to geostrategic rather quickly.

China’s exercises in the South China Sea and subsequent scrambling of jets from Taipei are by no means a novel action. The frequency with which tensions escalate is adding to concerns that the situation may soon move beyond mere saber-rattling. At the very least it appears an option that Xi Jinping is not willing to rule out in pursuit of China’s foundational One China principle.



Of course it is not to say that the impetus behind increasing belligerence is semiconductors; rather the sector would be a high-profile casualty should such conflict occur. The expensive establishment of a $12 billion TSMC fab in Arizona and the EU’s mulling of a similar deal with TSMC at least in part motivated by politics suggests some are hedging against such risk.

Meanwhile in more likely scenarios Western firms will need to be vigilant against intellectual property theft joint ventures and other dubious trade tactics that will attempt to shore up China’s particularly precarious position in the economy amidst the technology equivalent of an oil shock. If anything there cannot be any complacency on the lead that yet remains for firms that remain outside of Beijing’s grip. There is certainly no complacency in the skyscrapers that dot Shenzhen nor indeed in the halls of Zhongnanhai itself.

Wuhan Hongxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (HSMC) an $18.5 billion company that aimed to become one of China’s leading high-tech chipmakers started dismissing employees as hopes for business resumption faded.

HSMC sent notices to all of its workers Friday company sources told Caixin. The move came more than one year after the project ground to a halt.

The company made clear that “there is no plan for production resumption” and told workers to submit their resignation applications before Feb. 28 one employee said. The person said the company hasn’t offered any compensation plan.

“I didn’t expect HSMC to fail so quickly as there have been speculation that companies such as Xiaomi Corp. or Huawei Technologies Co. might take over” one employee said.

Established in late 2017 with a planned investment of 128 billion yuan ($18.5 billion) HSMC was set to make logic chips using 14 nanometer and 7 nanometer technology and smaller which would have made it one of China’s most advanced manufacturers in the field according to the company website. HSMC was part of a boom in the Chinese mainland’s semiconductor industry as Beijing pushes for self-sufficiency in key tech areas affected by tensions with the U.S.

HSMC originally received strong backing from the Wuhan government in central China. But the project never proceeded as expected and was shaken by a series of troubles since last year. In November 2019 a local court suspended HSMC’s right to use the land where it was building a factory amid a dispute with one of the engineering firms involved.

A person close to the project said HSMC started experiencing a cash crunch in June 2020 with difficulty paying suppliers.

In July last year a government report found that HSMC was suffering from a large funding shortfall that could bring it to halt at any time. According to the report the venture had yet to receive the lion’s share of its planned funding or 112.3 billion yuan of the originally planned 128 billion yuan.

According to the report the project essentially ground to a halt amid the unlikely prospect of getting any of its remaining funding anytime soon.

A Caixin investigation also found that the plant’s technological capacity was largely exaggerated. The local government said HSMC owns an advanced lithography machine produced by the Dutch company ASML Holding NV that is the most cutting-edge piece of equipment ever imported into China. But analysts said the information was misleading as the HSMC gear is just one of several imported machines capable of producing 7 nanometer chips in China.

An HSMC executive told Caixin in February that the local government had taken over the project and “was hoping to revive it.”

A person close to the Wuhan government said authorities considered inviting new investors into HSMC while adjusting the project plan. But raising enough funding was a challenge.

For years chip industry executives and U.S. government officials have been concerned about the slow drift of costly chip factories to Taiwan and Korea. While major American companies such as Qualcomm Inc. and Nvidia Corp. dominate their fields they depend on factories abroad to build the chips they design.

As tensions with China heated up last year U.S. lawmakers authorized manufacturing subsidies as part of an annual military spending bill due to concerns that depending on foreign factories for advanced chips posed national security risks. Yet funding for the subsidies was not guaranteed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMTY5NDMzMjIwMzMwOTA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Laser-induced digital oxidation for copper-based flexible photodetectors,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169433220330907 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMTY5NDMzMjIwMzMwOTA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL0J1c2luZXNzL1RlY2hub2xvZ3kvRGlhbW9uZC1iYXR0ZXJpZXMtcHJvbWlzZS10by1wb3dlci1zcGFjZS1wcm9iZXMtZm9yLTEwMC15ZWFyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Diamond batteries promise to power space probes for 100 years,"TOKYO -- Diamond batteries capable of generating electricity for 100 years are being considered for use in space probes and in equipment for underground mining.

Not anymore. Northwell administrators fear that hearing that song will remind employees of the early days of the crisis and how long it has dragged on. Hospital staff developed mental emotional and physical exhaustion as they treated a barrage of patients in the one-time epicenter of the pandemic that has claimed the lives of 20 of their colleagues.

Executives at the health care provider are doing whatever they can to keep employees strong as they enter year two of treating patients with the coronavirus.

""We have to be very careful about triggers"" says Maxine Cenac Carrington deputy chief human resources officer at Northwell which includes 19 hospitals in the New York City metro area. ""How do we support them to keep going when they're saying 'How do I get my heart and mind ready to do this again?' ""

COVID-19 fatigue is a crucial problem for organizations with front-line workers. Yet trying keep workers motivated resilient and productive after a year of havoc that has infected every corner of their lives bedevils employers.





Stress Abounds



Seventy percent of people in the global workforce say this has been the most stressful 12 months of their lives with 78 percent saying their mental health has been affected according to a study by Oracle Corp. an Austin Texas-based software company and Workplace Intelligence a Boston-based consulting firm. More than 80 percent of U.S. workers claim that they're stressed. It has been an especially harrowing time for working mothers who are trying to fulfill their work obligations while acting as de facto teachers cooks and housecleaners. Multiple studies have shown that women are carrying more of the domestic burden than their male counterparts.



""Fear uncertainty loneliness isolation disruption—people feel like life is out of control"" says Darcy Gruttadaro director of the Center for Workplace Mental Health at the American Psychiatric Association Foundation in Washington D.C. ""Employers are aware. They're calling us left and right [for advice].""



Burnout Anxiety and Depression



The problem is getting worse. In a survey taken in December by Limeade a Bellevue Wash.-based software company nearly 75 percent of workers said they were burned out. That's up from 42 percent at the beginning of the year.

In a separate survey just over 40 percent of respondents said they had experienced at least one mental or behavioral health issue over the summer according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Anxiety and depression were the most common problems and they are on the rise. Twenty-six percent of people reported symptoms of anxiety disorder more than three times the 8 percent who said they had experienced such symptoms in the second quarter of 2019. The number of people with depressive disorder symptoms quadrupled with one-quarter of individuals claiming to have experienced them up from 6.5 percent in 2019.

""These numbers are alarmingly high"" Gruttadaro says.









Organizations Offer Assistance

Gruttadaro says employers are trying multiple strategies to help employees cope. Those approaches include:

Increasing the number of free counseling sessions offered or waiving co-payments for therapy.

Providing free access to mindfulness and meditation training.

Checking in regularly with employees to ask about their well-being.

Teaching managers to spot troubled employees and initiate conversations to offer help.

Devising communication strategies to remind staff of benefits such as employee assistance programs and encouraging people to use them.

Bolstering child care and elder care benefits.

Gruttadaro says it's difficult to gauge the strategies' effectiveness because so many people are reporting that they're struggling with issues such as anxiety stress and fatigue. ""This is going to be studied for years to come"" she says.







Employees Want More

Despite some companies' best efforts workers say they need more. Half of respondents to the Oracle and Workplace Intelligence study said their companies added mental health services or support as benefits as a result of the pandemic. Still 76 percent say their company should be doing more.

Even companies that have strived to protect their employees from the mental and physical effects of the pandemic are seeing signs of fatigue. Phoenix-based Sprouts Farmers Market enhanced cleaning protocols at its grocery stores gave employees up to an additional 28 sick days distributed bonuses regularly communicated about its mental health benefits and offered loans and grants to staff with financial difficulties.

Still entire departments have either been infected or needed to quarantine after attending noncompany events together says Alisha M. Cheek Sprouts' regional HR advisor for Nevada and Utah. She has learned after the fact that people came to work when they weren't feeling well. At least one employee failed to report she was getting a COVID-19 test even though workers were instructed to inform management.

""She said 'I didn't know I was supposed to tell you' even though we've told them five million times"" Cheek says. ""I think after five million times you just stop listening.""

Cheek wonders what else she can do to drive home the safety message and worries that a new approach might cause confusion. ""You want to be consistent"" she says.



Jake Krug director of total rewards for Sprouts which operates about 370 stores nationally says there has been a shift in employees' attitudes. At the beginning workers were scared and confused by the new disease. ""Now they're tired of worrying about it"" he says. ""They just want it to be done.""











The end of the pandemic is getting closer but the crisis is far from over. Experts predict that the U.S. won't return to any kind of normalcy until at least early fall leaving leaders to devise new ways to protect employees against burnout anxiety and other conditions—ironic given that many organizations are better prepared to handle the virus's next wave after everything they learned from tackling the first one.

For example Northwell Health already hired traveling nurses to fill in for staff. In addition there are permanent centers where staff can go for quiet time and rest. All the information about behavioral health is in one place making it easier for employees to find. Managers have been trained to look for signs of mental health issues.

""Logistically we're much better prepared"" Carrington says. Yet she adds the search continues for different ways to help employees address the intense situation they face. The hospital has been learning how the military helps its members strengthen their psychological resolve when they must go back into battle after a stretch of civilian life.

Carrington is worried about how staff will handle another surge. She says some are optimistic about the efficacy of available vaccines. Others have expressed anger about having to relive a crisis that might have been prevented if more people had listened to experts and followed safety protocols.

""For some people the second time could be harder"" says Dr. Heidi Levine an emergency room physician and director of wellness and patient experience at South Shore University Hospital part of the Northwell network. ""Their emotions are already raised so this could impact them more.""

Levine also says the slowdown in cases during the summer and fall gave staff an opportunity to regroup though she's not counting on that to get them through the months ahead. While she praises South Shore's efforts to help the staff cope Levine is starting a support group for the emergency room staff that also borrows strategies from the battlefield. ""There are multiple studies that show physicians will take support from a peer before anywhere else"" she says.







Reluctance to Come Forward

Zoom meeting fatigue is common across professions and many companies have started to limit virtual gatherings especially happy hours and other ""fun"" activities designed to lift employees' spirits. Avionos a Chicago-based digital marketing company stopped hosting such events last year as lethargy set in though it still uses Zoom for business meetings. To stay connected employees have been divided into smaller groups giving them the freedom to decide how and when to connect.

Gibson Smith Avionos' chief people officer says calling employees to chat is one of the most effective ways to determine employees' mental health status. He says he calls about two employees a day to check in. Managers also regularly touch base with their teams for conversations that transcend work-related topics.

""Ask direct questions"" Smith advises. ""Ask if they're struggling. Direct contact is paramount.""

Some employees won't be forthcoming about their issues fearing they might appear weak or unprofessional.





Erin Hernandez has had two new bosses since the pandemic began and didn't feel comfortable talking about her anxiety with people she barely knew. ""There's an underlying concern about getting a new manager who doesn't know me or my work"" says the Atlanta resident who is a data analyst for U.K.-based InterContinental Hotels Group. ""Developing a rapport virtually is already a challenge.""

She was especially worried because her work slipped early in the pandemic as she buckled under the pressure of working from home with her husband while caring for her 6-year-old daughter. That challenge was compounded by a 35 percent reduction in her family's earnings because of pay cuts and her husband's reduced work schedule.

""I was crying all the time"" Hernandez says. ""I'd wake up in the middle of the night and stay awake for hours thinking about whether someone [I know] is going to get sick [with COVID-19].""

Hernandez opted to see a therapist but says her options were limited through the insurance she receives from her husband's employer. She pays $150 a session out of pocket to see a therapist every other week.

""We're burning through dollars"" she says. ""But it's a lot to be with people 24/7 with no escape.""

Berkshire Hathaway earned $42.5 billion in 2020 but on Saturday CEO Warren Buffett admitted the conglomerate’s results for the year included a rare “mistake” — that cost the company $11 billion.

The Oracle of Omaha said in his annual letter to shareholders that his 2016 purchase of the company Precision Castparts went bad forcing Berkshire to “write down” or deduct nearly $11 billion from its bottom line last year.

Buffett labeled the write-down on the company “ugly.” And he blamed himself saying it was “almost entirely the quantification of a mistake I made in 2016.”

Berkshire based in Omaha Nebraska bought the aerospace manufacturing firm for $32 billion.

“I paid too much for the company” Buffett 90 wrote. “No one misled me in any way – I was simply too optimistic about PCC’s normalized profit potential.”

With airlines worldwide flying far less over the last year due to the pandemic the aerospace industry suffered from major disruption making 2020 a rough year for PCC.

“Last year my miscalculation was laid bare by adverse developments throughout the aerospace industry PCC’s most important source of customers” Buffett wrote.

Buffett stood his ground on the company and said he still believes over time it will earn good returns.

“I was wrong however in judging the average amount of future earnings and consequently wrong in my calculation of the proper price to pay for the business” Buffett said. “PCC is far from my first error of that sort. But it’s a big one.”

Berkshire Hathaway remains the most expensive stock on the market with its lightly traded “A” shares closing Friday at $364580 up about 6 percent since the start of the year. Its “B” shares which were split off several years ago to create a more easily traded stock settled Friday at $240.51 up about 7.5 percent this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9kYWxsYXMvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAyLzI3L2ZvcnRyZXNzLWludmVzdG1lbnQtZ3JvdXAtZGFsbGFzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exclusive: $50B global investment firm eyes new office in Dallas sources say - Dallas Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2021/02/27/fortress-investment-group-dallas.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9kYWxsYXMvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAyLzI3L2ZvcnRyZXNzLWludmVzdG1lbnQtZ3JvdXAtZGFsbGFzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

During 2020 none of the timber companies across the state such as PotlatchDeltic near Bemidji or Blandin in Grand Rapids had to be shut down because of the pandemic. Ray Higgins of the Minnesota Timber Producers Association said the facilities were deemed essential by state and federal governments.

However what those factories produced meant some did better than others. Building products Higgins said did well during the pandemic resulting in lumber mills to have a good year.

""Paper was a little bit different in that a lot of loggers in the northern area will take products to Grand Rapids for Blandin or PCA (Packaging Corp. of America) in International Falls"" Higgins said. ""With schools and offices being closed there was a lot less paper being used so that market was kind of soft. The Duluth mill closed own so that has affected folks from that standpoint.""

The Duluth mill was owned by Verso Corp. which also shut down a paper mill in Wisconsin over the summer.

""It really depended on the type of logger you are"" Higgins said. ""If you're a logger that brings products to West Fraser (near Solway) or PotlatchDeltic then you may not have seen a lot of impact but if you're one that brings products to PCA or Blandin you probably saw more of an affect.""

""There's definitely been some challenges out there"" said Minnesota DNR Timber Program Supervisor Jon Drimel. ""Our winter harvest season will likely see a lower harvest this year simply because Verso isn't there which had used about 60000 cords per year.""

A cord is a unit in the industry which means a harvested pile of wood with 4-foot long pieces stacked 4 feet high and 8 feet long containing 128 cubic feet of space.

Despite fluctuations though the timber industry remains one of the state's largest. According to the most recent numbers compiled by the DNR the timber and fuelwood industries harvested and used 2.8 million cords in 2018.

Based on early analysis of 2019 the harvest levels will likely be similar.

For 2017 the industry had an economic impact of $9.8 billion in direct shipments and $17.8 billion in total impacts making it the fifth largest manufacturing sector for the state. In terms of employment the industry supports 30500 direct jobs. Along with the economic impact the industry also has a $458 million effect in state and local taxes.

As of 2018 Minnesota was home to 329 sawmills and wood product plants as well as seven pulp and paper-related mills. There were also 328 wood kitchen cabinet and countertop manufacturers as well as 62 custom architectural woodwork shops.

The pellet potential

Many of the previously mentioned sawmills produce leftover wood material and residuals. Locally there's a desire to create a wood pellet plant which would use the leftover material for its products.

""The use of wood in industrial pellets is the largest growing market for wood in the world"" said Pete Aube a member of the Greater Bemidji Economic Development board and chair of the Minnesota Forest Resources Council. ""What's driving it is climate change and carbon as countries replace coal with lower-carbon emission wood. The industry uses two and a half million metric tons per year.""

A company in formation to make the product with plants in Bemidji and Grand Rapids is NorthStar Pellets . The proposed plants would each create about 45 jobs. Locally the plan is to build the plant near the PotlatchDeltic lumber mill about nine miles southeast of Bemidji off of U.S. Highway 2.

""It's a new company made from a consortium of investors"" Aube said. ""The parent company so to speak is a family out of International Falls who built the third largest pellet plant in the United States in Arkansas. They know the market and wanted to build plants in Minnesota.""

""The NorthStar Pellets plant came from a local need as there's a market for those residuals"" said Dave Hengel Greater Bemidji executive director. ""Last year it was a victim of COVID-19. There was a bill to provide a production incentive to help get the product to ports that had been going through the Legislature and then the pandemic hit. So we were put off for a year but we're back now.""

Because there's a big international market the legislation introduced last year was to provide dollars to the company to transport the product to a port in Vancouver for exporting to Asia . This session a new bill providing up to $3.75 million per year until June 2033 has been introduced.

The legislation is sponsored by District 11A Rep. Mike Sundin DFL-Esko and co-sponsored by District 5A Rep. Matt Bliss R-Pennington.

""It's an emerging market"" Bliss said. ""There are a lot of places overseas doing it and we have a lot of waste from the forest products in the area. I know we're in a tight budget but that's more than 40 jobs in those areas and we have the residual products already. Whether we can get it done in this budget cycle I'm not sure but we're going to try. I think it makes sense.""

A companion bill has been introduced in the Senate chamber by Districts 2 and 5 Sens. Paul Utke R-Park Rapids and Justin Eichorn R-Grand Rapids. Eichorn has also introduced a bill in the Senate to assist loggers who were impacted by market changes caused by the pandemic when obtaining permits.

""It would be a good thing"" Drimel said. ""It may not be direct wood cut from the forest but for a place like PotlatchDeltic they have a lot of leftover product and it becomes a cost for them. This would be an outlet for those residuals and make things more efficient.""

Should the pellet-related legislation go through Aube said the two plants could launch production in either late 2022 or early 2023.

Pellet operations aren't entirely new to the area though. In March 2020 the company Green Friendly Wood Pellets moved from New Richmond Wis. to Bagley. According to Sally Goossen the company owner the relocation was based on the abundance of sawdust in the area.

The company produces pellets used for bedding in horse stables BBQ cooking and heating systems. Goossen said this year the company can make up to 20000 tons of wood pellets.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Farrow’,"Dylan Farrow tweeted out a long plea today for understanding and empathy in the hours before tonight’s HBO docuseries Allen V. Farrow airs unseen footage of her.

In the episode a long-suppressed home video shows 7-year-old Dylan talking days after an alleged incident involving her father Woody Allen occurred. The timestamp indicates the date of Aug. 5 1992.

“We went into your room and we went into the attic” says the girl who is busy cutting paper with a pair of scissors. “Then he started telling me weird things. Then secretly he went into the attic….went behind me and touched my privates.”

Woody Allen has vigorously denied the allegations for decades and has called the docuseries “a hatchet job” in his own replies on it. He has not been charged with a crime in connection with the alleged abuse.

The camcorder operator was her mother Mia Farrow. The tape has never been seen publicly but was allegedly given to Dylan by her mother when she came of age. She says in the tweet today that she kept it hidden in her closet and hadn’t watched it until the documentary surfaced.

In today’s tweet Dylan Farrow admitted its first airing in public is causing her “anxiety” and “sleepless nights.” She asked for “empathy compassion and an open mind and heart.”

Paramount+ has rolled out the first trailer for The Real World Homecoming. In case you missed it MTV is getting the band back together after 30 years. All the original cast members from the New York season are back meaning fans get to see what Becky Blasband Andre Comeau Heather B. Gardner Julie Gentry Norman Korpi Eric Nies and Kevin Powell have been doing all these years since. It should be an interesting moment for Paramount+ as they see how much people want to watch these old reunions specials. ViacomCBS's successes with Jersey Shore and Teen Mom reunion specials prove there's always an appetite for revisiting old favorites. Funnily enough The Real World helped provide a template for those smash hits to thrive so there's no reason to believe people won't pack in for The Real World Homecoming.

When the show was announced President of MTV Entertainment Group Chris McCarthy said ""THE REAL WORLD is credited with creating the Reality TV genre and was one of the first series to tackle important and yet unrepresented topics such as LGBTQ race gender HIV/AIDS and religion. With Paramount+ being the home to so many global reality hit franchises it seems only fitting to bring back the franchise and cast that started it all for the launch.""

""Celebrated for its diverse casting and honest portrayal of contemporary young adulthood THE REAL WORLD illustrated a simple yet powerful idea of connecting people from widely divergent backgrounds to find common ground on the issues that divided them and generated conversations that reverberated loudly through media and youth culture.""

Multiple seasons of THE REAL WORLD will be available to stream on Paramount+.

The views belong to the writer.

Addis Ababa skyline.

Ethiopia has shifted its focus towards its main agenda of continuing its reform process while at the same time re-building the region of Tigray.

A group of reformists led by Dr. Abiy Ahmed came to the helm of power in April 2018 ushering in a new era of political and economic liberalization and opening up amidst growing grievances about political economic and social inequality.

On the political front crucial measures of reform have been taken to set a stage for long term political solutions to peoples’ grievances and demands. Right at the beginning of the reform process tens of thousands of prisoners were released while political opponents both at home and abroad that were prohibited to practice politics in the country were allowed to join the democratization process. Repressive laws such as the Anti-terror Law and the Civil Societies Organizations Law that undermined the human and democratic rights of citizens were reformed.

Furthermore institutions that are considered as the pillars of democracy such as the Election Board the Human Rights Commission and the justice system went through extensive reforms to ensure the well-functioning of the institutions and independence in carrying out their constitutional mandates.

In the economic front even if Ethiopia had been registering double-digit economic growth for a decade and half unemployment high inflation rate as well as growing income disparity have been the Achilles-heel of the Ethiopian economy causing severe macro-economic imbalances and debt stress. Thus the economic reform emphasis is among others on reducing youth unemployment creating a favorable environment for the private sector as well as addressing structural challenges to the economy.

To this end a Homegrown Economic Reform agenda was drawn which led to the newly unveiled 10-year economic growth plan (2020/21-2029/30). The plan envisages to sustain the country’s high growth trajectory and position Ethiopia as an African Beacon of Prosperity. The economic reform has achieved commendable results by restructuring the debt burden inviting the private sector to have a strong role in the economy and adding to the focus of the economy sectors such as ICT tourism and mining.

In our sub region the new leadership rekindled the already strong role that Ethiopia played in the Horn of Africa. In this regard the Prime Minister’s initiative to end the two decades old “no-war no-peace” situation with Eritrea has received paramount global applause and recognition due to its significant effect on the stabilization of the region. The world honored the Prime Minister’s initiative by crowning him with the most prestigious global award the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019.

It goes without saying that for any reform process to succeed it will require the active participation of key political economic and social actors in particular and the entire populace. It was in light of this fact that the new administration invited all political actors civil societies media organizations as well as every citizen to contribute their fair share in the process of reforming Ethiopia towards a democratically stable and prosperous state.

Challenges and opportunities

However the reform process was not a smooth ride. Frequent challenges were posed by some groups abusing the widely opened democratic process advocating for ultranationalism and creating superficial inter-communal strife.

One can also clearly discern how these groups that have lost the monopoly of power such as the TPLF leadership have become a stumbling block to the reform by instigating instability and hampering political dialogue.

Since the start of the reform process the Federal Government has been patient towards the transgression that has been perpetrated by some groups including the TPLF leaders. All the peaceful options availed for the TPLF leadership to engage in the reform process were rejected. However the TPLF group remained intransigent to any form of dialogue and negotiations. Instead it opted to continue destabilizing Ethiopia by training and financing various armed groups as well as directly executing attacks in various parts of the country.

Furthermore the group was determined to oppose any decision from the Federal Government institutions including the postponement of the 6th General Election in light of the looming COVID-19 pandemic. The group rather opted to hold illegal regional elections and declared the Federal Government illegitimate.

The climax to this intransigence came in the early morning of November 4 2020 when the criminal clique attacked the Ethiopian National Defense Forces that have been stationed in Tigray region since the end of the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea in 2000. Only then the Government ordered the Federal Defense Forces to defend themselves by all necessary means and restore law and order in the country. The main objectives of the law enforcement operation were to bring the perpetrators of this heinous attack to justice to set free the military generals and officers taken hostage by the group and to restore peace and stability to the region.

Now that the operation is finalized within a short period of time the Government of Ethiopia has shifted its focus towards its main agenda of continuing its reform process while at the same time re-building the region of Tigray.

The Government of Ethiopia is bringing the reform back on track by among others readying the nation for a national democratic election. The Election Board of Ethiopia has already announced the new date for national and regional election to take place in early June 2021. It is expected to be the most competitive and democratic election that the country has ever witnessed in its history. The European Union’s Election Observation Mission is also expected to observe these historic elections in Ethiopia.

Building democratic institutions and democratic culture certainly takes time; it also requires tireless and dedicated efforts. At this stage the government has been able to lay down the basis for greater respect for human rights and better standards of governance in Ethiopia. The determination to conduct the upcoming national election is none other than a clear demonstration of this fact. For this to take roots it requires the dedication of all political actors in Ethiopia.

Offering an alternative to more traditional payment methods PayPal came to prominence in the early 2000s as a facilitator of payments for online auction site eBay. Operating out of California in the United States the company continues to be one of the most innovative companies in the financial technology (fintech) sector. as demonstrated by their recent adoption of cryptocurrency into their ecosystem.

What is Paypal Holdings Inc (PYPL)?

PayPal was established in 1998 by two individuals with software engineering backgrounds and one lawyer by training. Originally known as Confinity Max Levchin Luke Nosek and Peter Thiel's new company was created in order to develop security software for handheld devices. After finding little success in this area they pivoted their strategy opting instead to build a digital wallet. This new product was launched almost a year later in late 1999. Soon after a merger took place between Confinity and X.com an online bank established by Elon Musk. Although the new firm originally kept the X.com name they opted to rebrand and clarify their product and service offerings. The company settled on the name PayPal in 2001 and the company eventually went public with an IPO in 2002.

Soon after the IPO eBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion. At this time the company's growth was impressing investors. Over 70% of eBay auctions accepted payments through PayPal and approximately 25% of closed auctions were using this innovative new payment solution. In just 8 years PayPal grew to over 100 million users across 190 territories offering services using 25 different currency options. In September 2014 PayPal opted to split from eBay and focus on other avenues for growth. Although the two continued to work closely together in early 2018 it was announced that PayPal would cease processing card payments for the online auction site for 2020. Today PayPal is very much a separate identity from its former owner.

Why does Paypal Holdings Inc (PYPL) Matter?

Despite coming into existence two decades ago Paypal's ability to keep up with change has allowed it to remain highly relevant in the modern era. This ability has allowed the company to now serve over 350 million customers and merchants in more than 200 territories. With the goal of making financial services cheaper more convenient and more secure they have continued to innovate. In 2019 a partnership with social media giants Instagram saw the launch of Checkout on Instagram allowing for secure checkouts using the Paypal platform within the application.

An early strategic acquisition came in 2013 when Paypal acquired startup Braintree for $800 million. As part of Braintree's portfolio Paypal acquired the technology behind Venmo a mobile service payment app that has now grown to over 40 million users. More recently the company made another major move purchasing shopping rewards platform company Honey in a deal worth over $4 billion their largest takeover to date. Honey is a money-saving tool that is popular among millennials with over 17 million active users. Paypal states that it plans to further integrate Honey into Paypal and Venmo platforms allowing the company to further grow its network and attract more merchants.

Paypal made a big splash in 2020 by announcing support for cryptocurrencies within their platform. All users would now be able to buy hold and sell cryptocurrencies from their Paypal accounts. This opened up the possibility to make transactions through their platform using popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum with payments made with crypto being converted into the national currency of the vendor's choice. This adoption will allow for a new and innovative way to make payments to any of the company's 26 million worldwide merchants. Originally offered just in the United States this service will expand to the Venmo platform and into international markets in 2021. While competitors such as Square's Cash App have already allowed crypto transactions for some time this move creates an opportunity for one of the largest vendor networks in the world to begin its integration into the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Paypal Holdings Inc (PYPL) Prospects

Despite the positive recent announcements and strategic moves a growing number of competitors are entering the space and could potentially threaten Paypals's position in the sector. Tech companies like Google Apple Amazon and Facebook all developing their own payment systems. In anticipation of increased competition Paypal has put considerable effort into building out core aspects of their business such as Venmo. As a result the mobile application has have evolved from simple P2P money transfer tools into a modern well-rounded financial services application. While peer to peer transfers within the app do not generate revenue newer features such as Instant Transfers and the Venmo Credit Card are avenues that have been monetized. With a 2019 survey confirming that over 20% of Americans have used Venmo over the past year there is a clear and present opportunity to leverage the monetization ability of the platform.

Paypal has also looked towards foreign marketplaces with the goal of expanding its user base. In 2019 Paypal acquired GoPay a payment platform operating in China. The move made Paypal the first foreign payment platform to operate in that country. Although the marketplace in China is dominated by domestic giants such as Alipay gaining access to one of the largest markets in the world was a step in the right direction. With careful planning and execution this acquisition has the potential to pay off in a huge way.

Despite this potential competition from giant technology firms PayPal has been at the top for more than 20 years. Their global network is massive and they remain very well placed to fend off any challenges in the coming years.

Summary

As the world continues to move away from more traditional payment methods such as cash and credit cards in favour of e-commerce and digital payments few companies are in as good of a position as Paypal is to capitalize. The company is continuing to innovate creating a broad and diverse payments ecosystem that engages both consumers and merchants.

Yet as we explain it is getting harder to sustain (see article). After a long period of ossification the industry is entering a dynamic phase. In America digital markets are shifting towards oligopolies in which second and third firms compete vigorously against the incumbent. The big tech firms are wrestling over customers and data: witness the confrontation between Apple and Facebook over who controls iPhone users’ privacy. And all across Asia digital conglomerates are battling it out. The industry’s emerging structure is a far cry from the open diffuse capitalism this newspaper supports. But an oligopoly of rivals is much better than a monopoly.

The gale of creative destruction used to blow hard in Silicon Valley. The list of firms toppled from dominance runs from Fairchild Semiconductor to Hewlett-Packard. Yet recently the giants have clung on: Apple and Microsoft are over 40 years old and Alphabet and Amazon over 20; even Facebook is 17 this month. What happened? Network and scale effects mean that size begets size while data can act as a barrier to entry. Search social media advertising e-commerce streaming ride-hailing delivery and payments all exhibit these alchemical properties to some degree. Having achieved supremacy in their chosen area many tech firms especially the big ones have shown little appetite to compete directly with each other in the past decade.

With her infectiously positive spirit you wouldn't be able to tell that she's battling a lot more than meets the eye.

""Kimber was diagnosed with ewings sarcoma at four years old"" said her Mom Caitlin. ""We did 9 months of chemo and she did a limb salvage surgery.""

On Monday which is exactly three years of Kimber being cancer free she was getting a scheduled CT scan of her leg to determine how well her bone was healing post surgery.

""That night her doctor called me and told me that they found a mass on her leg. They found that she also has a mass in each lung so we have a lot more testing to do. Hopefully it's not anywhere else"" Caitlin said.

So before the trips to the hospital and chemotherapy begin again the community is coming together for a second time to support the bright eyed 8-year-old.

""We're all just trying really really hard to give her kinda of one last good day while things are still normal if you will and just celebrate that she is going to beat this"" said Rachel Hall who has been a family friend well-before Kimber was born.

She is also the main reason that Kimber spent the morning getting her make-up professionally done and hair dyed pink blue and purple.

Hall is a hair stylist at Heirloom Salon in Virginia Beach and the salon agreed to open specially for Kimber.

""We're about to have to go through cancer again have to cut it off anyway so we might as well just dye it while I can while it's still here on my head"" Kimber said.

After the pampering came a small COVID-safe party where Kimber was most looking forward to eating pizza and playing with her friends.

Hall who mainly organized the day said ""since we put the word out we've had about 50 or so local businesses volunteer food sweets and gift certificates for the family for while she's going through chemo. The biggest takeaway is that today is going to be a really great day for her but this is not going away after today. This is something that this family is going to need support and help with over weeks and months.""

""[Accepting help was very difficult the first time around but] accepting help was going to do nothing but help her and giver her all of her dreams and at the end of the day that's what matters most to her dad and I is that she's happy"" said Caitlin. ""We wouldn't have been able to do it without the help from everybody else.""

Below are the ways you can help Kimber and the rest of her family:

The “Own Your Ridges” campaign announced earlier this week includes two commercials starring Anthony Davis the Los Angeles Lakers all-star who began his partnership with Ruffles last year per an announcement.

According to Marketing Dive this first national TV campaign in almost a decade for Ruffles potato chips and the introduction of a new flavor aim to lift the profile of the brand among younger consumers. To expand the campaign beyond TV Ruffles launched a “Ridge Awards” campaign on social media.

Marketing Dive further notes that “the campaign for Ruffles also is another sign of the greater marketing muscle that Frito-Lay is putting into its brands. Snack foods have seen stronger sales growth in the past year as homebound consumers do more of their own cooking during the pandemic. To help maintain that sales momentum Frito-Lay has ramped up its marketing efforts with higher-profile campaigns.”

Frito-Lay has helped parent company PepsiCo to drive higher sales and earnings. The company’s profit rose 4.5% from a year earlier to $1.85 billion in Q4 as revenue climbed 8.8% to $22.46 billion. Frito-Lay North America saw 5% growth in organic sales

Here's how it's different from the others,"CNN —

The United States is getting a third coronavirus vaccine – this one made by Johnson & Johnson.

The US Food and Drug Administration has given the vaccine emergency use authorization the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended it and the federal government is scheduled to start distribution almost immediately.

Two vaccines are already being distributed in the US – one made by Moderna and another made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech. The new vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine division is a little different. Here’s how.

It’s one dose

Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is designed to be given as a single dose. That means no follow-up visits none of the red tape needed to make sure people return for those second shots and none of the worry about making sure a second dose is available at the right time.

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are both designed to be given in a two-dose series – the Pfizer vaccine three weeks apart and Moderna’s four weeks apart. There’s been discussion about whether it might be OK to give these vaccines as a single dose or to extend the time between doses so more people can get their first vaccine and thus get at least some protection.

But the FDA authorization says two doses and many vaccine experts including White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci fear giving just one dose of Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines might leave people only partly protected.

Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine was tested and shown to protect people with a single dose although studies are underway to see if two doses might provide more protection.

Different efficacy

One thing people might notice right away about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is how it stacks up against Pfizer’s and Moderna’s in terms of efficacy. Those vaccines had a startling efficacy rate in clinical trials of 94% to 95%. Real-world studies of Pfizer’s vaccine in Israel indicate that efficacy holds up. The risk of symptomatic Covid-19 – meaning people who got infected with the coronavirus and felt sick – decreased by 94% among people given two doses of the vaccine.

In contrast the overall global efficacy of Janssen’s vaccine was 66% against moderate to severe illness. But it was 85% effective against severe disease and in trials anyway 100% effective at preventing death as no one who got the vaccine died from Covid-19.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was given in different populations and at a different time however. It was tested in 44000 people in the US South Africa and Latin America and most of the testing was months later in the pandemic than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines which started testing in the spring and summer.

Pfizer’s vaccine was tested in 43000 people in the United States Germany Turkey South Africa Brazil and Argentina. Moderna’s was tested in 30000 people all of them in the US.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was tested after some of the troubling new coronavirus variants had started to circulate including one first seen in South Africa called B.1.351 that appears to weaken the body’s recognition of the virus – including after vaccination. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine’s efficacy was just 57% in South Africa where B.1.351 is now the dominant variant compared to 72% in the US where it is far less common.

Vaccine experts agree that all the vaccines provide very good protection by the most important measure which is whether they keep people from getting seriously ill.

But the differing efficacies raise the possibility that some people will see the Johnson & Johnson vaccine as second class Sarah Christopher the policy advocacy director at the National Women’s Health Network told an FDA advisory committee meeting Friday.

There are feelings “that there are first and second class vaccines with the latter relegated to low income rural or otherwise marginalized communities that has the potential to exacerbate existing mistrust” she said. “Public health authorities must address these perceptions head on.”

Quicker protection

With the Johnson & Johnson vaccine protection against moderate to severe disease starts about two weeks after people get vaccinated. By four weeks after the shot data from the clinical trial showed there were no hospitalizations or deaths.

Recent studies show good level of protection with the first dose of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines but people don’t get full protection until about two weeks after the second dose – so five to six weeks after the first dose.

It’s made using different technology

The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines use a brand-new technology called messenger RNA or mRNA. They deliver genetic material directly into cells via fatty particles. That genetic code gets taken up by cells in the arm muscle which then follow the genetic instructions to make tiny pieces that look like a part of the coronavirus.

Those little proteins stimulate an immune response generating antibodies and immune cells that “remember” what they look like and that will be ready to respond quickly in case of a fresh attack.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses viral vector technology. A common cold virus called adenovirus 26 is genetically engineered so that it can infect cells but it won’t replicate there. It cannot spread in the body and won’t give people a cold. Like the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines it delivers genetic instructions.

Instead of being carried in little lipid balls the genetic instructions are injected by the weakened virus into arm cells and they make the pieces that look like part of the coronavirus spike protein – the knob-shaped structure that the virus uses to connect to cells.

It’s easier to handle

Those delicate little balls of fat used to carry the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines need careful handling. Pfizer’s vaccine must be stored and shipped at between -80ºC to -60ºC (-112ºF to -76ºF) – something that caused a lot of trouble for states at first which had to scramble to get dry ice and special freezers. The FDA has now eased up on those requirements a bit but the vaccine can still only be held in the refrigerator for five days and must be used within six hours of being thawed and diluted.

And yes the Pfizer vaccine must be diluted before it’s used and it cannot be shaken but must be carefully inverted exactly 10 times to mix it. The Moderna vaccine is a little less fussy but also must be frozen and carefully handled.

Moderna’s vaccine can be kept at about -20ºC or about the temperature of a home freezer.

In contrast Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine can be kept at simple refrigerator temperatures for up to three months making it far easier to store and ship.

What they have in common

None of the three vaccines contains additives that can sometimes cause strong reactions such as antibiotics preservatives or adjuvants which are compounds used to boost the immune response that can add to the kick of any vaccine.

That means a very low risk of allergic reaction especially life-threatening anaphylaxis. The CDC reports only a few cases of anaphylaxis in people who have been given the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines and all were easily treated.

Only one case of anaphylaxis has been reported in the 44000 people who have tested the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

Plus all three target a specific part of the spike protein called the receptor binding domain. As the name implies it’s the part the virus uses to grapple cells. Mutations to this particular region could weaken the efficacy of all three vaccines.

Luckily all three appear to stimulate an overwhelming immune response – one much stronger than people get after a natural infection. So far it appears to be enough to continue at least partially protecting people from the most concerning variants.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53amhsLmNvbS9sb2NhbC1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1jb3ZlcmFnZS9zdWxsaXZhbi1jb3VudHktcmVnaW9uYWwtaGVhbHRoLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtb25seS0ybmQtZG9zZXMtb2YtdmFjY2luZS1hdmFpbGFibGUtZmlyc3Qtd2Vlay1vZi1tYXJjaC_SAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2pobC5jb20vbG9jYWwtY29yb25hdmlydXMtY292ZXJhZ2Uvc3VsbGl2YW4tY291bnR5LXJlZ2lvbmFsLWhlYWx0aC1kZXBhcnRtZW50LW9ubHktMm5kLWRvc2VzLW9mLXZhY2NpbmUtYXZhaWxhYmxlLWZpcnN0LXdlZWstb2YtbWFyY2gvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SCRHD: 2nd doses of Pfizer vaccine available first week of March; 1st dose appointments full,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wjhl.com/local-coronavirus-coverage/sullivan-county-regional-health-department-only-2nd-doses-of-vaccine-available-first-week-of-march/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53amhsLmNvbS9sb2NhbC1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1jb3ZlcmFnZS9zdWxsaXZhbi1jb3VudHktcmVnaW9uYWwtaGVhbHRoLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtb25seS0ybmQtZG9zZXMtb2YtdmFjY2luZS1hdmFpbGFibGUtZmlyc3Qtd2Vlay1vZi1tYXJjaC_SAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2pobC5jb20vbG9jYWwtY29yb25hdmlydXMtY292ZXJhZ2Uvc3VsbGl2YW4tY291bnR5LXJlZ2lvbmFsLWhlYWx0aC1kZXBhcnRtZW50LW9ubHktMm5kLWRvc2VzLW9mLXZhY2NpbmUtYXZhaWxhYmxlLWZpcnN0LXdlZWstb2YtbWFyY2gvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlaHJhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzQ1ODU4OC9QZml6ZXItYS12YWNjaW5lLXdpdGgtZW5kbGVzcy1wcm9ibGVtcy1hbmQtY29udHJvdmVyc3nSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer a vaccine with endless problems and controversy,"The Pfizer vaccine has caused a great deal of controversy and problems since its distribution and the side effects of injecting this vaccine have caused fear and panic in different cases.

Many people who have been vaccinated have been struggling with a variety of problems including hospitalization and even death.

So far various media outlets have reported deaths due to the Pfizer vaccine even in the United States.

Two months ago the media revealed that White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows had threatened the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve the Pfizer vaccine or he would be ready to resign.

According to a U.S. poll 60 percent of Ohio nursing home staff about half of California health care workers and 40 percent of Los Angeles nurses refused to receive the corona vaccine.

Participants in the survey said they are concerned about the dangerous side effects of receiving the vaccine and do not want to be treated like mice.

The federal system the Vaccine Side Effects Reporting System (VAERS) is a federal database that receives reports of these cases. This system is passive meaning that it does not automatically collect reports and reports are uploaded to it. Everyone including health care workers patients or their families can file reports of vaccine side effects.

According to the media reports on the system about the side effects of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines which have been licensed in the United States to prevent coronary injections are only part of this although most unreported cases are thought to be very serious. In some cases patients reportedly died within days of receiving the injection. In one case a 66-year-old man living in a Colorado nursing home reported a day after receiving the injection. The next morning on Christmas Day the man was seen standing still with his eyes half open and his mouth foamed. He was no longer breathing and had no pulse.

Opposition to Pfizer worldwide

These events have provoked a reaction of concern and astonishment in some countries of the world. Following the deaths of several people who had been injected with the Pfizer vaccine in Norway Australia requested information from Pfizer and Norwegian authorities.

Australian officials say they should get more information about the vaccine and its consequences before deciding whether to use the Pfizer vaccine in the country and Scandinavian countries have said they will be much more careful about injecting their citizens with the Pfizer vaccine. Australia has already placed an order for 10 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine and now appears to be wary of injecting the vaccine.

Opposition by Iran

In this situation it is possible to understand why the Islamic Republic of Iran has opposed the import of the American Pfizer vaccine. According to Hamid Reza Jamshidi Secretary of the National Headquarters for Coronavirus Control and a professor at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences COVAX has two pre-sale plans. In the first plan countries are given the right to choose a vaccine at a cheaper price and in the second plan countries are given the option to choose a vaccine but it is necessary to pay more and Iran has chosen the second one. COVAX has recommended countries to prioritize vaccine imports and that’s why which is why we did not choose to buy Pfizer from the beginning.

Jamshidi pointed to the start of vaccination in some countries in the region and neighboring countries and said: ""Vaccine-producing countries such as China India Britain the United States and… have long suggested to other countries that if a country commits to voluntarily perform human testing the priority will be given to selling the vaccine.

Countries such as Turkey the UAE Bahrain and Saudi Arabia are being vaccinated because they allowed human testing but Iran did not allow any human testing to be performed to protect the health of the people.

Jamshidi went on to say that the United States had blocked the import of medicine to be used by Iranian patients for three years so trusting to buy a vaccine from the American company Pfizer is just optimism because mRNA vaccines are new. It takes at least four years for their effects to be identified he said.

False promises

Jamshidi pointed out that the Leader of the Islamic Revolution had understood from the very beginning that the promises of vaccine delivery were false.

Currently Iranians living in the United States are not allowed to send even one acetaminophen to Iran due to sanctions.

If Iran wants to import drugs from the American company Pfizer right now the U.S. government sanctions will prevent it. The U.S. Treasury Department has forced all countries to obtain a license from the United States before exporting any pharmaceutical items or raw materials to Iran.

""We will use all the science of the day to make the domestic vaccine so at least three knowledge-based companies are currently researching mRNA technology"" he said. But because this technology is the first to be used in the world its long-term effects are unknown.

He added that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will lose their properties because the mRNA formula focuses on only one gene of the virus.

All senior officials of the Islamic Republic especially the Leader due to their extreme sensitivity to maintaining public health have serious doubts about the effectiveness and safety of the Pfizer vaccine and distrust of the enemy so based on previous experiences have banned the import of the Pfizer vaccine.

Health concerns

News and information that have been published about the dangers of the Pfizer vaccine have raised serious concerns about the health and future of the leaders of the countries that have got the Pfizer vaccine to fight the coronavirus.

Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz and his son and Saudi Crown Prince bin Salman were among those who received the American Pfizer vaccine in mid-January to survive the coronavirus.

Saudi Arabia also announced in a hasty decision in late December that it had approved the Pfizer vaccine and started the vaccination process against the coronavirus by injecting the vaccine into the Saudi minister of health.

This was at a time when most countries in the world were still undergoing scientific and research processes in this field and had not made a definite decision.

It seems that while the Pfizer vaccine injection has caused serious problems for many people in different countries of the world Saudi Arabia has not escaped the side effects of using this vaccine.

In recent weeks the Saudi media have been silent on the process of public vaccination against Corona in the country and it is not clear how many Saudi citizens have suffered or died from side effects due to the injection of the Pfizer vaccine in Saudi Arabia.

Therefore it is possible that Saudi Arabia has quietly slowed down or stopped the process of injecting the Pfizer vaccine into its citizens.

Interestingly Saudi citizens continue to be infected with the coronavirus which shows that the Pfizer vaccine has not improved the situation of the people of this country. According to the official Saudi state news agency on February 6 386 new cases of coronary heart disease occurred in the country. The total number of cases of the virus so far has reached 369961 of which 2327 are still being treated and 401 of them are in critical condition.

Also with the registration of 283 new cases of recovery the total number of cases of recovery has reached 361237 people and with the registration of 4 new cases of death due to coronavirus the total number of victims of this crisis has reached 6397 people and 45674 new tests have been performed.

On the other hand some Arabic-speaking users on social media report that the Saudi king is sick after receiving the Pfizer vaccine.

Bin Salman the 85-year-old Saudi king has been the subject of numerous media reports including rumors of his death due to gallbladder inflammation Alzheimer's disease and difficulty speaking for a long time.

Bin Salman has not had a significant media presence since the outbreak of the coronavirus and the Saudi media have only occasionally reported on the holding of government meetings in the form of videoconferences which have not been confirmed by independent news sources.

Due to the severe censorship of the Saudi government it is not clear whether Salman bin Abdulaziz who is also very old is in a good mood after receiving the Pfizer vaccine or whether he is struggling with the side effects and problems caused by the use of the vaccine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9icmVha2luZy1uZXdzL3BmaXplci1jZW8tYWxiZXJ0LWJvdXJsYS1jYWxscy1pc3JhZWwtd29ybGRzLWxhYi1pbi1pbnRlcnZpZXctdG8tbmJjLTY2MDM0OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla calls Israel 'world's lab' in interview to NBC,"""I believe Israel has become the world's lab right now because they are using only our vaccine at this state and they have vaccinated a very big part of their population so we can study both economy and health indices"" said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla during an interview given to NBC News on Friday.

""What we've seen is that the vaccine efficacy in real-world data is getting higher as we speak following the second vaccination so seven days compared to 14 days post-second vaccination there is a difference in efficacy"" Bourla claimed.

When asked whether one could infect others after receiving two doses of the vaccine he said: ""It is something that needs to be confirmed and the real-world data that we are getting from Israel and other studies will help us understand this better.

""But there are a lot of indicators right now that are telling us that there is a protection against the transmission of the disease"" Bourla added.

Bourla further noted that studies on the risk of the vaccine are also underway on pregnant women and younger children.

""We have already licensed for kids 16 and above... we are already doing trials for kids between 11 years old all the way to 16 and I hope that we will be able to have data in a couple of months. We are also planning to initiate pediatric studies from a younger age from age 5 all the way to 11. And I believe we should have data about this population by the end of the year"" Bourla said according to NBC.

Regarding how long the protection remains after receiving both doses of the vaccine Bourla said current data shows that after six months the protection is robust but we need to wait until a year in order to determine if it remains for the full year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmVzc3JlcHVibGljYW4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWxfbmV3cy93b3JrLXRvLXRyYW5zZm9ybS12YWNhbnQtcGZpemVyLXByb3BlcnR5LWludG8taW5kdXN0cmlhbC1wYXJrLWNvbnRpbnVlcy9hcnRpY2xlX2YwMDljMjJiLWUzNGYtNWMzMC04NTgxLTMxMDMwN2Q4MmJjYi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Work to transform vacant Pfizer property into industrial park continues,"Plattsburgh NY (12901)

McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhcnRhbnN3aXJlLnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9saXN0cy9saXN0LW9mLXNjaG9vbHMtbXN1LXRyYW5zZmVyLXBnLWFqLWhvZ2dhcmQtaXMtcmVwb3J0ZWRseS1jb25zaWRlcmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,List of schools MSU transfer PG AJ Hoggard is reportedly considering,"Former Michigan State point guard AJ Hoggard has reportedly cut the lists of schools he’s considering to only five programs.

PSX,Phillips 66,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAyLzI3L2lzLXBoaWxsaXBzLTY2LXN0b2NrLWEtYnV5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Phillips 66 Stock a Buy?,"This dividend stock surged 40% in just three months.

Leading downstream oil giant Phillips 66 (PSX 0.06%) had its worst year ever. The company had turned a profit every year since spinning off from ConocoPhillips in 2012. That is until the COVID-19 pandemic crippled its refined product and chemicals demand resulting in a $4 billion unadjusted loss. In 2020 the company reported record-low revenue and negative free cash flow (FCF) and added $4 billion in debt to its balance sheet.

Given this terrible performance investors may be scratching their heads as to why shares of Phillips 66 are up around 20% so far this year. Let's dive into Phillips 66's refining business to determine what went wrong in 2020 and what could go right in 2021.

Optimistic expectations

The short answer as to why shares of Phillips 66 have been going up has to do with expectations. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil the commonly quoted benchmark in the U.S. just passed the $60 per barrel threshold the highest point in over a year. An expected uptick in oil and gas demand coupled with lower supply is buoying oil prices. Supply is lower because virtually every major oil producer curtailed some production in 2020 in the face of lower oil prices. There's also the recent winter freeze in Texas which took even more production offline in the short term.

Low crude oil prices aren't automatically a good thing

Higher oil prices mean higher input costs for Phillips 66 which seems like a bad thing. This is because refiners take crude oil and turn it into useful products so lower oil prices tend to mean cheaper operating costs. However looking at oil prices alone can be misleading. Refining results are influenced by loads of factors like throughput feedstock costs turnaround activity and other costs. But the two most important metrics are realized refining margin per barrel and crude utilization rate.

Refining margin per barrel is simply the value of the products made from a barrel of oil relative to the cost of the unrefined crude oil. A high refining margin means more profit for refiners. Crude utilization rate is the amount of output compared to the total potential output that refineries are capable of. Again a high number means refineries are operating closer to capacity -- a good sign that demand for their services is high.

Why 2020 was so bad

In Phillips 66's case the main reason its 2020 performance was so bad is because its refining margin per barrel and crude utilization rates were drastically below historic levels. And by drastically I mean a $6.15 billion unadjusted loss compared to a 2019 profit of $1.99 billion and a 2018 profit of $4.54 billion. Refining tends to be the oil company's largest and most profitable segment but it was its biggest downfall in 2020. In fact the rest of the company's business segments -- midstream chemicals and marketing and specialties -- had a combined 2020 adjusted net income just 10% lower than 2019.

Metric 2020 2019 2018 Average WTI crude oil price per barrel $39.16 $57.02 $64.92 Realized refining margin per barrel $3.42 $9.91 $12.99 Crude utilization rate 76% 94% 95% Refining segment net income ($6.155 billion) $1.986 billion $4.536 billion

Looking at the figures it's clear that Phillips 66 doesn't care about high oil prices as long as its business is booming. Even with historically low WTI prices averaging under $40 in 2020 it's no surprise that Phillips 66 struggled mightily given a good deal of its refineries weren't operating and profit margins were slim. Its fourth-quarter utilization rate was just 69% the lowest of the year. Its fourth-quarter refining margin was just $2.18 which was a slight improvement from the third quarter but lower than the second quarter.

Limping toward the finish line

After a disappointing third quarter Phillips 66 had been hoping its figures would improve. Instead the fourth quarter was the largest adjusted quarterly loss in refining for the year. The company's lackluster performance is contrary to other leading energy and industrial stocks that saw their performance improve as the year progressed.

It could take time for Phillips 66 to adjust to higher oil prices. In addition to the points discussed earlier rising crude prices can be a detriment to refiners in the short term. Prices for refined products rarely move in tandem with crude prices especially if crude prices dramatically rise or fall in a short period of time. Phillips 66 and other refiners will need to clear their existing inventory thereby lowering supply so that prices for their products rise along with crude. In the meantime refinery margins will likwly be squeezed.

Hope on the horizon

Phillips 66 is still a long way from rebounding to its 2018 and 2019 levels but there's an indication that the downstream industry is improving. The U.S. Energy Information Administration tracks average crude utilization rates. The January average was just shy of 82% the highest since late March 2020. The first half of February averaged 83%. These improved rates are a sign that the industry is ramping up refinery usage in response to higher demand. This is the good news that Phillips 66 has been waiting for since the pandemic began.

Wait and see

Shares of Phillips 66 sold off mightily in 2020. While the stock looked like a bargain not too long ago a 40% surge in three months makes it less attractive given its poor results and unproven 2021 recovery. The leading indicators bode well for a much-improved first quarter but the company isn't out of the woods yet. Phillips 66 is unlikely to raise its dividend or reinstate its share buyback program anytime soon. And its budget of $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion for sustaining operations and $600 million for growth initiatives) is much lower than its usual spending.

In order to fund its $1.6 billion annual dividend obligation the budget and begin to pay down the $4 billion in debt it added in 2020 Phillips 66 will need to seriously improve its FCF and notch consecutive good quarters. Phillips 66 has a hefty 4.4% dividend yield well above the market average. But given the stock's climb and the looming uncertainties it's probably best to take a wait and see approach with Phillips 66 at this time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vb2tzdGF0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzIvMjgvbWVucy1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLWNvd2JveS1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLWhvc3RpbmctYmlnLW1vbmRheS1iZWRsYW0tcm91bmQtMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cowboy Basketball Hosting Big Monday Bedlam Round 2,• Game CenterPhillips 66 Bedlam Series7/8 Oklahoma (14-7 9-6) at RV/21 Oklahoma State (16-6 9-6)Date: March 1 2021Tipoff: 8 p.m. CTSite: Gallagher-Iba Arena (13611)Series: OU leads 140-101 (OSU leads 64-46 in Stillwater)Last: OSU won 94-90 in OT in Norman on Feb. 27TV: ESPN (Bob Wischusen Fran Fraschilla) Radio: Cowboy Radio Network (Dave Hunziker John Holcomb)Satellite Radio: XM 375 (OSU call) XM/Sirius 84 (OU call)Live Stats: okstate.statbroadcast.com • The BasicsPhillips 66 Bedlam Round 1 was an instant classic.

North East Lincolnshire’s skyline will be changing as one of the biggest cranes in the world is assembled.

Phillips 66 will raise a crane to its full height of 135m at its South Killingholme refinery on Saturday.

This will make the structure on par with the London Eye and it weighs a huge 3200 tonnes.

The crane was brought in pieces to the Humber Refinery on 150 different lorries to allow it to be constructed.

Residents from several miles around will likely be able to spot it rising this weekend.

The huge structure is being brought in to aid with maintenance work which is being carried out at the South Killingholme refinery.

Phillips 66 has said that residents may notice additional noise during this period and will take all possible measures to keep it to a minimum.

Some units will be closed down as this is carried out.

Information issued by Phillips 66 says: “The Humber Refinery is starting a maintenance period that will involve closing down some units.

""During this initial period you may notice some increased noise. We will do everything possible to minimise any noise during this period.

“The crane was brought on 150 lorries to site before construction could begin. The crane will be raised on Saturday (27/2/21) to its full height of 135m (as tall as the London Eye!)

“The crane weighs in at a massive 3200 tonnes.”"

EAST LIVERPOOL Ohio – Stepping into Renovatio’s Tap Room & Restaurant newly opened in downtown East Liverpool customers find themselves immersed in the city’s history.

Renovatio is the Latin word for “rebirth” and co-owners Randy Schneider and Craig Cozza hope the new enterprise will be the cornerstone of the city’s emergence from years of decline.

Schneider an East Liverpool native described the fortuitous way his partnership with the Pittsburgh developer came about and how they decided to spend $1.1 million to renovate a nearly century-old building originally Potters Bank & Trust into the city’s most modern attraction.

While in the process of buying five PNC bank buildings in Pennsylvania Cozza expressed interest in the Renovatio building at 200 E. Fifth St. He offered $50000 for the building although the owner wanted $100000 due to its historical architecture Schneider says. However Cozza held out saying he would buy the Pennsylvania bank buildings only if the East Liverpool one was included at his stated price. The offer was accepted.

Schneider was previously involved with marketing other Columbiana County ventures such as Numbers Brewing and Coaches Burger Bar and as a dispatcher for the city police department learned squatters were living in the Fifth Street bank building Cozza had purchased. He called Cozza to notify him of the situation. He also told Cozza of his idea for a tap room and restaurant and offered to purchase the building from him for double the price.

“[Cozza] called me a couple days later and said he didn’t want to sell me the building – he wanted to be my business partner” Schneider says. “He said to draw up the plans and let’s get started.”

Work began in earnest using local contractors such as Sanford Plumbing Veterans Energy Group and D&J Construction and wholesalers such as Milligan’s Hardware.

“Everyone we could possibly use locally we did and people loved it. A lot of local businesses were hurting due to COVID and we tried to pull everyone together” Schneider says.

Co-owner Randy Schneider says that wherever Renovatio’s has had the chance to buy locally they have – including the beer.

The pandemic nonetheless made an impact on the project with various permits and liquor licenses delayed pushing the completion from July 2020 to Jan. 30 when the doors opened.

Renovatio which has an atmosphere more typically found in restaurants in large cities opened to an appreciative crowd.

The original aesthetic of the original Potters Bank and Trust was kept intact with the soaring ceilings gigantic pillars and opulent architectural details of the 1924 building complimented by more modern touches.

The wood paneling in the dining and bar rooms was repurposed from the former safe deposit box viewing room with use of the boxes now offered to customers in the restaurant’s “pint club.” The vault door stands open surrounded by lights and a wood-fired oven resembling a kiln hearkens back to the days when the city was the pottery capital of the world.

The room is so large that sound panels are necessary Schneider says but they are traditionally unattractive so he had them designed as canvases featuring black and white photographs depicting the city’s history.

“People are not just coming in to dine. It’s almost like a museum. They come in and the usual questions are ‘What’s that picture?’ and ‘How old is this building?’” he says. “I told the servers they’re almost like tour guides and have to be able to answer those questions.”

With Cozza’s connections to Pittsburgh and East Liverpool’s pottery-making past the restaurant has an industrial flair. Steel is featured prominently with rusted wall panels and the bar is made from concrete. The dishware is from local potteries including Hall China and Homer Laughlin China Co. Even the pints used are from Commercial Decal in nearby Glenmoor Schneider says.

“We could have done it cheaper but it wouldn’t be local” Schneider says. “These are local taxpayers paying into the local economy.”

The restaurant offers a menu created by Devon Andre a self-taught chef with 15 years of kitchen experience. He describes the menu fare as “new American and French influenced with a homestyle feel and a touch of gastropub.”

Entrees include garlic herb New York strip steak with gouda chive mashed potatoes; a Cajun mustard seasoned pork chop topped with bacon apple chutney; blood orange beer battered cod; and the Fireman Special which consists of chicken and hot sausage with baby spinach heirloom tomatoes hot peppers in a blush arrabiata sauce with ziti pasta. Wood-fired pizzas are baked over oak and cherry wood also gathered locally.

Dessert offerings include a wild berry-topped cheesecake carrot cake and wood-fired apple crisp with bourbon caramel and vanilla bean ice cream.

“We make as much from scratch as we can – the salad dressing the pizza dough” Andre says. “As much as we can source locally we will.”

The kitchen at Renovatio’s is led by Devon Andre.

Local farmers have been benefitting from the new restaurant which purchases produce and meat from them. Beer from local breweries is used in many of the recipes.

“I’m not a chef who walks around with a clipboard; I’m very hands-on” Andre says. “I couldn’t do anything without my staff. We take a lot of pride in what we do. My following expects a certain standard and I maintain that standard wherever I go.”

Every Columbiana and Mahoning county brewery is represented among the 30 craft beers served including Numbers Brewing Co. Birdfish Brewing Co. Sundog Cellars Ciderhouse & Winery BrewLounge Beer Co. Noble Creature Cask House Penguin City Beer Biker Brewhouse and more as well as regional craft beers and wine. Two domestic beers on tap are also offered.

The owners are expanding into an adjacent building to create banquet rooms that can accommodate large crowds which Schneider says are sorely lacking in the area now that other banquet facilities have closed.

Schneider points out that residents travel to Youngstown Boardman and Pittsburgh to enjoy such dining experiences so why not offer the same opportunity here where they can contribute to their own community.

“I grew up here. No matter how many times this city has been beaten down – Crucible Steel closed the potteries closing the drug epidemic – it’s the people’s resiliency that pushes it to survive” Schneider says. “I’ve been in the military nine years traveled the world in different countries and cities and never saw a more resilient bunch of people. That’s what drives us to keep doing this. They still rise up from the ashes and are still proud of where they are and where they’re from and it gives us all the reason to put something like this here in a historical building they call their own.”

Already Schneider says they are seeing customers from Pittsburgh Beaver Midland and other communities coming in and making East Liverpool a destination stopping in at the antique mall across the street for instance which he says will help the city become a travel destination.

Renovatio’s is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Tuesday-Thursday; 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Saturday; and closed Sunday and Monday.

Live music is offered on Saturday nights.

Reservations are recommended especially on weekends although not required. The phone number is 330 932 0568.

Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel met Union Food and Public Distribution Minister Piyush Goyal and reiterated his demand of increasing the permitted amount of 24 lakh MT rice to be procured under the central pool in FCI to 40 lakh MT for the Kharif marketing year 2020-21.

He also requested the Union Minister to reimburse pending food subsidies for the year 2019-20 and 2020-21 amounting to Rs 5214.97 crore.

The Union Minister assured the Chief Minister of reimbursing food subsidies worth Rs 4832 crore. Agriculture Minister Ravindra Choubey and Food Minister Amarjeet Bhagat also accompanied the Chief Minister during the meeting. The Chief Minister also said that in the interest of farmers of Chhattisgarh the Centre should give permission for deposit of 40 lakh MT rice in the Food Corporation of India at the earliest as 92 lakh MT paddy have been procured from 20.53 lakh farmers under MSP in Chhattisgarh during KMY 2020-21 as on 31 January 2021 under the decentralised procurement scheme.

Baghel emphasised that in the meeting of the Food Secretaries of the Government of India for the KMY 2020-21 in-principle consent was given for taking 60 lakh MT rice to the central pool for Chhattisgarh due to which it is possible to resolve about 89 lakh MT of paddy currently acquired.

He maintained that the Food department has been allowed by the Government of India to take only 24 lakh MT of rice (16 lakh MT usna and 8 lakh MT arva) under the central pool in the Food Corporation of India in the Kharif year 2020-21.

The state’s PDS will require 20 lakh MT rice and in addition to this the stock of 3 lakh MT rice will be kept by the Civil Supplies Corporation.

In this way it will be possible to dispose of 70.50 lakh MT paddy which is being acquired. Also present were Secretary to Chief Minister Siddhartha Komal Singh Pardeshi and Secretary (Food) Dr Kamalpreet Singh.",,,,,,,,,

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndsdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9taWNoYWVsLXJvYmVydC1taWtlLXByb2N0ZXItNzM1NDk3MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michael Robert 'Mike' Procter - Obituary -,"February 6 2024

In Loving Memory ~

It is with very heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Michael (Mike) Robert Procter 79 of 150 Mile House BC on February 6 2024.

In North Vancouver BC Mike was the first of three children born to Mary and Peter Procter. Mike grew up in Williams Lake BC after the family moved there in 1951.

After graduating school he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an Electrician. Working for his father's company Procter Electric he worked throughout the Cariboo-Chilcotin and Mike and his father were instrumental in creating novel systems to generate electricity at remote ranches and locations throughout the region.

He moved on to working in the industrial sector and became highly skilled in his trade. High in demand he worked in the construction of new sawmills and in various plants all throughout BC. Later he worked at several local sawmills and contracted throughout the area.

Over all those years Mike made many friendships that endured for the rest of his life.

He went on to marry Cheryl Midnight and they had two children Chris and Jody.

Mike had a penchant for fast cars nice trucks and fine guns. He enjoyed hunting fishing and classic car restoration. He traveled to horse shows throughout BC AB and briefly the US winning many trophies with their champion Arabian show horse Star-Sirza.

In the mid-80's Mike met his life partner Betty Johnson and in the 90's they settled in the 150 Mile area. Mike and 2 good friends purchased the 150 Mile Hotel a rich piece of history in the Cariboo. Together they revived it into the 150 Mile Roadhouse & Pub. For years the establishment was a notable and lively gathering place where many good times were had.

Mike was a hardworking generous man who was always willing to help his friends and family.

He had a great sense of humour he was always up to something and he was entertaining to be around. Throughout his life he was fortunate to have made many friends many acquaintances and to have many great stories to tell. Mike will be sorely missed by his family and friends.

Mike was predeceased by his parents Mary and Peter and his stepfather John Ailport.

Key Metric: Prices

Procter & Gamble rode higher prices to increased revenue in its December quarter. But the upcoming earnings report could show the lowest price increases by the consumer goods seller since the first quarter of fiscal 2022 with analysts forecasting that P&G will hike prices by 2.75% in the quarter.

It could also be the first quarter in two years where the consumer giant reports positive annual growth in sales volumes with expectations for a 0.35% increase.

Business Spotlight

Procter & Gamble’s report comes after it detailed a $1.3 billion impairment charge for its subsidiary razor business Gillette forcing the company to reduce its 2024 full-year guidance for earnings per share (EPS). However the company said it was able to maintain its forecasts for 2024 revenue and it announced earlier this month that it would boost its quarterly dividend by 7%.

“We delivered strong results in the second quarter enabling us to raise our core EPS growth guidance and maintain our top-line outlook for the fiscal year” Procter & Gamble CEO Jon Moeller said after last quarter's results.

Analysts expect P&G to report its largest gains from its biggest segment with revenue from fabric and home care expected to jump about 3.6% year-over-year while its healthcare sales are also expected to increase across the same period. After beauty and personal care products helped pace P&G’s sales in fiscal 2023 revenue from that segment is expected to ease about 1%.

A component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) P&G has had a good start to the year with its shares up about 6.8% so far in 2024 as of Tuesday compared with a DJIA that has started the year flat. It’s also outperforming the SPDR Consumer Staples Select Sector (XLP) exchange traded fund (ETF) which also is flat so far this year."

Bennet Bucks Biden Admin. Request; Names Former McDonald’s Big Pharma Attorney for Lifetime Judgeship,"Progressive groups are criticizing Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet a Democrat for ignoring President Joe Biden’s request for judges of a certain caliber. Bennett recently recommended an elite corporate lawyer to hold a position on the federal bench and activists are seizing on a letter issued by President Joe Biden as a key exhibit in their arguments against Bennet’s pick.

On Dec. 22 well before the 46th presidency took shape incoming (and now current) White House counsel Dana Remus sent a letter to senators on transition team letterhead insisting that the Biden administration was focused on prioritizing public defenders and civil rights lawyers—two legal professions that barely register on the federal bench—for district judge positions.

“With respect to U.S. District Court positions we are particularly focused on nominating individuals whose legal experiences have been historically underrepresented on the federal bench including those who are public defenders civil rights and legal aid attorneys and those who represent Americans in every walk of life” the Remus letter stressed.

The Biden-Remus request came after progressive legal organizations made a series of requests for the new administration to revamp the judiciary with lawyers who didn’t come from the corporate world after decades of bipartisan affection for corporate attorneys resulted in nearly 70 percent of circuit judges hailing from the largely white and high-priced world of elite private practice.

“After decades of frustration as the courts become more and more conservative and more and more deferential to the powerful moneyed interests in our country a lot of hard-working lawyers who don’t make a lot of money have had it” former Wisconsin senator Russ Feingold president of the American Constitution Society said late last year. “They’re saying ‘Why is it that we work hard and we make our arguments and that somehow we have to go before judges who don’t have the experience of being on this side of the bar?'”

The Biden team listened to that grassroots pressure and all-but repeated the progressive call for non-corporate judges. Bennet however appears to have missed the memo.

On Feb. 3 Bennet had only one name to suggest: a retreaded corporate lawyer previously nominated to fill Colorado’s vacant district court seat by Barack Obama in 2014.

Former assistant U.S. attorney Regina Rodriguez is currently a partner at corporate law firm and lobbying giant WilmerHale where she co-chairs the trial practice division.

Her biography reads like anathema to the progressive movement and brags about a close relationship with regulated industries and corporate leaders.

“She has worked closely with company CEOs senior management and boards of directors in highly regulated industries—such as pharmaceuticals biomedical healthcare technology and medical devices—to create a culture of compliance in an ever-changing regulatory landscape” the biography states. “Ms. Rodriguez who has worked in both government and private practice has a deep understanding of the regulatory challenges facing companies today and works strategically and collaboratively across the entire corporate spectrum to provide exceptional client service and counsel.”

In the past Rodriguez represented McDonalds in an anti-discrimination case after a customer alleged racist treatment from the restaurant.

She’s also taken the company line on various Big Pharma cases — including an instance in which companies failed to disclose harmful side effects and lied about the effectiveness of their products. In one particularly controversial 2006 case Rodriguez represented an anatomical and pathology laboratory which mislabeled biopsy results that resulted in a patient undergoing an unnecessary cancer surgery.

Those episodes and others from her career are not likely to endear her to the reform-minded administration and progressives would like to point that out.

Demand Justice a left-of-center judicial advocacy group which led the charge against the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh with a series of hard-hitting advertisements launched a digital ad campaign that accuses Bennet of “standing in the way” of Biden’s stated goal to reshape the courts. The group’s Co-Founder and Chief Counsel Christopher Kang rubbished the disconnect while praising the White House’s quest.

“President Biden’s plan is exactly what we need to rebalance a court system biased in favor of the rich and the powerful” Kang told Law&Crime. “The idea that Sen. Bennet couldn’t find a single diverse well-qualified public defender or public interest lawyer to recommend defies common sense and it reflects an outdated approach that helped create our broken justice system in the first place.”

Colorado progressives are similarly dismayed with Bennet’s choice.

Former state representative Joe Salazar criticized the pick by saying it showed the Mile High State’s senior senator does not consider Civil Rights “a top priority.”

“I appreciate that their selection is Latina but corporate attorneys are not on President Biden’s priority list” Salazar told Colorado Politics.

“It would be nice to get somebody in there that has a little different of an experience that is more on the criminal defendant’s side” Denver-based litigator Leonard Martinez told the outlet. “Every time you see these judges appointed it’s district attorneys U.S. Attorneys — a prosecutor type of attorney nominated or a corporate lawyer.”

The concerns are not just aesthetic or academic. Recent research suggests that judges with corporate and prosecutorial backgrounds are exceedingly more anti-worker when they take the bench than judges without corporate or law enforcement bona fides.

“The result held true when comparing only Obama-appointed judges” the study noted. “Obama judges with corporate backgrounds were 36% less likely to decide in favor of workers in employment cases and former prosecutors were 50% less likely to decide in their favor.”

So why is Colorado’s Democratic senator outright bucking the request from the president of his own party? It’s probably because of where he gets his own recommendations.

Bennet uses a commission overwhelmingly comprised of corporate lawyers and prosecutors to inform his judicial picks. A report notes that 72% of the members on Bennet’s commission have such backgrounds — higher than any other senator with a publicly-disclosed commission roster.

Bennet famously introduced Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his confirmation hearings.

“President Biden has made clear that he wants to have a different kind of judge nominated” Kang himself a former Obama administration official said at the time the group went on the air against Bennet. “And yet Sen. Bennet in his first recommendation has recommended somebody who does not fit that mold who is very much in the old frame of a corporate lawyer. That’s not what President Biden has asked for and it’s not what our courts need right now.”

Bennet’s office told a Colorado news outlet that it was “disappointing that an out-of-state dark money group” was attacking the pick.

Regina Rodriguez “is an incredibly qualified Latina candidate who would bring diversity to the federal bench” a Bennet spokesperson said. “She also has a long track record of community service to Colorado’s children and working families.”

Rodriguez did not respond to the outlet’s request for comment.

His resignation represents a sharp turnaround from a few months ago when the liberal legal organization voted to renew DeVore for a second three-year term.

ACS which was founded in 2001 to help create a pipeline of liberal judges and act as a counter to the conservative Federalist Society faced growing pressure throughout 2020 to cut ties with DeVore and condemn Amazon for its anti-union practices. In the spring DeVore’s boss Amazon general counsel David Zapolsky had urged colleagues to tell reporters that among other things a fired worker who protested the lack of Covid-19 safety protections in a Staten Island warehouse was “not smart or articulate.”

In response a number of left-leaning groups including attorneys and law students affiliated with ACS sent a letter to ACS’s president Russ Feingold and the ACS board of directors protesting DeVore’s leadership role and calling for his immediate resignation. But the organization did not call for his resignation and six months later voted to extend his leadership position. At the time ACS told The Intercept that DeVore who had served on the board since 2017 was an engaged board member and that they saw him as helping to bring “a diversity of experiences” to the organization.

In a letter sent to New York University ACS student leaders on Friday Feingold confirmed that DeVore had resigned. “Andrew is a principled person his Board participation was exemplary and we benefited greatly from his service” Feingold wrote. “We are grateful for his dedication to the organization.”

ACS did not return a request for comment but their website has already been updated to no longer list DeVore as part of the leadership.

Feingold’s letter did not say why DeVore had resigned. But since December when ACS publicly reaffirmed its support for the Amazon executive a major unionization campaign at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer Alabama has picked up national attention. The company has been fighting the union effort aggressively including hiring a $3200-per-day consultant to dissuade the some 5800 workers there from voting for a union.

ACS has resisted pressure from its membership to speak more forcefully about Amazon’s labor practices for most of the coronavirus pandemic. In April amid public backlash to Amazon’s warehouse conditions ACS released a statement reiterating its support for workers’ rights but did not specifically mention Amazon by name. Amazon is listed as a 2020 corporate sponsor on ACS’s website though how much the company has donated to the nonprofit organization is unknown.

“I think it was very concerning that ACS as a progressive organization won’t make a statement that specifically calls out Amazon and its bad track record” Hooman Hedayati a member of the Washington D.C. ACS chapter board told The Intercept in December. “It makes me question to what degree they’d really be willing to speak up in support of the labor movement.”

In late January a virtual panel hosted by ACS chapters at Harvard New York University and Yale was titled “Corporate Influence in Progressive Legal Spaces: Why Is an Amazon Lawyer on the American Constitution Society’s Board of Directors?” Among other legal activists the event featured former Amazon worker Christian Smalls who was fired last March for protesting warehouse conditions.

Eight days after the virtual panel ACS released its first statement directed at Amazon. “The American Constitution Society encourages all employers including the Amazon Corporation to respect the right of workers to collectively bargain and to follow the law in remaining neutral as to their employees’ decision to unionize or not” Feingold wrote in the statement. “The upcoming unionization election at an Amazon plant in Alabama is scheduled to occur on February 8 and there have been concerning news reports outlining anti-organizing actions by the company. We are also disturbed by first-hand accounts of mistreatment of Amazon workers particularly in the midst of the pandemic.”

Voting for the Bessemer warehouse union began February 8 and will continue through March 29. It is the first union election for the company in the United States since about two dozen Delaware warehouse workers rejected forming a union in 2014.",,,,,,

The significance of this tribute has led other nations to celebrate the African Diaspora at different times throughout the year including the Netherlands Ireland and the United Kingdom for example. These instances of wider tribute across the globe have been supported through the altruistic activities undertaken by Donald Payne Sr. an alumnus of Seton Hall and New Jersey Congressman. Representative Payne was a noted advocate on behalf of education and human rights endeavors but he also spent several years learning about and lecturing upon a myriad of Black-centered history issues on both the local and international level during the course of his lifetime.

Donald Milford Payne (1934-2012) was a native of Newark graduate of Barringer H.S. and an alumnus of Seton Hall University earning his diploma in 1957 prior to doing post-graduate education at Springfield College (MA). He was an executive at Prudential Financial Services; Vice President for Urban Data Systems Inc. and also taught within the Newark Public Schools system prior to entering the political arena.

Congressman Payne spent a major portion of his public career as a United States Representative for the 10th District covering Newark South Orange and other neighboring communities from 1989-2012. He was a strong advocate on academic-related issues of various types including the School-to-Work Opportunities Act and National Literacy Institute. Counted among his many board-appointed accomplishments include a stint on the Democratic Steering Committee (2002) along with membership as part of the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs. In addition Congressman Payne was very active with peace negotiations in Northern Ireland and as a two-time (first ever individual re-appointed to this body twice) as a Congressional delegate to the United Nations (2003-2007) among other respected committee assignments.

The work undertaken by Congressman Payne in Africa was particularly keen as he became an advocate for the citizens of Darfur Sudan the Western Sahara and other parts of the continent as a former Chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health. In addition a highlight included a six-nation tour of Africa with President Bill Clinton during the 1990s along with leading a separate political mission to Rwanda. Congressman Payne was also a member of the Board of Directors for the TransAfrica Forum and involved himself with ending the Somalian conflict of the 2000s.

Congressman Payne was also a trailblazer in his own right as the first African American President of the National Council of Young Men’s Christian Associations (YMCA) during the early 1970s and later as Chairman of the World YMCA Refugee and Rehabilitation Committee between 1973-81. He was also the earliest African American U.S. Congressman to represent any district in New Jersey history and served as the 14th Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus (founded in 1969) and first ever from the Garden State.

During the course of his life and legislative career in particular Congressman Payne addressed noteworthy remembrances related to various African American individuals institutions events and eras. Solemnity and respectful reflection in relation to such celebrations as Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Douglass Day in addition to Black History Month. Congressman Payne also brought important perspective about his activities in the African American community to his alma mater and local constituents over the last several decades.

The most lasting memorial related to Congressman Payne from a Seton Hall perspective can be found within the preservation of his legislative records within the Monsignor William Noé Field Archives & Special Collections Center. School officials acquired his files in 2013 a year after his death. Various web pages and blog posts related to the local connections have been archived for public reference over the past decade . . .

That pushes it into unicorn territory with $340 million in total funding and a post-money valuation north of $1 billion. Skydio’s fresh capital comes on the heels of its expansion last year into the enterprise market and it intends to use the considerable pile of cash to help it expand globally and accelerate product development.

In July of last year Skydio announced its $100 million Series C financing and also debuted the X2 its first dedicated enterprise drone. The company also launched a suite of software for commercial and enterprise customers its first departure from the consumer drone market where it had been focused prior to that raise since its founding in 2014.

Skydio’s debut drone the R1 received a lot of accolades and praise for its autonomous capabilities. Unlike other consumer drones at the time including from recreational drone maker DJI the R1 could track a target and film them while avoiding obstacles without any human intervention required. Skydio then released the Skydio 2 in 2019 its second drone cutting off more than half the price while improving on it its autonomous tracking and video capabilities.

Late last year Skydio brought on additional senior talent to help it address enterprise and government customers including a software development lead who had experience at Tesla and 3D-printing company Carbon. Skydio also hired two Samsara executives at the same time to work on product and engineering. Samsara provides a platform for managing cloud-based fleet operations for large enterprises.

The applications of Skydio’s technology for commercial public sector and enterprise organizations are many and varied. Already the company works with public utilities fire departments construction firms and more to do work including but not limited to remote inspection emergency response and urban planning. Skydio’s U.S. pedigree also puts it in prime position to capitalize on the growing interest in applications from the defense sector.

Itanagar Feb 28: The lone Arunachal Pradesh Forensic Science Laboratory (APFSL) in the state situated at Police Training Centre PTC Banderdewa is unable to carry out tests resulting in halting and delaying of crucial cases.

The APFSL at Banderdewa caters to only analyzing fingerprints handwriting/currency and carries out Narcotic tests Ballistic (finger print) hence the state police is forced to send samples especially Biological & DNA related to the Central Forensic Laboratory Guwahati in case of other detections thus wasting precious time.

“As forensic opinions are crucial to substantiate cases which most of the time take long; filing of charge sheet equally gets delayed under NDPS Acts related cases. Sometimes it does take 6 months to a year when the lone female forensic expert (Narcotic) goes on maternity leave"" shares a Police officer.

To ensure that cases do not pile up and affect the investigation process the officer suggested that a division should have at least two experts to ensure continuity.

As of now Narcotic Finger Print Handwriting & Currency Ballistic divisions are functional with a single expert however the most crucial division ‘Biology & DNA’ is yet to be started. Any rape or other biological related cases are being sent to CFL Guwahati causing delay in expediting key cases and becomes expensive as well discloses sources.

The State needs to have a full-fledged APFSL presently it lacks facilities.

So many cases are still pending due to lack of well equipped APFSL though it plays a critical role in investigation of serious crimes including rape sexual assault cases and speedy trial is delayed due to late filing of FSL reports. Early and timely catering of FSL tests report would help to curb growing crime rate in the state.

Exposition Miró. A Collection by Barrié Foundation | The Strength of Architecture | From ...,"Description of project by Barrié Foundation



The Barrié Foundation presents the ""Miró. A Collection"" exhibition with 47 works by Joan Miró (Barcelona ​​1893 - Palma de Mallorca 1983) an unavoidable reference in the history of European painting and one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. Painter sculptor ceramist and engraver he was one of the greatest exponents of Surrealism and one of the Spanish artists with the greatest international projection whose work came to exert great influence both on his contemporaries and on subsequent generations.



With this exhibition the Barrié Foundation takes up its line of temporary painting exhibitions of historical interest that aims to bring Galicia the best of national and international artists. In this framework samples of great artists such as Pablo Ruiz Picasso El Greco and Joaquín Sorolla among others have been presented.



40 of the works come from the Collection that Fundación MAPFRE shows in its ""Espacio Miró"" in Madrid donated by different owners as temporary storage. The selection of these works is made up of 35 oil paintings on different supports 2 drawings and 2 watercolors with India ink. Although most of them are pieces from the last decades we can find paintings from different periods and with different motifs: constellations women birds stars and other types of characters.



In this way one can see how Miró continually takes up the same themes reinventing them and giving them new vitality. Perhaps what most characterizes this collection is that although on the one hand it presents the last decades in Miró's artistic career - a more unknown period that has only recently begun to receive the attention and enthusiasm of critics - on the other.  exposes almost all the issues that have interested the artist since its inception. Many times it is a kind of reunion with them which allows giving them a fuller meaning.



The other 7 works on display from public and private collections join this exhibition to contextualize his creative process and bring Miró's figure and work closer to the public in a more didactic way. To this end space will be created that will house the bronze sculpture Tête de Femme from 1974. The final work will be accompanied by all the pieces that precede it such as the preparatory drawings the first painted clay model and the plaster models.  then. In this way the visitor has the opportunity to accompany the artist throughout his creative process from his thought embodied in drawings with few strokes to the finished work.",,,,,,,,,

Yang Hou a former senior vice president at Qualcomm will take over for Alain Crozier as the chairman and chief executive officer for Microsoft Greater China Region says a company announcement released Monday.

After eight years at Qualcomm where he led sales and business development Hou will spearhead strategy sales and operations for Microsoft in the Greater China region. Hou was credited for achieving 3x revenue growth for Qualcomm’s semiconductor business and fostering partnerships in the smartphone industrial and automotive industries in China according to the announcement.

A native of northeast China Hou had a five-year stint at McKinsey & Company after he graduated from the University of Michigan and Peking University.

Crozier joined Microsoft back in 1994 and will officially pass the torch to Hou in July. His next step is yet to be announced.

Crozier is resigning at a time when China is racing to outpace the U.S. as the global technology leader. The ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute has shaken the global supply chain jacking up manufacturing costs for American hardware makers. Meanwhile a number of legacy U.S. tech giants are scaling back their presence in China where historically they have maintained research teams to better grasp the flourishing Chinese market.

In 2019 Oracle laid off hundreds of staff at its R&D center in China. Last year IBM closed its R&D center in China after 25 years in part due to increased labor costs former employees told TechCrunch.

The Microsoft counterpart Microsoft Research Asia is widely respected and regarded as the “West Point” for China’s artificial intelligence scientists. Famed alumni include ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming and the founder of autonomous driving unicorn Momenta.

Compared to its fame in China’s tech industry Microsoft’s revenue in China is modest as a result of rampant piracy and competition. In a 2018 interview former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said 90% of companies in China were using the Microsoft operating system but only 1% were paying for it.

On the new business front Microsoft has tried to peddle its Azure cloud computing product to Chinese enterprises but has so far been dwarfed by domestic players Alibaba Tencent and Huawei.

China contributed less than 2% of Microsoft’s annual revenue or around $2 billion president Brad Smith said in January 2020.

Like other foreign tech firms operating in China Microsoft is often caught in the middle between local authorities and free speech advocates. Its professional social network LinkedIn and search engine Bing have both been criticized for censoring content considered sensitive by the Chinese government.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9UaWNXYXRjaC1Qcm8tMy1MVEUtTW9idm9pLXMtc21hcnR3YXRjaC1wZXJmb3Jtcy1iZXR0ZXItdGhhbi10aGUtQXBwbGUtV2F0Y2gtYW5kLVNhbXN1bmctcy1HYWxheHktV2F0Y2gtaW4tdGhlLXNwZWVkLXRlc3QuNTI0NzQ3LjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TicWatch Pro 3 LTE: Mobvoi's smartwatch performs better than the Apple Watch and Samsung's Galaxy Watch in the ...,"TicWatch Pro 3 LTE: Mobvoi's smartwatch performs better than the Apple Watch and Samsung's Galaxy Watch in the speed test High achiever.

Case and connectivity – Mobvoi smartwatch with dual display The Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 3 LTE is a TicWatch Pro 3 GPS with integrated cellular communication. This makes the fitness tracker completely self-sufficient - during outdoor sports thanks to GPS and when making calls and retrieving data without a smartphone thanks to the cellular module. On the other hand it consumes more energy because the battery's capacity of 595 mAh isn't higher than that of its sibling model. The review of the TicWatch Pro 3 GPS which is identical except for the cellular module already describes the case and hardware. Here is a summary of the essentials: Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear 4100 is at the core of the hardware and it can operate with 1 GB of RAM. There's 8 GB at disposal for data in gross terms but only a bit over 4 GB is available in net terms. Both models communicate with all current satellite systems and measure heart rate as well as blood oxygen saturation but they don't generate an ECG. Both download updates and additional apps directly via WLAN instead of via the smartphone. With a speaker microphone and NFC for Google Assistant and Google Pay they provide the essential functions of any Wear OS smartwatch. They are controlled via the touchscreen and the two buttons on the side. A special feature is the dual-display design where Mobvoi puts a low-power FSTN LCD over an AMOLED screen. The FSTN LCD updates the contents displayed only once per second and remains transparent when the AMOLED is active. The TicWatch Pro 3 has an always-on display. If you deactivate it the FSTN LCD continues to show the date time and step count but it hardly consumes more energy than if the screen remained black. The TicWatch Pro 3 can run for several days if the FSTN LCD is generally activated instead of the AMOLED. In this case however you also give up the essential smartwatch functions.

4 News Setup and handling – Almost all settings are adjusted directly on the watch To pair the Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 3 LTE with an Android smartphone or iPhone you first download Google's Wear OS app from the respective store. In addition there's an app from Mobvoi in both stores. It comes with extensive instructions synchronizes audio notes created with the TicWatch Pro 3 LTE and downloads additional watch faces from the Internet. The Mobvoi app also includes a dashboard for the tracked data; you can read more on this under the section regarding health and fitness. To make sure the dashboard can display all the data tracked during the whole day you should open all health-related Mobvoi apps on the watch at least once after setup and allow access to the sensors. Nearly all options that are usually controlled by other manufacturers through the app are controlled by Mobvoi on the watch itself. This includes for example whether it measures heart rate and blood oxygen saturation manually or automatically and whether it warns the user when their heart rate lies outside of defined thresholds. Like all Wear OS smartwatches the TicWatch downloads additional apps from the Play Store as required. A short press on the upper button leads to the Play Store and the remaining apps that are installed. A long press launches Google Assistant. A double tap on the lower button launches Google Pay and a short press launches an individually configurable function or app. A long press on the lower button opens a menu with special functions like making an emergency call draining the speaker after swimming or switching to the TicWatch Pro 3's power-saving mode. As with all Wear OS smartwatches you use horizontal gestures to swipe through the widgets which are no longer limited to five on the TicWatch Pro 3 like they used to be. From the top you bring up a quick panel to mute the smartwatch put it into sleep or airplane mode or make the connected smartphone ring when it can't be found. A vertical upward gesture opens the notifications panel.

Mobvoi initially only launched the TicWatch Pro 3 LTE in Germany and the UK where it only connects to the Vodafone network. The menu item for setting up the eSIM profile on the watch only appears in the Wear OS app when a SIM card with the Vodafone OneNumber service is inserted in the smartphone. After setting up the eSIM profile you can limit the data volume and deactivate data roaming if necessary. The watch displays notifications including emojis in a summarized overview. A double tap on a single notification enlarges the preview of the respective notification but it doesn't open it so it's never displayed completely. You can delete them individually or all at once.

Health and fitness In addition to Google's health apps Mobvoi installs its own apps that measure heart rate and blood oxygen saturation and display their daily and weekly trends. Furthermore the fitness tracker shows you the number of steps calories burned and sleep quality; it also evaluates the current noise level and guides you through breathing exercises. As mentioned initially you should open all the watch apps at least once at the beginning to allow access to the sensors and adjust further settings. On the iPhone the TicWatch syncs steps heart rate sleep data calories burned and the duration of workouts with Apple Health if desired. Data and charts on health and fitness tracking can be viewed directly on the watch at any time and in parallel in the Mobvoi app on the smartphone. The following selection shows a small sample of the dashboard on the smartphone and a large part of the possible views on the watch.

Blood oxygen saturation and sleep tracking The TicWatch Pro 3 LTE automatically measures oxygen saturation at night and several times a day if desired. We also compared additional individual manual measurements with a medically certified device; on average the smartwatch was off by 1% compared with the certified measuring device.

Workout tracking Even if it's not in the name like with the TicWatch Pro 3 GPS the TicWatch Pro 3 LTE also works independently of the smartphone during outdoor training thanks to a dedicated GPS. Like its counterpart it supports all common satellite systems. A training recognition feature automatically tracks walks training runs and bike rides - if activated because permanent monitoring naturally shortens battery life. The fitness tracker only records the route when you confirm the detected activity. If you ignore the notification you can still save the run or bike ride at the end; only the map is missing from the log in this case. The 13 workout modes in the training app including elliptical trainer rowing machine and swimming are the same as in the GPS model. After specifying the pool length the sports watch notifies you of an achieved distance or alternatively of a time goal that has been reached. Sports like aerobics alternatively report the achievement of the targeted calorie consumption. The Free Style mode logs multiple sets if required. A HIIT workout mode such as in the Huawei Watch Fit or a separate time-controlled interval training mode such as in the Garmin Lily is missing. In particular we miss the Fitify app on the TicWatch Pro 3 LTE which was nice on the TicWatch Pro 3 GPS with its guided bodyweight workouts like Tabata.

Performance and battery life Among the smartwatches that we could subject to a browser test the superiority of the latest Qualcomm SoC which is found in both TicWatch Pro 3 models is impressive. Not only is the Snapdragon Wear 4100 faster than its predecessors but the TicWatch Pro 3 also performs better than the Galaxy Watch 3 with Samsung's Exynos 9110 and the Apple Watch Series 6 with the Apple S6.

Battery life Depending on the TicWatch Pro 3 LTE's many settings the runtime varied between 20 and 42 hours in the test. Decisive factors are for example whether heart rate and blood oxygen saturation are measured throughout the day and whether motion detection is activated. You should also pay attention to the selected watch face: Some have a dark gray background instead of a black one as seen in the picture on the left. They spoil the energy-saving potential of the AMOLED display at least when they brighten up in the sun. During a 10-minute call using the embedded SIM the battery dropped by 6% in the test. A full charge takes about 2 hours.

Verdict Test device provided by Mobvoi The measurable battery life advantage of the TicWatch Pro 3 GPS compared with other watches with Google's Wear OS was not immediately noticeable in the TicWatch Pro 3 LTE. The difference only becomes apparent when you consider what the TicWatch Pro 3 LTE can do. All-day SpO2 monitoring cellular connectivity motion detection and GPS tracking would not be possible in this way overall with the Wear OS competition. Thanks to GPS LTE and its extensive health-tracking settings the Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 3 LTE is currently one of the best-equipped Wear OS watches. In practice features like motion detection definitely motivate users to leave the car behind more often and do some physical activity instead a side effect that many hope to get with a wearable. However these features are hardly found in Wear OS watches because they reduce the already short battery life. The complex watch software is admittedly not for people who like simplicity: Discovering an option and finding it again can be tricky at times due to the elaborate structure of the interface.

Price and availability If you are in the United States you can easily find the TicWatch Pro 3 GPS model on Amazon for $299.99. At the time of writing the TicWatch Pro 3 LTE's cellular functionality can only be used in the UK Germany and Spain. You can find this model on Amazon UK for £329.99 (~$460).

Translator: - 571 articles published on Notebookcheck since 2020 Stephanie Chamberlain - Translatorsince 2020 I've been fascinated with technology ever since I got my very first Android smartphone which was quite a while ago. The power packed into such a small footprint still amazes me. Learning to program made my understanding of technology deeper and at the same time it expanded my interest to the area of desktop computers and laptops. All this led me to enjoy reading and watching reviews of new devices and that's how I stumbled upon Notebookcheck. I immediately found their reviews to be very comprehensive and luckily I've even had the chance of translating them since 2019. When it comes to the huge field of technology I'm currently also interested in specializing in Java programming. contact me via: LinkedIn",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdpem1vY2hpbmEuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjgvcmVkbWktazQwLXZzLW1vdG9yb2xhLWVkZ2Utcy1zcGVjcy1jb21wYXJpc29uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Redmi K40 vs Motorola Edge S: Specs Comparison,"It looks like Qualcomm gave life to a new niche of handsets after releasing the Snapdragon 870. We are talking about very affordable flagship killers powered by this chipset which is actually an upgrade of the Snapdragon 865+ released in 2020. It is not the best chipset by Qualcomm but it is still a flagship SoC with 5G connectivity and delivers amazing performance. The most affordable devices launched with this chipset are the Redmi K40 by Xiaomi and the Motorola Edge S. Which one is the best and which has the highest value for money? This comparison is here to give you the answer.

Xiaomi Redmi K40 vs Motorola Edge S

Xiaomi Redmi K40 Motorola Edge S DIMENSIONS AND WEIGHT 163.7 x 76.4 x 7.8 mm 196 grams 168.4 x 74 x 9.7 mm 215 g DISPLAY 6.67 inches 1080 x 2400p (Full HD+) Super AMOLED 6.7 inches 1080 x 2520p (Full HD+) IPS LCD PROCESSOR Qualcomm Snapdragon 870 octa-core 3.2 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 870 octa-core 3.2 GHz MEMORY 6 GB RAM 128 GB – 8 GB RAM 128 GB – 8 GB RAM 256 GB – 12 GB RAM 256 GB 6 GB RAM 128 GB – 8 GB RAM 128 GB – 8 GB RAM 256 GB – micro SD slot SOFTWARE Android 11 MIUI Android 11 CONNECTIVITY Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax Bluetooth 5.1 GPS Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax Bluetooth 5.1 GPS CAMERA Triple 48 + 8 + 5 MP f/1.8 + f/2.2

20 MP front camera Quad 64 + 16 + 2 MP + TOF 3D f/1.7

Dual 16 + 8 MP front camera BATTERY 4520 mAh fast charging 33W 5000 mAh fast charging 20W ADDITIONAL FEATURES Dual SIM slot 5G Dual SIM slot 5G

Design

Despite they are actually affordable flagships both Redmi K40 and Motorola Edge S come with an attractive design. The camera module is not invasive the screen-to-body ratio is high and the display has a punch hole design. According to Motorola the Edge S is splash resistant while Redmi K40 does not provide any protection against water at least officially. On the other hand the Redmi K40 is thinner and lighter thanks to its smaller battery and smaller display. If you want a device that fits better in a pocket and is easier to use with one hand then Redmi K40 is actually a better choice. But the protection against water offered by the Motorola Edge S is an important added value.

Display

If we consider the displays the Redmi K40 wins and you should choose it without thinking twice if you are looking for the best image quality. The Redmi K40 has a Super AMOLED display with a 120 Hz refresh rate and the HDR10+ certification as well as a very high 1300 nits peak brightness. It is almost a flagship display if we consider the color reproduction the refresh rate and the brightness. The Motorola Edge S has a midrange-class IPS display with a 90 Hz refresh rate and HDR10 certification as well as a lower 560 nits typical brightness. Despite the Redmi K40 has an AMOLED display both the phones feature a side-mounted fingerprint reader.

Specs & Software

As mentioned in the intro Redmi K40 and Motorola Edge S are fueled by the Snapdragon 870 mobile platform by Qualcomm. The SoC is paired with up to 8 GB of RAM and up to 256 GB of fast UFS 3.1 native storage. In terms of the hardware department it is essentially a draw. When it comes to the software you get a user interface close to stock Android with the Motorola Edge S and a highly-customized MIUI with the Redmi K40. Both the phones run Android 11 out of the box. Note that Motorola Edge S has expandable storage thanks to a micro SD slot while Redmi K40 does not.

Camera

The Motorola Edge S has a superior rear camera to the Redmi K40. It is composed of a 64 MP main sensor with an f/1.7 focal aperture a 16 MP ultrawide sensor with a 121 degrees FOV a 2 MP depth sensor and an additional TOF 3D sensor. Even the front camera department is better: it consists of a 16 MP main sensor and a secondary 8 MP ultrawide lens.

Battery

The Motorola Edge S packs a bigger battery with a 5000 mAh capacity while you get just 4520 mAh with the Redmi K40. The Redmi K40 has smaller dimensions thanks to its smaller battery but the Motorola Edge S provides a longer battery life. On the other hand the Redmi K40 charges faster with its 33W fast charging technology while Motorola Edge S stops at 20W.

Price

The starting price of the Motorola Edge S is €250/$302 while Redmi K40 starts from €280/$338. Those €30 do not make the difference. What does are the cameras and the displays. If you want a better display quality then go for the Redmi K40. But if you need a better camera phone then Motorola Edge S is actually better. I would actually choose the K40 because despite the Edge S has a better camera department it remains a mid-range camera phone.

As it turned out the smartphone received a screen no worse than that of the Mi 11 – it will be the latest generation OLED E4. Exactly the same displays are used in the new flagships of Redmi – K40 K40 Pro and K40 Pro +. The only difference is that the embedded camera in Mi 11 Lite is located in the left corner and in Redmi K40 its place is in the middle of the screen.

The screen diagonal of the Mi 11 Lite is 6.67 inches. The resolution is Full HD + and the frame rate is 120 Hz. There is no fingerprint scanner in the display it is located on the side in the same way as in the Redmi K40. The side frame of the device will not be made of metal.

The Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite is rumored to be built on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 775 SoC equipped with 6-8GB of RAM and 64-128GB of flash storage a 4150mAh battery and also supports 33W charging. The main camera of the model has three sensors – with a resolution of 64 8 and 5 megapixels. The official announcement of Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite should take place in March.

Xiaomi is the third smartphone brand globally Redmi Note series crosses 200 Million shipments milestone

Xiaomi was the first company to unleash a flagship with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 chipset. The brand revealed the Mi 11 in December alongside MIUI 12.5. Recently the company has officially announced the new flagship for global markets alongside the respective version of MIUI made for the global audience. Besides the new software skin and flagship the company used the opportunity to reveal details about its progress. Despite the ongoing pandemic that ravaged the market last year the brand managed to become the third-largest smartphone brand in the world. Redmi brand also broke some records last year.

Gizchina News of the week Join GizChina on Telegram

According to the brand’s report it is the first smartphone brand in ten markets which includes India as one of the most notable ones. Moreover it achieved at least the third position in 36 markets. The Chinese giant also is the fastest-growing brand in the high-end segment with an impressive 3639% growth year on year in Q3 2020. This includes devices that cost more than $500.

Xiaomi invested in the R&D department and improved its manufacturing process

Between the last quarter of 2019 and Q3 2020 Xiaomi invested over $1.3 billion in the R&D department. As a result 2143 camera tests that used to take 3 to 4 days have been fully automated. Nowadays the brand is capable of testing its cameras in just one day. The brand also improved its cameras and software. The Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro for instance kept the first place at the DxOMark camera ranking for 48 days. The Mi 10 Ultra was on top for nearly two and a half months. The Mi 11 also performed well in the camera benchmark website. The audio lab also is doing equally successfully. The Mi 10 Pro was the best phone in the DxO Audio tests for most of 2020. The brand also has more labs for the development of 5G displays and one that improves the phone’s overall stability.

Besides the Mi branded phones that are doing quite well in the high-end segment the company’s Redmi branch is also bringing a lot of money. So far the Redmi Note series has shipped more than 200 million units around the world. For comparison that number was just 140 million in November of last year and 100 million in October 2019. We expect these numbers to reach a new higher spot in 2020 with the arrival of the Redmi Note 10 series. Just like the Chinese Redmi Note 9 series we expect Redmi to bring at least two 5G smartphones in the Redmi Note 10 series.

Worth noting that Xiaomi growth also comes in light of Huawei’s demise. However we have to credit the former for knowing how to take the best of an opportunity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9yZWRtaS1rNDAtcG9jby1mMy1yZWJhZGdlLWRpc2N1c3Npb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Would you like to see the Redmi K40 with Snapdragon 870 as the Poco F3?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9yZWRtaS1rNDAtcG9jby1mMy1yZWJhZGdlLWRpc2N1c3Npb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

If I were any further in you would have to surgically remove me from Bobby Lashley. This is a long time coming I love it so much. I have been singing the praises of Bobby for far too long Lashley is a guy that for me I just see dollar signs when I look at him. It’s just a matter of the stars aligning and putting him in the proper position. Here’s a guy that loses the U.S. Championship lays out Drew McIntyre at the end of Elimination Chamber and now is coming for The Miz and the WWE Championship. Give me Bobby Lashley marching into Raymond James Stadium as the WWE Champion against anybody I don’t care I’m here for it.

Graves co-host of the show NXT play-by-play man Vic Joseph agrees that Lashley is world championship material.

I’m in on Bobby Lashley as well I love the fact that he’s in the championship picture. It’s fresh it’s new it’s different. Bobby Lashley is someone who scares the majority of people. If you were walking down the street or in an alley or in a restaurant and accidentally dropped your drink on Bobby Lashley and he turned at you and gave you a glare you would probably wet your pants. When it comes to Bobby Lashley he is everything you think of when you wanna talk about a WWE superstar and champion. He is imposing he strikes fear in his opponents he strikes fear in the viewer at home and you watch Bobby Lashley and go ‘Yeah he can kick my ass.’ He’s not your everyday guy walking down the street.

Graves told co-host Vic Joseph that he believes Lashley has been standing out to him for years now and wants to see him enter WrestleMania 37 as the WWE Champion.

If I were any further in you would have to surgically remove me from Bobby Lashley. This is a long time coming I love it so much. I have been singing the praises of Bobby for far too long Lashley is a guy that for me I just see dollar signs when I look at him. It’s just a matter of the stars aligning and putting him in the proper position. Here’s a guy that loses the U.S. Championship lays out Drew McIntyre at the end of Elimination Chamber and now is coming for The Miz and the WWE Championship. Give me Bobby Lashley marching into Raymond James Stadium as the WWE Champion against anybody I don’t care I’m here for it.

Vic Joseph concurred with Graves praising the rise of Lashley as something new and fresh. Noting that Lashley is everything that you could want in a WWE champion he strikes fear into everyone and could kick your ass.

I’m in on Bobby Lashley as well I love the fact that he’s in the championship picture. It’s fresh it’s new it’s different. Bobby Lashley is someone who scares the majority of people. If you were walking down the street or in an alley or in a restaurant and accidentally dropped your drink on Bobby Lashley and he turned at you and gave you a glare you would probably wet your pants. When it comes to Bobby Lashley he is everything you think of when you wanna talk about a WWE superstar and champion. He is imposing he strikes fear in his opponents he strikes fear in the viewer at home and you watch Bobby Lashley and go ‘Yeah he can kick my ass.’ He’s not your everyday guy walking down the street.

Joseph continued teasing the idea that should Bobby Lashley defeat The Miz this coming week and go on to WrestleMania – Brock Lesnar should be the guy to step up to the challenge.

That’s the one guy that’s the marquee that’s the name. That’s something that’s been teased for years it has so much potential it draws. That’s a case again if you’re looking across at 2 guys that you know physically would beat your ass if you were out in a bar and did something. It’s not going to be a masterpiece it’s not going to be 30 minutes it’s going to be two pitbull’s in the ring human demolition derby it’s going to keep you glued on your television.

Tom Brady won an unprecedented seventh Super Bowl ring by defeating the Kansas City Chiefs at Super Bowl LV. The 2020 season finale which went down in Tampa Florida further strengthened Brady’s legend in the NFL.

But to prepare for the summit tie Tom Brady had to make sacrifices. To be the GOAT it’s no secret that Brady has had to often forego certain things in life.

And for Super Bowl LV it meant staying away from his family to channel into the champion mindset. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback had sent his family including his wife Gisele Bundchen and his three children to their Florida mansion 12 days before the Super Bowl tie.

This meant that the quarterback stayed alone at home to prepare for the game against the Kansas City Chiefs. And in the end this ultimately helped Brady and his side lift the Lombardi Trophy. However one man has been a bit critical of Brady’s approach to the Super Bowl game.

Was sending his family packing a step too far for Tom Brady?

Three-time Emmy award-winning writer and producer Damon Lindelof during a segment of the Rich Eisen Show talked about how he felt that Brady sending his kids packing was a bit much of the quarterback.

“I do feel there’s a part of me as a father that (believes) you shouldn’t be able to send your children away as an excuse for excellence in any field” said Lindelof.

Lindelof a Jets fan admitted that his hatred for the Patriots franchise is deep-rooted but said that his opinion is not based on that.

“Look I’m a Jets fan as well. So the from the moment that Bill Parcells left to go to New England I hated the Patriots. So this is nothing against Tom Brady personally because he was a Patriot for so long. And I can acknowledge that he is an incredible football player” he added.

Lindelof questions Brady’s greatness

But Lindelof said that he wouldn’t have had the same reaction had he told his wife to send their kids packing.

“So when I heard that he sent his kids packing for the latest Super Ball so he could get into the appropriate headspace to win the game. I was like ‘Dude you know what would happen to me if I said to my wife we need to send our son away for a couple of weeks because I’m writing this episode of television and it’s really important because it’s a finale.”

Taking a further dig at Brady the Emmy award winner questioned Brady’s greatness because of the decision.

“I kind of feel like if you have to send your kids away you’re not really that great. You know like how distracting are your kids. Just tell them to keep it down a little.”

So do you feel Brady took it a step too far? Or was it okay for him to need his own space with the Super Bowl on the line?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3RoYXRncmFwZWp1aWNlLm5ldC8yMDIxLzAyL2NoYXJ0LWNoZWNrLXRoZS13ZWVrbmRzLWJsaW5kaW5nLWxpZ2h0cy1iZWNvbWVzLWZpcnN0LXNvbmctaG90LTEwMC1oaXN0b3J5LWVhcm4tNTAtd2Vla3MtdG9wLTEwL9IBhwFodHRwczovL3RoYXRncmFwZWp1aWNlLm5ldC8yMDIxLzAyL2NoYXJ0LWNoZWNrLXRoZS13ZWVrbmRzLWJsaW5kaW5nLWxpZ2h0cy1iZWNvbWVzLWZpcnN0LXNvbmctaG90LTEwMC1oaXN0b3J5LWVhcm4tNTAtd2Vla3MtdG9wLTEwLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chart Check: The Weeknd’s ‘Blinding Lights’ Becomes First Song in Hot 100 History To Ear...,"Ahead of his epic Super Bowl LV performance (click here to watch) The Weeknd was already scribbled in Hot 100 history books for the ongoing success of his 2019 ‘After Hours’ hit ‘Blinding Lights’ which is listed as the longest-running top 5 and longest-running top 10 hit ever.

In addition to watching his tune ‘Save Your Tears’ rocket into the Hot 100 top 5 for the first time (marking his third ‘After Hours’ song to reach the chart region) Tesfaye’s learned ‘Lights’ – at #4 on the refreshed tally – is shining in the top 10 for its 50th week.

It not only extends his record for longest-running top 10 (and top 5) hit but also comes as the first time any artist has enjoyed as lengthy of a run inside the tally’s topmost dectet with one song.

The Nvidia video cards offer a substantial performance increase over the RTX 20XX video cards without a price increase.



Since its release last year the new RTX 3060 Ti RTX 3070 RTX 3080 video cards have been popular and sold pretty fast everywhere. The Nvidia video cards offer a substantial performance increase over the RTX 20XX video cards without a price increase. The company is offering the latest line-up of video cards to replace the RTX 20XX series from gamer's PCs.

With that said the demand for the RTX 30XX video card line-up has been extraordinarily high especially for people who are into PC-building and looking for the best specs into their computers to play out high-graphics games as IGN reports

However there are ways to score the RTX 3060 Ti and other video cards from the line-up. PC manufacturers have built-in RTX 30XXs on their PCs and offer prebuilt computers with Nvidia video cards. Below are some stores selling PCs that feature an RTX 30XX line-up.

Dell and Alienware RTX 30XX Gaming PCs

Alienware is typically known for being pricey when it comes to their gaming PCS. But customers get what they paid for in terms of quality and customer support. Unlike other vendors Dell produces their own cases and cooling systems. Their desktop and entire Alienware line-up feature an excelent build quality and brand-name components.

SkyTech RTX 30XX PCs

The Skytech brand is unpopular but their budget gaming PCs offers makes them stand out from the competition. Customers can specifically order an RX 3060 Ti or RTX 3080 gaming PC from Amazon and receive it by the end of the month. SkyTech sources its parts depending on what's cheapest at the time; the brand and model of individual components can differ from system to system.

iBuyPower

IBuyPower is a boutique vendor that caters exclusively to gamers. Customers can buy one of the preconfigured options. such as an iBuyPower AMD Ryzen 3 3300X RTX 3060 Ti with 16GBs of RAM and a 500SSD card. But the stores claim to fame is the almost unlimited amount of possibility of customizability.

RTX 3060 Ti Features

Cnet reports that the RTX 3060 Ti has a smaller size than that of the RTX 2060 and it is rated to draw 170 watts compared to the 200 watts of its siblings. That means it is more likely to be compatible with the smaller capabilities.

The RTX 3060 Ti has an 8GB GDDR6 graphics memory and a 256 bit of memory space that data can go in and out faster. The graphics card also makes a good midrange choice for moderately intensive imaging work that occasionally uses GPU-accelerated filters and AI.

Nvidia Implements a Tamper-proof Lockdown for RTX 3060

According to Forbes. Nvidia was curtailed the mining performance of the RTX 3060 on purpose to make the graphics card less appealing to would-be miners. The company has implemented a tamper-proof lockdown of the driver RTX 3060 core and BIOS to halve mining performance.

DG2 Xe-HPG variants start from 96 EUs and 4 GB GDDR6 VRAM and will top-out at 512 EUs with 16 GB GDDR6 VRAM to take on NVIDIA GA104 and AMD RX 6800 offerings.

Intel recently introduced its first modern dGPU the DG1 or Xe Max for Tiger Lake laptops and select desktop configurations. During the previous Architecture Day event Intel's graphics chief Raja Koduri said that the company will soon launch DG2 or Xe-HPG products aimed at mainstream gamers and content creators. While we've been hearing about Intel DG2 for quite some time now a recent leak points to possible variants slated to launch later this year.

The info comes from several sources including @harukaze5719 @OneRaichu and @hougetsu on Twitter. We've previously reported that Xe-HPG may feature up to 512 execution units (EUs) or 4096 stream processors (SPs) and that Intel is exploring the possibility of scaling it up to 960 EUs as well. While we are still unsure about the 960-EU part we are now getting to see some information about what all SKUs can be expected along with their VRAM capacities.

According to @hougetsu and @harukaze5719 who happened to decode @OneRaichu's cryptic tweet Xe-HPG could be available in at least six variants. These include:

512 EUs (4096 SPs) / 256 bit-bus / 8 or 16 GB VRAM

384 EUs (3072 SPs) / 192 bit-bus / 6 or 12 GB VRAM

256 EUs (2048 SPs) / 128 bit-bus / 4 or 8 GB VRAM

192 EUs (1536 SPs) / 128 bit-bus / 4 GB VRAM

128 EUs (1024 SPs) / 64 bit-bus / 4 GB VRAM

96 EUs (768 SPs) / 64 bit-bus / 4 GB VRAM

The SKUs start from 96 EUs and go all the way up to 512 EUs. Intel already offers a 96-EU part with DG1 so we can expect the corresponding DG2 version to be faster with improved IPC and with GDDR6 RAM instead of LPDDR4x. The 256 384 and 512-EU variants offer double VRAM choices as well with the highest being 16 GB GDDR6 on a 256-bit bus.

Going by available specs alone RTX 3060 Ti/RTX 3070 levels of performance with the 512-EU variant is not improbable at the very least though the RX 6800 is also a potential competitor here in terms of available memory bandwidth.

While other details of Xe-HPG DG2 aren't yet available we do know that the 384-EU SKU is likely to have a die area of 190 mm2. According to Intel DG2 would be made fabbed in an external foundry which we hear will be a TSMC 6 nm node. It is not yet known how these cards would be named but the company may follow a nomenclature similar to NVIDIA and AMD.

Earlier this month NVIDIA announced its CMP HX family of Crypto Mining Processors which are intended for professional miners looking to make some big bucks. This week we found out that the entry-level CMP 30HX and 40HX feature the Turing TU116 and TU106 GPUs respectively.

Today VideoCardz revealed that the next step up in the family -- the CMP 50HX -- is also based on Turing specifically the TU102. The CMP 50HX is thus closely related to the previous generation flagship GeForce RTX 2080 Ti.

GeForce RTX 3080

But more interesting is the fact that the top-of-the-line CMP 90HX features the GA102 which means that it's most closely aligned with the current Ampere-based GeForce RTX 3080. Gamers probably won't like the idea of hard-to-find Turing GPUs destined for crypto mining cards but NVIDIA previously revealed that these GPUs ""don't meet the specifications required of a GeForce GPU and thus don't impact the availability of GeForce GPUs to gamers.""

The report opines that these crypto mining GPUs most likely have ""broken Tensor RT TMUs or ROPs [that] renders them unfit for the GeForce badge but still good enough to serve as a slave in a mining farm doing complex mathematical equations."" That sounds like a fair deal to us.





The hash rate of the CMP 90HX more than triples that of the entry-level CMP 30HX while nearly doubling up on the CMP 50HX. However the CMP 90HX is also quite a bit more power-hungry with a 320-watt TDP.

NVIDIA's CMP 30HX and 40HX will supposedly be available from board partners like ASUS EVGA Gigabyte and MSI in March. The CMP 50HX and 90HX however will launch during the second quarter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGVib29rY2hlY2submV0L0h1YW1pLW9mZmljaWFsbHktY2hhbmdlcy1pdHMtbmFtZS10by1aZXBwLUhlYWx0aC41MjU1OTEuMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Huami officially changes its name to Zepp Health,"Huami is a wearables OEM that has built a market leadership worldwide mainly through the popularity of its Amazfit devices. Now the company has announced that it will be known as Zepp Health from now on. This wholesale re-brand is intended to consolidate its position across all its businesses going forward

4 Reviews

Huami Corporation originally gained recognition as the ODM for the Xiaomi Mi Band line of fitness trackers. It subsequently struck out on its own through its Amazfit line of wearables which now range from the experimental flexible-display X to the broadly-appealing affordable Bip series. Now it has announced a name change that as it believes will keep this success going.

It has announced that it has officially (and legally pending regulatory approval) transformed into Zepp Health Corporation a rebadging that applies to all of its markets worldwide and every aspect of its business: even its New York stock exchange (NYSE) ID is now ZEPP.

This transition has been in the works since it bought the Zepp (a company originating in Silicon Valley with an association with health technology) brand recently: for example Huami wearables have paired to phones using the app of this name for quite a while now.

The company has adopted this name across the board in an effort to underpin the connection between human welfare and technology that as it asserts it represents. Huami - sorry Zepp Health - has also done this to hammer the fact that it is no longer merely a wearables-maker home.

Indeed it asserts that it has also ""developed a platform of proprietary technology including AI chips biometric sensors and health data algorithms"". Using this not to mention its new name it intends to expand into many more areas of health tech including connected health products analytics for insurers and precision possibly actually clinical sensors.

To this end the company has secured ""strategic partnerships"" with companies in these fields such as Hyperfine Promaxo and Prudential Asia to bring these goals to fruition. Finally the corporation has declared that ""Zepp"" is more universal across cultures and languages as well as simply easier to say.

However it has yet to outline the effect this change will have on Amazfit and the brand recognition it has built up not to mention that of its various series which have multiplied to include GTS GTR Stratos and T-Rex to date.

In addition to sites like r/WallStreetBets and Discord many traders have turned to the financial side of Twitter colloquially known as ""FinTwit"" for investment ideas.

What Happened: Nathan Michaud founder of Investors Underground joined Pennies Going In Raw hosts Hugh Henne and Dan Knight to discuss the influence of Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) on the market.

Why It Matters: The trio noted to listeners that many of the bigger influencers on Twitter can influence the price of a stock. There is nothing illegal or wrong with simply stating that one likes a stock or sharing research. As Michaud explains that line is crossed if the influencer is taking money to promote the stock.

“If you’re getting compensated for stocks you should be disclosing it and you shouldn’t be trading them” Michaud said.

In his very early days of trading Michaud gained first-hand experience dealing with the SEC regarding compliance issues. While Michaud was in college he began helping companies improve their websites. From there he put information about the companies on his stock ideas website as well.

“Where I went wrong was I was trading them as well” Michaud said.

Many traders including Michaud have expressed their disapproval of a large Twitter account tweeting out a stock pick and then selling that stock as soon as it shoots up — basically a Twitter-fueled pump and dump.

“I think it comes down to intent. So I have mad respect for people that buy and actually hold. ... If you’re tweeting just to exit right into that I don't think that’s the best thing to do” Michaud said.

Diamond Hands: Michaud says it is difficult for investors to pass up easy gains. Specifically Michaud went on to describe how impressed he was that Mr. Zack Morris held his AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) trade for so long refusing to take early gains.

“He crushed it I gave him a lot of credit. It’s very hard to not take gains. In order to get where he got with AMC he had to not take X not take 2x not take 5x... that’s hard to do. Heavy kudos to him” Michaud said.

Current Market Conditions: Henne Knight and Michaud also discussed how abnormal the current market climate is for newer investors.

“I don't think that people get how great it is that are just starting out — this is not normal” Michaud said. “It’s not always like this.”

Michaud went on to compare the current market climate to that of the dot-com bubble of the late 90s.

Story continues

“Clearly there’s some sort of a bubble. You can either complain about it or do your part to inflate it. I’m doing the second” Dan said.

Michaud went on to explain that days and days of a stock running up could come crashing down in a much shorter time frame.

“I’m very good at waiting and waiting and letting it roll over. You could have that two three week run up and that’s great but that can unravel in one hour. And so that’s why I really like shorting... and it happens to be something I’m very good at.”

Trump was sicker with Covid-19 in October than publicly acknowledged at the time with extremely depressed blood oxygen levels at one point and a lung problem associated with pneumonia caused by the coronavirus according to four people familiar with his condition.

His prognosis became so worrisome before he was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center that officials believed he would need to be put on a ventilator two of the people familiar with his condition said.

The people familiar with Mr. Trump’s health said he was found to have lung infiltrates which occur when the lungs are inflamed and contain substances such as fluid or bacteria. Their presence especially when a patient is exhibiting other symptoms can be a sign of an acute case of the disease. They can be easily spotted on an X-ray or scan when parts of the lungs appear opaque or white.

Mr. Trump’s blood oxygen level alone was cause for extreme concern dipping into the 80s according to the people familiar with his evaluation. The disease is considered severe when the blood oxygen level falls to the low 90s.",,,,,,,,,

“Based on my recent visit in the last two days we are now 40% (complete) in the vertical and horizontal infrastructure. That’s why I told them that if we will be completing 10% per month we are within our timeline of completing the rehabilitation by December 2021” TFBM chief Chairman Secretary Eduardo Del Rosario said in a statement.

“So we are now 40% in terms of accomplishment. Based on our Master Development Plan we are on track with the target that we have set” Del Rosario added.

The TFBM is spearheading the war-torn city's rehabilitation together with its 56 implementing agencies and partner organizations by providing emergency financial livelihood food medicine and shelter assistance.

The TFBM rehabilitation's second phase - debris management - focused on removing millions of tons of debris following the five-month-long battle between government forces and the ISIS-influenced Maute terror group.

Also during the phase unexploded bombs were recovered and detonated.

The phase took one year and four months to complete.

The next phase of the rehabilitation is the construction of vertical and horizontal infrastructure which started in July last year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Permanent housing units were constructed by UN-HABITAT with a $10-million grant from the Japanese government on a 1.8-hectare property provided and developed by the Social Housing Finance Corporation.

On May 23 2017 pro-ISIS terrorists belonging to the Maute group led by brothers Omar and Abdullah with the help of the Abu Sayyaf faction under Isnilon Hapilon occupied Marawi City triggering a five-month armed conflict that resulted in over a thousand deaths and leaving the city in ruins.

The occupation also stunned a Philippine military inexperienced in urban combat and stoked wider concerns that Islamic State loyalists had gained influence among terror groups in Mindanao. — DVM GMA News",,,,,,,,,,,,

The city is served by two waste collection companies with Republic Services serving the west side of Stockton and Waste Management the east. On Monday both haulers will begin imposing fees on customers for improperly filling their carts.

Residents in Stockton are provided with three carts: organics recycling and trash. Customers who put items not allowed in the carts or fill them too full could be hit with charges ranging between $6.09 to $18.20.

The city says the move is not aimed to be a punitive measure.

""This just allows us to be able to get people to properly separate their materials while also having the materials removed from the curbside"" Grace Smith Stockton's solid waste manager said.

The franchise agreement between the city and the two companies which was renewed last January and will be in effect for 10 years allowed for the haulers to impose surcharges for customers not following waste disposal guidelines Smith said. She called contamination and overfilled carts as a ""long-standing problem.""

Mailers sent out by both Waste Management and Republic Services in the last month or so informed customers that the charges would go into effect after three incidents of overage and/or contamination within three months. Continued violation could also lead to a customer receiving a larger bin or face an increased rate to accommodate excess waste and contaminates.

Excess waste includes leaving trash recycling or organics directly on the curbside or bins being so full that the lid doesn't close all the way. Contamination includes things like putting items in the wrong carts such as throwing trash in with the recycling.

Molly Gomez the municipal manager for Republic Services in Stockton says the company has seen an ongoing increase of contaminations. She said this is an opportunity.

""We're seeing an increase amount of contaminations on a daily basis"" Gomez said. ""So we're using this opportunity to educate the public on how to properly utilize the recycle and organics carts.""

One misconception Gomez says is that plastic bags can be placed in with the recycling.

""They get caught up in the machinery causing delays and damage to the equipment"" Gomez said. ""The bags also contaminate the bales of clean recyclables with nonrecyclables.""

Bales that are found to be contaminated also can't be recycled and are then sent to the landfill Gomez said. That's why helping to educate the public is the main goal she said.

Paul Rosynsky senior communications specialist for Waste Management said that plastic bags make up about 80% to 85% of contamination.

""A lot of people are just putting their recycling in a trash bag or in a plastic bag and then putting that whole bag in the recycling cart"" Rosynsky said. ""We can't stress enough that you should not be doing that that you need to keep your recycling loose in the cart — loose and dry.""

Rosynsky also said that tightening recycling restrictions on contaminants both from the state and internationally have made it more vital for customers to be vigilant about what items they throw into what bin.

Both Waste Management and Republic Services provide online general guidance regarding what waste can and should go into each cart. The companies have also partnered with the city with a more detailed and area-specific list of dos and don'ts for recycling green waste and what should ultimately end up at a landfill called StocktonRecycles.com. It also allows you to search the site by typing in what item you're looking to dispose of as well as provides some ideas for reuse.

The companies and the city say the new surcharges aren't meant hassle customers about minimal violations such as someone's neighbor throwing a bag of dog poop in their recycling cart.

""We're not checking for those little objects like that"" Rosynsky said. ""We're looking for gross contamination.""

Organics and recycling carts which are the main focus for contaminants have contamination thresholds of 3% and 10% respectively to incur surcharges for violations Smith said.

Haulers must also provide evidence to customers of violations Smith said such as documentation photos or video. Republic Services says it is using auditors to randomly check customers carts while Waste Management has installed cameras on their trucks that will be reviewed by auditors.

The companies can notify customers of a violation in a variety of ways such as electronically via email or text message and by leaving notification tags on carts Smith said.

""In all instances the customer receives a letter regarding the service' Smith said.

Both companies also have apps that can be downloaded that customers can use to receive alerts and manage their accounts.

Customers can report to the companies if they believe they have been improperly cited for a violations such as a cart being identified with the wrong address or someone else illegally dumping trash in someone else's carts.

""It's a huge concern of customers but It's not something that we see happening regularly at all"" Rosynsky said.

Residents can also report problems to the city but Smith said they should start with speaking to the companies themselves. She also noted that if needed additional carts can be provided at a reduced or no cost.

""We do recognize the fact that nobody is perfect there's always going to be some level of contamination"" Smith said.

The Suppliers Partnership for the Environment (SP) is a collaborative forum that brings together global automotive manufacturers those in the supply chain the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other government bodies to synergize on a vision for positive environmental impact. The newest project SP members produced is the guidance document “Sustainable Packaging Specification Recommendations for Automotive Manufacturing Operations.”

The recommendations in the report discuss “opportunities to minimize automotive packaging waste and address potential barriers to recyclability in the design phase based on proven best practices that have been implemented by industry environmental sustainability leaders.”

Sophia Borroni-Bird sustainability lead at General Motors (GM) speaks about the benefits of the partnership saying “the collaboration drives down the cost of the materials. More importantly creating a circular economy and addressing climate change can’t be done in a vacuum.”

GM has been a member of SP for years alongside Call2Recycle Covanta Audi Mexico Ford Motor Company Henkel Honda North America Li-Cycle TerraCycle Waste Management and others.

“The collaborative platform has allowed trust and relationships to be built over time” Borroni-Bird says.

When she formally joined the group in 2019 Borroni-Bird brainstormed with other OEM representatives to gauge interest in the formation of a group focused on sustainable materials. The Materials Efficiency Working Group (MEWG) was the result of the discussions.

“The process involved developing common definitions a mission and a short-term timeline” she explains. “We started by only have the OEMs and then quickly realized the importance of extending the group to include suppliers. Since Q4 2019 we have outlined a mission collected supplier survey feedback and received proposals on methods to increase sustainable content in common components as well as finalize this packaging initiative to encourage sustainable packaging across the industry.”

The original document developed by John Bradburn on behalf of SP member company ERA Environmental Management Solutions allows OEMs to take a collaborative approach to solve some of the biggest challenges and address potential barriers in automotive packaging such as logistics.

Bradburn says “this project is about companies working together through SP to share knowledge and lessons learned over many years of work to minimize waste across the automotive industry and promoting the thinking and action that is needed to tackle packaging waste minimization and pave the way for others to follow the same path.”

The first recommendation provides a backbone for the remaining guidance stating “when building business cases for packaging design and logistics include and communicate to procurement/purchasing/supply chain managers a total enterprise financial scope that considers all corporate goals and strategies including health safety and the environment.”

Sustainability is an integral component throughout the document explaining how automotive manufacturers can implement it in the value chain including:

Whenever possible source parts modules and other products using returnable packaging and base this decision on lifecycle factors.

Avoid using foams in packages that include spacers and dunnage if possible as most foams (polystyrene polyurethane and other thermoset products) are difficult to recycle.

If a foam packaging product is sourced expanded polypropylene (EPP) may be more recyclable than other foam options.

Combination packaging (specifically incorporating multiple materials) should be avoided whenever possible.

Pallet and container separation ease improves reuse and recycling potential.

Avoid using metal clips on plastic banding.

Avoid using metal brackets and wood to reinforce cardboard/OCC boxes.

Whenever possible avoid one-time use packaging and assembly aids.

Plastic corrugate which many times is polypropylene should not be sourced with mixed plastics or metal fasteners unless material is intended for reuse

LDPE plastic bags and bubble wrap and other film can be reused or baled and placed into a plant recyclable film program.

Use of expanding polyurethane foam in packages should be avoided especially when formed within plastic bags

Wooden crates even for small batch shipping use should be designed with ease of disassembly for reuse and/or shredding for recyclability in mind.

Over time the “participation and engagement from the suppliers especially those that are commonly shared amongst the OEMs provides the coordinated savings of larger-scale positive actions” says Mark Yamauchi Toyota Motor North America sustainability manager.

Going forward each automotive manufacturer will adapt the guidelines as appropriate and develop its own set of metrics to measure results. “Thus it is anticipated that it may be difficult to establish common analytics” Yamauchi says. “Success may end up be gauged anecdotally.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MveWVzLW5pa29sYS1hbmQtdHJldm9yLW1pbHRvbi1saWVkLXRocm91Z2gtdGhlaXItdGVldGgtMTU2OTI1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yes Nikola and Trevor Milton Lied Through Their Teeth,"Once the most promising automotive startups Nikola saw quite a proverbial fall from grace in 2020. It doesn’t look like 2021 will be much different despite obvious efforts to right all the wrongs that have been done.

At one point Nikola and its over-confident founder and CEO Trevor Milton were promising the world to investors and potential customers. They would deliver an electric / fuel cell pickup to rival Tesla’s Cybertruck the Badger  and they would also be bringing their flagship hydrogen-powered truck Nikola One into production along with Two and Tre.And that was just the top of the iceberg in terms of what they bragged about doing or being able to do in the foreseeable future.All changed in September 2020 when short-seller Hindenburg published a damning report on how Milton in particular and Nikola in general had blown up a bubble with nothing but hot air inside  leeching cash from investors with outright lies. An “intricate fraud” is the exact phrase used to describe Nikola and all its claims of revolutionizing the auto industry.The damning reports sent Nikola stock down forced General Motors to admit to its mistake and back out of the deal to make the Badger and more importantly triggered separate investigations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department as well as an internal review. Milton was eventually ousted as CEO but as part of his exit Nikola is paying his attorney fees.The findings of that Nikola internal review conducted by law firm Kirkland & Ellis were made public and – what do you know?! – it turns out that the bubble was filled with hot air indeed.Nine of the statements made by Milton and Nikola have been found entirely or partially inaccurate Bloomberg reports. As it so happens it’s on these statements that Nikola built itself a reputation of the most innovative company drawing millions in investments and pre-orders.More to the point Milton lied when he said that the Nikola One prototype shown in 2016 and then in the now-viral 2018 video was “fully functional.” Consequently he also lied when he lashed out at the media for reporting that the truck could not have been operational since it was missing parts. And yes they lied when they claimed One moved under its own power when they had in fact towed it up a hill and had it rolling downwards.Milton and Nikola lied about progress made with both One and the Badger and the technology they used had developed or were in the process of developing. They lied about using only in-house parts and they lied about owning natural gas wells which they used as backup to solar hydrogen production. They lied about the solar panels on the roof of the company’s HQ and how much energy they produced. They lied about the amount of hydrogen produced at the Nikola demo stations.Hilariously despite the fact that Nikola pretty much lied through its teeth to get investors the company is fighting the notion that it’s a “fraud.” The internal review report which was filed with SEC and was followed by a shareholder meeting highlights the company’s current approach toward scaling down the scope of the operations. In other words let bygones be bygones and forget about how Nikola got started and focus on the future instead.The future isn’t looking bright either because the company is flailing financially.

A. Situation analysis

Description of the disaster

On February 17 according to the Iranian Seismological Centre a 5.6 magnitude earthquake hit the country. The epicentre was 11 km from Sisakht city 19 km from Madovan city and 20 km from Komeh city in Isfahan province. Based on the magnitude and the distance to the populated areas around a number of 19 cities with a population of 257661 individuals and 1144 villages have been affected by the disaster. So far six (6) aftershocks reported (the biggest is 3.6).

According to the report from the Ministry of housing 380 houses have been seriously damaged in Sisakht city and 47 in Samirom city. The total population in Sisakht is over 10000 individuals in Madovan district is 18078 and in Komeh city 2184. The total urban population is over 182000 with 45517 housing units while the total rural populations is 197140 with 48627 housing units.

The Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS) responded to the disaster from the very beginning. The provincial crisis management taskforce was set up in the capital of the province with the participation of the governmental organizations related to response operation. The taskforce is run by the National Disaster Management Organization (NDMO) in the provincial level.

Summary of the current response

Overview of Host National Society Response Action

The IRCS was established in 1922 (as the ‘Red Lion and Sun Society’) and became affiliated with the IFRC in 1924. It has over 8500 staff and some 1.5 million volunteers being active through the Youth Organization the Volunteers Organization and the Relief & Rescue Organization. IRCS has 500 local branches across the country. The National Society has strong auxiliary link to Government and is mandated under the Law on Crisis Management to conduct search & rescue activities relief services and to provide emergency shelter. In addition the IRCS is responsible for raising public awareness on disasters preparedness including the provision of related educational activities.

On the first day of the earthquake 147 villages were rapidly assessed by IRCS (121 villages in Kohgilouye-Boyerahmad and 26 in Isfahan). Five emergency ambulances deployed to deliver basic health care services to the injured people. Two emergency camps were set up for people in need while most of the affected people were reluctant to stay in the camps and preferred to stay at their houses yard. So it was decided to distribute one emergency family tent per family for those households with urgent needs. 63 persons injured out of which 36 received outpatient services by IRCS and 7 people were transferred to medical clinic by IRCS.

Since the immediate onset of the disaster and in line with responding to the urgent needs of the affected population the IRCS reached to 12130 persons through the distribution of 3331 relief tents 945 blankets 6644 kgs of plastic sheets 214 set of heaters 1965 food parcels (for 72-hours) and 70 ground sheets.

Overview of Red Cross Red Crescent Movement Actions in country

The IFRC has a presence in Iran since 1991 and has been providing technical support in Capacity Building initiatives and supporting IRCS in Disaster Management Shelter Disaster Law Youth and Health. There is no partner National Societies (PNS) present in the country however IRCS has a memorandum of understanding with a number of PNSs. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has a delegation based in Tehran with various number of humanitarian activities in cooperation with the IRCS and is on standby to support the IRCS operation (e.g. through health support to migrants mine risk education (MRE) restoring family links (RFL).

Overview of other actors’ actions in country

Efforts of Ministries local authorities national NGOs and the IRCS are coordinated by the National Disaster Management Organization (NDMO). IRCS delivers the relief rescue and emergency shelter. Sectoral services are led and implemented by line ministries. The governmental bodies and institutions are engaged in the on-going operation. UN agencies are present in-country including WHO FAO UNOCHA UN-Habitat UNDP UNHCR and UNICEF.

Portland Trail Blazers forward Robert Covington will take part in the Skills Challenge ahead of next Sunday's All-Star Game per Marc J. Spears of The Undefeated.

The Skills Challenge and Three-Point Contest will take place before the start of the All-Star Game in Atlanta on March 7 while the Slam Dunk Contest will be at halftime.

Covington entered Sunday averaging 7.3 points 6.4 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game in 30 starts for Portland.

The 30-year-old has been quiet offensively this season but he has proved himself as a versatile weapon with a career average of 12.3 points per game and 35.4 percent three-point shooting.

As Spears noted the Tennessee State product is also the only HBCU player in the NBA.

The NBA plans to honor historically Black colleges and universities at the All-Star Game this year with the league and players association pledging a combined $2.5 million to the schools plus COVID-19 relief.

Workers have been job hopping in the hopes of attaining better pay and career mobility in the uncertain Covid-19 economy and it is a trend that millennials and Gen Z are expected to dominate again in 2021. One in four workers plan to switch jobs this year an increased pace compared to last year. Of the one in five workers who switched jobs last year 33% identified as Gen Z and 25% as millennial according to a new study from IBM 's Institute for Business Value. Gallup identifies millennials as the most likely among generations to switch careers and suggests that six in ten millennials are open to new job opportunities. But the idea that millennials and Gen Z created this trend is a common misconception. Every generation job hops in their youth in the search for the right career fit and some data suggests that millennials are job hopping at a slower rate than their previous generational counterparts at the same age. Across the board younger people including those in their 30s and 40s are much more likely to shift jobs and take risks compared to older workers who are more established in their careers according to Gad Levanon vice president of the Labor Markets Institute at The Conference Board. With the worst of the pandemic behind the U.S. and accelerated vaccine rollouts nationwide people foresee a reopening of industries like retail and air travel and aren't as worried about significant layoffs or being the ""first to go"" in a new role. ""It's a period with a lot of changes and combined with strong economic growth people are no longer afraid to switch jobs"" Levanon said. Younger Americans are updating some of the tactics in career switches for a changing world. Not only are younger workers seeking job mobility but they're also looking for flexible and remote work schedules a need that's come to the forefront amid Covid-19. Many younger workers are also incorporating skills training to market themselves as more competitive candidates. The role of millennials in the job market is of growing significance. Based on July 2019 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau millennials have surpassed Baby Boomers as the largest living adult population and made up more than one-third of the U.S. workforce in 2018 according to Pew Research Center. The organization defines millennials as those born between 1981 and 1996 while Gen Z begins with those born in 1997.

Job seekers want good pay and benefits

Some of the most prominent reasons for job hopping include the desire for career mobility and higher wages a growing need as employer pension plans become a thing of the past and workers need to devote more of their incomes to retirement savings. Between 1975 and 2017 pension plans dropped from more than 103000 to just about 46700 according to the Labor Department. Younger workers are also sensitive to lack of recognition or transparent feedback from supervisors which can lead workers to feel undervalued and ultimately move to a new company where they may be in a better position to negotiate pay said Sarah Stoddard a career expert at Glassdoor. Several companies including global staffing firm Robert Half  offer salary calculators to job seekers as a tool to use for negotiations. Glassdoor has its own version called the Know Your Worth tool which offers pay recommendations based on market value. Read more from Invest in You

How three millennials earning over $100000 spend their money

Changing jobs? Consider transfer of 401(k) savings Amid this drive for higher wages and mobility corporations will need to shift how they prioritize and invest in employees to retain talent. For example companies may need to offer flexible benefits based on stages in life and internal mobility said Amy Wright managing partner of talent and transformation at IBM. One of the biggest concerns for workers as indicated in the IBM study is the need for more flexible schedules. Workers want a better work-life balance increased benefits and job support but they are also looking for skills development which can qualify candidates for jobs typically out of their reach Wright said. Fifty-eight percent of those surveyed by IBM said that they plan to take continuing education courses this year while roughly 30% of Gen Z and millennial respondents surveyed said they will enroll in a formal degree certification or badging program. Continuing education and skills building has emerged as a way for job seekers to distinguish themselves. IBM offers SkillsBuild a platform that allows workers to sharpen skills like their computer literacy or data analytics through online courses. Several major companies including Google and Microsoft 's LinkedIn also offer courses for workers as do online education platforms that have boomed during the pandemic including Coursera. The shift to online amid Covid-19 and growth of digital technology within the last decade has simplified the ability to job hop while making it easier for talent to interview and work for companies out of their region. ""It's an availability of opportunity that didn't exist in previous generations"" Wright said.

Switching jobs no longer a red flag

Once deemed a red-flag for recruiters switching jobs has become more common and accepted said Vicki Salemi a career expert at Monster. The pandemic will further destigmatize job-hopping but it also has led to financial stress that may further exacerbate the need to find new employment. With the rise of student loans and an uncertain economy there's a sense of urgency for new workers to find a job that pays the bill which means many individuals entering the job market are settling for jobs that aren't the right fit. ""They may not necessarily find the right fit in the first job or even the next one"" Salemi said. While new job seekers may struggle employers are becoming more open to candidates they may not have considered in the past. Data from the Monster's Future of Work 2021 Global Outlook found that industries including health care and hospitality are becoming more open to graduates without previous experience in the field while nearly half of large businesses surveyed are reporting higher acceptance of candidates living outside their geographic area.

There has long been this maligning of millennials as being job hoppers. I think that that's the wrong story. Job hopping is something we want to see more of.

Executive Overview

Applications platforms and the Internet of Things (IoT) are appearing in the solution portfolio of many software and automation suppliers. Each company has its own rationale for offering a platform but the underlying reason is that these companies need to move to an efficient modern application development and deployment environment.

There is still quite a bit of confusion in the marketplace about these platforms. Part of the confusion arises because the term “platform” is frequently applied to a variety of technologies. Computing infrastructure operating systems chipsets smartphones and a variety of other platforms are commonly encountered in technical discussions.

Most of the confusion has to do with the simultaneous commercial emergence of both the Industrial IoT and these various platforms. IIoT starts with connected physical things or devices. In many cases a second different platform is involved in connecting these “things.” Unfortunately it’s often difficult to distinguish between IoT device connectivity platforms and cloud application platforms with IoT functionality. This is largely due to the similar-sounding descriptions and attributes often used in marketing materials and on websites. Upon closer inspection it becomes clear that the former is primarily an edge platform and the latter primarily a cloud platform. We expect this confusion to continue because suppliers of both edge and cloud functionality are gradually expanding their capabilities to include both.

This report focuses primarily on the latter; cloud application platforms with IoT functionality. We have identified two main types of these platforms and will examine the strategies behind each. We also examine the relationship of these platforms to edge systems and devices and to IoT device connectivity platforms.

Among our findings is the fact that in addition to the move to a modern development and runtime environment a common driver is the idea that customers will benefit from a broad interoperable ecosystem of application suppliers and applications. We will consider this as well.

We include continuous process discrete manufacturing infrastructure and smart cities in our discussion.

Cloud Application Platforms (PaaS)

Cloud application platforms provide a modern approach for developing and deploying software applications. The approach is gradually displacing the older client/server model in which large complex monolithic applications were created and run. In practice the client/server model came to dominate both the IT and the OT software spaces in recent decades. But the pace of this changeover is accelerating as more companies embrace the modern platform approach.

This has sparked a “platform vs. platform” competition in the marketplace. Some large suppliers seek to become the dominant platform ecosystem with the broadest library of third-party applications often complemented by automation equipment and devices. Other suppliers and smaller companies are trying to figure out just how they should compete in the emerging environment.

Open Systems

The drive toward open systems can be seen in two levels: the cloud platforms/apps level and the automation and devices level. At the cloud platform/apps level many of the competing application platforms are based on the open source Cloud Foundry platform. Though built on an open platform the cloud application platforms are somewhat less open. At the automation level ExxonMobil and Lockheed Martin are some of the primary movers behind an open process automation initiative. For infrastructure/smart cities organizations like Duke Energy are pushing grid interoperability and peer-to-peer messaging.

The Platform and Edge Model

In developing the IIoT Platform architectural model ARC considered several important points:

The emergence of cloud application platforms as a next-generation development and runtime environment for the industrial space (and others)

The existence of IIoT device-level platforms whose main role is to provide and manage edge device connectivity and app deployment

Recognition that advanced analytics must be an integral part of IIoT solutions

The fact that edge devices and systems are fundamental to IIoT solutions

The emergence of fog as an important network and computing concept.

ARC’s IIoT Platform Model has two parts: platform and edge. Because the platform can serve a broader purpose we have chosen to label it “Application Platform with IoT Services.” We have labeled the second part “IoT Edge.”

Application Platforms w/IoT Services

The Application Platform w/IoT Services is fundamentally a cloud application platform a Platform as a Service (PaaS). It may be built on the open source Cloud Foundry platform or on a proprietary platform such as Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services both also known for providing cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The platform is an application development and runtime environment. As such it may be used for IoT or any other applications. Software is built as microservices. A basic microservice typically performs one simple function well. Basic microservices can be assembled into more complex compound microservices or as complete applications. The platform vendor creates commercial applications here and may permit third parties or customers to also build and deploy apps on the platform.

The cloud Application Platform comes with a Core set of (micro) services and development tools that can be used to build applications. A set of Analytics and Data services together with IoT/Edge services rounds out the basic requirements for the IoT platform. In addition some vendors may incorporate third-party or partner services as part of their platform offering.

IoT Edge

The IoT Edge is made up of edge devices and systems communications networks industrial control systems industrial software and connectivity software or platforms (such as those offered by PTC or Telit). The edge equipment may be “smart” that is with their own (embedded) computing and communications capabilities that can interface to local sensors and information and run local applications or analytics. Additional sensors and devices can be added to “dumb” infrastructure.

IoT apps can run on the edge devices in controllers and plant software systems or in the network switches and gateways. Depending on specific business models latency and processing requirements; apps may reside at the Edge in the Fog in the Cloud or some combination of these.

Why Ecosystems Matter

Marc Andreeson’s 2011 essay “Why Software is Eating the World” made the point that software increasingly plays a vital role in every company’s product and service offerings and can disrupt or transform businesses and entire industries. This is being driven in part by the availability and broad usefulness of machine learning technologies and technologies capable of dealing with massive amounts of data (which are also driving an exponential surge in connected devices that generate data from the edge) and by the availability of modern cloud application platforms.

Companies in industrial or infrastructure/smart cities segments are developing a huge appetite for software. They are generally not interested in developing software themselves and instead want to look to the competitive marketplace for most apps (though they also want to develop the occasional special app themselves). To support these customers apps will need to meet certain expectations for availability quality speed of deployment performance interoperability support and security.

A software supplier can try to keep up with all its customers’ needs and wants by building maintaining and updating its own software portfolio. Or it can elect to focus on core software and create a platform wherein any number of ecosystem partners can create apps to fulfill the needs of the marketplace. Today the differences seem minimal but in time the ecosystem approach may prevail as the number and variety of providers increases.

Strategies for Competing with Application Platforms

One of the most challenging aspects of winning in the digitization software and services market will be the many ways industrial platforms can be used to compete. By leveraging IaaS and PaaS companies can quickly develop apps and even entire software businesses without incurring the expense of building and maintaining the underlying computing hardware and software systems. On a given platform barriers to entry for new applications are low and multiple providers may offer similar apps or microservices. Solutions can also be embedded into hardware to quickly extend cloud-based services to compete at the edge. Companies can even use their competitors’ platforms to nibble away at their market share. Solution providers will also have to consider how to keep customers while also migrating them over to new pricing and use structures.

There are also challenges associated with user choices. With platform-based services users can choose and deploy solutions with much more freedom around length of use and depth of services. This is fundamentally different than the traditional “all-in” purchasing of larger software. As a result revenue is likely to be less consistent than traditional pricing models at least until the market more fully matures and users are converted to platform pricing models. Countering this dynamic is the fact that software subscriptions are annuities that can eventually provide a more stable revenue stream than license sales models.

The positive side to this dynamic is that it reduces some existing market barriers for solution providers. In the past some vendors particularly larger ones didn’t compete for certain types of business because deals simply weren’t large enough. Microservice-based solutions remove the deal-size barrier. On the other hand the ability to deliver smaller chunks at lower prices may increase the overall market size.

Finally there is a great deal of uncertainty among solution providers as to how big the digital software and service market will become in the industrial and infrastructure/smart cities segments. Many still wonder how a platform-based business model can open new revenue streams and how it compares to traditional software models.

Today two main competitive strategies are being used:

“Open IoT Operating System for Industry”

GE Predix Siemens MindSphere 3.0 and SAP Cloud Platform all are positioned as an “operating system” for industry. Each company is competing for a share of the cloud application platform market and wants to be seen as a preferred solution. Each hopes to benefit from having a partner and customer ecosystem in which everyone can contribute or consume apps via some type of app store. Each strives to make its own platform the dominant platform if not for all of industry then at least for certain sectors. And each embraces the concept of machine makers using its platform for monitoring smart connected products and offering related services to their own customers and others. At the very least each wants to be a premier competitor and top tier provider of a next-generation software PaaS for industrial and infrastructure companies.

GE and Siemens both leverage their industrial products and expertise to great advantage positioning themselves as premier platform providers AND automation and software solution experts in selected industrial spaces. SAP relies more on partnering and standards for OT connectivity but has an advantage when it comes to business system and extended supply chain integration.

“IoT Cloud Platform with Industry Solution Partners”

Companies such as Microsoft and Amazon focus on providing IaaS and PaaS cloud platforms for all industries not just the industrial infrastructure and smart cities sectors. Suppliers such as Schneider Electric and Honeywell build their IoT solutions on Microsoft Azure IaaS and PaaS. Others use Amazon AWS or other platforms. These suppliers also use the term “platform” for their software offering but have not positioned themselves as application platform providers. Instead they position themselves as automation and application experts in selected industrial infrastructure and smart cities spaces that now have cloud-based solutions. (“Automation Solution Expert with a Cloud-based IoT.”) The underlying IaaS/PaaS provider (Microsoft Azure Amazon AWS Google Cloud Platform) may become the base platform for other applications.

Other Important Platforms for Digital Transformation

In addition to the cloud application platform several other kinds of platforms are frequently encountered in digital transformation projects. We highlight a few of the most common ones below.

IIoT Device Level Platforms

IIoT Device Level Platforms provide connectivity to edge devices and systems. These platforms also typically provide tools for managing devices as well as developing and deploying applications on devices and in the cloud. They provide context for connected data and may offer modeling visualization and certain analytics tools. These platforms are often complemented by a cloud application platform so cloud-to-cloud integration capabilities as well as enterprise integration tools are often included.

Analytics Platforms

Until recently analytics and business intelligence platforms have been thought of as an engine and toolset for use by data scientists. Companies typically deployed these applications at the business level. Most were expensive monolithic and arcane; placing them out of reach for decision support for the typical business manager. But in recent years things have changed dramatically. Advanced analytics and machine learning tools are typically available as services in cloud application platforms. They are often provided by the platform supplier but may also be supplied by a third party. IBM Watson Services is an example of cognitive analytics services in the latter category.

Advanced analytics solutions particularly those that use machine learning to predict asset failure are becoming widely available in industrial markets. Asset failure prediction can be based on condition monitoring or can be part of a more complex asset performance management (APM) solution. The underlying techniques used can differ.

Statistical and single-layer reasoning analytics like decision trees draw conclusions. They are very effective at doing so and can be applied via machine learning for asset failure and predictive maintenance solutions. These methods are ideal for discovering hidden but known insights by filtering out noisy irrelevant data.

Cognitive analytics are suited for the volume and random nature of certain data particularly if unsupervised learning is called for. When applied to assets cognitive analysis can identify new patterns or outliers that will lead to degradation and failure.

Design and Engineering (PLM/BIM) Platforms

To a great extent Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) or Building Information Modeling (BIM) is still offered as a standalone platform. Solutions can be found that run in the cloud (SaaS) or deployed on a cloud infrastructure platform (IaaS). As of this writing we’re not aware of any major player in the PLM and BIM spaces that offers a significant Cloud Application Platform (PaaS) with microservices. Nevertheless these platforms remain important to industrial digitization and will be called upon to support two emerging requirements.

The first is providing digital design engineering and simulation capabilities to support design manufacturing and operations processes and thus provide the “digital thread” throughout these processes. Wearables augmented reality helmets or glasses mobile devices smart carriers smart containers smart components smart products autonomous machines video third-party services social additive manufacturing voice control remote sensing and more are becoming an active part of the real-time data-rich operations environment. New sensors gateways and networks will be added. Autonomous vehicles will be deployed. New smarter robots will be introduced. The list goes on and on but the key difference is the need to support rapid change in operations through digitization.

For many discrete manufacturers the second requirement is direct support for additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing continues to make unbelievable strides towards the manufacturing mainstream and has progressed farther and faster than almost anyone initially foresaw. Driven by materials science and design software advances this technology can already build optimum parts – in significant volume – that cannot be made any other way. 3D printing may be the most potentially disruptive technology in manufacturing. Companies failing to prepare for its emergence on an industrial scale could soon find themselves at a significant disadvantage.

Comments and Conclusions

In yet another example of IT technologies migrating into the OT space cloud application platforms are beginning to transform operations throughout the industrial and infrastructure operations landscape. This modern PaaS approach to application development and deployment is powerful efficient and flexible. It can be a very good way to take advantage of advances in machine learning and device connectivity to improve operations and maintenance or support smart products and the new services that accompany them.

When thinking about platform alternatives it is important to consider how your operation will want to leverage the platform. Do you expect to build apps yourself? Is it important to have an app marketplace offering third-party apps and microservices available to you? Do you prefer to have a single supplier provide most of the needed functionality?

In addition to these considerations pay special attention to the included or available machine learning/cognitive computing/artificial intelligence capabilities and how they match your needs. This can be a critical differentiator. Also consider carefully whether you will need a second device-level platform to support your applications or whether other means of edge connectivity will suffice.

This week on Talking Smack Seth Rollins stopped by to discuss the uninviting answer he received from Cesaro last night when the ""Swiss Cyborg"" interrupted his speech and mercilessly swung Rollins around for several minutes. ""The SmackDown Savior"" clarified to panelists Kayla Braxton and Paul Heyman that he never requested Cesaro to come out.

""Look look look. I did not invite Cesaro. You got it a little mixed up. He interrupted me"" Rollins informed. ""After walking out on me two weeks ago when I was trying to give an address to the Superstars in our locker room to tell them that SmackDown is about to get much better than it's already been he walked out on me. He stayed around to patronize me mind you. Then he walked out on me.

""This week he interrupts me. I try to offer him some guidance [and] some help because that's what he needs to get to the next level. He cannot do this without me. Everything thing I touch turns to gold. I was trying to help out a friend and that's how he repays me.""

Heyman took a moment to compliment Rollins' strides since his return at the Royal Rumble. He mentions that the Universal Champion and his former Shield brother Roman Reigns is watching his content very closely; however Heyman has some serious concerns about Cesaro's ferocious demeanor lately and alerts Rollins to watch out.

""I must admit to you that my 'Tribal Chief' Roman Reigns has seen the media that you've done recently. It's quite impressive"" Heyman mentioned. ""Roman Reigns is quite flattered by the words that you have bestowed upon him which makes me as 'Special Counsel' constraint; it's not because I think Cesaro is more of a man than you are but he is on such a tear lately. He has finally stepped into a zone that he has never been able to find before. That zone makes him — with his superhero strength — one of the most dangerous competitors in WWE.

""Now sir you are a visionary. A visionary that I myself am inspired by each and every week...You have a vision for SmackDown and its future that cannot be compared to. My concern is that Cesaro can disrupt that vision. I'm concerned for you.""

Rollins cuts Heyman off and reassures him that everything is going to be all right.

""That's a fair concern. Everything that you said about Cesaro is true"" Rollins replied. ""Everything I said about Cesaro when we stood in that ring together was absolutely true. I believe in his potential and I still do. As you know – 'Special Counsel' and the 'Tribal Chief' — sometimes things go the easy way. Sometimes it's an easy conversation; we get along and life is good. Other times that's not how people come to an understanding.

""Cesaro seems to have wanted to take the hard road. I don't know where that is going to lead the two of us but I can tell you that he's going to learn one way or another. I didn't want it to be this way. I tried to talk to him; he's made things difficult on his own. You have every right to be concerned. But I assure you everything is going to be ok. We're going to be just fine. I promise you.""

Click to skip ahead and see Chuck Akre's Top 5 Stock Holdings.

Akre Capital Management LLC founded in 1989 by Chuck Akre is an asset management firm with approximately $15.7 billion in private investments mutual funds and separately managed account assets.

Akre Capital Management's investment approach to choosing the potential pick is based on a ""three-legged stool"":

1. Strong business with a sustainable competitive advantage; 2. Exceptional management team; 3. Pattern of disciplined reinvestment.

These three factors qualify companies to be among Akre's investment opportunities and he refers to those companies as ""compounding machines"". Chuck differs from other asset managers in at least two important ways:

First when he buys a security he does not look on the exit point; He looks to compound the capital invested over a long term horizon.

Second Chuck benefits from the opportunity created in Wall Street through what he calls: ""beat by a penny miss by a penny"" syndrome. With a time frame ranged between five to ten years he grab the opportunities created through quarterly ""misses"".

Charles Akre Akre Capital Management

Charles Akre of Akre Capital Management

Akre Capital's Akre Focus Fund managed to outperform the S&P 500 Index by 3.5 percentage points annually between its inception in 2009 and March 2020. So if you are an investor in a dumb passive index fund you should consider investing in Akre's fund instead. As per the latest 13F filing Akre owned 28 stocks spread mainly across the Consumer Discretionary Industrial Financials and Technology sectors.

While Chuck Akre’s reputation remains intact the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 26 2021 our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 197.2% vs. 72.4% for the SPY (see the details here). That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.

Keeping this in mind let's take a look at the Chuck Akre's largest ten holdings for the last quarter. To be noted that no new investments were initiated during this quarter nor any position was fully closed.

Story continues

Akre’s 10th-largest holding is KKR & Co. Inc. (NYSE: KKR) a global investment company specializing in alternative investments. Akre allocates 4.03% of his portfolio to KKR being $596.27 million. He first bought 4.8 million shares during the first quarter of 2018 while its share price was trading at a level near $20 whereas now he owns 14.73 million shares and the company's share price is trading above $47.

Since 2016 AUM and management fees grew at a compounded annual growth rate of 18% and 15% respectively. The company announced an increase in its annual dividend by $0.04 per share to reach $0.58. Here is what Greenhaven Road Capital said about KKR in its 2020 Q4 investor letter:

“In 2021 KKR will close on their purchase of General Atlantic insurance company substantially increasing their permanent capital from 9% to 33% of AUM. 2021 should also see continued asset growth as they are in fundraising mode for their three largest strategies. Historically KKR has been excluded from the S&P 500 for governance reasons but the company will likely make changes to qualify for inclusion which would bring a large forced buyer to the stock. With its ballast of stable locked-up management fees KKR is designed to survive market fluctuations and economic cycles. The desire for pension funds and endowments to have a path to 8% returns in a zero-interest rate world should drive continued demand for KKR’s services. Quite frankly I believe that 2022 2023 and 2024 look rosy for KKR as well. “

9. SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ: SBAC)

The first time Akre initiated a position in SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ: SBAC) was in the first quarter of 2014. The position is currently the ninth-largest holding in the portfolio valued at $ 695.45 million representing 4.7% of the overall fund holdings. The position remained constant over the fourth quarter of 2020.

SBA Communications Corporation founded in 1989 is a real estate investment trust. It owns and operates wireless infrastructure used by mobile carriers and wireless broadband providers in North Central South America and South Africa.

The stock’s price increased by 17.1% in 2020. The company started paying dividends in 2019 and is currently paying $0.465 per share as a quarterly dividend (i.e. $1.86 yearly dividend). As per the company’s President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Stoops an increase in dividends is expected in 2021:

""Next quarter in conjunction with the preparation of our 2021 outlook we anticipate that our Board of Directors will be declaring a materially increased quarterly dividend which as is becoming our practice will remain the same on a quarterly basis through the course of the year.""

SBAC seems to be a recession resistant stock. Here is what Baron Asset Fund said about SBAC last year:

“SBA Communications Corp. which owns and operates towers for wireless communications contributed to performance because of its continued organic growth and its relative immunity from COVID-19 related economic disruption. In addition the merger of two large wireless carriers Sprint and T-Mobile was upheld by the courts. This removed uncertainty around the pace at which the combined entity will invest in infrastructure to upgrade its network benefiting SBA. We retain conviction in our investment because of the ongoing growth in demand for wireless voice data and video; the company’s strong competitive position; and its consistent ability to return capital to shareholders through share buybacks and a recently instituted dividend.”

8. CarMax Inc. (NYSE: KMX)

Ranking 8th on Chuck Acre’s top 10 stock picks list is CarMax Inc. (KMX: NYSE) a retailer of used vehicles in the United States. The company operates two main segments: CarMax Sales Operations which sells domestic imported and luxury vehicles and CarMax Auto Finance which provides financing services.

Akre’s position in CarMax decreased by only 905 shares during the fourth quarter of 2020. The stake is valued at $706.49 million constituting 4.77% of the portfolio.

During 2020 KMX shares showed a 7.74% price appreciation and its price reached an all-time high level in 2021 at $128.53. The rally was attributed to positive data on current sales trends following negative year-over-year growth trends during the last two months of 2020.

CarMax reported a year-over-year increase in revenues of 8.1% during the third quarter of the fiscal year 2020 and its earnings per share increased by 36% compared to the same quarter of 2019 reaching $1.42. Here is why Giverny Capital thinks CarMax is a great investment:

“We’d note our largest holding Carmax continues to generate admirable performance that is heavily discounted by the market which believes Internet-based competitors like Carvana and Vroom have superior business models for selling used cars. For its quarter ended August 31 Carmax reported 28% growth in earnings per share and solid unit growth yet the stock declined after that announcement on concerns that its brick and mortar car lots may soon be obsolete. We’re confident in Carmax’s consumer proposition and in the viability of its omnichannel approach to selling cars whereby it can serve customers in stores or online.""

7. Roper Technologies Inc. (NYSE: ROP)

As of the end of the fourth quarter Akre held 1.91 million shares of Roper Technologies the seventh-largest holding in his portfolio. The position decreased by only 638 shares during the quarter and represented 5.57% of the overall portfolio.

Roper Technologies Inc. (NYSE: ROP) was incorporated in 1981. It is leading diversified technology company operating as a software designer and developer and provides engineered products and solutions for niche markets worldwide. It is considered a dividend aristocrat with growing dividends since 1993 and a current dividend yield of 0.59%.

Last quarter the firm earned $1.51 billion up 8% on a yearly basis. Roper's President and CEO considered that the company had a great 2020 with tremendous operational and capital deployment:

""Against the unprecedented backdrop of COVID we meaningfully enhanced the quality of our enterprise. We saw solid growth in our software recurring revenue while investing for accelerated growth across the broader portfolio. In addition we took advantage of attractive market conditions to successfully deploy $6 billion of capital toward high-quality software acquisitions. Importantly our free cash flow grew 16% in 2020.""

Andvari Associates is also bullish on ROP. Here is what they said recently:

“Another Andvari holding that made a significant acquisition last year is Roper Technologies. We’ve owned Roper since 2015 and it is a company laser-focused on compounding their cash flows. Their objective is to use their excess cash flows to acquire other businesses that improve Roper’s overall financial characteristics. Over the last two decades Roper has evolved from a maker of industrial pumps to a conglomerate that owns dozens of high-tech and software businesses. Roper announced last August they’d be acquiring Vertafore for $5.35 billion the largest acquisition in its history. Vertafore is a leading provider of software-as-a-service solutions for the property and casualty insurance industry. The business seems a great fit for Roper: it has strong cash flows it doesn’t require capital to grow it’s a leader in a niche market and revenues are recurring in nature.”

6. O'Reilly Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: ORLY)

O'Reilly Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: ORLY) shares witnessed a 10.28% appreciation in price during the last twelve months. Chuck Akre is the major shareholder of the company with 1.84 million shares valued at $832.61 million. About 5.63% of the fund's portfolio was allocated to ORLY an automotive aftermarket parts and tools supplier in the United States.

Despite the 2020 disruptive business environment O'Reilly Automotive was able to open 156 new stores successfully. For 2021 capital expenditure is expected to increase by $100 million reaching $650 million and management is committed to a target of 165 to 175 new store openings.

During the fourth quarter earnings per share increased by 27% registering $5.40 compared to $4.25 during the same quarter of 2019. As for the full fiscal year earnings per share reached $23.53 increasing by 32% on a yearly basis. This result represents a record level of revenues and operating income since the company went public in 1993.

O'Reilly announced that its Board of Directors approved to increase its share repurchase program by $1.0 billion reaching an aggregate amount of $15.75 billion. In fact the company has repurchased 81.7 million shares under this buyback program since 2011 estimated at $14.57 billion. In 2020 4.8 million shares were repurchased. Qualivian Investment Partners also likes ORLY. Here is what Aamer Khan said in an interview with Insider Monkey:

Oligopoly in a simple understandable business which is less vulnerable to disruption (auto parts) and has a long growth runway. The small independent local auto parts companies are ceding share to the national players who are consolidating the space and O’Reilly is able to make value-creating acquisitions as well as organically growing store counts in states where it is underrepresented that have secularly increased its market share.

For tourists it often figured into sightseeing itineraries right alongside Grauman’s Chinese Theater and the Hollywood sign.

""In the 1960s there weren't paparazzi and tabloids and internet like there are today"" Segal previously explained. ""But the Beatles came in to shop and it got so much attention that it caused a traffic jam outside.""

I'm introducing myself a little aggressively here because I'm winding up to relaunch Car Bibles a sister site of The Drive into the ultimate resource for DIY and how-to guides car repair advice buying resources and more. We just hired a crack squad of writers to help us do that and you'll be hearing from them soon too. So here I am; rocking you like a hurricane and so on.

Anyway onto the items that should be on your list this holiday season.

I got these International Scout II bedsheets at a Ross discount store years ago and sadly I don't know where you can find them today. Andrew P. Collins

The internet as a whole gets lousy with gift guides every December. They’re helpful for finding good-value items quickly but the best gifts of all aren’t always about efficiency. Sometimes you want to give something with a little sparkle; something that’s not necessarily easy to find unless you know where to look.

That's why I want to bring you my first batch of APC endorsements. APC happens to be my initials and in this case it also stands for Andrew’s Personal Choice. That's a new stamp of awesomeness I'm hoping to be handing out more often. Since as an insatiable collector of curiosities I consider myself uniquely qualified to recommend exceptionally cool items.

High-End Gifts For Old-School Nissan Z Stans

Z-Spec's black billet battery tie-down for the Z31 on an Optima Red Top battery. Yeah I had to get the cool-looking battery. I'm just that extra and into engine bay decoration. Andrew P. Collins

Hey I said this list was personal! As you’d know if you followed me on Instagram I’ve been restoring a 1984 Nissan 300ZX over the last few years. As such I’ve been ordering products for these cars from all over the internet. A couple of things have really stood out.

I just got a billet battery tie-down bar from Z-Spec Design out of Ohio the quality of execution and feel on this thing are both just incredible. Normally this is a part that's necessary but easily forgotten; you probably don't think much about yours. But the one I got feels like a work of art.

Every angle is perfect the “Z” cut-in is classy without being too flashy and the texture is tres premium. It fits just right to boot. Z-Spec makes all kinds of engine dress-up accessories like this for various Nissans I won’t hesitate to recommend their work.

And while we're talking about decorative Datsun items I have to brag about my sweet titanium key. I was a little wary of spending $70 for a dang key blank when I ordered my titanium key from Ronin Imports but the design was so seductive that I had to treat myself. It was totally worth it this Z32-style key replica is nothing less than a work of art. I don’t even hang the key on my key rack I leave it on my desk so I can stare at it all day and touch it whenever I want.

My Z32-style titanium key from Ronin Imports clipped on to my Devil Z keychain from Yanimator. Now I just need something special to replace the link between the two. Maybe some kind of precious metal? I told you–I'm extra.  Andrew P. Collins

Cheaper Gifts For Retro JDM Fans

Zooming out just a tiny bit to “old-school Japanese cars” instead of just Nissans and Datsuns specifically I found a couple of small-batch stores to patronize: Yanimator Art and Star Cruiser Drive Yard.

Yanimator

Yanimator has a great variety of JDM and anime-themed keychains stickers and little art pieces that are really fun. I got a keychain that’s a caricature of the Devil Z hero car from Wangan Midnight (cars and anime on that one!) and I’m really happy with it. The acrylic body is robust the resolution on the image is superb and it’s even got little sparkles in it!

As for Star Cruiser I just randomly stumbled upon it while looking at pictures of Mitsubishi Starions on Instagram. I got me a Starion sticker that I’m going to gift to a friend who used to own one. It hasn’t arrived in the mail yet so I can’t comment on execution but the selection of cars and art style over there are worth checking out.

A Gift For Your Friend Who Likes Big-Gulps

Aftermarket cupholders are a tricky proposition in that a lot of them don't work. But what's a car if not a giant beverage socket on wheels I ask.

Sometimes I forget how dangerous the Scout looks just to sit in. So many rough surfaces! Cupholder has made it a little hospitable though. Can't be not sipping on coffee for any extended period of time so this is a necessity. Andrew P. Collins

If you or someone you know also feels that way but their vehicle is lacking in cupholder quantity or quality check out The Ledge. This is a beefy drink holster wide enough to accommodate an enormous coffee cup or whatever else you sip on while driving. The normal application is to stick it in your car's door via the window slot though I will say I tried this in my Mitsubishi and the thing was just too large and the truck couldn't roll up its window properly with the thing in place.

However I moved it over to my Scout where I slung it over the edge of my center console instead and it works perfectly!

Personalized Gifts For Particularly Proud Car Owners

Speaking of automotive art on Instagram one of the most fun things I spent money on this year was a caricature of my International Scout from artist Brian Theodore who goes by Stancetoonz online. How cool is this:

Instagram | @stancetoonz Yep that's a caricature of my Scout. It came with some stickers and a printout too!

The process was great I DM’d that account asking about pricing and availability they hit me back I sent a photo of my truck for them to work off and about a week later I had this incredible image to enjoy!

Commissioning art is a great way to spend money because all your cash goes straight to the creator there’s no corporate vampire intermediary. Just keep in mind that you’re working with an individual not a faceless corporation when you make your inquiries. You might not get immediate responses or an instant-refund policy. Make sure everybody’s on the same page when you agree to a product and a price understand that what you’re buying is organic and may not look exactly as you pictured it. And never ask for art for free. If it were easy to whip up you’d do it yourself wouldn’t you?

Anyway I had a great experience working with Stancetoonz but there are quite a few folks who will draw a picture of a car for you for money. And of course they all have distinctive styles. Search around and don’t be shy about DM’ing people. Here are a few other advanced artists you might want to look at which I follow online but haven’t bought art from yet:

Guy Simms whose on Instagram as @guyricatures. His website is Guyricatures.com.

Instagram user @drawingcoolcars whose real name I couldn't immediately find.

Aaron Hillsdon whose Insta handle @drawsyourcar certainly implies that he's open to commissions but you'd have to message him to find out.

Gifts For Adventurers

The world of off-road driving and overlanding has no shortage of dongles great and small that you can spend all kinds of money on. But if you’re looking to gift something unique and artsy that also has actual enthusiast cred go see my friends at 4x4ward.

Andrew P. Collins I will admit my visor visor is very deliberately arranged to be aesthetically pleasing. I've got Polaroid-style photos of my wife and the city of Los Angeles both of which I love dearly plus a notebook and a Zebra F-301 (the coolest pen naturally.) The two enamel pins on the outer edges and the Dakar Rally Bedouin patch are from 4x4ward.

I discovered their site on Instagram (I really should spend less time on Instagram huh?) and have ordered a few things all of which have been cool and interesting. Old unusual and generally hard to find vintage items are all over this site and the stock changes all the time. It’s like a cool thrift store for retro off-road stuff!

If your giftee likes off-road stuff but prefers a more in-your-face aesthetic check out Seek & Enjoy. Artist Nick Sawyer creates very cool somewhat ’70s/’80s-looking stickers and shirts over there. I’ve bought quite a few and have no complaints about print quality.

Gifts For Offline Car People

I’ve been a member of The Motoring Club for over a year now. We’ve got a clubhouse in west Los Angeles where we meet up to hang and talk cars. Unfortunately it’s been closed a lot lately due to pandemic restrictions and it’s not really open to the public.

There's always cool stuff hanging around TMC's parking lot. Andrew P. Collins

However the dudes who run the joint are launching a print mag called The Motoring Journal soon which is going to be a quarterly published book with pretty pictures and fun stories. Even better: Signing up comes with stickers and keychains and everybody loves that stuff. Folks who want to check that out can get versions of club membership that’s applicable no matter where you live.

An ultra-premium print publication that’s already got some momentum is The Road Rat. Every issue is gorgeous and collectible. I’ve pawed through a few on friends’ coffee tables it’s a great way to give your eyes a break from screens. Another newcomer that The Drive's Editorial Director Patrick George is particularly fond of these days is Hypertrash Magazine; it's probably what staffs of sites like The Drive and Jalopnik would put together if none of us had to chase internet traffic or e-commerce dollars.

A Gift For Practical Car People

I’ve received tire pressure gauges as gifts a few times. Maybe because they’re often sitting on sale racks near the cash register at auto parts stores? Anyway I’m not complaining they’re useful and I like to keep one in each of my cars.

My colleague Corey Foster has one too! The finish on these a lot prettier than most digital gauges which makes them nicer gifts. Also the bleeder valve is nice for fine-tuning. Corey Foster

Funny enough @john_osborn on Twitter recently posted about “needing a tire pressure gauge” and asked if folks had preferences between the stick-style ones that look like pens analog round dial ones that look like clocks or digital gauges.

I would have replied to them myself but was happy to see that several folks shouted out my go-to recommendation ahead of me: Accu-Gage analog with a pressure relief valve all the way baby.

Accu-Gage makes elegant and easy-to-use tire pressure gauges in a whole bunch of sizes. Grab one that goes to 60 psi for your car-driving friend. I prefer the analog ones because they don’t have batteries that can die and the form factor is a little classier than the digital ones which look like ear thermometers.

This reminds me I lost my last Accu-Gage a while ago so mom if you're reading this...

A Gift For Me

Besides that tire pressure gauge if anybody’s got a line on the lower horizontal grille that mounts just below the chrome section in a 1998 ’99 or ’00 Montero front bumper get at me! Every time I find one in a boneyard it's already been cracked. I’ve been reasonably good this year and everything!

Don't actually buy me one that would be weird. Mitsubishi/Partsouq

Anyway I hope you're having a Merry Consumptionmas season wherever you are. And if you enjoy car trinkets as much as I do hopefully this list of items has brought you a little joy and help with holiday shopping.

If you can appreciate this level of nerdiness and specificity when it comes to automotive accessories you're going to have a good time with us over at Car Bibles. When it comes online in earnest the site will be chock full of projects parts-hunts misadventures and auto advice for practical people. In the meantime we're going to get some action going on Car Bibles' Twitter Instagram and Facebook pages so come hang out with us there!"

Scientists who took part in the study concluded that the transmission of aerosol particles between spaces via the HVAC system is exceptionally low and undetectable both in the air and on surfaces.

A team of five medical scientists specializing in bioaerosols led by Josh Santarpia PhD. – associate professor pathology and microbiology UNMC; and research director chemical and biological programs NSRI – were called on to understand in detail the role of HVAC systems in spreading airborne particles on cruise ships.

The study specifically explored the effectiveness and efficiency of cruise ship air management strategies – ventilation filtration and supply – and examined air flow across different areas of the ship including guest staterooms crew staterooms lounges and other public spaces.

Royal Caribbean’s HVAC systems were intentionally designed to maximize ventilation continual fresh air intake and filtration prior to the pandemic. These systems continuously bring in ocean air through one side of the ship filter it multiple times before it reaches staterooms and public areas and maximize ventilation in every space for frequent air changes.

The air is filtered again before it is exhausted from the opposite side of the ship. As a result the system in place was already designed to reduce transmission of airborne diseases.

Royal Caribbean is implementing additional layers of precaution to further minimize the possibility of COVID-19 transmission onboard by adjusting shipboard settings to allow for the maximum air changes per hour – twice more what is recommended for land-based venues by ASHRAE — and upgrading to MERV 13 filters throughout the system.

Royal Caribbean Group is applying the recommendations of its Healthy Sail Panel of public health and scientific experts to provide a safer and healthier cruise vacation on all of its sailings. Health and safety protocols regional travel restrictions and clearance to visit ports of call are subject to change based on ongoing evaluation public health standards and government requirements.

Royal Caribbean may move its home port to Cozumel Mexico amid delays to restart the cruise industry in the United States. According to Cozumel Mayor Pedro Joaquin Delbouis Royal Caribbean approached the city about designating the island as a home port for its cruise operations.

“A company has established a Plan B if in April there is no decision to sail Cozumel would be its home port starting in May” said the Mayor reported the Riviera Maya News. “We were consulted and we immediately said yes.”

Joaquin Delbouis added that the city is already constructing a new dock that will become the home port and it’s projected to be completed by May. The project is currently being funded and planned by the Mexico federal government.

The mayor added that after a decade of projects that never came to fruition Quinatana Roo will have its first home port. Originally planned for Cancun the port was met with opposition by hoteliers that felt the home port would become competition for the hotel industry. Cozumel has been receiving cruise ships for over 50 years and has the experience to handle a home port the Mayor added.

Royal Caribbean did report that they are looking at alternative destinations for its home port according to Royal Caribbean’s Senior Project Manager Richard Gibbs.

“We’re engaging with various stakeholders particularly governments and partners in the travel industry around the world to evaluate the feasibility of returning to cruising from several destinations once it is safe to do so. No final decisions have been made regarding these efforts” Gibbs said in a statement to Travel Pulse.

According to Royal Caribbean Senior Vice President Vicki Freed test sailings have yet to be scheduled due to delays by the CDC.

“The reason you haven’t heard anything is because we don’t have dates yet” Freed said this week according to Travel Weekly. “We don’t have any more information. But as soon as we do I promise we will get that information to you.”

At the beginning of February the Mayor of Cozumel was also reaching out to European Cruise companies to bring their ships to the Mexican Island. The Mayor has been in talks with the MSC which is the one large cruise line already successfully sailing in the Mediterranean. MSC Cruises has been the pioneer of sailing in a Covid-19 world and the Mayor is hoping the cruise line will include Cozumel on its itineraries.

Mexico is no stranger to tourism during the pandemic and continues to be one of the most popular destinations during Covid-19. In spite of travel restrictions amidst the global pandemic tourism in Cancun continues to thrive. A recent passenger traffic report from Grupo Aeroportuario el Sureste (Asur) said the Cancun airport served over 700 thousand passengers in the month of January alone.

Kennedy Jr.,"The grandson of President John F. Kennedy this week savaged his presidential-candidate cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in a series of mocking meant-to-be-funny videos that were inarguably uncharacteristically un-Kennedyesque escalating a civil war within America’s most storied political dynasty.

In a series of Instagram posts the grandson Jack Schlossberg 31 variously called Mr. Kennedy 70 a “prick” suggested he was using steroids said he was “lying to us” and portrayed him as a Russian stooge and a stalking horse for Donald J. Trump.

But what viewers may be more struck by or even insulted by are the heavily accented caricatures the young scion used to dramatize his points.

If Japan’s Best Car can be believed Toyota thinks so and it’s dusted off the circa 2015 Toyota S-FR concept for production with the help of Daihatsu and Suzuki—two small car specialists the former of which is a Toyota subsidiary. Do we want to believe?

Of course we love the MX-5; we are enthusiasts who love sporty cars and Toyota’s no stranger to the segment. The last car it built in this class was the MR-2 Spyder a nominal Miata competitor that appealed to the quirkier and more hardcore enthusiasts. It had less curb appeal and more “budget Elise” mojo. But the S-FR (well the concept which is old) has one thing the MR2 Spyder doesn’t: undeniable cuteness. Rather than an amphibian shape made out of Duplos the S-FR is funky and organic—more Kermit and less Kerbal.

Forbes’ Japan-based reporter put hands on the exclusive Best Car report and from this we understand that the appeal of shared development costs and partner automakers is what makes the revival feasible. Well rumored revival. The evidence is thin to be clear. The Daihatsu Vision Copen apparently previews the bones of a future S-FR and seems an appropriate basis; the windshield surround and the doors look very S-FR. It’s rounded and cute. Toyota-izing it would be a simple task.

After all if Daihatsu is making a small convertible already it wouldn’t be difficult for Toyota to create a larger more powerful version at a different price point. Bringing in Suzuki’s small engine expertise would help reduce costs as well. Consider the BMW underpinnings of the latest Supra and the co-development of the GR86 and the Subaru BRZ. Toyota has signaled it won’t build a sports car without some aspect of it being shared or already in existence.

Best Car pegs the upcoming S-FR to debut in 2026 or 2027 with tweaked styling but a similar overall vibe to the 2015 S-FR concept and a 150-hp 1.3-liter turbo I-3 engine under the hood.

Plausible? Maybe. Probable? That’s another story entirely. And as for the U.S. market don't expect a Daihatsu-based anything to make it here; besides Toyota has the GR86 already which is essentially a roofed Miata fighter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,S.F.'s Valencia Street merchants endorse replacing center bikeway with protected side-running lanes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/s-f-valencia-street-bicycle-lane-19442272.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaC5lZHUvdW5odG9kYXkvMjAyNC8wNS9lbGl6YWJldGgtcy1jaGlsdG9uLW5hbWVkLTIxc3QtcHJlc2lkZW50LXVuaXZlcnNpdHktbmV3LWhhbXBzaGlyZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elizabeth S. Chilton Named 21st President of the University of New Hampshire,"Following a national search Elizabeth S. Chilton a native of the Northeast who most recently served as chancellor of Washington State University’s Pullman campus has been appointed the 21st president of the University of New Hampshire effective July 1 2024.

Chilton will succeed James W. Dean Jr. who is retiring after six years leading UNH. She was appointed the inaugural chancellor of Washington State’s Pullman campus in 2022 after joining WSU in 2020 as provost and executive vice president of the WSU system.

“UNH is a leading public university with strong student outcomes a large and diverse research portfolio and dedication to the state of New Hampshire and I am honored and humbled to have the opportunity to serve as president of this incredible institution” Chilton says. “I’ve long admired UNH’s history vibrant and engaged community and commitment to student success and scholarship. I look forward to returning to the Northeast to join the Wildcat family and help UNH serve our students and society in pursuit of a prosperous future.”

WSU Pullman is the system’s flagship and Washington State’s land grant university serving about 18000 students. Prior to becoming chancellor her role as chief academic officer included oversight of research functions across the six-campus system a role she continued in while serving as chancellor for the last two years.

A first-generation college student and a graduate of public universities Chilton is a champion for public higher education deeply committed to access and liberal arts education. She values UNH’s unique position as a leading public research institution that maintains a sharp focus on undergraduate education inspired by the university’s research mission while also remaining a strong believer in the power of a transformational undergraduate experience.

“Dr. Chilton has shown tremendous leadership and strategic vision across the academic and research enterprise and her career is a testament to the mission of public higher education” said Jamie Burnett ‘95 ‘96G ‘98G the vice-chair of the University System of New Hampshire Board of Trustees and chair of the presidential search committee. “She cares deeply about the student experience and is committed to advancing student success at UNH. She has a record of collaboration lifting up her peers building partnerships and creating opportunities. The UNH community and the state should have a high degree of confidence in Elizabeth’s appointment.”

Chilton’s appointment concludes a search launched last fall after Dean announced his intention to retire. A 16-member search committee comprised of representatives of the Board of Trustees faculty staff and students across UNH’s three campuses led the search.

Chilton will visit all three UNH campuses from May 9 to 11. She will spend May 9 and a portion of May 10 in Durham before visiting the Manchester and Concord campuses on the afternoon of the 10th.

“Elizabeth is a proven and versatile leader devoted to the mission and values of public land grant universities” said USNH Board Chair Alex Walker. “She brings the experience track record and capabilities to lead a multi-campus institution that is part of a larger well-coordinated public higher education system. She distinguished herself among a very strong pool of candidates as the right person to lead the University of New Hampshire in these dynamic and challenging times in higher education.”

From 2017 to 2020 Chilton was dean of the Harpur College of Arts and Sciences at Binghamton University part of the State University of New York system. Prior to that she spent 16 years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst serving in a variety of roles including professor anthropology department chair and associate vice chancellor for research and engagement.

She earned her bachelor’s degree in anthropology from the University at Albany SUNY and then her master’s and Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her academic work focuses on the pre-colonial archaeology of Northeast North America as well as paleoecology cultural resource management heritage studies and materials science. She is the author of dozens of peer-reviewed book chapters and journal articles.

Chilton is an avid hiker kayaker and canoeist as well as an enthusiastic choral singer. Her husband Michael Sugerman is also an anthropology professor. The couple has an adult son and three lively dogs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL215LXZhbGxleS10cmlidXRlcy9yb3NzaS1icm90aGVycy1sZWxsaW8tZnVuZXJhbC1ob21lL2thcmVuLXMtcmVudHoteW91bmdzdG93bi1vaGlvL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL215LXZhbGxleS10cmlidXRlcy9yb3NzaS1icm90aGVycy1sZWxsaW8tZnVuZXJhbC1ob21lL2thcmVuLXMtcmVudHoteW91bmdzdG93bi1vaGlvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Karen S.

Salesforce Park could be to San Francisco what the Highline is to New York City or the 606 is to Chicago.

It’s a public park amid a bustling city – perhaps not so bustling right now given the COVID-19 pandemic has cleared the way for plenty of social-distancing spacing for both locals and visitors on a Friday afternoon in February – atop a living roof featuring 600 trees and 16000 plants arranged in 13 different botanical featured areas.

Located at 425 Mission St. Salesforce Park is 70 feet above the Grand Hall – or the fourth floor if you’re taking the elevator from the Beale Street entrance off Mission Street just south of Market Street near the Embarcadero – and runs the entire length of the Transit Center’s nearly four-block stretch.

The Mission Street gondola to the park was closed on this day.

The 5.4-acre rooftop park is free to the public with open areas including the lawns hills plaza and even an amphitheater.

This above-the-street park is actually a layered soil system that balances seismic shifting while collecting and filtering stormwater to irrigate gardens.

A variety gardens consisting of indigenous trees and plants from Australia Mediterranean Basin and the Wetland are showcased throughout the park. For visitors these different gardens will allow them to appreciate the climatic conditions and environments – drought fog desert and forest.

Salesforce Park – the software company bought the naming rights good for 25 years – opened in 2019 at an estimated cost of $2.2 billion. Included were the necessary repairs and re-inspections when cracks were discovered during construction.

The park above the City is for leisurely strolls and to sit back and relax.

There’s a Starbucks in the 1070-foot Salesforce Tower and a playground area.

However no pets are allowed and ballgames bikes and other wheeled equipment for the exception of wheelchairs and baby carriages are prohibited.

Tents percussion instruments sleeping smoking soliciting or weapons of any kind are also forbidden.

Salesforce Park is open from now through April from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. and no earlier than 6 a.m. to no later than 9 p.m. from May through October.

It is essentially a repackaging of existing products and services combined with some new capability that will be offered ‘as a Service’ to drive digital transformation.

RISE with SAP has been designed to provide a path to what SAP call the ‘Intelligent Enterprise’ and has been designed to support customers irrespective of their starting point or complexity. It will be offered on a subscription basis and features automation services process re-engineering capabilities and a host of migration and integration tools.

The announcement was broadly supported by user groups and partners but it is too early to say how much impact it will have for the vast majority of SAP customers who are stubbornly delaying a move from ECC6. Whilst RISE offers many of the tools that customers will need to make a more informed decision about S/4 it still doesn’t appear to solve the four biggest challenges to S/4 uptake: it’s very expensive it takes a long time there aren’t enough skilled SAP consultants and most customers are happy on ECC6.

SAP’s efforts to move its install base to S/4HANA have been hampered by a number of factors all of which have been compounded by the global pandemic. While coronavirus has accelerated the need for digital transformation it has not provided a springboard for SAP customers to sign up to their latest offering – UKISUG reported that 30 percent of respondents in a survey had delayed their S/4HANA plans.

If moving to S/4 was a simple process then most customers would have pushed the button already. But S/4 migration is not a simple process – it is a uniquely complicated activity – and business leaders that are already in turmoil do not seem minded to add to their woes with a disruptive ERP project that will strip resources away from the task of keeping the lights on.

To add to these challenges SAP is battling against the narrative that is being controlled by its partners at both ends of the equation. At one end it is the hyperscalers that are quarterbacking the move to the cloud while the GSIs (which increasingly own the customer relationship) are spearheading process re-engineering. This leaves SAP stuck in the middle without clear line of sight to the customer and with less influence over the direction of travel.

Time is running out for SAP to find a solution for the rank and file user base. RISE will likely be a valuable tool for large enterprises that can maximise the process re-engineering capability – driven by SAP’s recent acquisition of Signavio. But what about the tens of thousands of mid-sized SAP customers that simply cannot find a business case to justify the investment? SAP won’t maintain its position as the global ERP leader with a solution that only works for the top 10 percent of its customers. Developing a cost-effective migration path for the majority of its customers has to be SAP’s top priority in 2021. Time will tell whether RISE can deliver on that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAyLzI4L2JldHRlci1idXktbWljcm9uLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktdnMtd2VzdGVybi1kaWdpdGFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Micron Technology vs. Western Digital,"Which memory and data storage leader is a better all-around investment?

Micron Technology (MU -0.77%) and Western Digital (WDC -1.53%) are both major players in the memory and data storage market. Micron mainly sells DRAM and NAND (flash) memory chips while WD produces NAND chips flash-based SSDs (solid-state drives) and traditional platter-based HDDs (hard disk drives).

Both companies struggled with declining memory chip prices throughout 2019 as sluggish shipments to smartphone and PC makers caused a global glut of chips. DRAM and NAND prices gradually stabilized in 2020 but that recovery was throttled by pandemic-related disruptions in the first half of the year.

However investors have been much more bullish on Micron than WD over the past 12 months. Micron's stock price rallied more than 50% as its memory chip sales improved while WD's stock price remained nearly flat as its weak HDD business largely offset the growth of its NAND business. Will Micron remain a stronger investment than WD throughout the rest of the year?

The key differences between Micron and WD

Micron generated 70% of its revenue from DRAM chips another 27% from NAND chips and the rest from other types of memory last quarter. That business model makes it the only ""pure play"" on memory chips in the U.S. market.

WD which significantly expanded its NAND business by acquiring SanDisk in 2016 generated 52% of its revenue from flash products last quarter. The remaining 48% came from its legacy HDD business.

WD's HDD business has been shrinking as more PC makers have shifted to SSDs which are pricier but also smaller faster more power-efficient and less prone to damage than platter-based drives. It's trying to counter that secular shift by selling higher-capacity HDDs to enterprise and data center customers but the segment's revenue and margin will likely continue to decline for the foreseeable future.

WD and Micron rank third and fifth respectively in the global NAND market according to TrendForce's latest numbers. Samsung and Kioxia (formerly known as Toshiba Memory) rank first and second respectively and SK Hynix ranks fourth. However SK Hynix will likely jump to third place after it closes its forthcoming takeover of Intel's (INTC -0.94%) NAND business.

In the HDD market WD shares a near-duopoly with Seagate Technology (STX) which hasn't aggressively followed its lead into the NAND market yet.

Which company is growing faster?

Micron's revenue declined 8% to $21.4 billion in fiscal 2020 which ended last September as it grappled with low DRAM and NAND prices in the first half of the year. But its revenue rose in the second half of the year thanks to rising sales of PCs during the pandemic the production of new 5G smartphones and gaming consoles and robust orders from data center customers.

Those accelerating tailwinds boosted its revenue and adjusted earnings by 12% and 63% respectively in the first quarter of 2021. Its DRAM revenue jumped 17% year over year and its NAND revenue grew 11%.

Micron expects DRAM and NAND prices to rise throughout 2021. Based on these catalysts analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 17% and 47% respectively for the full year -- which are impressive growth rates for a stock that trades at just 11 times forward earnings.

Western Digital's revenue rose 1% to $16.7 billion in fiscal 2020 which ended last July. However its adjusted earnings plunged 37% as weak NAND prices crushed the flash unit's margins and its HDD margins continued to contract.

WD's fortunes didn't improve in the first half of fiscal 2021. Its revenue dipped 5% year over year to $7.9 billion during those six months as its weak HDD business offset its rebounding flash revenue.

WD's HDD business struggled as weak demand from data center customers offset stronger demand from PC makers during the pandemic. The HDD segment's declining margins also partly offset its expanding flash margins.

However WD's adjusted earnings still rose 40% thanks to lower spending during the pandemic and an easy year-over-year comparison to the first half of 2020. Unfortunately analysts expect its revenue and earnings to both decline about 4% for the full year before turning positive again in fiscal 2022.

WD's stock also trades at 11 times forward earnings but it deserves that discount valuation a lot more than Micron. It also suspended its dividend last May and probably won't reinstate those payments anytime soon. Micron hasn't paid a dividend since the 1990s.

The winner: Micron

I recently said Western Digital was a better investment than Intel since it has a clearer path to a turnaround than the struggling CPU maker.

But WD definitely isn't a better buy than Micron which is recovering at a faster rate while trading at the same forward P/E ratio. Micron isn't as diversified as WD but its streamlined exposure to the DRAM and NAND markets along with its lack of a legacy HDD business clearly make it a better overall investment.",,,,,,,,,

One of them was Jess “Long Shot” Conley who earned his moniker by riding horses with long odds to victory. He also earned a reputation for having a short fuse and for frequent gambling that ultimately led to his downfall.

Conley’s racing career in this venue lasted from 1897 until 1902. During this period Conley‘s name frequently appeared in local newspapers when he won or placed in a horse race. Also his name appeared in the press when he was involved in physical and verbal altercations.

Edward Wiard Builds Shell Mound & Oakland Trotting Park

Edward Wiard was born in New Haven Connecticut 1815. As a young man Wiard worked as a steamboat engineer. In 1850 he answered the call of gold and immigrated to California.

After prospecting for gold in Mariposa County he purchased a 150 acre tract of land in 1858 in an unincorporated area north of Oakland. In the 1870s Wiard built the Oakland Trotting Park and Shell Mound Park.

Opened in 1871 the Trotting Park was a one-mile oval shaped course located north of Park Avenue and west of San Pablo Avenue. Shell Mound Park an amusement park opened in 1876 and was located west of the railroad tracks adjacent to the Bay.

For 25 years the Oakland Trotting Park featured harness racing a form of horse racing in which a horse pulls a light two-wheeled vehicle called a “sulky.”

Wiard died in 1886 and Oakland Trotting Park and Shell Mound Park were purchased by Judge James Mee of San Francisco. Trotting Park was then leased to Thomas Williams who invested in the park by resurfacing the track and building a new grandstand.

The track was renamed the New California Jockey Club. Trotting races were discontinued and the new track featured thoroughbred horse racing with jockeys in the saddle. The renovated track reopened on October 24 1896.

The rebuilt racetrack employed a large number of African Americans to train and care for the horses. Many of them were from Kentucky a state with a long history of raising and racing horses. Over the years many famous African American jockeys raced at the Emeryville Track including Willie Simms Alonzo Clayton Felix Carr and Jess “Long Shot” Conley.

Oakland Annexation Threat

After incorporating in 1854 The City of Oakland began annexing nearby settlements and was targeting the tract containing the two parks. There was considerable opposition to racetrack gambling within the existing Oakland community.

Williams wanted to protect his investment so he and other racetrack directors orchestrated the incorporation of “Emeryville.” Joseph Stickney Emery owned a 185-acre tract just south of Wiard’s.

A petition proposing the creation of a town was submitted to the Alameda County Board of Supervisors. The board voted in favor of allowing residents living within the boundaries to vote for incorporation. In addition to the issue of incorporation the ballot offered voters two slates of candidates. If incorporation carried the new town would have an elected government.

The election was held on December 2 1896. Residents voted 150 to 27 in favor of incorporation. W.H. Christie the candidate with the most votes became “Emeryville’s” first mayor a position he held for over three decades.

Conley’s Career Begins to Blossom in Kentucky

Born about 1870 possibly in Chicago Jess Conley started his career as a jockey in 1896 at the Harlem Race Track 5 near Chicago.

Conley was hired by trainer Crit Davis to ride his stable of horses. Conley had trouble getting off to a good start. This was before the invention of the starting gate where a man stood at the line with a flag. Davis did not think Conley had any future as a jockey and decided to let him go.

In 1897 at the age of 27 Conley was hired by W. F. Schulte to ride his stable of horses at the Latonia Race Track in Kentucky. At Latonia Conley piloted the horse Alleviate to a string of victories. He soon achieved recognition as an exceptional jockey in this venue.

In mid-November 1897 Conley returned to Chicago where he continued to dominate at the Lakeside Track. After spending a few days racing in this venue Conley took the train west to Oakland. The Emeryville Track opened for the racing season on November 15 1897.

Conley Earns Moniker at Emeryville Track

November 23 1897 was the first day Conley rode at the Emeryville Track riding Zamar. The next day the S.F. Call had the first mentioned of his name. “Conley who rode Honig’s sprinter (Zamar) yesterday was one of the ‘finds’ of the past season around the Chicago tracks. He landed a number of longshots. His name would convey the impression that he came from the Emerald Isle (Ireland) but he did not. He is a colored lad.”

Two days later on November 25 before an immense crowd Conley astride Harry Thobur odds of 50 to 1 a horse no one thought had a chance of winning hustled the steed “along in exhilarating manner” and came in second place. From this moment on the press referred to him as “Long Shot” Conley for his uncanny ability to ride a dark horse to victory.

Conley was again praised by the S.F. Call on November 27:

“Long Shot Conley has made a pronounced hit with race goers. His style is … vigorous and lasting unwilling to acknowledge defeat.”

The Emeryville Track and the Ingleside Track in San Francisco had alternate schedules so they didn’t conflict with each other. The Emeryville Track would stay open for two weeks and then close. Then the Ingleside Track would open for the next two weeks and close and so on. Jess Conley raced at both tracks.

Success Leads to Jealousy Collusion by White Jockeys

Conley had only raced in the Bay Area for two weeks when he ran into trouble. Conley’s success at the Emeryville Track and Ingleside created resentment on the part of the white jockeys. They colluded to slow him down by bumping up against his horse or boxing him in. In 1897 The S.F. Call reported this story with the headline “Conley in Need of Protection. The Colored Rider Bumped and Cut Off on Every Possible Occasion.”

The article reads:

“ … a combination has been formed among the white boys to down Conley whenever opportunity offers and for effectiveness its efforts have been highly gratifying. Well authenticated rumors have been in circulation for a week or more that Conley‘s popularity had aroused a jealous feeling among his comrades of a lighter caste and that they had taken measures to cause his winning percentage to assume a consumptive hue.” … “Conley came to California a stranger but by his earnest efforts to win whether on the back of an outsider or astride a favorite at once installed him a favorite with the public. He is a colored boy but in racing the color line has never been drawn and he is entitled to the same treatment as his white colleagues.”

Conley complained to the track officials about the conspiracy to interfere with the progress of his horse. The officials promised to investigate. Later one of the white jockeys “Skeets” Martin was fined $50 for colliding with Conley‘s horse.

1898: Conley Criticized Suspended

Conley’s success also made him a target of the press and track officials. When Conley did not win or place as some thought he should he was accused of deliberately holding back his mount suggesting he may be taking bribes according to the S.F. Call January 29 1898.

“Conley is no longer worshipped as the idol of purity. On his arrival here his admirers were wont to say that a barrel of Klondike nuggets would not tempt the colored wonder. Now on several sides complaints are heard of poor rides which are blamed to inactivity on the part of “Longshot.” The game (horse racing) is rotten to the core but it is to be hoped that Conley has not met the tempter and fallen. He can ride at a very useful weight and has a brilliant future before him.”

Track officials also accused Conley of swerving his mount on the track so as to endanger other jockeys. In January 1898 he was suspended for a week for this violation. The S.F. Call reporter did not think the suspension was justified.

“If the colored lad turns his neck while on the road to the wire he is rewarded with a fine. There is sense and justice in everything and there is no just reason why it should not be dealt out to Conley in the same proportion as it is to the balance of the riders.”

Conley vs. Tod Sloan

On February 10 1898 track star and future racing hall of famer Tod Sloan raced against Conley at the Emeryville Track. In the first race Sloan rode Wawona the favorite at 2 to 1 odds in a mile and a furlong run. Conley’s horse Our Climate had 30 to 1 odds of winning. Tod’s horse got off to a late start at the post. Conley shot ahead and crossed the finish line a winner. The S.F. Call account reads:

ADVERTISEMENT

“Tod was unfortunate in getting his mount away from the post last of the bunch and being compelled to travel the overland (outside) route most of the way was led past the judges over two lengths by the 30 to 1 shot Our Climate with Conley in the saddle.” According to the Call “the colored lad was vociferously cheered as he returned to the stand.”

Conley and Sloan competed again in the last race. Tod‘s horse May W. was again the favorite the horse with the best chance of winning. Conley rode a big bay Libertine The other horses in the race were Tea Rose Montgomery and Peixotto. Tod led on the back stretch but Conley “came with a rush” and passed Sloan near the finish line and won by almost a length. After the race a big smile appeared on Conley’s face that “lengthened until it resembled the main entrance to a circus tent.”

After his defeat of Sloan Conley’s fame spread across the country. On February 21 1898 the Kansas City Journal ran an article in recognition of Conley‘s remarkable success as a jockey in California.

“Then the Sloan fetish arrived on the (Pacific) slope … Sloan came rode and was conquered by Conley … Conley’s work at Latonia last fall was so superior to the other boys‘ riding there that it is surprising he had to again prove his ability at the Frisco tracks before securing the recognition which was justly due him. He has had to contend with cliqism and favoritism at Ingleside and Oakland alike but his ability to sit in the saddle his utter fearlessness his quick perception of the shortest route to the winning post and his undoubted honesty have combined to gain him the confidence of the horse owners and today he ranks third in the list of winning jockeys of the California tracks. Conley will ride for W. F. Schulte this season.”

Kentucky Derby Appearances

Conley also had a busy year. In May 1898 Conley entered the Kentucky Derby held at Churchill Downs a mile and a quarter race for three-year olds. Conley’s mount Han d’Or owned by G. A. Singerly came in fourth place two lengths behind the winner. Willie Simms another Black jockey rode the winning horse Plaudit crossing the finish line in 2:09.

In September 1898 Conley lived up to his nickname riding two horses with long odds to victory on the same day at the Newport Racetrack in Kentucky. The first race with Conley aboard Albert Vale with odds of 7 to 1 won the six and a half furlongs race in 1:25 1/4. Conley also won the fifth race astride Bannie a distance of five furlongs in 1:05 1/4.

“Long Shot” Conley also entered the 1899 Kentucky Derby. The race was held on May 4 with a field of five horses. Conley’s horse Mazo was owned by John E. Madden. The mile and quarter race was won by F. Taral aboard Manuel. Conley came in third place 1 and 1/2 lengths behind the winner. Conley received a purse of $300 for his third place position.

1899: Back to Emeryville: Suspension & “Foul Riding”

Conley returned to the Bay Area in 1899 and continued to race at the Emeryville Track. On November 31 1899 before a throng of 9000 Conley won the Paxton Handicap. The S.F. Call reported: “ ‘Longshot’ Conley’s followers at last had their patience and fortitude rewarded for the colored chap piloted the dainty Rosormonde to victory in the Paxton handicap over one mile and a furlongs.”

ADVERTISEMENT

In January 1900 Conley was suspended for 30 days for bumping into another horse. While aboard Sig Levy Conley collided again and again with Rathgar for a distance of over 200 yards. The officials accused him of “foul riding.”

The suspension was reduced to only two weeks. Conley was soon back in the saddle and on Jan. 29 in the fifth race at the Emeryville track “Long Shot” crossed the finish line a winner on Colonel Root a 30 to 1 long shot.

1901: Conley Turns Hostile

When Conley started racing in 1897 he was described by the press as “modest” without having a “big head” or a sense of entitlement. When he was interviewed by the Call a year later he seemed confident but not arrogant or combative. By 1901 his attitude had changed. After numerous victories on forgotten tracks after being suspended for infractions harassed on the track by white jockeys under unrelenting pressure to win Conley by 1901 had become hostile angry quarrelsome and violent.

From January to June 1901 Conley’s name appeared in local newspapers several times twice for committing acts of violence. Like many other jockeys Conley frequented saloons and pool halls between races where he drank played poker and pool.

Within the gambling and saloon subculture it was common for a misunderstanding or an argument to escalate into a fight. Conley was usually armed with a knife and a handgun for protection. Conley had a short temper that sometimes got him in trouble.

Fight at the Kearny Street Saloon

On the night of January 21 1901 Conley was drinking in a saloon on Kearny Street in San Francisco. Conley got into an argument with a pool player over who should pay for the drinks. Conley pulled out a knife and slashed his face.

Conley was arrested and charged with “assault with a deadly weapon.” Conley claimed he acted in self-defense. Conley posted $100 bail and was released from jail. In February 1901 Conley appeared before the Superior Court. We don’t know how the case was resolved but it does not appear the he served time in jail.

On May 12 1901 Long Shot was playing poker at Bayer’s saloon near the Emeryville track when he became involved in a incident in which guns were drawn. Fortunately bystanders intervened and no shots were fired. The Call article suggests Conley was reacting to his hand being tipped by a spectator.

Conley again found himself in trouble in 1902. On April 30 as Conley was leaving the track he reportedly made an insulting comment to a white female who slapped him in the face. The incident was reported to police and Conley was arrested and taken to jail. Conley retained a Black attorney Torn Pearson who showed up the next day in court to defend the jockey. Judge Smith charged Conley with battery and released him on $50 bail. He was ordered to appear in court the next day. Conley failed to appear in court and forfeited his bail.

By this time he had boarded a train headed east for parts unknown. After this departure he never raced again in the Bay Area.

Conspiracy Against Black Jockeys and Anti-Betting Laws

After the turn of the century an unfortunate development occurred which made it difficult for Black jockeys to secure mounts. In a conspiracy on the part of white jockeys and horse owners Black jockeys were not hired to ride in many parts of the country. White jockeys supported this policy because it eliminated competition from Black jockeys.

Another problem that confronted both white and Black jockeys was the closing of race tracks all over the country. The number of horse racetracks in the U.S. declined from 314 to as few as 25 in 1908. Many of them were forced to close because of anti-betting laws passed by cities and state legislatures. Ingleside Track closed in 1905 because of a San Francisco city ordinance banning racetrack betting. California passed an anti-betting law that closed all the racetracks in the state in 1911. The Emeryville Track was forced to close in February 1911. All of the racetracks shut down in New York in 1911 and 1912. With fewer racetracks in operation the occupation of jockey became more precarious.

Injured in Chicago

In January 1903 Conley made an appearance at the New Orleans track in the midst of a scandal. Track officials suspected there had been collusion between the bookies trainers and jockeys in an effort to rig the races. This inside information evidently gave the bookmakers an advantage. There was an investigation to make sure the races were conducted in an honest manner.

Conley raced again in October 1903 at the Piedmont Park Racetrack in Atlanta Georgia. On October 10 Conley riding for H. C. Shulz of Detroit piloted three winners across the finish line.

ADVERTISEMENT

In June 1904 at the Washington Park Racetrack in Chicago Conley was involved in a serious accident. In the fourth race aboard Sky Pilot the horse broke his right leg and collapsed on the track. Conley went down with the horse. He suffered a “severely injured” back as a result of the fall. He lay unconscious and had to be carried off the track.

He soon recovered and by August 1904 he was back in the saddle riding at a track in St. Louis. Conley’s name appears in a July 1907 newspaper aboard Paul at the Latonia Track in Kentucky.

1911: Attempted Comeback & Final Years

Conley’s name disappears from the newspapers for several years. However in 1911 at the age of about 41 he tried to make a comeback by entering the Kentucky Derby. The race took place on May 13. In a field of seven horses Conley astride Colston took third place while the winner Meridian set a record for the course having run the distance in 2:05:00. Conley’s horse lost by 15 lengths.

After his performance in the 1911 Kentucky Derby Conley’s name again disappears from the newspapers for several years. Finally a New York Herald October 23 1920 p. 11 article appeared which provides information about the twilight of his career.

The article reads:

“Conley is probably the oldest jockey in the world. He admits to forty-six and his friends say he has passed the fifty mark. He is ‘Long Shot’ Jess Conley who a generation ago was considered one of the best in the country. In 1904 he rode five winners in one day and time and again guided home three and four winners a day. His last winning mount was in 1912. Since then he has had an occasional mount. He has earned his living exercising in the morning rather than riding in races.”

There are no public records to determine when and where Conley died and Conley has yet to be inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

Anti-Betting Legislation Ends Race Track Era in California

Emeryville’s race track era came to an abrupt end when the State Legislature passed an anti-betting bill in 1910 that forced the California Jockey Club and all other California race tracks to close. The last race at Emeryville was run on February 15 1911.

ADVERTISEMENT

On December 15 1915 a fire swept through the race track complex destroying all of the buildings. The closing of the California Jockey Club which in 1910 was the largest employer of African Americans in the city was devastating to Emeryville’s African American work force.

Golden Gate Fields in Albany opened in 1947 after California re-legalized parimutuel wagering.

This weekend’s story continued this trend with a “blink and you’ll miss it” tribute to one of the biggest moments in MCU history.

OH....SNAP!

“Episode 8” of WandaVision shows how Wanda Maximoff created her sitcom version of Westview during her breakdown dealing with Vision’s death.

As a ""wave"" of red magic encapsulates the entire town to transform it into a 1950s black & white setup a billboard on the side of a building can be seen with the phrase “Make cleaning up a SNAP!” as well as the word “Lagos” referencing the super heroic events of Avengers : Infinity War and Captain America : Civil War that Wanda was heavily involved in.

WandaVision

WANDA’S PAST STICKING WITH HER

As has been the case throughout WandaVision  Marvel Studios is doing an outstanding job of not only referencing the MCU’s past but making sure it connects directly to the central heroes .

“Lagos” refers to the city where Wanda helped defeat and kill Crossbones in Captain America: Civil War . In this event she threw Brock Rumlow into a building full of people as he exploded accidently killing multiple innocent civilians. It's noteworthy that WandaVision brought back the faux ""Lagos"" brand in Wanda's sitcom world after debuting it in the paper towel commercial in ""Episode 5.""

As for “Snap” this obviously ties back to one of the single biggest moments in MCU history. In Avengers: Infinity War  the Mad Titan Thanos killed Vision and defeated Wanda before completing the Infinity Gauntlet and snapping his fingers to wipe out half of all life in the universe.

These are two of the most impactful moments in Wanda’s life both of which contribute to the pain and suffering she feels so often in the MCU. It makes perfect sense that in another moment of pure grief these two moments come to the forefront of her mind once again.

It will be interesting to find out which MCU references will find their way into the season finale. No matter what they turn out to be they will surely delight fans who have been keeping up with the story the whole way through.

Marks and Spencer is the place to go for pretty underwear at good prices and with a huge selection there is always something for everyone.

Rosie Huntington-Whiteley 's range is particularly gorgeous with most styles featuring silk and lace - and the new collection is as luxury as always.

Posting a picture on Instagram of the floral bra and underwear set M&S wrote: "" @indiaamoon is getting ready for spring in @rosiehw floral-print lingerie.""

The model was wearing a pastel pink robe which matched the colour scheme of her bedroom but there was something else in the shot that caught shoppers' attention - and left them quite confused.

One fan commented: ""Anyone else think that was a slice of bacon on the bedside table?""

This remark got a lot of replies of people agreeing and one asked: ""What is it?!""

Another shopper wrote: ""Thought those were two rashers of uncooked bacon on her bedside table - unconventional breakfast in bed but I could work with it!""

No one took to the comments to explain what the 'rashers of bacon' were but to us it looks like perhaps a piece of abstract art that's yet to be put up?

Over the last few weeks it seems the Irish actor has been dropping hints about a new relationship.

Today's top videos

It is believed that Barry and his longterm girlfriend Shona Guerin parted ways last year after the pair moved to the UK while Barry was shooting the upcoming Batman movie.

The pair have unfollowed one another on social media and the Kerry woman has returned to Ireland in recent months.

However neither Barry nor Shona have spoken publicly about their relationship to confirm or deny the split.

Barry has sparked new romance rumours when he shared a picture of himself with another lady looking very happy exploring London earlier this year.

Although he deleted the picture from his Instagram Story after followers spotted it the Dunkirk actor has now shared another snap of himself with Alyson.

Posting a new picture with the sun illuminating them from behind the pair beam at the camera.

Barry tagged Alyson in the picture although her Instagram is private. This time she shielded her face with a pair of sunglasses and a woolly hat for what seemed to be a walk in the good weather.

The jury’s still out on whether it’s a romantic or platonic relationship but as the previous photo had included a love-heart the rumour mill started churning.

Barry has been keeping busy over the last number of years and is due to star in Marvel's Eternals The Green Knight and DC's Batman.

While Shona has returned to Ireland she confirmed to EVOKE that she is currently working on a film production in Dublin.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9rLmNvLnVrL2NlbGVicml0eS1uZXdzL2plcmVteS1jbGFya3Nvbi1iZWFyZC1oYWlyLXVucmVjb2duaXNhYmxlLTIzNTgyNjEy0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub2suY28udWsvY2VsZWJyaXR5LW5ld3MvamVyZW15LWNsYXJrc29uLWJlYXJkLWhhaXItdW5yZWNvZ25pc2FibGUtMjM1ODI2MTIuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jeremy Clarkson looks unrecognisable in latest snap with lockdown grey beard and long hair,"Something went wrong please try again later.

Others felt that the father of three actually looked more similar to another character beloved by children; Hagrid from Harry Potter.

A fan simply commented ""Alright Hagrid.""

Although Jeremy may be all healthy now with healthy facial hair to prove it the star recently overcame Covid-19.

Back in January he opened up on battling coronavirus over the Christmas period and fearing he would die on his own from the disease.

The 60 year old revealed that he had contracted the illness and began feeling ill four days before Christmas.

Writing in an article for The Times the star explained that he felt poorly so began googling his symptoms and went to get a test which came back positive.

Writing in the column the presenter revealed: “The doctor was very clear I'd feel under the weather for between five and 14 days and then I'd either get better or I'd have to go to hospital.

“Where because I am 60 and fat and because I've smoked half a million cigarettes and had double pneumonia I'd probably die on my own in a lonely plastic tent.”

The star who presents The Grand Tour then explained to readers that he had been spending time isolating with his 46-year-old girlfriend Lisa Hogan and her children.

However he felt uncertain as to who he was allowed to have contact with. Jeremy added: “I’m not going to lie — it was quite scary!”"

A Houston nano-brewery is making a big leap and is branching out to open a second location in Montrose. Southern Yankee Beer Company is located off of FM 1960 — and now it’s adding Southern Yankee Crafthouse at 1312 W. Alabama Street.

This new Southern Yankee is taking over the old Good Dog building a prime Montrose space with plans for a summer opening. The entire operation is a true family affair with operating manager Alex Porter working alongside his parents and sister Sydney who is the head brewer. It’s all about fresh brews and wood-fired pizzas — and fitting into a city that welcomes one and all.

The Porters are a former military family who have been all over with a lot of time spent up north. Their brewery’s Southern Yankee name — while technically an oxymoron — strikes at the root of what America’s most diverse city can mean to those who recently or not so recently have come to call it home.

“The idea being to just signal that we welcome all kinds from all backgrounds” Alex Porter tells PaperCity. “It’s amazing how many people like us that come from the North now they’re in the South. We’ll sometimes get people who just walk in and say ‘Hey I just need that shirt.’ “

Now you will be able to get it — and much more — in a new Montrose location.

Transforming the old Good Dog space into a Crafthouse brings quite a few noticeable structural changes. Houston’s Construction Concepts is completely renovating the building. The inside will be opened up with load-bearing walls getting knocked down and replaced by beams. In the newly freed up space there will be an expanded bar put in place that will feature full bar service and a cocktail menu.

Southern Yankee also plans to capitalize on the building’s largely untapped outdoor space. The Porters are having the patio extended by about 25 percent and are adding a large gabled roof with lighting and fans. Part of the idea is creating a space for year-round live entertainment. The backyard also has been cleaned up and there will be comfortable seating out back. All the better for sipping on a brew and chowing down on some wings on the lawn.

“At the Crafthouse we’re gonna have everything we have at the brewery plus” Alex Porter says.

This is especially true when it comes to the food menu. At the brewery on FM 1960 the Porters whip up wood-fired pizza and wings from their food truck. But Southern Yankee Crafthouse will boast a full kitchen allowing the menu to be expanded. Food options will still revolve around wood-fired cooking and pizza and wings will still be at the core of the menu. But at Southern Yankee Crafthouse there also will be cast-iron skillet dishes.

“We’re really excited to explore because it’s a great presentation and it’s a great way of cooking” Alex Porter says. “It’s very flavorful and it’s like when you get a sizzling plate of fajitas it’s just part of the experience.”

With so much focus on the food Southern Yankee is on the lookout for an executive chef as well.

Plans call for Southern Yankee Crafthouse to open around June or July. Get ready for some brews in Montrose.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Rmdy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9zaGluZ2xlLW1vdW50YWluLXJlbW92ZWQtZnJvbS1zb3V0aGVybi1kYWxsYXMtbmVpZ2hib3Job29kLW5laWdoYm9ycy1zYXkvMjU2NjA3NC_SAXlodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNkZncuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvc2hpbmdsZS1tb3VudGFpbi1yZW1vdmVkLWZyb20tc291dGhlcm4tZGFsbGFzLW5laWdoYm9yaG9vZC1uZWlnaGJvcnMtc2F5LzI1NjYwNzQvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Shingle Mountain' Removed From Southern Dallas Neighborhood Neighbors Say,"The process of removing ""shingle mountain"" an eyesore and health hazard for residents of one southern Dallas neighborhood has been completed neighbors say.

The process to remove the 6-story-tall pile of debris started in mid-December -- nearly three years after Marsha Jackson who lives near the site first complained to the city about it.

It took roughly 90 days to remove ""shingle mountain."" To celebrate the removal the Dallas Symphony Orchastra brought its mobile stage to the site to hold an outdoor concert.

""Please don't understand when I do have the tears of joy because I never would think that this day would actually happen just for me down here in my little neighborhood"" Jackson said.

In past interviews with NBC 5 Jackson said dust from the site forced her family indoors and impacted their health.

By December 2018 11 months after Jackson raised concerns the city of Dallas sued Blue Star Recycling the company that had planned to grind up the shingles and sell them for use in road paving material over code violations.

In April 2019 a judge ordered the owners to remove the pile within 90 days but in June of that year with the judge's deadline approaching the recycling company said it didn't have the money to remove the material but that it was making arrangements with other recycling firms and that it could take up to another year to clear the site.

When that year came and went last summer one of the co-owners of Blue Star Recycling said that he'd tried to fix the problems after ""not so great business practices by someone else"" but that he was now out of business and was seeking bankruptcy protection. The second co-owner never replied to messages left by NBC 5.

City Council member Tennell Atkins who represets District 8 said the shingle material was removed by city contractor Roberts Trucking. It was processed at McCommas Bluff Landfill and recycled he said.

The removal process was supervised by Modern Geosciences with air quality being measured on and off the property.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmVzc2Nvbm5lY3RzLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvbmV3cy9jb25uZWN0aW9ucy9oaXN0b3J5L3NvdXRoZXJuLXRpZXIvMjAyMS8wMi8yNy9nYWxsZXJ5LXNvdXRoZXJuLXRpZXItdGhyb3diYWNrLTEzLzY4MTgwMDMwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southern Tier Throwback 13: Broome County and the military,"SOUTHERN TIER

NEW ALBANY Ind. (AP) — Duke Energy plans to close a 63-year-old coal-fired power plant in southern Indiana months earlier than had been expected.

The utility’s R. Gallagher power plant which boasts twin smokestacks that have long towered over the Ohio River city of New Albany was scheduled to be retired in 2022. But the company recently announced that the plant will close by June 1.

The Gallagher station went online in 1958 in New Albany. A second unit began generating electricity in 1959 followed by two more units in 1960 and 1961 at the plant located just north of Louisville.

Two units were retired in early 2012 after a federal jury ruled that illegal modifications had been made to two of the units causing violations of the Clean Air Act. Pollution-control equipment was installed in the other two units which burn low-sulfur coal to reduce emissions.

The Gallagher station operated at a limited capacity in recent years and lower power demand during the pandemic has further reduced operations said Duke Energy spokeswoman Angeline Protogere.

Protogere said the closure is not expected to disrupt service in the area noting that the company’s other plants and power resources meet current needs the News and Tribune reported.

Activity at the site could still continue for several years however as the company dismantles the facility and closes on-site coal ash basins."

DALLAS — American Airlines and Southwest Airlines two of the largest companies in North Texas together lost about 35300 employees last year as the air travel industry grappled with its worst-ever crisis.

American and Southwest each disclosed the employee losses in regulatory filings this month. A combination of voluntary employee separations and retirements contributed to the workforce reductions spokespeople from both companies said. American also restructured its management team in Fort Worth last year and that came with a 30 percent headcount reduction for those particular functions.

Last year's losses could have been even worse.

Airlines avoided mass layoffs after the federal government provided financial aid to the industry as part of multiple coronavirus relief packages. In exchange for taking Payroll Support Program funds the airlines agreed not to conduct furloughs or layoffs.

American which has roughly double the number of employees as Dallas-based Southwest accounted for the bulk of employee losses between the two carriers. But even as a percentage American's losses were far more substantial.

American relies on lucrative overseas travel a sector which experts project will be among the last to fully recover. Almost all of Southwest's network on the other hand is concentrated in the U.S.

Southwest also came into the pandemic on a stronger financial footing than American.

According to regulatory filings American's headcount went from 133700 at the end of 2019 to 102700 at the end of last year for a total loss of 31000 employees. The loss marks a 23 percent reduction.

During the same time period Southwest's headcount went from 60800 down to 56500 for a loss of 4300 employees. That represents a 7 percent reduction.

Locally the two corporate giants also employ many frontline employees as American accounts for more than 80 percent of the traffic at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and Southwest flies more than 90 percent of the traffic at Dallas Love Field.

Southwest still maintains an employee base of around 11000 in North Texas a spokesperson said similar to pre-pandemic levels. American employed about 33000 North Texans heading into the pandemic and today employs fewer people locally a spokesperson said declining to provide a specific number.

As far as potential 2021 employee cuts American recently told employees 13000 could be furloughed this spring if more federal financial aid is not given to the industry. Up to 2700 employees could be affected in DFW. Southwest said it doesn't plan on furloughs or layoffs through 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDVhdGxhbnRhLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NvdXRod2VzdC1mbGlnaHQtZ3JvdW5kZWQtaW4tYXRsYW50YS1kdWUtdG8tbWVjaGFuaWNhbC1pc3N1ZS1vZmZpY2lhbHMtc2F50gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94NWF0bGFudGEuY29tL25ld3Mvc291dGh3ZXN0LWZsaWdodC1ncm91bmRlZC1pbi1hdGxhbnRhLWR1ZS10by1tZWNoYW5pY2FsLWlzc3VlLW9mZmljaWFscy1zYXkuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest flight grounded in Atlanta due to mechanical issue officials say,"article

A Southwest Airlines flight bound for Fort Myers Fla. diverted to Atlanta when it experienced a mechanical issue officials said.

Reports indicated Southwest Flight 2044 traveling from Chicago Midway to Fort Myers landed at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport on Saturday. Officials with the airline said the landing was a cautious move by the flight's pilot. The flight landed safely without incident or injuries.

The flight carried 126 customers and five crew members landed safely without incident in Atlanta.

""We have removed the aircraft from service for further review and will accommodate the customers on a different aircraft scheduled to arrive in Fort Myers about an hour delayed"" a spokesperson with the airline said.

American which currently offers daily flights to Phoenix and Dallas-Fort Worth from Santa Barbara will start the new Chicago service on May 8 Deanna Zachrisson the Santa Barbara Airport’s business development manager confirmed to Noozhawk.

The flights presumably aimed at the leisure-travel market will be on Saturdays and Sundays between May and September Zachrisson said.

American plans to use Airbus A319 jetliners — a twin-engine aircraft that can seat 124 to 156 passengers depending on the configuration.

The flights will depart O’Hare International Airport in Chicago at 9:50 a.m. with a noon arrival in Santa Barbara then turn around for a 5:45 p.m arrival in Chicago Zachrisson said.

The new Santa Barbara service is part of an expansion by American in the Chicago market that includes service to Fresno; Billings Montana; Spokane Washington; and Nantucket Massachusetts.

In the fall of 2019 United Airlines announced it was instituting daily red-eye service between Santa Barbara and Chicago O’Hare scheduled to start in June 2020 but those plans were scuttled by the COVID-19 pandemic.

United has not announced whether or when it intends to institute the Santa Barbara-Chicago route but Zachrisson said the carrier is now eyeing daytime flights rather than the red-eyes.

United currently flies from Santa Barbara to San Francisco and Denver. It canceled its daily service to Los Angeles International Airport last spring as the pandemic took hold and it’s not known when those flights might resume.

In related news Southwest Airlines plans to hold a job fair next month to hire 25 to 30 employees as part of its entry into the Santa Barbara market Zachrisson said.

The no-frills airline announced in January that it would begin service to Las Vegas Oakland and Denver from Santa Barbara on April 12 flying its trademark 737 aircraft.

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 0.32%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1pbmMtbnlzZS0xNjE0NDAyNzEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange you may begin.

Dennis Lange: Thank you Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 first quarter webcast. Here today in addition to myself is Don Allan President and CEO; Chris Nelson COO EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning Don Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.

And as we normally do we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO Don Allan.

Don Allan: Thank you Dennis and good morning everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent solid execution and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy. We are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin. This is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24 versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022.

Story continues

Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results. Specifically we have captured 1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024 consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations. We believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months.

As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20% which is predominantly our cyclically depressed outdoor business and the rapidly recovering aerospace fastener business. We are actioning significant cost efficiencies to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as widebody plane production continues to recover. Our long-term success will be driven by improved profitability coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand.

We are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023 ACE Hardware named Craftsman as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award. Congratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners it's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return.

Turning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down 1 point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand. Adjusted gross margin was 29% up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. We are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50 up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. On April 1 we completed the sale of STANLEY Infrastructure to Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet. Looking forward in 2024 we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. At the same time we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses. I want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward.

I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance.

Chris Nelson: Thank you Don and good morning everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor first quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion down 1% organically versus prior year as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand which pressured volume. Pricing was relatively flat consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain and organic growth. Now turning to the product lines.

Power tools was up 1 point organically led by pro-driven growth in DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high margin DEWALT cordless. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand. Outdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data which showed an early start to the season versus prior year. We are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last two years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays. The independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory which pressured shipments in the quarter.

We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025. As Don alluded earlier the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure. Consistent with our overall strategy our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the UK.

We are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share. In aggregate all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America Brazil Mexico Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter. In summary for Tools & Outdoor we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength. We are making deliberate investments in our brands market activation and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to the long-term shareholder returns.

I will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and engineered passing volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and a point of currency pressure. Within the Industrial segment Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. We believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening. Industrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1% an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity.

A toolbox filled with an array of different tools representing the professional products of the company.

This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced. The quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year. Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode ramp-up time is eliminated between shots.

DEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20-volt MAX cordless 2-1/4 Peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site. Additionally our TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps PROs maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites. These are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive.

We believe these innovations coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains. As we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT Craftsman and STANLEY. Thank you and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.

Pat Hallinan: Thanks Chris and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately 145 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the period bringing our aggregate savings to approximately 1.2 billion since program inception. As we focus our portfolio streamline our business structure and transform our operations our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure. Given the dynamic macro environment we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025.

Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components finished goods and indirect expenditures. Our operations excellence program which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities. A pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming which are more event-driven will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.

We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025. And -- the manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter which affected five sites with the goal to complete the site modifications this year. Regarding product platforming this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.

In aggregate our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024 improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases. This quarter our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately 360 million where we've traditionally averaged a roughly 700 million increase in the first quarter of the year.

Days of inventory is now approximately 150 days an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days. We used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet. We remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. For the full year 2024 we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency. CapEX is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives.

These items combined with organic cash generation support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent investing in organic growth and our transformation funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. We expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024 and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year.

We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s. We are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls.

Our view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Infrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly. Our planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024.

These are designed to accelerate innovation market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley brands. This should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.

Our adjusted EPS range remains $1 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million largely relating to the supply chain transformation program with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024 with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.

Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25% with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile. In summary we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion cash generation balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market. We are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that I will now pass the call back to Don.

Don Allan: Thank you Pat. As we report another quarter of progress our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team. As our profitability continues to improve we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands particularly DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley. We believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2x to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools and Outdoor and Engineered Fastening. We are focused on consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. With that we are now ready for Q&A Dennis.

Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks Don. Shannon we can now start the Q&A please. Thank you.

I pretty much curbed my tea habit during the pandemic opting for sparkling water over my go-to iced chai on slow afternoons. I can't tell you the last time I visited a coffee shop (shout-out to social distancing) but after seeing a recent matcha trend go viral on TikTok I decided I needed to get into gear and find a Starbucks drive-through location. My order? An iced matcha latte with two pumps of chai.

The iced matcha order heard round TikTok can be traced back to @swanmuse (aka Robin) who called the latte the ""best drink in the world"" and vowed it tastes ""like the moon herself."" Is anyone's palate really prepared for that kind of wonder? As it turns out yes. Several creators vouched for Robin's recommendation including Lizzo! A similar drink has actually been quietly chilling on the Starbucks secret menu for ages under the moniker Cha Cha Latte — I might be late to the party but thrilled to be here all the same.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGVwaS5jb20vbG9jYWwvc2VhdHRsZW5ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMC15ZWFyLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LW5pc3F1YWxseS1lYXJ0aHF1YWtlLXdhc2gtMTU5ODI4NDYucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,20 years ago today: 6.8 Nisqually earthquake rocked Western Washington,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.seattlepi.com/local/seattlenews/article/20-year-anniversary-nisqually-earthquake-wash-15982846.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGVwaS5jb20vbG9jYWwvc2VhdHRsZW5ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMC15ZWFyLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LW5pc3F1YWxseS1lYXJ0aHF1YWtlLXdhc2gtMTU5ODI4NDYucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL2RhaWx5cHJvZ3Jlc3MuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYnVzaW5lc3Mvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLXByb3Bvc2VkLWZvci11LXMtMjktYWNyb3NzLWZyb20td2FsbWFydC9hcnRpY2xlX2FhYWI4NGIwLTc5ZWEtMTFlYi1hMzM1LTlmODkxZTM0N2FhYy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks proposed for U.S. 29 across from Walmart,"Another Starbucks could be coming to Albemarle County.

A developer is proposing to build a Starbucks with a drive-thru on U.S. 29 across from Walmart.

The county’s Architectural Review Board will review the initial site plan for the project at its virtual meeting Monday.

There is currently an office building on the site which is about 0.7 acres. Early last year the property at 2231 Seminole Lane was rezoned from Commercial Office to Highway Commercial but a proposed use for the property was not given at the time.

County staffers recommended that the ARB which regulates the design of development along entrance corridors recommends approval of the initial site plan without conditions. Staff also recommended a number of revisions to the proposed plan before any final approvals including more specifics about the building and landscaping.

Currently Starbucks locations at Pantops Fifth Street and the former Wells Fargo bank off U.S. 29 near Best Buy also have drive-thrus.

Last year the county’s ARB also approved changes to the 29th Place shopping center Starbucks at the intersection of U.S. 29 and Berkmar Drive. The store will be relocated to the other end of the building and a drive-thru will be added.

The ARB has a full agenda Monday including six regular review items and a work session.

In addition to the Starbucks the board also will review changes to the Charlottesville Albemarle Airport’s parking lot elevator and stairs an auto dealership on the corner of Rio Road and U.S. 29 and changes to a Holiday Inn Express on Pantops.

It also will review an initial site plan for an ExtraSpace storage facility in Hollymead along Worth Crossing. It will be visible from U.S. 29 behind the Exxon gas station.

The Board of Supervisors in December approved changes to the site to allow for additional square footage beyond what was approved in the original rezoning as well as different building footprint locations.

County staff recommended the ARB recommend approval of the initial site plan without conditions. Staff also recommended a number of revisions to the proposed plan before any final approvals including that the applicant provides renderings of the building from both directions on U.S. 29 with and without landscaping.

The ARB will also have a work session about architectural revisions to a proposed Sheetz at the intersection of Airport Road and U.S. 29.

The meeting is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. on Zoom.

While some would assume that Eastern’s campus became quiet after the departure of students for Thanksgiving break the Eastern Sodexo team was brewing up their newest addition to campus: Zime. Officially opening the first week of the Spring semester students are becoming accustomed to the new and exciting addition of healthier meal options and Starbucks coffee. I spoke with Scott Lofland the general manager for Sodexo at Eastern about the change and how it came to be.

A few years ago Sodexo heard that Eastern students were not too happy with the slow wait times and greasy foods that were being served at Jammin’ Java and Eagle’s Nest. Sodexo held focus groups with Eastern students and tried their best to figure out how to better suit the Eastern population. The students expressed their desire for accessible fresh and healthy food as well as a larger assortment of beverages. Lofland and his team began doing their research into different Sodexo brands across the country and found Zime a healthy eating option that also served Starbucks coffee. Needless to say they decided to bring Zime to Eastern.

Zime was originally slated to open at Eastern in the Fall 2020 semester but due to the coronavirus restrictions put in place by Governor Wolf construction had to be delayed. Lofland stated that due to the shutdown of construction companies in Radnor Township none of the construction permits could be approved and Sodexo was stuck at a standstill. Thankfully the permits were approved by the time Thanksgiving rolled around so the team was still able to get Zime in this academic year.

While students returned to see Starbucks drinks on the menu the biggest surprise was the updated food options that Zime has to offer. Instead of the fattening chicken fingers and turkey melts that students were used to at Eagle’s Nest Zime offers healthier (and fresher) options like pasta rice bowls empanadas and flatbreads. Lofland emphasized the freshness of the food at Zime stating that he was proud that Zime’s service was not only faster than its predecessor but better in both quality and freshness.

The student reaction to Zime so far has been generally positive. When asked about his opinion of Zime self-described coffee lover Michael Newman said that the new menu has impressed him. “I was pleasantly surprised not only by the new look but also by the better quality of the food” said Newman. Senior Lindsey Thompson echoed Newman stating that “having Starbucks (drinks) is really familiar and nice”. As a student who visits Zime on a fairly regular basis I agree with Newman and Thompson. On top of that the line at Zime has moved quicker than the line ever did at Jammin Java which is a huge improvement in my eyes. Zime has quickly become the new favorite food spot of Eastern students and we are so excited to see how Zime continues to get better.

There were buckets at each of the eight starting platforms for masks and jackets a plethora of disinfectant bottles used after each heat and the typical standing-room-only crowd had been dramatically reduced to just a handful of socially-distant spectators.

The conclusion of the tournament though was business as usual.

The St. Xavier AquaBombers continued to turn the annual event into the ""St. Xavier Invitational"" capturing their 13th consecutive OHSAA state team swimming championship.

""This season was filled with change and challenge. My heart and hat go out to them because they put in the work from Day 1 and knew it was an uphill struggle but they were ready to work and carry on the tradition that classes before them had passed on"" St. Xavier head coach Tim Beerman said. ""Without everyone's contributions to what this season became it wouldn't be the celebration that it is right now.""

There were changes with how the AquaBombers climbed to the top of the team standings to win the program's 42nd career title.

According to Beerman he had a slew of first-time state swimmers this season. St. Xavier encapsulated the essence of being a team on Saturday stretching the gap between itself and state runner-up Upper Arlington by over 70 points (261.5-190) without the benefit of an individual state champion. Instead the AquaBombers used their seemingly unending barrage of top-tier swimmers to capture the team trophy.

St. Xavier had at least one swimmer make the podium in 10 of the 11 events and had a top-5 medalist in nine. The turning point for the state team championship came in the 500 free when St. Xavier pulled away with a mix of what has made them such a perennial power and what will keep them that way.

Going into the 500 free St. Xavier was deadlocked for first place in the team standings with Mason. Freshmen Thackston McMullan and Alex Ingram came from the second heat to finish fourth and eighth respectively in the finals. In the third and final heat senior Adam Lamping came in third and junior Nicholas Gockerman finished seventh.

Fielding half (4-of-8) of the podium visitors in the event gave St. Xavier a whopping 54 points cushioning a lead that would only expand over the final four events.

""That's how it was all season"" Beerman said. ""The guys really stepped up and learned how to race and learned how to represent what St. X swimming and diving is about. That's what we relied on here at the state meet. There were a lot of guys who had to get their feet wet and they did. The results speak for themselves.""

McMullan was also in the top-5 in 200 free (5th) and was on two state runner-up relays (200 FR 400 FR). Junior Logan Tobery was on all three top-5 relays and brought in points with a 13th-place finish in the 100 free. Fellow junior Chase Guenther went third in the opening 5th-place 200 medley relay with seniors Nathan Wall and Tristan Menninger and was 10th in the 100 backstroke.

Individually Wall was fifth in the 200 individual medley and third in the 100 breast. He was also on the runner-up 400 relay group and Menninger was seventh in the 100 back.

""It's awesome especially with this group of guys. We're a very close team and I wouldn't want to accomplish this with anyone else"" said senior Owen Taylor who was on a pair of state runner-up relays and finished top-5 in the 50 and 100 free. ""It's a team sport and everyone contributed for us to do this again. Winning individual (titles) is cool and all but all that matters is the team.""

Also bringing in points individually were seniors Lamping (12th in 200 free) and Will Morstadt (15th in 50 free). Junior William Froass was on the state runner-up 200 free relay group and Gockerman finished 10th in the 200 free.

""We have a lot of guys who stepped up for us tonight"" Taylor said.

The only thing missing for the state-champion AquaBombers was the standard herd of the Long Blue Lane which usually migrates to the stands just behind the podium and makes its presence felt throughout the meet.

That group was reduced to just one row of fans on Saturday but Beerman knows that dedicated bunch was faithfully watching with glee back in Cincinnati.

""I know that the Long Blue Lane is well-represented here and at home"" he said. ""They are a part of this journey in every aspect and we missed having them here. We know that they're with us in spirit and this celebration and championship belongs to them just as much as any other part of the team.""

Mason grabs Cincinnati's 2 individual titles

Mason found themselves in a tie with St. Xavier for first place in the team standings at Saturday's halfway point after Comet swimmers won the area's only Division I boys individual state championships.

Mason entered Saturday's first event — 200 medley relay — with just the fifth-best seeding time at 1:33.69. District-champion Kings had the best (1:32.42) and St. Xavier was less than two-tenths of a second behind.

But it was Mason's group of juniors Elijah Devyak and Carl Bloebaum and seniors Kevin Wu and Braden Osborn that registered an early upset. The Comets shaved off over 2.5 seconds from their seeding time and pulled away from runner-up Hoover for the state title.

""It's surreal"" Devyak said. ""We were fifth coming in and we just wanted to give it our all. When Braden (Osborn) finished we just went crazy. There are really no words to describe it.""

The 50 free was less dramatic. Osborn was the front-runner coming into the event and improved on his seeding time winning a state championship game in 20:23.

""It's a good feeling"" Osborn said. ""Putting in the hard work this season and seeing the results is really the reason I swim. Looking up and seeing the time just means the world to me.""

The same state-champion relay group finished third in the 200 free relay. Bloebaum was state runner-up in the 100 butterfly and Devyak came in fifth. Osborn was also fifth in the 100 free.

Mason girls were the state runner-ups in Division I girls on Friday. The Mason boys ended up fourth with 145 total points.

FORT LAUDERDALE | St. Thomas Aquinas High School’s legendary coach George Smith has announced his retirement effective at the end of the 2020-21 school year.

Coach Smith has been teacher coach athletic director mentor and friend to thousands at Aquinas for the past 49 years. He has been the foundation of one of the country’s most recognized and successful high school athletic programs establishing the standard for athletics at St. Thomas in Broward County the State of Florida and the entire country.

Photographer: COURTESY St. Thomas Aquinas High School will pay tribute to coach and athletic director George Smith later this year. He announced his retirement at the end of February effective at the end of the 2020-2021 school year.

More than the victories and awards Smith said he is most proud of the legacy left on the STA campus and the drive he inspired in the hearts of the athletes he has come to know and love. “What happens off the field is the greatest reward” he said.

St. Thomas Principal Denise Aloma speaking of her colleague and friend noted that “for almost 50 years as teacher coach and AD George Smith has set the highest of goals for athletes coaches and all of Raider athletics. His leadership and commitment provided the platforms to consistently surpass those goals. His selfless tireless extradentary contribution to the success of the program is etched in the halls of STA. The hearts and minds of all of us blessed to have known him are strengthened.”

Msgr. Vincent Kelly former supervising principal at St. Thomas noted the assistance Smith has given to placing athletes in prestigious colleges throughout the nation. “George Smith has made a vibrant contribution to the lives of thousands of students and adults. Through the medium of football and athletics in general he has given so many the awareness and then the development of their own personal dignity their natural talent and their potential for leadership in the future. We are truly grateful to George for a life of dedicated service not only to youth but to all of us.”

Smith was hired as history and physical education teacher at St. Thomas in 1972.He started the school’s wrestling program that same year and continued as head wrestling coach until 1978. Smith posted an overall record of 72-19 and was named Wrestling Coach of the Year in 1973-74 by the Miami Herald and twice for the South Atlantic Conference.

In 1975 Smith was named head football coach and the Raiders began an unprecedented sprint towards excellence for the next 33 years. Under Smith’s helm the Raiders went 361-66 amassing 18 district championships 8 undefeated regular seasons 6 state championships and7 state runner-ups. Under Coach Smith St. Thomas led the state in most appearances in the tournament series with a 69-20 record. As head coach he holds the record (13) forappearances in the state tournament series and is the third-winningest football coach in Florida history. During Smith’s years as head coach 580 players went on to play college football and 30 continued to the pros.

Smith took on the leadership role as STA’s Athletic Director in 1982. His vision and community development provided the platform for the program’s rise towards state and national prominence. St. Thomas is a Nike Elite School and Gatorade Top 25. Raider football appeared on national networks at least once for the last 14 years.

Coach Smith also has been instrumental in massive renovation efforts on campus most significantly state-of-the-art athletic facilities that include: the George Smith Athletic Center (athletic offices fitness center varsity locker rooms weight room wrestling facility); synthetic track turf fields (baseball football/soccer/lacrosse practice field and softball) and most recently a practice gym for basketball and volleyball.

Currently more than 1000 student-athletes participate on 34 teams at St. Thomas. During his 39-year AD tenure Raider athletics has won 111 FHSAA state championships and 13 national championships plus myriad other Florida and national recognitions.

Smith himself has been inducted into the Broward County Sports Hall of Fame the City of Fort Lauderdale “Walk of Fame” the Florida Athletic Coaches Association Hall of Fame the FHSAA All Century Coaching Staff and MaxPreps 12th Best Coach of All Time among many other recognitions.

The school is planning events later this year in honor of Smith.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY21pYW1pLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3B1YmxpeC1jb3ZpZC0xOS12YWNjaW5lLWxvY2F0aW9ucy1pbi1taWFtaS1kYWRlLWJyb3dhcmQvMjM5Mzg5Mi_SAWpodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNtaWFtaS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9wdWJsaXgtY292aWQtMTktdmFjY2luZS1sb2NhdGlvbnMtaW4tbWlhbWktZGFkZS1icm93YXJkLzIzOTM4OTIvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Publix COVID-19 Vaccine Locations in Miami-Dade Broward,"Starting March 1st Publix will begin administering COVID-19 vaccinations at its 136 pharmacies in Miami-Dade and Broward.

One: New technology illuminates Black history at Ft. Mose

As the site of the first legally sanctioned free African settlement in what is now the United States Fort Mose Historic State Park has long played an important role in telling the history of slaves who risked their lives in an escape to freedom. It is exciting to know that new technology will help the park do that in a more modern and accessible way.

Last week thanks to support from Florida Power & Light and the Community Foundation of Northeast Florida the park unveiled new interactive signage that will highlight its historical significance through a self-guided tour.

Every February Fort Mose hosts a three-day event in which reenactors detail that history for thousands of visitors. Now thanks to FPL and the Community Foundation anyone can benefit from their expertise year-round. Simply scan a QR code and learn the history of a specific location on the flight to freedom.

The mechanics are simple but the significance is not. Bringing this historic site further into the modern age expands its reach and the ability to effectively tell the story of the official National Historic Landmark Flight to Freedom Trail.

A visit to Fort Mose has always been a great opportunity to learn about its rich history. Now that story is being told in a more modern and interactive way. I encourage everyone to make the trip. You’ll be glad you did.

Two: History is inspiring positive change

George Floyd’s death was not in vain. It awakened the world to the tremendous injustices occurring throughout the world with people of color.

When I first came to this beautiful city some 27 years ago I felt the sting of racism in many public places and from some people I met. My grandchildren enjoyed visiting me but all white people left our pool when they entered. Four years forward adults remained in the pool and splashed joyously with my grands.

Racial relations have certainly moved forward. The Record newspaper is credited for the tremendous job done to highlight history of people of color such as a recent story honoring Native Americans land by Nancy-Sikes Klin.

From other stories readers have learned about the first sanctioned free Black community in America. This is Fort Mose in St. Augustine – not Jamestown. Today the Accord Civil Rights Museum vividly and factually portray the history of that period and the Lincolnville Museum and Cultural Center provides the entire Black history from when the Moors conquered Spain to the present. As a result more residents and visitors have become knowledgeable about our contributions our pain and our joy.

Increased knowledge has helped residents denounce racism embrace diversity and confirm the need for bettering the lives of families. Programs like Compassion St. Augustine has brought enhancement programs to incarcerated youth the West Side Coalition has worked toward a better community for poor families.

In spite of the pandemic I am witnessing a tremendous population growth in St. Augustine but we need to find ways to attract Black and Brown people. It means a review that looks toward change of local and state policies and statutes that affect marginal groups negatively and should lead us to restructure many of our social and economic programs. As Dr Martin Luther King Jr. said “We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.”

Three: The forgotten souls of Fish Island shed a grim light on Jesse Fish

Thank you for acknowledging in your recent article some of Fish Island’s storied past and the many facets of Jesse Fish but as we celebrate Black history month let us also remember the many enslaved African people connected to Fish Island Preserve by way of Jesse Fish and the many generations of his mixed race descendants whose stories and contributions lie buried deep within the history of our beloved Fish Island one of the very few remaining places in the oldest city in America connecting the intersection of plantation life the African diaspora and the Atlantic slave trade in 17th 18th and 19th century St. Augustine. Fish Island is not just the story of a little boy who according to McPhee became “Florida’s first orange baron” and his orange plantation that represents the very origins of the commercial orange industry in our nation but it is inextricably linked to the many enslaved people who lived worked and died on “El Vergel.”

More:St. Augustine History: Jesse Fish an 'opportunist' with a troubled life

By 1834 2.5 million oranges were shipped from St Augustine and although colder climates eventually drove Florida’s orange industry further south it began here in St. Augustine. In context Fish arrived in St Augustine from New York as only a child himself well-connected to and under the employ of William Walton and Company patriarch of one of the largest merchant shipping companies of that era and also known to be the “importer of more slaves in early century than all other West Indian merchants combined.” According to historian Jane Landers Fish also had strong familial ties and business partnerships with New York mariners and Charleston merchants with known ties to the Atlantic slave trade.

More:Jesse Fish's claim to Anastasia Island played out for decades

Sixteen years passed from Jesse Fish’s arrival in St Augustine to when records mark the beginning of his own involvement in the human trafficking of enslaved African people. According to Landers Fish “introduced most of the African-born Slaves registered in the decade preceding Spain’s loss of Florida.” Between 1752-1763 Fish is on record as registering 133 enslaved African people 83 of whom were children who ranged in age from 5 to 16 years. The youngest of these was a five-year-old girl named Melchora. The year of registration assigned name and nation of origin for each person can be found in Appendix 9 in Landers’ book Black Society in Spanish Florida. They represent a diverse cultural heritage from over 40 African nations. Landers also describes the process of registering each enslaved person. They were examined assigned a new name a monetary value and then subjected to branding. Leaving behind all traces of their former lives and identities they were made part of the free labor force that built Florida.

Based on census records from 1783 1786 1787 and in his 1796 probate record Fish owned 16 14 17 and 11 slaves respectively. Except for his probate record their names are omitted. In addition to the two children from his first marriage and their mother Fish left behind seven mixed-race grandchildren Sophia Betsy John Maisy Diana Harriet and Phebe whose mother Clarissa was Jesse Fish Jr.’s West Indian servant of African descent. Based on baptismal records found recently by Landers Fish Sr. also had another mixed-race daughter Maria Juan Francesca whose mother was a free Black woman Eva Fish. Their stories are yet to be told.

Whenever I visit Fish Island I am reminded of the many souls connected to this remarkable place and their forgotten place in the history of our community. Explore the city’s website to learn more about Fish Island’s emerging story.

If you regularly drive along the west side of Eau Claire over the past few years you have likely noticed a tall structure growing atop Mount Washington. First a column then girders; now in the winter of 2020-21 the 55-meter ski jump has come to full realization. Its inaugural use was for the 89th Annual Flying Eagles Invitational on Feb. 20-21 and years of planning and volunteer work led to the completion of the project.

According to project engineer and manager Matt Gundry planning began more than a decade ago. Prompts were the deterioration of the old 40-meter structure the evolution of the sport and facilities at Mount Washington. Following a donation from the Severson family approval eventually was made and the construction saga began.

Volunteer help was critical in construction. According to the Flying Eagles Ski Club’s Tami Jastrow they had “over 40 club and other divisional club volunteers along with a lot of community support from such groups as the CVTC lineman program students and the Eau Claire Police Department.” Approximately 2000 man hours came from associates of the ski club’s Dan Mattoon and Prestige Auto.

”

So much of this had to be figured out by trial and error in a hands-on manner.

Challenges were plenty from grading the concrete landing between thunderstorms to dealing with the dynamics of steel and plastic while laying the track assemblies. “So much of this had to be figured out by trial and error in a hands-on manner” Gundry says.

The result is the only 55-meter jump in the United States one that features a clothoide in-run curve. According to Gundry the design optimizes the physics of modern ski jumping. “The improved landing profile results in landing forces that are less than half as hard as designs from a decade ago.”

Gundry notes that the new facility will help local athletes better prepare for new jumps in other locations while featuring infrastructure for better jumping availability and contains industrial-grade composites and galvanized steel to keep it in use for decades.

The next time you drive along Clairemont Avenue or Menomonie Street take a glance up at the new ski jump – when you can do so safely of course. At the top you may see some small figures: the next generation of Eau Claire-area ski jumpers practicing for future glories.

Here’s an expanded Q&A with Matt Gundry of the Flying Eagles Ski Club about the new 55-meter jump on Mount Washington.

Volume One: How was the determination made to build the new jump? Why was the old jump in need of replacement?

Matt Gundry: Replacement of the existing 40m jump had been on the club wish list for over a decade when the initial HS55 concepts were formulated. Although the old jump had served the club well and helped train numerous international level athletes deterioration of the wood ramp structure was becoming a concern. Evolution of hill design standards and jumping techniques over the decades since the 40m had been constructed meant that the old style hill geometry no longer matched up with the modern rendition of the sport. Finally changes to the sizes of the small training hills at Mount Washington resulted in a poor fit for the size of a 40m hill – it was not much larger than the new 30m and yet was less than half the size of Silver Mine. The club felt that a 55 or 60 meter “medium hill” would better fill the gap between the 30m “small hill” and the 85m “normal hill” at Silver Mine.

A very generous donation by the Severson Family prompted the club to develop plans to build a new jump that would “complete” the Mt. Washington training complex. Various alternatives were then explored to try to optimize the jump within the limited space available. After consideration by the club board and with technical support of the International Ski Federation the sanctioning body for ski jumping an HS55 design was finalized. Upon review of the jump plans and additional fundraising the club board approved construction and the four-year odyssey was set in motion.

What was the most technically-challenging part of the overall construction?

In general staging and planning the construction in a manner that allowed the maximum amount of the work to be safely completed by volunteers was challenging. Each new task came with a requisite new set of skills that needed to be learned and practiced on the fly. The materials and methods needed for this project differ considerably from what the average home handyman requires.

Forming and pouring the concrete on the landing was grueling and required some innovative techniques to shape form reinforce and pour the concrete in the very short period of time before the next thunderstorm came along to wash out the sub-grade. However from a technical standpoint mass production and installation of the track assemblies over the past several weeks was one of the biggest challenges. While maintaining the very tight tolerances necessary so that the pieces would fit together well the volunteers also had to solve issues with finicky materials like stainless steel fasteners that would bind easily and plastics that had wildly differing thermal expansion characteristics. So much of this had to be figured out by trial and error in a hands-on manner. We learned a lot in the process and already have ideas for improving the design as we implement the new tracks at other hills in Eau Claire.

What are the most interesting features of this jump?

From the athlete perspective the most interesting aspects of the design are the spiral or clothoide in-run curve and the low-force landing profile. The clothoide in-run begins with a very gradual curve which gets progressively tighter as the athlete approaches the takeoff. The advantage of this new standard (the concept is just over a decade old) over the older style circular curve is that it does not have an abrupt transition at the start of the curve to disrupt the athlete's balance. The tighter curve at the takeoff creates a slightly greater G-force which preloads the skier better for the jump motion but does not subject the skier to prolonged high G-force like the circular curve.

Over the past 15 years or so the International Ski Federation has taken a hard look at the physics of ski jumping to better establish more appropriate biomechanical limits for design of ski jumps. The improved landing profile results in landing forces that are less than half as hard as designs from a decade ago. This reduces the risk of injury in falls or where the athlete out-jumps the hill reduces risk of repetitive strain injury and helps inspire confidence in developing athletes to fly further down the hill. As ski jumping has progressed to become a more inclusive sport this type of safety feature has become ever more important.

For both jumpers and non-jumpers the experience of simply being on this jump is intended to inspire the feeling of flight even if your feet don't leave the ground. The outer railings are barely visible cable railings. The walking surfaces are open grating. The underlying structure is cantilevered so much of the structure is open below. Standing on the start platforms at the top of the new HS55 tower is altogether different than standing on a jump built into the terrain or on scaffolds with solid decking and railings. The panorama extends well below the horizon providing a view seconded only by free falling.

Finally the jump is designed to reduce strain on club resources wherever possible. The new track system follows on the Silver Mine track design implemented by Dave Tomten about five years ago to vastly reduce the amount of snow required to be placed on the tower and shaped. The open stair gratings and cable railings prevent accumulation of falling snow reduce drifting and simplify removal of what little snow does accumulate on the structure. The materials selected for the construction are industrial grade composites and galvanized steel not expected to experience warping decay or significant weathering for decades.

What advantage if at all does the jump provide the ski jumping community in the Eau Claire area?

The new HS55 is the only medium-size jumping hill in the U.S. and one of the few in the world that has the clothoide in-run. It is also one of the few jumps that has been designed for reduced impact forces. Our athletes will be better prepared to compete on new jumps like the large hill being completed in Iron Mountain Michigan and will be able to take more practice jumps with less fatigue and risk of injury. The infrastructure improvements accompanying the new jump aim to increase availability of the jump by reducing the time to prepare the jump at each change of seasons.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZXhjZWxzaW9yLmNvbS9wcm9tb3RlLXNjaWVuY2UtdGVjaG5vbG9neS1hdC1mYXN0ZXItcGFjZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Promote science technology at faster pace,"O P Sharma

Jammu and Kashmir has been celebrating the National Science Day like other parts of the country on February 28 every year as this day in 1928 marks the discovery of the “Raman Effect” by renowned Indian Physicist C V Raman for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize during 1930 and bestowed highest civilian award: Bharat Rattan in the year 1954. Now the Science and technology has assumed great significance and the theme for the current year is : Future of STI-Impacts on Education Skill and Work”.

Steps are already afoot to further promote science and technology in India with notable advances in the missile space technology medicine IT and many other fields with India now emerging as a leading country in the comity of nations. But we still have miles to go and so a greater push has be given for promotion of science and technology. The theme for this year is very relevant and have to make our education suitable for scientific temper and utilise it for bettering the life of the people. The theme which is a very vital for UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and also Ladakh which have rich bio-diversity and vast scope for scientific explorations for contributing to the overall betterment of life. All-out efforts must be made to popularise and promote science and technology to move forward for wide-spread scientific knowledge.

It may be mentioned that there are fairly large number of research-oriented educational institutions and varsities focusing on agriculture horticulture medical science engineering and IT sectors. In fact tangible advances have been made on the scientific horizon and notable progress registered putting India on the high rank among the comity of nations. It is notable that our young bright youth are taking to science and in time to come our talented boys and girls will adorn the high ranks of scientific community for bringing benefits of science and technology to the common people.

Bright Career

It may be recalled that Dr. CV Raman was born on November 7 1888 in the then Madras Presidency (Tamil Nadu) and his father was a Professor of Mathematics and Physics. Young Raman completed his BA and then MA in Physics from the Presidency College Madras. He got a government job and tried for a career in the science field. He participated in various scientific competitions and the then Government selected him for a scholarship for research work in the laboratories of the Indian Association for Cultivation of Science and the University of Calcutta. It may be added that he researched the spectrum nature of steel fundamental issues of steel dynamics; the structure and properties of diamonds.

On the recommendation of the National Council for Science and Technology Communication (NCSTC) in 1986 the “National Science Day” began to be observed in India on February 28 the day when the great Indian Scientist Dr Raman made his important scientific discovery. Now National Science Day is celebrated across the country to focus attention on the advancement of science and technology which certainly hold a key to all development.

High Hopes

Every year a specific theme is discussed and debated to sensitize the people about the urgent need for promotion of science and technology to catch up with the advanced nations. To create awareness among the common masses the event is now organized with seminars conferences public debates and discussions in schools colleges universities and other academic scientific technical medical and research institutions all over the country. On the very first National Science Day in 1987 the National Science Popularization awards were constituted for recognizing outstanding efforts in science communication and popularization.

Young bright Indian scientists are now rated high at the international level who have done India proud in the all sectors including IT sector medicine engineering space technology and other fields. Some of vital topics like :”Expanding Horizons of Science”; “Clean Energy Options and Nuclear Safety” “Science for the People and the People for the Science” “Women in Science and Technology” while this year’s theme: “Future of STI- Impact on Education Skill and Work” has very wide implications. On this day eminent scientists and institutions are given prestigious awards.

Nation’s Objective

Dr APJ Abdul Kalam a top scientist who had served as the 11th President of India in his book “India 2020” had strongly advocated for an Action Plan to develop India into a knowledge superpower and developed nation. He had worked on high positions in DRDO ISRO and was popularly known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology as also India’s Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998. India is on the right tract of science and technology highway and it must now go with quick and sure steps. Key to Advancement

The Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been underscoring the role of scientific knowledge technology and innovations through bold initiatives for overall speed development so that India emerges as a safe and super strong nation.

Some positive signals are emerging with leading advanced educational and other institutions already in place coupled with lot of promise scope and talent . India has made tangible strides it has still to move forward for transformation of society to attain the status of super power with a mission of working for peace progress and spiritual enlightenment for humanity.

If it issues a decision soon the ACM could become the first antitrust authority to rule on Apple’s app-store payment policies which have long drawn complaints from app developers. The European Commission last year opened a formal investigation into the iPhone maker over some of the same practices.

In letters to developers involved in the investigation sent earlier this month which were described to Reuters by two people who received them the regulator stated it was nearing a draft decision in the case.

According to the letter sent by ACM the regulator is also scrutinizing Apple rules that prevent developers from telling users about any cheaper payment alternatives outside of the app.

“It’s not just that Apple is inflicting economic harm” said David Heinemeier Hansson co-founder of software firm Basecamp and one of those who received the letter. “Apple is essentially giving us a gag order.”

If you don't get a satisfactory response submit a complaint through your relevant consumer affairs office.

To avoid data roaming charges disable roaming in your phone settings or get an international data plan from your phone company.

This article explains how to avoid high roaming charges and how to dispute roaming fees on your iPhone bill.

How to Fight iPhone Roaming Bills

If you're facing a big iPhone data roaming bill and want to avoid paying the whole thing follow these tips. We can't promise that they'll get you out of paying but these tips will give you a fighting chance.

Create a clear list with the following information: Your account name and number.

Your monthly phone plan type.

Your monthly phone plan inclusions and features.

Any phone plan extras that you added.

The amount of the roaming overage you want to contest (list both the amount of the charge and the data used). Compile the documents that support the above list for example your original phone contract the bill you're contesting and other related paperwork. On another sheet of paper write down exactly why you are disputing the bill. Acceptable reasons include incorrect charges or misleading information or advice. I don't have the money I can't pay it's ridiculous and similar reasons are not good arguments to make. Write down your plan of attack. For example email customer service; if that fails contact consumer affairs or protection; if that fails seek legal advice. Write a draft email. Include all relevant account details the disputed amount the reasons why you are disputing and what resolution you seek. Mention what step you will take if you find their response unsatisfactory. Don't threaten inform. For example ""I have contacted consumer affairs and pending an unacceptable response I will be pursuing the matter further."" Also include the following line towards the end of your email: ""I would like to continue all correspondence related to this matter via email so I have an accurate and complete record of our conversations."" Re-read the draft email. Do not threaten or use abusive or foul language. Get someone else to read it and give feedback. Is it polite firm and clear? Did you explain exactly what you are disputing and why? Words like ""misleading"" ""outrageous"" and ""disgusted"" are all strong and evocative. Include them if applicable and appropriate. Send your email to the complaints department at your phone company and wait for a response. If they call state you won't discuss the matter over the phone and all correspondence should be through email as indicated. If you have not received a response after five business days resend the email. When the company replies decide whether their response is: Acceptable and reasonable (you got what you wanted).

Unacceptable but reasonable (they offered you a decent deal).

Unacceptable and unreasonable (they won't negotiate). Now you have to decide when the company's offer is worth accepting. There may not be a price you have in mind but rather a principle. If you don't get a satisfactory answer inform the company of this. Explain why it's not good enough and again inform them that you are taking the matter to consumer affairs. Now lodge a complaint through your relevant consumer affairs office and take it from there. Finally seek legal advice and pursue it.

Keep a record of everything (emails included). Be prepared to fight for the principle of it. You will hit a few roadblocks and the company is counting on you giving up because of them. Be calm polite and reasonable.

What Causes Big iPhone Data Roaming Bills?

The monthly plans that iPhone users purchase for making calls and using data on their phones are for use only in their country. Unless you specifically get a plan with international features making calls or using data outside your home country isn't part of your monthly costs. As a result when you go to another country and use your iPhone you're immediately in roaming mode (that is roaming outside your home country and off of your home phone company network). Phone companies charge high fees for calls and data while in roaming mode and that's what causes the high bills after trips.

International travel is exciting but if you're not careful your international trip can include iPhone data roaming charges that add up to hundreds or thousands extra on your monthly phone bill. But because these charges appear on your bill doesn't mean you're stuck having to pay them.

How to Avoid iPhone Data Roaming Charges

The best way to avoid having to contest a bill for data roaming is to avoid roaming in the first place. One simple way to do this is to get an international data plan from your phone company before you leave on your trip. Contact your phone company and they can help you.

Alternatively there are ways to avoid data roaming bills by changing settings on your phone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9jb3VudHJ5L21pcmFuZGEtbGFtYmVydC1icmVuZGFuLW1jbG91Z2hsaW4tc3BlbmRpbmctYWxvbmUtdGltZS1tYWRlLXVzLXJlYWxseS1zdHJvbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Miranda Lambert on Spending So Much 'Alone Time' with Brendan McLoughlin: 'It Made Us Really Strong',"Miranda Lambert is thankful for all the time she's been able to spend with her husband Brendan McLoughlin.

During an appearance on a recent episode of SiriusXM's The Storme Warren Show the country star 37 opened up about really getting to know her husband over the past year now that they've been spending ""so much alone time"" together.

""I think it was really good"" Lambert said of the former NYPD officer 29 whom she met just months before marrying.

""We didn't date very long before we got married"" the singer added. ""And so we sort of got to just really really really get to know each other. Cause it was just us two with no distraction at my farm outside of Nashville. And so I was really thankful for it because it made us really strong.""

Although the past year has been difficult Lambert expressed gratitude for the chance to reconnect with what's most important to her.

""A lot of couples especially a lot of my friends don't really see their significant other because we're different directions all the time. But with everything that happened last year I think everybody was forced to sort of reconnect with themselves and with people that they really love and that are close to them"" she said.

""And I kept saying there's gonna be a lot of engagements and babies or a lot of divorce"" she joked.

Lambert also opened up about her experiences traveling with her husband — including one moment that had the potential to push their relationship.

""Backing up [a trailer is] sort of a trigger"" she explained. ""That'll be the one time you really identified as like one person trying to back up the other person trying to tell the other person how to back up a trailer.""

When it comes to long days behind the wheel Lambert added that the couple likes to keep themselves occupied.

""We do a lot of podcasts"" she said. ""So like we don't have to just sit there and twiddle our thumbs and talk while we drive. We like get into Dateline or murder mysteries or something. So that helps.""

Another benefit of being on the road together? Getting to watch her ""house husband"" take care of the chores — sometimes without his shirt on. Lambert who has never been shy about being a big fan of her husband's chiseled physique was asked during the interview if she's ever considered doing laundry on his washboard abs.

""Oh yeah. That's a great idea"" she said before recalling one particular moment from their travels while on the way back from Georgia.

""There was a laundry right across from where we parked"" she said. ""So I had to do some zoom meetings and he did the laundry. I was like house husband on the road this is great.""

Just last month the couple celebrated their second wedding anniversary.

""2 years hitched!! ❤️ @brendanjmcloughlin"" Lambert wrote alongside a special photo from her ""Settling Down"" music video which featured her husband along with the hashtag #anniversary.

Call of Duty: Mobile appears to be looking to capitalize on the Among Us craze with a new leak revealing a mode that closely resembles the gameplay experience of the party game. The leak is said to have come from the Chinese version of Call of Duty: Mobile and consists of something called a ""Werewolf"" mode where players again have to figure out which of the people in the lobby isn't who they claim to be. It's unclear at this time whether or not the mode will make its way to other regions.

The YouTuber who goes by Zenix shared the first video of the Werewolf mode gameplay to show what it looks like when Call of Duty: Mobile players are trying to figure out who the ""Imposter"" is. While it of course can't replicate the exact experience from Among Us we see some similar elements at play in this Call of Duty: Mobile mode where players are tasked with gathering resources and completing different objectives.

One of the big differences between the two games appears to be that killing players isn't limited to only the ""Imposter"" an expected change in a Call of Duty version of the experience. Just like players do in Among Us they're able to vote together on who they think the suspicious player might be.

The gameplay above is the best example of the mode that we've seen so far but it's again unclear if it'll be released globally or if it'll just be limited to certain regions.

Regardless of where this mode ends up it's not the first time that we've seen another game try its own interpretation of the Among Us formula and it won't be the last. Fortnite for example added a mode late last year called ""The Spy Within"" that tasked players with following what was essentially a Fortnite version of Among Us."

The tech giant had planned to pack Stadia with original content announcing two years ago that it was hiring hundreds of game developers and starting studios in Los Angeles and Montreal.

But those teams barely had time to get started before they were dismissed earlier this month as Google shut down in-house game development.

From the beginning Google’s approach to video games wasn’t very Google-like. The Alphabet company tends to launch bare-bones products and test them as they grow. With Stadia it came out big. Flashy press conferences and ad campaigns promised high-quality games with innovative features playable on Android smartphones or on the TV through Chromecast. Gamers would have access to a library of exclusive titles and well-known favorites like Assassin’s Creed without having to dish out $500 for Sony’s PlayStation or Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox.

So when Stadia launched in 2019 gamers were expecting the complete package not the beta model. While the cloud streaming technology was there playing to Google’s strengths the library of games was underwhelming and many of the promised features nonexistent. Other platforms offer hundreds of games a year but Stadia offers fewer than 80 according to Mat Piscatella an analyst at the NPD Group which tracks video game sales data.

Players also didn’t like Stadia’s business model which required customers to buy games individually rather than subscribe to an all-you-can-play service à la Netflix or the Xbox’s Game Pass. Paying as much as $60 for a single game for it only to exist on Google’s servers rather than on your own PC seemed a stretch to some. After all the hype gamers were disappointed. Stadia missed its targets for sales of controllers and monthly active users by hundreds of thousands according to two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokesperson declined to comment for this story.

“I think it would be fair to say the messaging leading up to and around the launch was inconsistent” with the final product Piscatella says.

Stadia’s struggles are a warning sign for other prospective video game streaming services. Microsoft and Amazon.com both deep-pocketed major technology companies with experience in video games have ambitions in the area with their respective xCloud and Luna offerings. But those products have rolled out gradually rather than promising to be console-killers keeping expectations in check.

It didn’t have to be this way. Google actually had a beta version of Stadia in 2018. Called Project Stream it allowed users to play Ubisoft Entertainment SA’s popular game Assassin’s Creed Odyssey in the tab of a Chrome browser. Fans were impressed.

The following year at the Game Developers Conference Phil Harrison who is in charge of Stadia unveiled what he called the “future of gaming.” He promised that Stadia would be more powerful than PlayStation or Xbox. He showed off innovative features like State Share which would allow users to take snapshots of their games and share them with friends allowing those friends to jump into the same game exactly where they had left off.

The prospects were exciting to fans and pundits who predicted that Stadia could dominate the market offering many of the same games as Xbox and PlayStation without the hefty price tag.

But all the buildup had some developers within Stadia worried according to people familiar with the matter. Their deadline to ship the platform in the fall of 2019 wouldn’t allow them to deliver what players expected they said. They argued that Google should position the launch as another beta test. After all Google’s most successful products had followed a similar approach. Gmail was officially in beta testing for five years for example as the company continued to tweak and refine it.

There was resistance from Harrison and others on the Stadia leadership team many of whom had come from the world of traditional console development and wanted to follow the route they knew.

Harrison had positioned Stadia as a traditional gaming platform full of bells and whistles but that didn’t mesh with Google’s own mantra to “think big but start small” as detailed in a 2011 blog post by longtime Google executive Susan Wojcicki now chief executive officer of YouTube. “Watching users ‘in the wild’ as they use our products is the best way to find out what works then we can act on that feedback” she wrote. “It’s much better to learn these things early and be able to respond than to go too far down the wrong path.”

A British video game industry veteran Harrison was a prominent face at both PlayStation and Xbox during their worst console launches — the overpriced PlayStation 3 and badly managed Xbox One. He joined Google in 2018 as vice president of Stadia.

His team wooed big-name publishers like Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. shelling out tens of millions of dollars to get games like Red Dead Redemption II on Stadia according to two people familiar with the deals. The amount of money Google was willing to spend came as a shock to veteran game developers but even that wasn’t enough. Video game platforms live or die on exclusive content. So Harrison also brought in Jade Raymond a veteran executive who has worked on Assassin’s Creed and Star Wars to start building an in-house development division.

When Stadia officially released on Nov. 19 2019 it left critics scratching their heads. The library of games was small and mostly old with none of Google’s exclusives available yet. Most of the features Harrison promised were not actually there such as the State Share concept. The platform was only available through a $130 kit that included a special controller and Chromecast. Gaming website Kotaku called the marketing “random and terrible” and the platform failed to catch on. In fact the company produced so many more Stadia controllers than it had demand for that last year it gave them away for free.

Despite the tepid launch there was optimism among Stadia’s developers that they could win over fans with exclusive games so long as Google gave them time to thrive. They were excited about game prototypes that could only work on a cloud platform pushing memory limits with computer-driven artificial intelligence. One prototype according to people familiar with the plans was described as a cross between a Google Assistant and a Tamagotchi pet allowing players to interact with smart creatures in all sorts of fun ways.

Then on Feb. 1 Google suddenly pulled the plug on in-house development. Stadia will still exist as a service and continue to offer third-party games that are also available on other platforms. But without exclusives Stadia has little hope of competing with big consoles or building an audience of millions. It seems unlikely to be the “future of gaming” that Harrison had promised.

While Stadia didn’t seem to follow the traditional Google playbook without some drastic changes it could still face a pretty Googley outcome: being added to the long list of products that Google has killed.",,,,,,,,,

Analysts and industry watchers have lauded Minneapolis-based Target's forward-looking pre-pandemic strategy of investing in brick-and-mortar stores as the key to its success in the last year as some other retailers had to pivot on the fly.

But back in 2017 when Target facing sluggish sales introduced the concept the response was not widely applauded. But the company stayed firm that to compete with the likes of Amazon the stores had to be built out to fulfill online orders at the same time they became more welcoming to in-person shoppers.

""We knew we had all of this capacity in our stores and so we started to build it out and that's what we have done over the past three or four years — improve our capabilities improve our process build technology train our teams"" said John Mulligan Target's chief operating officer in an interview last week.

The company is banking on those shoppers staying as the pandemic wanes.

""To me in many ways 2020 is just an accelerated set of chapters in a book we've been writing for a while"" said Chief Financial Officer Michael Fiddelke in an interview.

Fiddelke

More than 95% of Target's third-quarter sales were fulfilled by its stores. About the same percentage of sales were fulfilled by stores during the holidays.

Target already said in January that comparable sales in November and December rose 17.2% with same-store sales increasing more than 4% and comparable digital sales jumping 102%. The retailer will release its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on Tuesday.

Mulligan said it makes sense for stores to be fulfillment centers with 75% of customers in the United States living within 10 miles of a Target location.

To have store employees pick items from the aisles and prepare them for shipment is 40% cheaper than shipping from a distribution center. Order pickup or drive-up orders are similar in terms of costs to store sales and cost 90% less on average than if the orders were shipped from a warehouse.

Improvements and expansion of same-day pickup options including drive-up or delivery by Target-owned Shipt have paid off as well. In the third quarter same-day services grew an outsized 217%.

Target executives are expected to talk about the next steps in same-day service during an earnings briefing on Tuesday.

""We designed our stores for ease and that's why we had drive-up that's why we had pickup that's why we had Shipt … and we found a lot of those things we designed for ease were very applicable to safety"" Mulligan said.

In the future even after the pandemic Target will further evaluate how safety and health can be improved in its next store redesigns for example finding ways to make checkout lanes less crowded Mulligan said. People will want to feel safe in stores beyond COVID-19 he said.

Mulligan also sees more investments in robotics and automation to make Target's supply chain even more efficient.

In the Twin Cities Target has tested a robotics system that helps sort items into boxes to get precise amounts that they need so excess products don't need to be stored in the backroom.

The system is expected to expand to possibly two other sites outside of the Twin Cities this coming year.

In the third quarter Target also opened a small sorting center in northeast Minneapolis that helps collect online orders from stores and sort them into routes for carrier delivery. While Target is still researching that process Mulligan said he could see it expanding to other large urban areas.

Order pickup is Target's longest-running same-day service starting in 2013. The retailer in 2017 started to add ""drive-up"" service its version of curbside pickup.

The service grew in 2018 and 2019 but saw an explosion in its popularity last year. Drive-up orders increased 500% in the third quarter.

Same with Shipt delivery with third quarter orders growing nearly 280%.

Target has also increased the types of items available through same-day services. Last summer it began to offer fresh and frozen groceries for pickup after it was first piloted in the Twin Cities.

Not only do many of these capabilities help the bottom line by increasing orders it also helps Target build market share and customer loyalty Fiddelke said.

For example after customers become drive-up users their overall spending at Target increases by about 30% he said.

In November Target reported more than $6 billion in market share gains in 2020.

""We are taking big strides to deepen the guest relationship"" Fiddelke said.

For months in 2020 most of the city was in lock down with Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration and the City Council holding virtual meetings and hearings during the pandemic instead.

But well-connected high powered lobbyists still found a way to rake in bundles of cash from wooing City Hall and the Council for their clients.

The lobbyists raked in $106.34 million in 2020 — just slightly less than $113.2 million in compensation during the 2019 pre-pandemic year according to a new report from the City Clerk’s Office.

Leading the pack for the fourth consecutive year was Suri Kasirer’s lobbying firm — taking in $14.164 million nearly matching the $14.3 million earned in pre-pandemic 2019.

One government watchdog wasn’t surprised.

“The seasoned hot-wired lobbyists still get their phone calls returned. From a client’s perspective lobbyists are more important than ever” said Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group.

“The top connected lobbyists can still wield their influence and charge clients the big bucks” added Horner.

Suri Kasirer’s 32-member firm pressed the mayor and council to provide COVID-19 relief to the hard-hit restaurant and hotel industries. Her clients included ROAR — Relief for the Restaurant Industry — and the Hotel Association of NYC which has been trying to get the city to defer property taxes and interest fees on hotels that are closed and not generating revenue.

Kasirer’s well-heeled client list also includes Northwell Health Columbia Presbyterian and Mt Sinai hospital systems. Northwell had been pushing a controversial proposal to expand its Lenox Hill hospital on the Upper East Side which is facing fierce neighborhood opposition.

The firm’s table of clients last year also included the Target Corporation T-Mobile USA IF Cornerstone which owns part of the vacant Long Island City waterfront property where the aborted Amazon headquarters project was supposed to be located; Charter Communications Comcast Cable South Street Seaport Sotheby’s Columbia University the Disney Company and real estate powerhouses Two Trees Management the Related Company SL Green Realty and Silverstein Properties; the Archdiocese of NY Google the anti-horse carriage group NY-CLASS etc.

“We are pleased to continue to be the leading advocate in New York City and are proud to support our clients as they work to reinvest in and rebuild New York as we emerge from the pandemic” Kasirer said.

“This was a very tough year. This was a year from hell. My clients were struggling to deal with COVID.”

She also spoke of her unsung clients who helped the needy during the pandemic including the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty AARP and SAFE Horizons which aids victims of domestic violence.

And she said there were some positives in terms of development amid the pandemic noting client SL Green’s opening of the 14011-foot tall One Vanderbilt office tower by Grand Central terminal following the rezoning of Midtown East.

Lobbyist James Capalino’s firm was the second highest compensated firm with $9.9 million — down from $11.9 million in 2019 followed by Bolton-St. Johns with $6.7 million.

The top ten lobbying firms also included Constantinople & Vallone (includes former Council Speaker Peter Vallone) $5669402.00; Pitta Bishop & Del Giorno $4826526.51; Greenberg Traurig $4571504.20; Davidoff Hutcher & Citron $3240421; Fried Frank Harris Shriver $3198924.84; Geto & de Milly Inc. $3120500; and CMW Strategies ( Connelly McLaughlin & Woloz) $3104899.92.

The developer of a project to build a 13-tower mixed-use project along Flushing Creek in Queens — the FWRA consortium — paid over $1 million in lobbying bills as it won City Council approval to rezone the area the most paid by any one client last year.

Real estate and development remain the bread and butter of the lobbying industry accounting for 40 percent of lobbying activity by industry by far the most.

Entities with their own in-house lobbyists included the Real Estate Board of NY ($320844) the Association of Neighborhood Housing ($285978) Greater New York Hospital Association ($180700) and the United Federation of Teachers ($173164) among others.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vZm9vdHdlYXJuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9leGVjdXRpdmUtbW92ZXMvZmFzaGlvbi1pbmR1c3RyeS1leGVjdXRpdmUtaGlyZXMtcHJvbW90aW9ucy1mZWJydWFyeS0yMDIxLTEyMDMxMDI0Njcv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly9mb290d2Vhcm5ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2V4ZWN1dGl2ZS1tb3Zlcy9mYXNoaW9uLWluZHVzdHJ5LWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1oaXJlcy1wcm9tb3Rpb25zLWZlYnJ1YXJ5LTIwMjEtMTIwMzEwMjQ2Ny9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Industry Moves: February 2021,"Who’s in who’s out who’s been promoted and hired — FN covers all the industry changes in one place.

Wow that sucks... IMO your situation actually has reasonably quantifiable damages that you suffered because you had investment specific to their shingle roof and the pricing of the previous contract terms. Plus your situation is new construction so you have more reliance on their delivery than someone else who already has an existing roof.California Small Claims has a limit of $10000 and typically requires you to appear in person. This mechanism seems like a possibility for you.Hopefully you have receipts bills or line-items from other contractor POs that clearly state their costs included items in expectation of a Tesla solar roof. For example special architectural review specific gutters that work with Tesla's product load-bearing requirements unique to the solar roof or you modified your roof slope. The key is to quantify the costs/damages that you really incurred. Trying to argue that the 50% price increase is in itself a damage is very difficult without a competing bid from another solar shingle roof vendor that you passed on because you chose Tesla's offer.If you cannot get specific line items on your POs I've even seen situations where a licensed expert's sworn affidavit can be used where they quantify the costs. Although in this case the only existing ""Solar Roof Experts"" are probably related to Tesla Solar and could be barred by Tesla's from disclosing such trade secrets.Naturally the risk of dealing with this type of hassle is you still have to have an arbitrator actually determine Tesla has some responsibility/fault to cure your situation. Since you likely signed Tesla's boilerplate contract without any modifications... Tesla gave themselves many vaguely worded opportunities to modify pricing for just about any circumstance without breaching the terms of the agreement. But an arbitrator may view their contract to be too one sided and award you damages anyway. The key is to quantify those damages...Obviously you should consider talking to a lawyer about this situation instead of relying on my posting on TMC.

SPLENDORA Texas (KTRK) -- Five Montgomery County deputy constables were injured Saturday when the driver of a Tesla rear-ended a cruiser during a traffic stop causing a chain-reaction crash authorities said.

It happened around 1:15 a.m. on the Eastex Freeway near East River Road in Montgomery County.

While most of the deputy constables' injuries were described as ranging from scrapes to back injuries one of them may have suffered a possible broken arm according to authorities on the scene. A K9 officer was also on the scene and was checked out by a veterinarian. None of their injuries were believed to be life threatening.

The driver of the original vehicle that had been stopped was standing on the shoulder of the road when the crash happened and was seriously injured. He was transported to a hospital in critical condition.

One of the deputy constables was conducting a search underneath the engine compartment of a vehicle during the initial stop according to Splendora police Lieutenant Troy Keller.

""He heard the impact he held onto the vehicle and was moved with the vehicle"" Keller said.

There was no indication the driver of the Tesla slowed down prior to impact and was believed to have been intoxicated authorities said. The Tesla driver was not injured in the crash and was taken into custody on a DWI charge.

Two of the patrol cars were totaled and three others were damaged in the crash.

The driver of a Tesla crashed into a Montgomery County Pct. 4 Constable cruiser causing a chain-reaction collision early Saturday.

The incident is the latest in a trend of crashes involving law enforcement vehicles in the Houston area over the past several months and at least the second one this weekend.

In northwest Harris County a deputy suffered minor injuries Saturday when a suspected intoxicated driver slammed into the back of his cruiser at a traffic signal.

Naveen Sharma (@djnaveensharma) is a wedding DJ from Michigan and owner of this stunning orange Model Y. When he posted a photo in a Tesla Model Y Facebook group it quickly caught the attention (and plenty of commentary) from onlookers.

So I decided to ask Naveen for some more photos (and details) and he was courteous enough to provide the goods. It turns out that before the vinyl wrap this Tesla was actually a pearl white Model Y as evidenced below.

That said after getting a new custom orange wrap from Michigan-based Superior Dent Repair & Detailing this beauty transformed into some Tesla ""eye candy"" that quickly captured the attention of so many Facebook fans and admirers.

If you're curious the orange color seen on this Tesla Model Y is called “Urban Orange Gloss” and the hex code is HX20495B.

It took approximately $2400 and one week to get the Model Y wrapped in this glossy orange color and a ceramic coating installed over it for some extra protection.

Rumors have surged that Tesla may begin a vinyl wrap service for its customers in China and roll out the service to other markets. If this happens this particular look could become quite popular — you never know.

To explore the possible relationship between CDX2 and Reg IV in gastric cancer tissues mRNA and protein levels were measured by real-time PCR and IHC. The samples were divided into two groups based on the relative expression of mRNA in the 93 cases: low (≤ 2) and high expression (> 2). A high expression of CDX2 mRNA was found in 31 of the 93 cases and a low expression was found in 62 of the 93 cases. Low CDX2 expression was frequently observed in gastric cancer tissues with low Reg IV expression (72.6% 45 of 62 cases) and high CDX2 expression was frequently observed in tissues with high Reg IV expression (67.7% 21 of 31 cases; p = 0.0002 by χ2-test; Table 4). Correlation analysis further showed that the expression of CDX2 mRNA was positively associated with that of Reg IV mRNA in gastric cancer tissues (r = 0.387 p = 0.0001; Table 4). Furthermore we examined protein expression in the 102 cases and representative images of the IHC results are shown in Fig. 1. CDX2 was mainly found in the nucleus with cytoplasmic staining occasionally observed. Reg IV was detected mainly in the cytoplasm of tumor cells. CDX2 was negative in 67 cases and positive in 35 cases and CDX2 expression was associated with Reg IV expression (p = 0.032 by χ2-test; Table 5). Further analysis showed that the expression of the CDX2 protein was positively associated with that of the Reg IV protein in gastric cancer tissues (r = 0.334 p = 0.001; Table 5). These results suggest that CDX2 expression positively correlates with Reg IV expression in gastric cancer tissues.

CDX2 silencing downregulated Reg IV expression in gastric cancer cells

To confirm whether CDX2 regulates Reg IV expression in gastric cancer cells CDX2 expression was knocked down via RNA interference (RNAi). Measurement of the relative CDX2 mRNA expression level at 48 h post-transfection with the three CDX2 siRNAs showed that siR-CDX2-3 produced an optimal interference effect and CDX2 mRNA levels decreased by 86.0% in AGS cells (Fig. 2a). siR-CDX2-3 significantly reduced the mRNA (p = 0.0002) and protein (p = 0.003) levels of Reg IV in AGS cells (Fig. 2a–b). In MKN-45 cells siR-CDX2-1 achieved the highest knockdown effect. Reg IV mRNA (p = 0.001) and protein (p = 0.007) levels were also decreased in the CDX2 knockdown group compared with the control group (Fig. 2c–d). These results indicate that the silencing of CDX2 led to the downregulation of Reg IV in gastric cancer cells.

Fig. 2 CDX2 silencing downregulated Reg IV in gastric cancer cells. AGS (a b) and MKN-45 (c d) cells were transfected with the three CDX2 siRNAs for 48 h and the CDX2 siRNA with the optimal silencing effect was chosen and used for subsequent experiments (left of a c). CDX2 mRNA level was measured using real-time PCR and the results were normalized to GAPDH (right of a c). Moreover western blotting was used to analyze Reg IV and CDX2 protein levels β-actin was used as a loading control. Representative immunoblots are shown and the relative protein signal intensity was quantitatively analyzed using Image Lab software (b d). Full-length original blots are presented in Additional file 1. Data are presented as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 was compared with the control groups Full size image

CDX2 overexpression upregulated Reg IV expression in gastric cancer cells

To further confirm the regulation of Reg IV by CDX2 in gastric cancer cells cells were transfected with pcDNA4/TO-CDX2 or pcDNA4/TO (control) for 36 h and CDX2 expression was analyzed via real-time PCR and western blotting. Figure 3a c shows that CDX2 mRNA levels increased by 101.8-fold (AGS p < 0.0001) and 301153.3-fold (MKN-45 p < 0.0001). The western blotting results further verified the overexpression of CDX2 protein in AGS (p = 0.0001) and MKN-45 (p = 0.007) cells (Fig. 3b d). We found that Reg IV mRNA and protein levels increased after CDX2 overexpression in AGS and MKN-45 cells (p < 0.01; Fig. 3a–d). These results suggest that the overexpression of CDX2 led to the upregulation of Reg IV in gastric cancer cells.

Fig. 3 CDX2 overexpression upregulated Reg IV in gastric cancer cells. AGS (a b) and MKN-45 (c d) cells were transfected with pcDNA4/TO-CDX2 or pcDNA4/TO for 36 h. Reg IV and CDX2 mRNA levels were evaluated using real-time PCR and the results were normalized to GAPDH (a c). Reg IV and CDX2 protein expression were analyzed via western blotting. β-actin was used as a loading control. Representative immunoblots are shown and the relative protein signal intensity was quantitatively analyzed using Image Lab software (b d). Full-length original blots are presented in Additional file 1. Data are presented as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 compared with the control groups Full size image

Reg IV did not affect CDX2 expression in gastric cancer cells

To investigate the effect of Reg IV on CDX2 in gastric cancer cells Reg IV was silenced or overexpressed. siR-Reg IV which had a significant silencing effect in our previous study [1] was transiently transfected into cells for 48 h. Real-time PCR analysis showed that Reg IV mRNA levels decreased by 79.5% (AGS) and 90% (MKN-45) (p < 0.01; left panels of Fig. 4a b). The western blotting results also demonstrated that siR-Reg IV significantly reduced Reg IV expression compared with the control groups (p < 0.01; middle and right panels of Fig. 4a b). Although the CDX2 mRNA level was downregulated (p < 0.0001) the protein level did not change (p = 0.274) following Reg IV silencing in AGS cells (Fig. 4a). However Reg IV silencing had no effect on CDX2 mRNA and protein levels in MKN-45 cells (p > 0.05; Fig. 4b). These results suggest that Reg IV silencing had no effect on CDX2 expression in gastric cancer cells.

Fig. 4 Reg IV had no effect on CDX2 in gastric cancer cells. AGS and MKN-45 cells were transfected with siR-Reg IV (a b) or pEGFP-C1-Reg IV (c d). Reg IV and CDX2 mRNA levels were evaluated using real-time PCR and relative mRNA expression results were normalized to GAPDH (left of a–d). Reg IV and CDX2 protein expression levels were analyzed via western blotting. β-actin was used as a loading control. Representative immunoblots are shown in the middle panels of a–d. The relative protein signal intensity was quantitatively analyzed using Image Lab software and shown as histograms (right of a–d). Full-length original blots are presented in Additional file 1. Data are presented as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 compared with the control groups Full size image

Cells were also transfected with pEGFP-C1-Reg IV or pEGFP-C1 (control) and the expression of Reg IV was validated by real-time PCR and western blotting. Figure 4c shows that Reg IV mRNA levels increased by 526.1-fold (AGS) and 3478357.1-fold (MKN-45) (p < 0.01). To further determine whether the Reg IV protein was overexpressed we detected the fusion protein (EGFP-Reg IV; ~ 41 KDa) of EGFP (27 KDa) and Reg IV (14 KDa) via western blotting using the Reg IV antibody. The results showed that EGFP-Reg IV was expressed when AGS and MKN-45 cells were transfected with pEGFP-C1-Reg IV (Fig. 4c d). Moreover the endogenous Reg IV level was significantly upregulated in pEGFP-C1-Reg IV-transfected AGS cells (Fig. 4c). However CDX2 mRNA and protein levels were unchanged following Reg IV overexpression in AGS cells (p > 0.05; Fig. 4c). Although Reg IV overexpression downregulated CDX2 mRNA levels in MKN-45 cells (p = 0.0002) protein expression did not change (p = 0.154; Fig. 4d). These results indicate that Reg IV overexpression had no effect on CDX2 expression in gastric cancer cells.

CDX2 promoted the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells

To determine the roles of CDX2 in the motility of AGS and MKN-45 cells wound-healing Transwell migration and Matrigel invasion assays were performed following CDX2 silencing or overexpression. In the wound-healing assay migration of AGS cells was significantly reduced after CDX2 silencing in comparison with the control group (p = 0.002 for 24 h p < 0.0001 for 36 h; Fig. 5a). Alternatively cell migration was significantly increased after CDX2 overexpression (p = 0.047 for 24 h p = 0.008 for 36 h; Fig. 5b). Because MKN-45 cells migrated very slowly the wound healing process was monitored for 72 h. Consistent with the findings in AGS cells knockdown of CDX2 dramatically inhibited the migration of AGS cells (p < 0.01; Fig. 5c) while overexpression of CDX2 significantly increased migration especially after 48 h (p = 0.003) and 72 h (p = 0.031) (Fig. 5d). Moreover the Transwell migration assay showed that CDX2 silencing significantly reduced the number of AGS cells that migrated from the upper surface to the lower surface of the inserts (p = 0.009; Fig. 5e) and CDX2 overexpression had the opposite effect (p = 0.014; Fig. 5f). Similar results were also observed in MKN-45 cells (Fig. 5g–h). Therefore these data indicate that CDX2 promoted the migration of gastric cancer cells.

Fig. 5 CDX2 promoted the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. a–d Wound-healing assay to detect the migration of AGS and MKN-45 cells after CDX2 silencing or overexpression. Representative microscopic images are shown. Magnification 100 × . The bar charts show the percentage of wound-healing at indicated times (below panel). e–h Effects of CDX2 silencing or overexpression on the migration and invasion of both cell lines were assessed by Transwell assay. Cells transfected with CDX2 siRNA or pcDNA4/TO-CDX2 migrated across uncoated or Matrigel-coated Transwell inserts. Cells in five fields from each membrane were counted using an optical microscope. Representative images of migrated cells are shown. Magnification 200×. The bar charts show the number of cells that migrated across 8 µm pores to the underside of the membrane. Data are presented as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 compared with the control groups Full size image

We further assessed the impact of CDX2 on the invasive properties of AGS and MKN-45 cells using Matrigel-coated inserts. Compared with the control group the number of cells that passed through the Matrigel-coated membranes reduced by 81.0% in AGS cells transfected with siR-CDX2-3 (p < 0.0001; Fig. 5e). However CDX2 overexpression resulted in the opposite effect (p = 0.0002; Fig. 5f). Consistently CDX2 silencing inhibited the invasion of MKN-45 cells (p = 0.015; Fig. 5g) and CDX2 overexpression markedly increased invasion (p < 0.0001; Fig. 5h). These results show that CDX2 promoted the invasion of gastric cancer cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,

By Sarah Frey. (Ballantine Books 251 pages $27.)

Sarah Frey describes her inspiring climb from ""brutally"" impoverished Illinois farm girl to agribusiness titan in her memoir ""The Growing Season.""

Frey felt she was ""powerful brave and destined for a life of greatness"" despite material deprivations thanks to twisted parental encouragement necessity and innate optimism and determination. She was the youngest of 21 including half-siblings and she and her parents and four older brothers survived off the land and by their wits. Frey's charming and controlling father concocted many schemes including faking his death when he left his wife and 13 children to be with Frey's married mother of two.

Starting at age 8 precocious entrepreneur and born saleswoman Frey joined her mother on her ""melon route"" buying watermelons and cantaloupes from other farmers to sell to stores. At 15 to get away from the chaos at home Frey and a brother moved into a rundown house on family property and fixed it up. As soon as she had a driver's license and a truck Frey started her own melon route while attending high school and community college and working at Tractor Supply Co.

When the bank was about to foreclose on the family farm Frey bought it for her own. At 19 she made a key melon distribution deal with Walmart. From there she has grown her business with more hard work and the help of her devoted brothers. Frey Farms is now a multistate producer of pumpkins watermelons and other produce as well as fruit beverages.

Through tragedies and setbacks Frey has remained resolute and devoted to her business and family. Her charisma and chutzpah leap off the page of this extended elevator pitch. It's easy to see why ABC-TV has expressed interest in producing her colorful story.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHA6Ly93d3cubm9ydGhlc2NhbWJpYS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi9tYW42LW1hbi1raWxsZWQtd2hpbGUtdHJ5aW5nLXRvLWNyb3NzLWRhdmlzLWhpZ2h3YXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,65-Year Man Killed After Trying To Cross Davis Highway,"65-Year Man Killed After Trying To Cross Davis Highway

The company which was started by Reuben Doetsch and Sean Breuner has acquired more than 400 assets and is now in 60 cities and 25 markets.



AvantStay which leases and manages all of its properties this year plans to launch in at least 30 more markets including its first international destination in Los Cabos Mexico.



Breuner said he and Doetsch launched AvantStay because of their shared passion for travel.



“We started this company because we love to travel and love this alternative accommodation space and started to realize that what was missing was the consistency of the product” he said.



Breuner added that with other short-term rental companies it can be hard for consumers to know what they’re going to get. Sometimes the furniture at a property is old or hot tubs don’t properly heat or the kitchen is not stocked in a way that is conducive to cooking.



Instead of simply being a listing service for short-term rental products AvantStay actually operates its properties.



Breuner said this brings the consistent quality that travelers like about hotels to the short-term rental space. He added that AvantStay’s approach is particularly effective for people traveling in large groups or for those who want the increased privacy a private home offers.



“Fundamentally the way people are traveling has changed and we feel that one of the biggest friction points in the lifestyle travel industry is how do you bring groups together to have amazing experiences” Breuner said.



Doetsch called short-term rentals an “under-optimized product” that the company aims to capitalize on.



AvantStay offers cleaning service and grocery packages that are ready at a rental unit when guests arrive.



Breuner said part of what the company is working on now is scale. AvantStay is adding 50 properties a month.



And although the company’s roots are in Los Angeles and 40% of its product is in California AvantStay only has a handful of local properties all in Malibu.



“We only do full-time short-term rentals and in L.A. there are certain restrictions” Breuner said referring to laws passed by the city that limit the amount of time properties can be used as short-term rentals.



L.A. imposed the restrictions following complaints that people were buying homes with the intention of using them only for short-term rentals driving up home prices and turning some neighborhoods into tourist areas.



Doetsch said the company recently launched in new areas including on the East Coast.



He added that the company is looking for properties with “potential to be awesome … We’re not going to take cookie-cutter stuff. We’re creating this different experience and this brand.”



Doetsch added that the company looks for what travelers want in the specific cities they are looking at and they might even partner with wineries or breweries in the area to bring a local feel to the asset.



AvantStay has an in-house local design team that works on curating each property.

Although prices vary based on the location and property AvantStay renters should plan to spend about $100 per person each night.



“It’s the most affordable way to travel” Breuner said.



And Doetsch said that with the Covid-19 pandemic people are shying away from large hotels and like the idea of renting a home.



“We’ve been in a lucky situation as a business” he said. “Covid we’ve taken some licks but at a macro standpoint it’s been good for us.”



By the end of the year the company plans to have 1000 units with more than 5000 rooms. And by the end of 2022 the company’s goal is to increase those numbers to 2500 homes and 10000 rooms.



“We want to be the national brand for short-term rentals and we’ll have a ton of properties across the entire United States” Doetsch said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndzcGEuY29tL25ld3MvZGVwdXRpZXMtc2VhcmNoLWZvci1taXNzaW5nLTkteWVhci1vbGQtYm95LW5lYXItdHJhdmVsZXJzLXJlc3Qv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NwYS5jb20vbmV3cy9kZXB1dGllcy1zZWFyY2gtZm9yLW1pc3NpbmctOS15ZWFyLW9sZC1ib3ktbmVhci10cmF2ZWxlcnMtcmVzdC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Missing 9-year-old boy near Travelers Rest found safe,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wspa.com/news/deputies-search-for-missing-9-year-old-boy-near-travelers-rest/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndzcGEuY29tL25ld3MvZGVwdXRpZXMtc2VhcmNoLWZvci1taXNzaW5nLTkteWVhci1vbGQtYm95LW5lYXItdHJhdmVsZXJzLXJlc3Qv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NwYS5jb20vbmV3cy9kZXB1dGllcy1zZWFyY2gtZm9yLW1pc3NpbmctOS15ZWFyLW9sZC1ib3ktbmVhci10cmF2ZWxlcnMtcmVzdC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53bHR4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbWlzc2luZy1zYy05LXllYXItb2xkLWxhc3Qtc2Vlbi1zYXR1cmRheS1tb3JuaW5nLzEwMS1mZjI4MjFjNi04ZGFmLTQ4MGEtYjYyYS0yYWIyMDk1NDgxMTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Missing 9-year-old last seen near Travelers Rest SC,"GREENVILLE COUNTY S.C. — A 9-year-old who was reported missing in Travelers Rest SC Saturday has been found safe according to The Greenville County Sheriff’s Office .

(Mainichi/Tadakazu Nakamura)

NARITA Chiba -- A subsidiary of Japan Airlines (JAL) will end its suitcase repair business that the company has run for some 30 years at the end of March due to plummeting demand and air travelers.

Tokyo-based JAL ABC Inc. has repaired a total of more than 300000 suitcases near Narita International Airport in Chiba Prefecture near Tokyo. Suitcase prices have become lower in recent years and demand for repair services has decreased resulting in declining profitability. In addition as the number of air travelers has plummeted amid the novel coronavirus pandemic the number of repairs also dropped to 10% in fiscal 2020 compared to the previous fiscal year and the company judged that it cannot expect demand to recover anytime soon.

JAL ABC launched a business to deliver travelers' luggage from Narita airport to their home when the facility opened in 1978. The company foresaw a demand for repairs as suitcases were getting damaged at times during transportation so it launched the repair business in 1990. The company had a repair facility constructed near Narita airport in 1992 which received the overwhelmingly largest share of international travelers in Japan at the time.

Suitcases that cannot be repaired are stacked at JAL ABC Inc.'s office in Narita Chiba Prefecture on Feb. 18 2021 before being discarded. (Mainichi/Tadakazu Nakamura)

Among the suitcases the company has repaired damage to casters accounted for 30%. It has also repaired many handles fasteners locks frames and cracks in bodies. JAL ABC employees painted the repaired parts the same color as the surrounding area so that it was not apparent which part of the suitcase has been fixed.

Some of the more notable requests from customers include: ""I want it repaired because I have memories of using it during my honeymoon"" and ""I want it fixed at any price because it's my travel partner I use 10 to 20 times a year."" At a peak the company repaired 26000 suitcases in fiscal 2010. Repair costs range between 5000 yen (about $47) and 100000 yen (about $944) and average at 10000 yen (about $94).

The company has received words of appreciation after returning suitcases to customers such as ""I was able to travel again thanks to you"" and ""How did you fix it so nicely?"" One customer even sent JAL ABC a video of memories shot during a trip along with a letter of thanks.

However the number of repairs has gradually decreased from 18000 in fiscal 2015 to 17000 in fiscal 2016 then 16000 in fiscal 2017 and 2018 and 12000 in fiscal 2019. Behind this is the increasing bipolarization of suitcase prices -- those of luxury brands and cheap ones. When a suitcase is broken someone who uses a high-end model tends to send it to the brand's maintenance department. In contrast someone who uses a cheap suitcase likely thinks that it is less expensive to buy another cheap one.

A decline in aging repairers with expert skills is also a reason to withdraw from the business. It takes at least three or four years to train a person to fix a suitcase and it takes more than 10 years for a person to master their trade. As the repair business has been in the red in recent years a decision had to be made whether JAL ABC would continue operations.

A head of the suitcase division at JAL ABC said: ""I thought we could keep the business going in some way as customers need this service. Ultimately the influence of the novel coronavirus was huge. It's difficult to keep going as the pandemic hasn't dwindled even a year after the first infection was confirmed.""

JAL ABC will continue its suitcase rental service and intends to focus operating resources on businesses at airport counters including luggage delivery services and mobile Wi-Fi device and cellphone rentals. Regarding its withdrawal from the suitcase repair business a company representative said ""It is very regrettable but we've judged that we can't keep the business going. We're really grateful to our customers and client companies for all their support.""

While going through a mountain of memories back when the pandemic started I came upon a type-written sheet of paper inside a hand-written note that the relief pitcher Dan Quisenberry had sent my wife and me back in 1996 six years after he had retired and two years before he would succumb to brain cancer. It was this poem:

I have read those words time and time again in the last year. They provided me with a beacon of hope that I kept turning to as the fog of 2020 thickened and now hopefully dissipates. Dan always threw strikes. That the poetry comes from one of the best relievers in baseball history is only a surprise if you never met the man. He was witty and warm religious and irreverent kind and competitive a devoted family man and a consummate teammate. At a time when we all need to be mindful of our priorities he is missed as much as ever. On Feb. 7 he would have turned 68.

Like his pitches he came out of nowhere to save 33 games for the 1980 Royals and help them get into the World Series. With a sinker that he seemingly threw from the cleats of third baseman George Brett he averaged 39 saves a year in his first five full seasons. We became friends while I was covering the team for Sports Illustrated and better friends when I did a profile of him for SI in ’83.

""He was witty and warm religious and irreverent kind and competitive a devoted family man and a consummate teammate.""

Take a look at his 1983 stat line: a then-record 45 saves in 69 appearances and 139 innings with just 11 walks—a number better conveyed by two exclamation points considering that two of the walks were intentional. Now go to YouTube for the 1985 World Series parade 35 years ago when the Royals came back from a 3-1 deficit to beat the Cardinals in seven games and watch Quiz tell a reporter “I really can’t believe it -- I keep thinking we need to play someone else tomorrow.” This after he appeared in 92 games that season and postseason. (He starts at 1:24:16)

His underhanded sinker might have made it look easy but it wasn’t. As he once wrote “When everything goes right and I get the save I’m the one who’s saved.” The next few years brought struggles for both the Royals and Quiz so they parted ways on Independence Day 1988. He pitched for the Cardinals that year and next then joined the Giants in 1990. After five painful games he called it quits. When asked what he was going to do he said “I’ve got a big pile of laundry I’ve wanted to get to.” What he did do was devote more time to wife Janie and their children Alysia and David and more energy to his favorite charity the Harvesters Food Bank. He also took up poetry and discovered another talent that people didn’t expect him to have.

“When everything goes right and I get the save I’m the one who’s saved.”

A book of his poems On Days Like This was published by Helicon Nine in 1998. They are almost evenly divided between baseball and life and they are funny self-deprecating reflective and evocative. Here’s what the great baseball writer Roger Angell had to say on the back flap of the book: “Some of his last lines are as terse as Frost’s… while others hook and cling and turn you back to the top of the page again wanting more time with this good poet and sweet man.” Here are just a few of them written by a man who was used to being called upon in critical situations:

Early in the same year that the poems were published doctors discovered that Dan had a malignant brain tumor. He underwent surgery and on May 30 he and Janie returned to Kauffman Stadium for his induction into the team’s Hall of Fame. His vision had diminished but he could sense the love of the 30000 fans in attendance. And in the press conference after the ceremony his mind was as sharp as ever. A reporter asked him “Is there a lesson in all this?” Quiz asked him to define “this” then begged off because he didn’t want to answer with a cliché. When another writer asked him about his accomplishments he said “I don’t think about those things because I needed so much help. I needed a great wife. I needed Willie Wilson in center. I needed a great second baseman like Frank White.” Then he turned to the writer whose question he hadn’t answered. “We need each other. That’s the lesson.”

A few months later George Brett went over to Dan’s house for lunch. “He knew he was not going to win this battle” Brett recalls. “I asked him ‘Why you?’ And he responded ‘Why not me? I can handle this.’ That speaks volumes about the type of person he was.” Dan passed away on Sept. 30 1998 -- the bottom of the ninth month. On days like these his is a life well worth remembering. As for his children David is a cybersecurity expert with four kids and Alysia is an artist wife and mother who teaches art at a senior center in Kansas City. Her 12-year-old daughter is a budding artist who is a huge Royals fan. When asked about the poem Ode To My Children which is not in the book Alysia says “I have it framed on a wall in my studio. Only one line is different. Mine says ‘You’ve made your own way.'"" Janie who still lives in Kansas City is remarried to Larry Stone a fellow elder at their church. She devotes much of her time to the grandchildren and when the pandemic is over she hopes to be a volunteer for Serve The World Charities a resource for the underserved communities in Kansas City. But Dan is never far from her thoughts. “I’ll never forget the time Alysia and I took her little girl to meet her grandpa at the Hall of Fame in Kauffman Stadium” she says. “After that every time she would go to see the Royals play she wanted to visit her Grandpa Dan.” We’ll let Dan finish as he so often did.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdG9tYWhhd2t0YWtlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzI4L2F0bGFudGEtYnJhdmVzLXRlbXBvcmFyaWx5LWZpbGwtbWlrZS1zb3Jva2FzLXNob2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Atlanta Braves: Who could fill Mike Soroka's shoes?,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vd2Vuc2Jvcm90aW1lcy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvbm9uLXByb2ZpdHMvMjAyMS8wMi9ib3lzLWdpcmxzLWNsdWItcmFmZmxlLW9mZmVyaW5nLWdldGF3YXlzLXRvLXZlZ2FzLWRpc25leS1ndWxmLXNob3Jlcy1hbmQtZ2F0bGluYnVyZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boys & Girls Club raffle offering getaways to Vegas Disney Gulf Shores and Gatlinburg,"Four different vacation packages are being raffled off to raise money for the Cliff Hagan Boys & Girls Club’s Mike Horn Unit.

This was a huge pickup for Wells and Cumbie as the quarterback room is a question mark. Can Shough steady the position? Let's see what the expert thinks!

What is the mood in Oregon over the transfer in general? Sad to see Tyler go or happy to see the back of him?

It really is split down the middle. Obviously you never want to lose a quarterback that has the potential to at least be a serviceable backup but there are plenty of Duck fans who believe Shough was never going to be the QB to take us to that next level.

Still I think the majority of Duck fans believed he would be favored for a reprisal of his QB1 status. Considering he entered the 2020 season a redshirt sophomore having thrown just 15 passes in his college career it seems a bit ridiculous to assume we’ve seen everything the kid has to offer in this latest season. After all this was his first year in a new offense during a very strange season that featured very little preseason practice.

How would you describe Shough’s performance as the starter?

I would describe Shough’s 2020 performance as a bonfire that ran out of fuel halfway through the party. No one really knew what to expect from Shough after the departure of Herbert and at first it seemed we were in for an agile dual-threat QB that was rapidly improving as the season went on.

A week-one win over Stanford and a comeback victory over Wazzu had the fanbase rallying around Shough. And against a surprisingly decent UCLA defense he had his best game of the season finishing with three touchdowns and 334 yards through the air without throwing a pick.

Unfortunately on the road against Oregon State and Cal Shough had a combined four turnovers and when things got tougher against USC and Iowa Mario Cristobal elected to turn to grad-transfer Anthony Brown Jr. In hindsight it seems like it was a decision made out of desperation and not out of confidence in Brown.

What are the strengths and weaknesses of his game?

Shough’s major weakness at Oregon was his inability to fully execute Moorhead’s offense which relied heavily on RPOs and a mobile quarterback. He seems to have an impressive arm and occasionally showed real promise in the pocket by planting his feet and letting it rip or escaping pressure and turning it into positive yardage but he made a handful of mistakes that sank a few crucial Oregon drives.

Still the talent is there now he needs a system that will help him unlock it.

Tech is likely switching back to an Air Raid orientated attack under Cumbie. Do you think Tyler’s game fits that style?

I think so. He came to Oregon as the No. 7 pro-style quarterback in the class of 2018 according to 247Sports. He also looked much more comfortable buying time to throw downfield than he did barreling forward for yards though picking up big chunks of yards with his feet when the defense gives it to him is one of his best qualities.

I’m fairly confident that given a full offseason Shough’s skill set will fit nicely into Cumbie’s offense. And considering lack of confidence likely played a big part in Shough’s failures here a system that requires quick accurate decisions may be just what the young QB needs to reset his game.

Lastly do you think Shough takes the next step as a quarterback if he were to win the starting job in Lubbock?

If Shough earns the starting job right away then I think Texas Tech fans have a promising quarterback that potentially will be a three-year starter. Duck fans are definitely rooting for him and if your fanbase welcomes him with open arms then I truly believe he can leave his troubles in Eugene.

Thanks again to Adam for his thoughtful answers! To me it sounds like Tech is getting a quarterback capable of thriving under Cumbie. The Air Raid does not demand a truly mobile quarterback nor does it have to have an RPO flavor.

Watching Shough's film shows a young quarterback who has all the tools. Physically he is a Power Five starter. If Cumbie can develop him as a decision maker this offense will take off.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The board Thursday held a work session to discuss the road ahead for making the proposed building a reality.

""We know the medical need is real"" said Jim Rollins institute president.

The institute is a state-supported school offering several programs for high school students and adults including industrial maintenance diesel technology nursing and information technology.

Administrators began examining the need for an increased focus on health care education about five months ago Rollins said.

Joe Rollins the Northwest Arkansas Council's director of workforce development said health care and social assistance is the second-highest growing industry in Northwest Arkansas. Construction is first and manufacturing is third he said.

The region had 1128 open health care support jobs with 281 different employers as of Thursday he said.

""I think this is the right time and conversation"" Joe Rollins said of the facility. The region will continue to see a need for qualified health care workers he said.

Northwest Arkansas' population was 545866 as of 2020 and is projected to grow by 39994 or 7% over the next five years as people move to the region in search of work Joe Rollins said.

The institute has to determine whether funding the medical building is feasible before taking further action said James Johnson consultant with Development and Institutional Advancement Associates in Johnson.

""I think this is our first step"" he said. ""What we need to know is can we raise real money.""

Johnson said he's working with institute administrators on a funding feasibility and planning study.

About 50 individuals foundations and corporations will be asked through confidential interviews if they would be willing to make a gift toward the development of the building and in what amount he said. No actual gifts will be asked for at that time he said. Interviews will take about five months to complete he said.

""What we want to do is win the campaign on paper before we even start"" he said.

Funding the building will likely require the participation of state and local industry partners and personal and philanthropic giving Jim Rollins said.

The institute has been busy recently constructing new facilities including a 14000-square-foot building for the welding program. It opened last year. The institute also is building a 20000-square-foot building for the ammonia refrigeration and industrial maintenance program.

The welding building was funded through a $3 million gift from the estate of Ella Frances Byrd of Springdale as part of the Jackson G. Byrd Bypass Trust said Melissa Greenslade student service director.

The institute received $1 million from the state's rainy day fund and $1 million from Tyson Foods to pay for the ammonia refrigeration building's construction and equipment installation Jim Rollins said.

The institute is state funded said Mike Hamley vice president of finance and operations. The institute also received funds through philanthropic giving tuition and fees he said.

Recognized need

The proposed building isn't likely to become a reality for at least three years Jim Rollins said. It would take about one year to raise the money necessary to begin construction and another two to build it he said.

The building would meet a definite need for the school said Debra Walker the institute's director of nursing programs. The institute offers certified nursing assistant sterile processing surgical technology and licensed practical nurse programs Greenslade said. About 130 students graduate from the programs annually.

""We can't grow the programs right now because there's nowhere to put them"" Walker said of incoming students.

Health care students share space in the school's main building and the nursing building with other programs she said.

The nursing program has two classrooms both with a capacity of 35 students Walker said. Classrooms in the main building seat no more than 18 students said Robin Eason vice president of instruction.

The nursing building likewise fails to meet technology safety and comfort needs Walker said. It has windows that don't open fully and must be broken to exit classrooms in the event of an emergency outdated wiring poor internet connectivity and poor ventilation she said. The facility can be very cold in the winter and extremely hot in the summer.

""We're in desperate need over there"" she said. ""If you're freezing you can't think.""

Potential

The proposed building would be about 50000 square feet and serve all health care students under one roof Jim Rollins said. The current nursing building is 18585 square feet Hamley said.

A medical building would also allow the institute to increase its offerings Eason said. The institute could incorporate medical assistant pharmacy technician electrocardiograph technician medical office administration dental assistant and other medical programs.

""We have much to contribute to the health community"" she said. ""We just need a facility and the opportunity.""

Richard Alderman lead architect with Wittenberg Delony and Davidson Architects has been working with the institute on a voluntary basis to discuss the proposed building.

The building would best be located on the northwest corner of the campus where it would be visible from South Old Missouri Road he said.

""I think we're on the right path"" said Carlos Chicas a member of the institute's board of directors. ""We need to be our own billboard.""

DALLAS — Many banks choose not to make home loans to residents in low-income areas government statistics show even though federal law prevents discrimination in lending. But that doesn’t mean bank money isn’t flowing into these same neighborhoods. It is – but in the form of low-income apartment complexes built in areas of slum and blight.

A WFAA investigation found that banks own or have owned at least 50 low-income housing developments in Dallas. They buy into these projects in order to get billions of dollars in government tax credits on them and to prove to bank regulators that they are reinvesting in low-income communities.

Our investigation also found that regulators are failing to enforce laws that require these apartment complexes to provide a safe affordable place for families to live rather than merely be a tax boon for their owners.

A need for housing

Like most American cities Dallas has a shortage of housing that lower-income families can afford.

When affordable housing does get built it’s generally apartment complexes. And too often developers construct them in high-crime high-poverty neighborhoods located below Interstate 30.

Last year we showed you how I-30 divides Dallas’ wealthier and whiter neighborhoods to the north from the largely Black and Hispanic residents to the south and how many banks continue to “redline” or purposely underserve southern Dallas.

So who’s the money behind all these low-income apartment complexes?

Sterlingshire

Let’s look at one – Sterlingshire formerly called the Bruton Road Apartments. It’s at Bruton Road and North St. Augustine Drive in the heart of Dallas’ Pleasant Grove neighborhood.

From the outside they’re nice. Residents we talked to said they’re also nice on the inside.

But crime is high according to residents. The complex is inside one of the Dallas Police Department’s “Targeted Area Action Grids.” These TAAG areas as they’re known get extra police attention because of high crime and are scattered mostly in southern Dallas.

Sterlingshire “should never have been [built] there to begin with” said Terrance Perkins a community activist and pastor of the nearby Abundance Grace Church.

“We need affordable housing” he said. “But apartment complexes [are] something we need less of especially here in Southeast Dallas. When you take a population of people and put them in one place and no resources you lead them to a dead end.”

So who owns Sterlingshire? WFAA research of court filings state housing records and public corporate documents shows that Bank of America owns 99.9% of the corporate entity that owns the complex.

And it’s not alone.

Too much crime too many apartments

We’ve identified 50 affordable-housing apartment complexes in Dallas that are owned or have been owned by big national banks. In addition to Bank of America these include American Express Chase Truist and Wells Fargo

We reached out to all of them. Those that responded said they are proud to invest in housing that serves low-income and minority families. But none wanted to be interviewed about it.

A roof over your head is indeed a good thing housing advocates say. But if you look closer frequently these buildings are clustered together in the poorest parts of the city. They are in deserts with few jobs under-performing schools lacking retail fresh groceries or reliable transportation.

FROM 2019: New center brings fresh food options to southern Dallas community

Half of the bank-financed apartments we’re talking about are located inside DPD’s TAAG areas or crime hotspots.

State law says a neighborhood shouldn’t have more than 20% of its housing – apartment units or single-family homes – be government-subsidized rental properties. In other words no clusters of low-income housing.

But we found several groupings of low-income housing complexes. One is near Southwest Center Mall formerly known as Red Bird Mall where we found banks own or have owned three apartment buildings. The concentration of subsidized housing there is 63%.

Farther east near C.F. Hawn Freeway and Great Trinity Forest Way is another high-crime high-poverty low-opportunity neighborhood. There you will find three apartment complexes including Rosemont at Pemberton Hill which was formerly owned by Chase Bank. The concentration of subsidized housing there is 43%.

In a statement Chase Bank said: “We believe affordable housing is a critical need in our communities.”

“Where you live really matters” said Ann Lott a fair housing advocate at the Inclusive Communities Project in Dallas.

Her nonprofit has sued suburban communities over their refusal to allow affordable housing. Those refusals are one reason housing is continually built in the same inner-city neighborhoods. “We have to stop a system that consistently puts poor people in areas where they cannot thrive"" she said.

“The people that live in the community need access to credit"" she said. ""They need access to loans so they can buy their homes. Banks are contributing to the slum and blight of the communities and one could argue that they have become the new slumlord.”

Bank report cards

So why do national banks invest hundreds of millions of dollars in apartments in high-crime high-poverty neighborhoods? That’s a two-part answer.

The first part has to do with bank exams.

First a little history.

For decades through a practice called redlining banks denied loans to the Black and Hispanic communities.

To address the problem Congress passed The Community Reinvestment Act in 1977 also known as the CRA. Every few years the government grades banks on how well they follow the CRA; in other words how good a job they are doing loaning money directly to lower-income businesses and homebuyers.

By the ’80s and ’90s though regulators changed the rules so banks don’t just get credit for making loans directly to individuals. They also give them what you might call ""extra credit"" for investments in affordable housing.

Today the CRA “motivates the vast majority of these investments” according to the Affordable Housing Tax Credit Coalition trade group.

Consider the CRA exam for Bank of America for its operations in North Texas. It says “...the bank has an excellent level of community development investments” totaling $813.9 million around Dallas-Fort Worth. That includes a $15.5 million dollar investment in Sterlingshire.

Corporate records show Bank of America is a 99.9% ""silent partner"" in Sterlingshire. That means the bank is a majority corporate owner but doesn’t make decisions about where an apartment complex is built and it doesn’t run day-to-day operations.

In addition to Sterlingshire Bank of America is also the 99.9% corporate owner of a low-income apartment complex across the street and another two miles to the north.

In all we found Bank of America has current or past investments in 13 low-income complexes in Dallas. All generate positive CRA scores for the bank.

Using public records we estimate Bank of America has invested $50 million in the area around Sterlingshire alone.

But how much money is the bank lending to homebuyers in this same neighborhood? The government tracks that and analysis provided by the advocacy group the National Community Reinvestment Coalition or NCRC shows Bank of America made two mortgage loans in that area in 2019.

We reached out to Bank of America about our findings.

""There is a tremendous need for affordable housing nationwide"" said Bill Halldin Bank of America spokesperson in a written statement.

""Bank of America is committed to supporting our clients and communities by providing upfront financing that is a critical component for organizations to be able to expand housing opportunities"" Halldin said.

Bank of America is not alone in its lending patterns.

Further analysis of government lending data by the NCRC shows that banks make a lot of loans north of I-30. To the south banks make very few loans – but have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in affordable housing apartment complexes helping them get passing grades on their CRA exams.

What does all this say about the effectiveness of the CRA?

“To allow tax credit housing to substitute for real loans home loans -- it’s perverted the entire meaning of the Community Reinvestment Act"" said Laura Beshara a Dallas civil rights lawyer. She along with law partner Michael Daniel have filed a number of lawsuits over affordable housing policy including for the Inclusive Communities Project whose case went all the way to the Supreme Court.

""It’s furthered the racial concentration of the area its furthered the poverty concentration"" she said. ""It’s added more residents to an area of high crime that didn’t need to be there. And at the same time they’re not making any loans to the people that live there.”

Tax credits

Aside from favorable CRA bank exam ratings another reason banks buy into low-income apartment complexes is tax credits.

The government says ""Hey Bank if you buy in with $15 million to cover the cost of building XYZ apartments the United States promises to pay you back."" The bank then claims the tax credit over a 10-year period until it gets all its money back.

We're not talking about hundreds or thousands of dollars of these low-income housing tax credits. Each year the United States gives about $8 billion in tax breaks to the corporate owners of these apartment complexes. And almost all of those tax breaks go to banks.

For the banks “it’s a no-fail system” Beshara said. With government support she said these apartment investments generate a steady return for banks with almost no risk.

“It’s very safe from an investment point of view and a sure thing” she said

But there are rules. To get that tax credit the government says a project has to be part of a “concerted community revitalization plan.” What does that mean?

It means to be eligible for a tax credit apartments have to be located in parts of town where there is a focused plan to improve struggling neighborhoods. Typically that means they have to be accompanied by things like health clinics community centers infrastructure educational and economic opportunities.

Dallas has designated revitalization plans in five neighborhoods. All of them are south of I-30 and one is in West Dallas. Banks have financed a total of six affordable housing projects inside those zones. All of them get tax breaks.

But we found 44 apartment complexes in Dallas that were all built outside revitalization areas. And they got tax breaks too.

“I don’t think they should be eligible for the tax credit” Beshara said.

So who’s letting this happen? First off it is developers who conceive of the projects pick the location and get all the state and local approvals. Developers get fees from the projects and other revenue. Banks then buy into the projects as “limited partners” and usually become 99.9% corporate owners.

By law banks typically cannot own property so they have to get special permission from the government to do so. That permission is granted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or OCC. They regulate banks among other things and give them permission to own a controlling interest in these apartment complexes. They also grade big national banks on how well they comply with the CRA.

We asked the OCC about its own rules that allow banks to buy into these low-income housing tax credit projects or LIHTCs only if they are “designed primarily to promote public welfare"" and whether what we found is of concern to them.

""The OCC’s CRA rule does not require a (low-income housing tax credit) project to be in a revitalization area to receive CRA credit"" said Bryan Hubbard an OCC spokesman. ""The OCC doesn’t regulate all individuals nor entities that may invest in LIHTC projects and isn’t involved in selecting which projects receive LIHTCs.""

Banks we contacted bristled at being called “owner” of these apartment complexes. They point out that they do not select the sites where they’re built and do not run any of the day-to-day operations. All of which is true.

But federal law says they have to be an owner in order to use the tax credits to lower their tax bill.

“Under federal income tax law (low-income housing tax credits) may be claimed only by property owners who have the benefits and burdens of ownership” according to a 2014 OCC information sheet outlining how the program works. “This includes all partnerships (LPs LLCs and other equity investors) in the properties. For example if a bank holds a 99.99 percent interest in a partnership it receives 99.99 percent of the tax credits and real estate losses which include but are not limited to depreciation and interest expenses.”

The tax credits themselves are granted by the Internal Revenue Service. But government investigations have found that the IRS does a poor job of overseeing the program.

In 2015 the U.S. General Accounting Office found “IRS oversight... has been minimal” and records “were not sufficiently reliable to determine if basic requirements for the LIHTC program were being achieved.”

“They don’t care where these projects go – at all” Beshara said. “And they don’t care who it affects.”

We asked the IRS why it gives banks tax breaks on apartments that are outside revitalization areas. “Since your story involves a specific group of taxpayers in a certain area the IRS will decline any comment due to disclosure laws and regulations” a spokesperson replied in an email.

“The program has operated for over 30 years without any requirements of where the housing should be located” Beshara said. “As a result the housing has become concentrated in high minority areas of high poverty. Many of them with very distressed neighborhood conditions with high crime.”

Sterlingshire revisited

In 2015 before Sterlingshire was built Beshara and her law partner sent a warning letter to regulators. They said Sterlingshire’s paperwork “failed to disclose” that there was “significant criminal activity” in the area and that the project should not be eligible for tax breaks.

“This false representation can be the subject of a suit by any future tenants of the project for the consequences including harm from the high crime in the area” they wrote.

That harm came in 2019. In June 13-year-old Malik Tyler a resident of Sterlingshire was walking near his home when he was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting.

The company that manages Sterlingshire declined to talk to us for this story.

Not far from where Malik was killed across the street from Sterlingshire neighbors later noticed activity on a large vacant lot. When Terrance Perkins inquired he learned what developers had planned for the site – another low-income housing complex.

He gathered neighbors for a fight. They won that battle – at least for now. But another neighborhood might not be so lucky.

“What the builders end up doing or the investors they’ll come to a community that’s not going to fight it and put the apartment complex there” Perkins said. “And then [they’ll] say ‘Hey look we’ve done something great.’ But in reality you’re only crippling us.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzExOGIyOWJhLWYxMTgtNDZmZi1iNjM5LTY3NWNlYjNjMWNmNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goldman bankers join Walmart effort to take on Wall Street,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

It began with an attempted robbery at the Bank of America branch in North Hollywood. Forty-four minutes later hundreds of rounds had been fired by the robbers carrying AK-47s and LAPD officers most of whom were armed only with their handguns.

The two bank robbers Larry Eugene Phillips Jr. 26 and Emil Matasareanu 30 were killed.

After a bystander reported the robbery to authorities responding officers were met with a barrage of gunfire from Phillips as he casually walked out of the bank and into the parking lot. Realizing how badly they were outgunned some of the officers got rifles at nearby gun stores.

Matasareanu shot twice in the bank parking lot took cover in a getaway car and slowly drove toward Phillips who continued walking and shooting.

Phillips was shot nearly a dozen times. His gun jammed when he was pinned down behind a car. He shot himself in the head but an autopsy report noted the coroner could not determine whether he or police fired the fatal shot.

Matasareanu shot several times in the legs bled to death a short time later. His family later sued two police officers and the city claiming the officers were indifferent to Matasareanu’s wounds at the scene and let him die. The case was declared a mistrial in 2000 and later dismissed.

Eleven officers and seven bystanders were injured .

He has been accused of four other robberies in Mesa and Phoenix in addition to the initial robbery in Tempe on Dec. 1.

The crimes on Friday occurred at the branches near the corner of Deer Valley Drive and Tatum Boulevard at 1 p.m. and near the corner of Seventh Street and Bell Road at 4:40 p.m. according to a release.

Dubbed the “Piggy Bank Bandit” due to leaving with coin rolls from one of the robberies authorities say the suspect approached the teller during each of the incidents and presented a demand note.

The suspect whose gender is unknown is described as being between 5-foot-6 to 5-foot-8 and 25 to 35 years old.

The person has been observed wearing a beanie-style hat hooded sweatshirt long pants black-rimmed glasses a black face mask and a backpack during the robberies according to a press release.

A photo from one of the robberies in December found the suspect appears to have a tattoo on the left side of their neck.

According to a release the FBI Violent Crimes Task Force assigned to the case is comprised of the Phoenix Police Department Peoria Police Department Scottsdale Police Department Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office FATE team Maricopa County Attorney’s Office and the FBI.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the FBI’s Phoenix Field Office at 623-466-1999 480-948-6377 for Silent Witness or submit tips online.

UBER,Uber,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZ3J5bWV0YWxndXkuY29tL2VtcHlyaXVtLXViZXItZGVuLXN0ZXJuZW4tcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Empyrium - Über den Sternen Review,"If you asked me to name an underrated band Empyrium would be one of the first out my mouth. Beginning life as a symphonic/folk/metal band in the mid-1990s with gems such as Songs of Moors and Misty Fields they strayed into pure neofolk territory as they developed before disbanding in relative obscurity in the early 2000s. 2014 saw their return with a fresh post-metal influence in their sound in The Turn of the Tides. It borders on an atmospheric masterpiece and remains one of my favorites from that year. An EP entitled The Mill followed in the same vein shortly thereafter but things have been silent in the six years since. 2021 has arrived and with it the long-awaited sequel entitled Über den Sternen (Above the Stars). With great quality comes great expectations so I was all-too-eager to get my grubby hands on the album.

Über represents a reversion to the folksy blackened approach of olde but with the measured post-influenced approach of new(e). It’s an album more about mood and atmosphere than moment to moment demands. “The Three Flames Sapphire” opens the album with beautiful acoustic melody before a cello slowly swims in. When this track released as a single I was transfixed by its hypnotic enchanting quality. Neofolk is presented more obviously than on The Turn lending a peaceful but dark temperament. The controlled pace doesn’t let aggression and brute force power loose often but this ensures that when it does the music is all the more potent. When electrification on the guitars does take hold this is frequently for its texture in the mix and not just melody or rhythm.

Further contributing to this atmosphere are the sonorous clean vocals. It’s a baritone but uniquely musical offering a somber twist to counter-balance the occasional harsh vocals. These are also strong with a retched shriek piercing the soundscape to bolster those moments of heaviness. The record benefits from grandiose but somber chants softer vibratos and the fierce shrieks all of which blend into the dynamic music. Despite the record’s strength in softness readily stripping back into sparse compositions this dynamism also facilitates passages of grand heaviness and density. “The Wild Swans” typifies these qualities through its dramatic drum rhythm which bridges into an epic chorus layering choral chants shrieks riffs and commanding percussion. Further the closing title track stands alone in directly opening with a heavy but nifty guitar lead before transitioning into a strings-laced melodic theme which permeates the finale slipping in and out of heavy and light passages.

Empyrium here write simple songs. Most tracks feature one core melody and plenty of repetition but they excel in taking their time. Lots of things feed into how engaging things are: the hypnotic atmosphere; the memorable melodies; the diverse vocals; the folksy instrumentation; the subtle variations on core melodies; the selective harmonization; and the instrumental flourishes across transitions. Each meaningfully develops the music while retaining Über’s cohesion. The songs are internally cohesive and contribute to the album’s whole. On my first listen through the entirety I wasn’t so enraptured but it was reaching the title track at the finale that signified its staying power. As the first single available I had heard it multiple times already and it was immediately my highlight. The more time spent with it the more I liked it and this quality is true of the remainder. The exception which proves the quality in completeness here is the pairing of “Moonrise” and “The Archer” at the record’s core. They’re individually lovely interludes but sequencing them together hinders Über’s momentum. It’s a small stumble which stands out next to the remainder’s careful construction.

What strikes me most is how mature Über sounds. It’s the creative output of experienced musicians and songwriters who demonstrate skill care and control. It draws from Empyrium’s heritage while pushing their sound forward referencing 90s-style production but sounding unlike any single previous release. The Turn began its life as a solid recommendation but now sits as one of my favorites of 2014. I consequently took my time with this album to allow it to gestate. It similarly initially struck me as a (mildly disappointing) good record but its undeniable quality has strongly grown on me. Will it continue in this vein and finish as one of the top records of the year? That remains to be seen but initial signs are promising.

It was passionately embraced by Uber the ride-hailing company set up to put taxis out of business. Unfortunately for it one of the things it broke was UK employment law – which led the UK supreme court to issue a judgment on 19 February confirming that this was indeed the case.

Uber (for those who including this columnist have never used it) is a technology platform that puts customers seeking a taxi in touch with drivers who own cars and are willing to provide rides. Everything that happens in that process other than conversations between customers and drivers is controlled by the platform. Uber’s case – and business model – depends on drivers being regarded as self-employed contractors ie cheap. The case decided by the court hinged on the question of whether drivers were indeed merely contractors or “workers” entitled to a minimum wage and holiday pay – protections they were unable to enjoy while Uber classified them as self-employed.

The court unanimously upheld a 2016 employment tribunal decision maintaining that drivers are in a “position of subordination and dependancy to Uber”. The judgment is worth reading just to see the justices’ elegant exposition of this proposition. Uber set maximum fares; drivers had no say in their contracts; the application imposed penalties if drivers cancelled too many requests; and they had little or no ability to improve their economic position through “professional or entrepreneurial skill” – so in practice the only way in which they could increase their earnings was by working longer hours while constantly meeting Uber’s measures of performance. Which meant they worked for Uber and not themselves.

Although Uber are insisting the verdict only applies to the 25 drivers who brought the claim in reality it sets a precedent for how millions of gig economy workers are treated in the UK and elsewhere (because foreign courts pay attention to what courts in other jurisdictions have decided). In that sense the judgment is a landmark one with significant implications for gig-economy outfits such as Deliveroo and others.

Mind you it doesn’t go the whole way to regarding Uber drivers as employees. There are three employment categories under UK law: employees who are guaranteed employment rights and benefits; workers who enjoy some of those rights; and the self-employed who have very little protection. The supreme court has just moved the drivers from the third of these categories to the second. But it’s a start.

So what happens next? Will Uber tweak its platform to reduce its level of control over its “new” workers? If it does then as the Financial Times pointed out it will be less able to guarantee customers a uniform service – which is one of the reasons why Uber was so popular with foreign visitors to Britain. (I gather that a common complaint of Uber drivers to their passengers in Cambridge is that the bottom dropped out of their business once the pandemic forced Chinese students to return home.)

Another possible response will be to raise prices to cover the additional costs of conforming with the law as decided by the supreme court. Since Uber is pathologically unprofitable (London seems to have been one of the few cities where it was making some money) a significant rise in its operating costs seems certain to make the financial picture worse.

So on the face of it Uber is cornered – by UK law on the one hand and by financial realities on the other. But as any zoologist will confirm wild beasts are often at their most dangerous when cornered. And Uber – which until recently had the most toxic corporate culture after Facebook – is unlikely to play nice. We had a taste of that in California a while back when it – and an alliance of other gig-economy companies – shelled out $200m to successfully support Proposition 22 a measure that allows them to continue classifying their drivers as “independent contractors” rather than “employees” with mandated benefits.

Uber is already trying the Proposition 22 approach in Brussels. It has published a preposterous “white paper” explaining how important it is to preserve the freedom of 600000 European workers to “access flexible earning opportunities”. The “current legal ambiguity on the status of independent workers” it goes on “makes it difficult for platforms like Uber to provide both access to flexible work and benefits and social protections to independent workers”.

Well in the UK at least that “current legal ambiguity” has been eliminated. So all that remains now is for Uber to come to terms with the one thing that all global tech companies viscerally loathe: the idea that they have to obey the law of the petty jurisdictions in which they operate. And one of the deliciously ironic side-effects of Brexit is that the option of kicking the case into the long grass of the European court of justice is no longer available! Sometimes one must be grateful for small mercies.

Five years after they took Uber to court two ex-drivers on Friday won a legal battle against the ride-hailing firm.

Yaseen Aslam and James Farrar were part of a small group of drivers who brought the original case against Uber in 2015. Aslam and his colleague Farrar president and general secretary of the App Drivers and Couriers Union (ADCU) respectively claimed Uber was breaking UK employment law by failing to offer basic worker rights such as holiday pay and national minimum wage. They won the case.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Uber disputed the claims saying it acted like other traditional minicab firms and counted its drivers as self-employed contractors. At the time this meant drivers had minimal protections including no sick pay and Uber could avoid the costs of paying minimum wage. In 2017 Uber appealed the original ruling and lost.

Uber then appealed the case in the UK's Supreme Court and the process dragged on into February 2021. Again the company lost marking the end of its legal road. The outcome could threaten Uber's business model in the UK — one of its biggest markets — if it is forced to cough up back pay for thousands of drivers who may bring cases and if it must pay higher taxes.

The dispute will go back to an employment tribunal which will decide how much the 25 drivers who brought the case five years ago will be awarded. Aslam believes he's entitled to between £10000 and £12000.

""I was delighted"" he told Insider. ""It means a lot. I didn't just do it for myself I did it for the workers and drivers. I'm just a driver who spoke up for injustice.""

Aslam who is based in the UK worked for Uber between 2013 and 2017. Once during his time at the company he says Uber ""deactivated"" him for organizing a campaign against the company's treatment of drivers. This meant the company didn't allow him to access the app to pick up passengers he said.

""I'm not anti-Uber and I'm not there to shut Uber down. But the law is there for a reason"" he added. Uber did not respond when Insider asked it to comment on Aslam's claims of deactivation.

Uber's business model

When Aslam first started working at Uber he said it was good. He earned £50 an hour got a £10 bonus for each ride and the fares were higher. Plus the company ""put the drivers first.""

As he continued working for the company however the fares got cheaper and the bonuses stopped he says. After the launch of UberPool a service launched in 2015 that allows people to split ride costs with another person who is travelling in the same direction drivers were earning even less according to Aslam.

Related stories

Back in 2016 CNN also reported that drivers said UberPool meant more work but not necessarily more pay. Aslam said drivers have realised that Uber is ""hiding behind technology to control workers.""

According to Aslam Uber's business model involves mass recruiting and flooding the streets with drivers and cars while keeping fares cheap to attract customers. This has long been a criticism of Uber and its business model — that the firm initially funded by huge amounts of private capital could afford to keep cab fares artificially low at the expense of drivers and the competition.

Although Aslam thinks businesses such as Uber should exist he said they ""rely on exploiting people and they go for a mass scaling model and I think it's wrong."" He believes the customer should take some responsibility in the pricing as there's a human cost involved: ""There's someone behind that wheel and they need to have rights.""

The case still isn't over

""The devil is in the details now"" Farrar told Insider. He said Uber is being defiant about committing to implement the ruling.

After the recent ruling Uber was quick to point out that it only applied to the group of 25 drivers who brought the case in 2016. It also said the ruling was specific to how Uber's business operated when the drivers initially filed a lawsuit and that the business has since changed.

""Uber is trying to spin a line to drivers that this ruling only applies to the original claimants and not to all drivers"" said Farrar who worked for Uber between 2015 and 2016. ""Not only is it untrue but it's demonstrably contrary to the spirit of the ruling.""

Advertisement

He hopes Uber is just going through ""a stage of emotional grief and denial"" and that it will accept the ruling. But if not he said the government and regulator Transport for London (TfL) needs to step in.

Claims against Uber are already piling up

If the government doesn't enforce the law and TfL doesn't step in Farrar said he and other drivers would have to ""pile up litigation"" against Uber.

Indeed thousands of claimants are already making claims against the firm. Nigel Mackay a partner at Leigh Day Solicitors said his company currently has 3500 clients with claims against Uber.

Farrar who formed an organization called Worker Info Exchange to help app workers like Uber drivers access their data from companies they work for said these types of claims could become extremely expensive for the taxi app company. He believes there'll be a cottage industry of lawyers making continuous claims against Uber ""because it's an easy win.""

He added: ""It's embarrassing that the poorest people on minimum wage have to go to the Supreme Court against one of the most powerful companies on Earth.""

Although Uber did not respond to Insider's request for comment the company sent a press release shortly after the ruling featuring a statement from Jamie Heywood Uber's regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe.

It said: ""We respect the court's decision which focussed on a small number of drivers who used the Uber app in 2016. Since then we have made some significant changes to our business guided by drivers every step of the way. These include giving even more control over how they earn and providing new protections like free insurance in case of sickness or injury. We are committed to doing more and will now consult with every active driver across the UK to understand the changes they want to see.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjcvdWJlci1kb29yZGFzaC12cy1naWctd29ya2Vycy5odG1s0gFFaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjEvMDIvMjcvdWJlci1kb29yZGFzaC12cy1naWctd29ya2Vycy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gig companies prepare to bring their fight for independent work nationwide under a more skeptical Biden administration,"In this article UBER

Still fresh off of a landmark victory in California companies like DoorDash  Instacart Lyft and Uber are preparing to bring their message supporting an independent workforce nationwide. But the companies will face new hurdles in passing similar legislation outside of California. The tradition of direct democracy through ballot measures that exists in the state is less common elsewhere meaning companies will have to win over lawmakers not just voters. And in Washington they will have to face a new federal administration led by a president who openly opposed the California proposition while on the campaign trail. Nearly 59% of California voters voted yes on Proposition 22 the ballot initiative supported by the gig companies to maintain their workers' status as independent contractors rather than employees. The measure would save the companies costly expenses that come with an employed workforce but it would also require them to provide some new protections for app-based ridesharing and food delivery workers. Those would include benefits they could carry between apps and guaranteed minimum earnings. The proposition essentially undermined a California law known as AB5 that took effect in early 2020. AB5 targeted the gig companies by establishing a three-part test to determine if workers should be classified as employees. Prior to Election Day last year Uber and Lyft were still fighting a lawsuit from the California state attorney general in court that claimed the companies illegally maintained their workers as independent contractors under the new law. A judge had granted a preliminary injunction requiring the companies to reclassify their workers determining that the state had a good chance of prevailing on the merits. The passage of Prop 22 seems to have reversed the fates of Uber and Lyft in California and reinvigorated the fight for their business models across the country. The gig companies point to the relatively high level of support California voters showed for their ballot measure as a reason why lawmakers in other states should see that the independent model is supported by their constituents. But state lawmakers working on bills to protect gig workers in places like Illinois Massachusetts and New York told CNBC that the outcome in California does not necessarily portend the future in their own states.

California casts a shadow

State and local lawmakers working on their own legislation to protect gig workers had hoped California would serve as proving ground for some early ideas. But confusing execution of AB5 bred resentment among some workers who were unexpectedly caught up in the new rules. AB5 painted the workforce with a broad brush later adding exemptions for industries where its protections weren't really needed. But that led to lots of confusion for workers who had long been independent casting a shadow over the legislation. Freelance writers for example were furious that their regular contracts had to be cut to remain below the threshold to be considered contractors. Diane Savino a New York state senator working on her own legislation to address gig work issues said that it was a mistake for lawmakers in California cast too wide a net with AB5. ""Not a single worker's life was changed the day after AB5 was enacted into law"" she said making it difficult for Californians to see its benefits when they went to the polls. ""It's hard to extol the virtue of legislation if no one ever sees how it works."" New York City Council Member Brad Lander had been ""optimistic"" prior to the pandemic and during the introduction of AB5 in California that his legislature could soon pass new protections for gig workers. But the new reality that took place throughout 2020 seemed to slow down any momentum that existed. ""A lot was riding on California"" Lander said. ""There was a lot of optimism that AB5 was going to start the ball rolling build the momentum for state-level changes."" Ultimately inaction benefits the gig companies Lander said. ""The gig companies don't have to win by winning. They could just win by stalemating leaving the current situation"" he said. But Will Guzzardi a state representative in Illinois sees things differently. He said the implementation of Prop 22's protections for workers in California could give a tangible example of what's lacking under that model. ""I think in fact the passage of Prop 22 is going to add a lot of momentum to our arguments because we're going to be able to point to these examples that you've seen and say 'look what happens when you give the gig employers free rein. Look at the abuses'"" he said. ""It's bad for California but I think it does create an opportunity for us to say 'we can't let this happen here.'""

A third way?

The fight over gig worker rights has boiled down to one key question: Which way offers the best outcome for workers themselves? Under the current system there are two ways workers can be classified: as employees or independent contractors. As the pandemic exposed a key pitfall in that model for gig companies — the fact that their workforce was left with low demand for work and no access to unemployment insurance prior to the passage of the CARES Act — Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi asked the government to consider what he called a ""third way"" to classify work.

Under this model a third classification group could allow for the flexibility of independent contract work while providing some of the protections of full employment he argued. Khosrowshahi advocated for portable benefits that could move with workers from one gig to the next. Some labor law experts have pointed out that nothing in the current law prevents gig companies from taking on part-time employees and providing them with flexible shifts. But the firms have said such a model would be impractical in part because it would be too difficult to track working hours while maintaining its system built on pairing demand on both sides of the market. In a statement for this article an Uber spokesperson said ""Nearly 10 million California voters -including 47% of Democrats- voted to give gig workers what they themselves said they wanted: the choice to keep working independently with new benefits and protections. We hope other states will listen to the voices of drivers and delivery people who strongly support new laws that make gig work better."" Indeed a majority of gig workers have said in independent surveys long before Prop 22 came into the picture that they prefer to be independent workers. Those advocating for reclassification however point to the large spending power and megaphone of the gig companies. DoorDash Instacart Lyft Uber and its now-subsidiary Postmates poured $200 million into the campaign for Prop 22 while the opposition raised less than $20 million. Plus the companies had access to voters right through their phones pushing messages through their apps urging them to vote yes on the proposition and threatening to scale back their services if it did not prevail. But the companies point back to the broad support Prop 22 garnered. ""Across the country drivers have consistently said they want to remain independent contractors"" Lyft said in a statement. ""That's why Lyft is advocating for solutions that allow drivers to keep their independence while also gaining historic new benefits like those won with Prop. 22."" In an interview with CNBC DoorDash Head of Policy Max Rettig said he cares less about the labels for employment than creating a ""legal system that recognizes and enshrines this really unique type of work that recognizes its value that makes sure that it continues to exist and that creates benefits on top of that."" Creating portable benefits that workers can choose from is key he said since workers on DoorDash and other platforms often have other jobs that already provide them healthcare benefits meaning additional offerings from DoorDash could be less meaningful to them. Instead workers should have the option to put funds toward what they really need. ""The lesson that I would draw about Prop 22 … is this is a proof point that a third way can work and that a third way is ultimately politically popular across the political spectrum"" Rettig said. Rettig added that even though the specific language of Prop 22 won't necessarily translate exactly to other states or on the federal level it's proof that the system can work by keeping the flexibility and benefits workers want. Instacart similarly said in a statement that it was open to looking at other types of solutions outside of California. ""While Californians passed a first-in-the-nation solution that protected worker flexibility we recognize there may be other approaches to meet the needs of app-based workers"" the company said. ""Many lawmakers across the country are reimagining how to modernize existing labor systems and we look forward to engaging with them on innovative solutions."" Providing a new model for work is really what will keep workers protected some advocates say. Reverend Kirsten John Foy founder of Uber-backed social justice group The Arc of Justice and a founding member of the New York Coalition for Independent Work (alongside several gig companies) said whatever the outcome is he knows the current model of employment has not worked for traditionally marginalized communities. App-based gig work has provided people already working multiple jobs the ability to take on work that has more flexible hours and more agency he said. ""To say that we can now use a model that has failed our communities in the past to now protect our communities in the midst of economic crisis is laughable"" he said referring to Black Brown and immigrant communities. ""Why do we think that the dependency model has served us well enough to continue it or expand it?"" Foy said. ""It hasn't. It has served us at the very least marginally. We are running around looking for band aids to problems that are chronic ... and the app-based paradigm is a systemic and chronic solution to a chronic problem.""

'And then the pandemic hit'

The pandemic showed many gig workers and lawmakers just how precarious the entire sector really is. ""People don't understand their rights until they're in a situation where they're really in a jam"" said Jay Livingstone a state representative in the Massachusetts legislature who introduced a bill last year that would require gig companies reliant on independent contractors to pay into the unemployment system. Because they currently do not workers for apps like Uber and DoorDash were left without unemployment insurance early in the pandemic until the CARES Act allowed for them to be included in those payments. Savino the New York state senator said she's gotten ""some of the nastiest commentary"" of her political career from independent workers telling her to mind her own business when it comes to regulating their industries. ""And then the pandemic hit"" she said. ""And what we saw is that working people who were employed by traditional employers who had unemployment insurance coverage had workers compensation coverage had paid sick days had the least disruption in their lives were the ones who fared the best in this environment. And the people who had been out there these gig workers were the ones who were really in the worst possible position."" Soon the emails took a different tone. ""I'm desperate I can't get into unemployment I'm not eligible I need help"" Savino recalled the messages saying. ""And we don't want to find people in that position. So what we need to do is figure out what makes sense in this modern world of work. Because no matter what we do here's one thing we know: People aren't going back to the way things used to be."" Livingstone said he remains concerned about ""validating [the] business model"" of gig companies but he decided that the best way to get relief to workers would be to ""avoid that dispute of what exactly is the employment relationship."" ""There's a more immediate concern of if there is another downturn or if this downturn continues and federal programs expire how is the state going to provide for these people?"" he said. ""And as more of the economy is shifting to an independent contractor model whether legally or illegally it's going to be more and more of an issue when there is a downturn moment like this.""

What's next

While California provided an early win for the gig companies it's clear there's still a long road ahead. On his campaign website President Joe Biden promised to ""put a stop to employers intentionally misclassifying their employees as independent contractors"" including by enacting laws that would make misclassification subject to greater penalties. Biden openly advocated against Prop 22 and nominated a former union leader Boston Mayor Marty Walsh to lead his Labor Department. If confirmed Walsh would have to figure out what to do about a rule the Trump administration created at the end of its term and set to go into effect in March. The ""Independent Contractor Status Under Fair Labor Standards Act"" rule would make it easier for gig companies to argue that their workers are truly contractors rather than employees. On Inauguration Day the Biden administration froze the rule for regulatory review delaying its effective day to May 7. The DOL could still further delay or take action to roll back the rule after going through mandatory processes. In Congress Democrats reintroduced the PRO Act a broad labor rights bill earlier this month that would establish an ABC test to determine worker classification at the federal level similar to California's AB5. And in New York a federal court ruling in July determined Uber and Lyft drivers are eligible for unemployment payments from the state though the judge also said the companies had made it unfairly difficult for drivers to receive those benefits. Savino said New York's court rulings mean the state has a different dynamic from California's. ""We could do it the easy way or the hard way"" she said. ""The easy way is let's come up with a legislative framework that we all understand and makes sense for workers. Or we could do it the hard way. We could just hand you [the gig companies] a bill for past due insurance premiums. Which would you like?"" Groups advocating for employment status for gig workers will likely look to where messaging worked and fell short in the California campaign. Will Coleman CEO of rideshare service Alto which employs W-2 workers said he's felt that the potential benefits to consumers of an employed workforce has been missing from the narrative. ""I think we need to do a better job of really articulating the consumer trade-off in addition to the employee trade-off"" Coleman said. Those could range from more consistency in service to a quicker ride with fewer cars on the road to lower emissions. ""They may have won Prop 22 in California but they didn't win the war"" Savino said. ""And it's in their interest to do it the right way in New York."" Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

Spilling the beau-tea!

The 2021 Golden Globes are officially in full swing—and in true Hollywood fashion our favorite stars are showing up and showing out for the fanciful affair. Of course we wouldn't expect anything less given this is the ceremony that kicks off awards season.

While the night is just getting started there's already one celebrity making us swoon with her Golden Globes look: Sarah Hyland.

The Modern Family actress turned heads while hosting the Live From E!: Countdown to the Golden Globes. She oozed with glamour wearing a fiery red off-the-shoulder gown that featured a voluminous pleated skirt and curve-hugging bodice. She dazzled in a Monique Lhuillier design.

Sarah's old Hollywood-inspired fashion wasn't the only thing worth raving over because her beauty was just as fabulous. For one the 30-year-old star's crimson-colored ensemble perfectly complemented her new red hair which she debuted earlier this week.

But best of all? The award-winning actress used wallet-friendly products proving you don't need to break the bank to look like a million bucks. Luckily E! News has all of the details on Sarah's red carpet glam.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2RlY2lkZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjcvdW5pdGVkLXN0YXRlcy12cy1iaWxsaWUtaG9saWRheS1tYWtldXAtYXJ0aXN0LXRlbGxzLWFsbC1hYm91dC1hbmRyYS1kYXlzLXN0dW5uaW5nLXRyYW5zZm9ybWF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'United States vs. Billie Holiday' Makeup Artist Tells All About Andra Day's Stunning Transformation,"Andra Day stuns as the soulful blues crooner Billie Holiday in Hulu’s newest biopic The United States vs. Billie Holiday. But even as she mesmerized with her poignant heart-rending pipes we couldn’t quit looking at her candy apple red lips.

Wondering how to get this stunning at home? We asked the movie’s makeup department head Laini Thompson how she settled on Day’s look and what products she used to create the singer’s shiny pout.

“Most of the research I turned up on Billie was in black and white but what I noticed in all the pictures was that her lips were perfectly lined and defined” says Thompson. So the first thing she decided on was Mac Lip Liner in Ruby Woo $18. “We knew we had to keep outlining and going around her lips to get the right effect.”

In an effort to keep in tune with this look Thompson began her journey to find the perfect red lipstick—testing between 25 and 30 different colors in every name brand. Finally she came across Julie Hewett’s line of Film Noir lipsticks and decided on Rouge Noir $28—which she says harkens back to the days of old Max Factor colors. “And you don’t paint it on with a brush. You have to apply it right from the tube to get that color right.”

The final touch to bring out the shine is the unassuming Kiehl’s Lip Balm $13.75. A workhorse for damaged winter lips Thompson says the secret lies in tapping the balm on top of the lipstick for a perfect finish not rubbing it on–and staying away from lipgloss.

In the end Thompson was thrilled with the look she created for this iconic role over three and a half months of shooting. Standing backstage with a mirror and all of these products Thompson touched up Day after every single performance to pay homage to Billie’s perfectly lined lips—from Café Society to Carnegie Hall.

“I used a whole tube of lipstick on her! That has never happened before. This should have lasted a year! We put so much product on her lips but that’s what made her pop.”

Connected devices: From digital watches to more advanced health devices patients can bring the health systems into their homes and better communicate with their care providers 24/7 ultimately improving health outcomes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRleG1lZC5vcmcvVGVtcGxhdGUuYXNweD9pZD01NTg2N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leading Innovation: Physician Entrepreneur Develops App to Engage Patients,"

In 2015 Austin cardiologist Manish Chauhan MD decided to finally act on an idea he’d been knocking around for a while – something to fill a void he’d witnessed when it came to engaging patients in their care.

“Patients are looking for clear information about their health from their trusted clinicians to make better decisions and self-care but we oftentimes don’t have the tools or the time or digital resources to sit and simply explain to patients about their conditions and different treatment options [during or after office visits]” he said.

To fix that he decided to create an app that could provide physician-approved videos that explain in simple language the causes and consequences of heart-related problems like heart failure or atrial fibrillation. The internet already has plenty of medical websites with text-based and ad-filled information but his tool would allow any health care professional to present video-based information to patients about their conditions treatment options and new therapies.

Dr. Chauhan talked over with his wife the pros and cons of taking such a big step and decided to jump ahead.

“[I told her] if I build an app that only one doctor uses and that’s me I know it’s going to help my patients” he said. “So I’m going to build it.”

That was the start of CardioVisual.com an app that boasts more than half a million clinician and patient viewers.

Out of the comfort zone

Physicians and other health care professionals should not only embrace new technology they should help lead in the creation of it Dr. Chauhan says. Driven by physicians health care technologies are much more likely to improve care and not waste the time of either patients or those overseeing their health care.

“My message is clinicians should lead in the innovation in health care because we can make a difference” he said. “That’s how we’re going to be able to create better solutions that are relevant on a daily basis.”

Dr. Chauhan knew what he could contribute as a physician. He also knew he’d have to step out of his comfort zone to learn about technology and venture capitalism. But once experts in engineering technology and business saw the value of the app Dr. Chauhan quickly found they’d step up with the knowhow and the money to help.

For instance he knew the app had to be easy to share accessible to patients and clinicians and up to date and detailed enough to cover most medical eventualities.

“Most people don’t have one [medical] condition” he said. “They may have several conditions e.g. heart disease diabetes and high cholesterol. So how do we give them comprehensive information that is consistent that most doctors will agree is good information?”

On the technical side however Dr. Chauhan was at a loss.

“From a medical standpoint we knew we were in the right space” he said. “But from a business and technology standpoint we needed the guidance from bright folks so I had mentors.”

Physician-driven tech

Many of the app’s most important features have come about because of physician input Dr. Chauhan says.

“The whole reason to have separate language content came from three separate clinicians in South Texas sending us feedback saying ‘Where are the Spanish-language videos?’” he said. “So now we try to create a Spanish and English version for all our content. [Also] clinicians are worried about medical discussions on social media so we built a secure forum just for clinicians.”

At first Dr. Chauhan says he “bootstrapped” the funding running the app on a small budget and a dedicated technical team. As the app grew he ran into some luck: A large investor was willing to fund the project.

Perhaps the biggest obstacle Dr. Chauhan says he faces is that many physicians – especially older ones – understandably are reluctant to adopt new technology.

“Clinicians are smart” he said. “They use their smart phones and apps all the time. But they don’t want to adapt new technologies in health care and I think in part because a lot of the tools – for example electronic medical records – are not built to be user-friendly. They’re not built around the busy work schedules and the flow of the clinicians or the needs of the patients.”",,,,,,,,,

Medical staff from the National Children's Hospital take part in a vigil to honour their fallen colleagues and call on the government to provide ample protection to frontline staff and the immediate release of their bonuses in Quezon City on April 28 2020.

Last week Stratbase ADR Institute in partnership with health advocacy groups Philippine Alliance of Patient Organizations Bantay Konsumer Kalsada Kuryente Health Justice and Citizen Watch Philippines launched an initiative to raise awareness on the urgent need to implement the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act fully.

This new initiative aptly called UHC Watch is composed of civil society groups committed to being vigilant and watchful that all public health investments are fully in place and efficiently utilized to benefit the most number of Filipinos.

The launch event was timely given that the UHC Act was signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte in February 2019. However despite the two years since its passage critical provisions of the law remain unimplemented.

The discussion on UHC was also relevant given the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The current state of the Philippines' public health and economic crisis is in no small part a consequence of our neglect of the country's health care systems.

This pandemic has made it abundantly clear that strengthening the health systems through UHC policies is essential to responding to pandemics and delivering critical health services to Filipinos without them falling into poverty.

Indeed unlike COVID-19 the issue of public health is by no means novel. In fact ""to stay healthy and avoid illnesses"" has regularly topped Pulse Asia's ""Most Urgent Personal Concerns"" survey. In its latest report staying healthy was the top personal concern of 74% of Filipinos.

Health too was one of the top issues in Pulse Asia's ""Most Urgent National Concerns"" survey. Ranked third on the list of 16 concerns ""controlling the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19"" was one of the most urgent concerns for 23% of the respondents.

However while COVID-19 a health issue makes a podium finish some of you may be asking how in the middle of a pandemic is COVID-19 and staying healthy not the number one most urgent national concern of Filipinos? I argue that it is because of the most urgent concerns that rank right before and right after health.

According to the Pulse Asia Survey ""controlling inflation"" is the top concern with 43% while ""increasing workers' pay"" is second with 34%. At the same time coming in fourth just below our concern for controlling the spread of COVID-19 is ""Providing assistance/subsidy to those who lost their livelihoods and jobs because of the COVID-19 pandemic"" at 27% while ""Reducing the Poverty of Many Filipinos"" and ""Creating more jobs"" come are tied at 6th with 26%.

What all six of these concerns have in common is that they are all economic in nature.

The fact of the matter is amidst a pandemic many Filipinos do not have the luxury of worrying themselves with their health when empty plates hungry mouths and the idea alone of out-of-pocket payments grossly outweigh one's regard for health and well-being.

Indeed this survey gives the popular saying ""health is wealth"" a run for its money.

However if the UHC law is fully implemented the law would expand access to health services by automatically enrolling all Filipinos in the National Health Insurance Program and would provide equitable access to quality and affordable health care services while protecting Filipinos against financial risk.

Despite the two years since the law was passed and the public health and economic crises that we have all faced in the past year the UHC Act's key objectives have still not yet been fully realized.

One example is the effective implementation of population-based and individual-based health services provided for in the act. If implemented fully it would call for deeper collaboration between the Department of Health and local government units for interventions that address population-wide concerns such as public health campaigns disease surveillance or controlling mosquito breeding grounds for instance.

UHC Act provisions that ensure access to health technologies by improving government procurement mechanisms such as pooled-procurement should also be implemented. Under this provision the government will become the key purchaser of medicines and health services. By pooling medicines or services Filipinos need it will negotiate for fairer prices and ensure that these get to where these medicines and services are required.

That said UHC is not just about health financing. Provisions in the Act cut across the health system from health policy and governance to communications networks and health information systems. The last example of health information systems in UHC is one that Filipinos could benefit from immediately. Currently copies of patients' medical data are floating around siloed information systems.

However the UHC Act mandates that necessary health data should be consolidated and stored in interoperable information systems that would lead to more efficient health services. In more immediate terms this means patients no longer have to fill in patient records forms every single visit and your doctors could also have access to relevant medical information at the tip of their fingers.

If fully implemented the UHC act could have profound impacts on Filipinos' most urgent concerns. First given that ""stay healthy and avoid illnesses"" is an already top personal concern UHC could fundamentally change how Filipinos take care of themselves.

Second by lifting the financial weight associated with medical care and out-of-pocket expenses off the shoulders of Filipinos the UHC act might even re-shape how economically-concerned we are.

While it is unlikely that our economic concern will go away with the full implementation of a single law perhaps knowing one has UHC coverage might still be enough to shift the reason behind our concern away from drab medicals bills and towards more cheerful activities.

Mixed method research comprising three distinct studies was conducted in two rural towns of Kongo Central province DRC from 1 January 2017 through March 2018. The main study which involved 625 households (3712 household members) consisted of an Action Research in which pre-(baseline) intervention and post-intervention surveys were carried out using the Malaria Indicator Questionnaire from the World Bank and WHO Malaria Programme in Africa and Madagascar [13 21]. It was a 6-month prospective study comprising two interventions: community participatory WASH action and malaria education campaign. The latter intervention was implemented in both study sites (Fig. 1a). In addition baseline and end-of-study malaria testing was performed among the survey responders (household heads).

The second study was a prospective hospital-based epidemiological study was conducted from 1 January through June 2017; medical records of patients were collected during the 6-month period which was conducted using medical records of patients admitted from 1 January through 30 June 2017 at two randomly selected referral health settings.

Sampling procedure and inclusion criteria

In the main study a two-stage cluster sampling technique was used to randomly select two study sites at the ‘health zone’ and municipality (county) levels as shown in Fig. 1b. Loma county (WASH action site) was randomly selected in Mbanza-Ngungu health zone in the rural town of Mbanza-Ngungu located at 154 km from the capital Kinshasa with an area of 8460 km2. It has a population of 651092. On the other hand Quartier residentiel county (Control site) was randomly selected in Kasangulu health zone in the town of Kasangulu. Located at 33 km from the capital Kinshasa Kasangulu has an area of 4680 km2 and a population of 194190 inhabitants. In DRC a health zone consists of primary operational units of the health system and usually it covers a population of 100000–150000 inhabitants in rural areas and 200000–250000 inhabitants in an urban area [22]. The following criteria were used to select the county where the study should be conducted: (1) having a referral health setting under the supervision of the health zone inspector and (2) the health setting should have a well-handled patients’ records. Hospital-based epidemiological data were collected at each study site to determine malaria incidence.

In the main study all households from the randomly selected study sites having at least three members were eligible. Considering a power of 80% (β = 0.80) for α value of 0.05 we expected to have at least 200 households participate in this research. Within each study site blocks of 50 houses were created; thereafter data collectors have randomly selected every second house on each street in the area of each block. Data collectors were public health nurses and doctors who served under the supervision of one of the authors (WR) who is professor at the Faculty of Medicine University of Kinshasa in DRC.

Additionally only households having at least three members were finally included in the study. In total 625 households (3712 individuals) were surveyed including 316 (50.6%) from the WASH action site and 309 (49.4%) from the Control site.

Surveys and interventions

Surveys were conducted simultaneously at both study sites at baseline and at the end of six-month intervention period following a schedule that was announced to residents by local health zone staff. The French version of malaria indicator survey (MIS) questionnaire was used in this study. It is a validated questionnaire used by the National Malaria Programme of several French speaking African countries to estimate household malaria burden.

MIS comprises an informed consent form and questions related sociodemographic and anthropometric characteristics household characteristics past medical history WASH status malaria preventive measures malaria status and care. All household heads participated in the baseline and post-intervention surveys. Additionally home visits were undertaken by local collaborative research team and Health Zone staff to evaluate WASH status at home and in the living environment and check indoor and outdoor preventive measures used by household members and ascertain consistency of their use. A hand-held GPS GIS device was used to collect data on geospatial localization of mosquito breeding sites; that is to estimate the distance between residences and mosquito breeding sites (grassy area stagnant water spot garbage spot and river side). We assumed that when a residence was located at less than 200 m from a mosquito breeding site household members were considered at high risk for malaria.

Anti-malaria interventions comprised the following actions: (1) community WASH action consisting of a weekly participatory hygiene and sanitation transformation (PHAST) was carried out only in WASH action site in order to clean the residential environment and eliminate mosquito breeding spots; (2) community anti-malaria education. The latter was implemented in both study sites after the baseline survey. Education sessions were organized in communities schools and leaflets that display risk factors and behaviors were being distributed to the participants as well as household heads in each study site. The PHAST approach is a learning methodology commonly used to prevent a broad range of infectious diseases at community level through improvement of hygiene behaviors and sanitation and encourages a better community management of water and sanitation services. In this study PHAST was extended to periodic cleansing of the living environment by local volunteers and community members.

Diagnostic procedure for malaria and geospatial categorization of high risk area

Participants underwent the rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria at baseline and at the end of the study. Blood sample was collected via finger prick into Heparin-coated tube. RDT is a validated diagnostic test for malaria; it has high accuracy for malaria diagnosis; it has the advantages of rapid-detection and it is easy to use and cost-effective. Thus it is useful diagnostic procedure in resource-limited and endemic areas for malaria particularly. It can detect malaria parasite’s specific antigens in the blood: histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP2) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The test allows to diagnose malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum and other Plasmodium species [23]. All participants with a positive RDT at baseline received malaria treatment and were followed for six months.

Regarding the hospital-based epidemiological study only patients admitted to internal medicine and pediatric departments o between 1 January through 30 June 2017 and whose records showed final diagnoses were included; records that showed no diagnosis were excluded. For medical records showing comorbidities the first diagnosis was considered.

In general measures that reduce outdoor and indoor mosquito population are believed to play a crucial role in reducing malaria prevalence especially in malaria endemic countries. Thus during WASH intervention mosquito breeding sites which are considered high risk areas were targeted.

Households living in proximity (distance less than 200 m) to a river still and stagnant water/grassy spots were considered high risk areas for malaria. On the other hand residences located at higher altitude or far from river grassy/stagnant water spots were at lower risk for malaria.

Outcome variables and statistical analysis

Outcome variables were the following: (1) prevalence of positive RDT among responders (2) survey-based self-reported household incident malaria (number of doctor-diagnosed malaria cases in household members at any health setting) and (3) hospital-based malaria incidence from data registered at selected referral hospital at each study site. Data are presented as proportions for categorical variables whereas means and their standard deviations are used for continuous variables. Comparisons within and between study groups were performed using paired t test (for incident malaria incidence cases) and chi-square test (for categorical variables); however for categorical variables with repeated measures (RDT) McNemar’s test was used. All variables that showed a significant or marginally significant association with household malaria in the bivariate logistic regression analysis were subjected to a multivariate analysis model to determine predictors of malaria. Analyses were performed with the use of Stata software version 15.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbm5pbmd0b25iYW5uZXIuY29tL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvcHV0bmV5LXRhbGtzLWFuZC10YWxrcy12aWEtem9vbS9hcnRpY2xlXzRhY2I2YzhjLTdhMjUtMTFlYi1hMzI3LTBmZmI1ZjEzZTE3NS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Putney talks and talks via Zoom | Local News | benningtonbanner.com,"Bennington VT (05201)

The Board of the Mission Neighborhood Centers Inc. (MNC) has announced its new Chief Executive Officer Richard M. Ybarra. The appointment is effective March 1. Ybarra succeeds Santiago “Sam” Ruiz who recently retired after 40 years as CEO.

As one of San Francisco’s original Settlement Houses during the late 1800s MNC continues the same principles embracing the concept of empowerment. For over 60 years the historic organization has focused on the wide range of culturally sensitive multi-ethnic multi-generational community-based services that develops leadership and strengthens families to build strong healthy and vibrant neighborhoods. MNC has been on the forefront tackling issues of displacement of Latinos and other communities of color by collaborating with agencies building multi-use affordable housing.

“Following a rigorous search process we believe we have found someone who is a seasoned nonprofit leader with a long history of working with our communities in California” said Board President Beverly Hayon. “We are certain that he will lead MNC into the future while maintaining a strong connection to our founding cultural roots and a deep commitment to the stability and strength of our current services.”

Richard M. Ybarra of San Diego the new CEO of Mission Neighborhood Centers is slated to take the helm March 1 with over 25 years of experience in MNC’s focus areas of children’s services family services youth services aging and disability services and workforce development.

Ybarra’s extensive experience in each of MNC’s key focus areas – children’s services family services youth services aging and disability services and workforce development – will provide a seamless transition to continue MNC’s work in the community.

“I’m honored and enthusiastic to have the opportunity to lead Mission Neighborhood Centers. As we face challenging times I know we can continue building on the strong foundation that has been established by Mr. Ruiz. I look forward to meeting the community” Ybarra said.

Ybarra brings more than 25 years’ experience to the role. He holds an undergraduate degree from San Diego State University and a master of public administration in state and local government from the John. F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

His past experience includes serving as president of Ybarra Consulting Services and CEO of Community Associations Institute in San Diego.

One of the newest projects that Ybarra will provide leadership for MNC staff to successfully administer is the new “Mission Neighborhood Centers’ Essential Services Hub” in the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood.

Ybarra has worked extensively with low income multicultural communities as well as many of California’s political leaders throughout his career. He worked closely with Cesar Chavez helping advance the farmworkers’ movement.

“We are confident Richard’s experience and background will bring understanding and relevance while complementing MNC’s past present and future” Hayon said. “We are happy to report that Sam Ruiz has offered his support and assistance during this transitional period at MNC. This will ensure a warm welcome and introduction to members of our MNC community.”

One of the newest projects that Ybarra will provide leadership for MNC staff to successfully administer is the new “Mission Neighborhood Centers’ Essential Services Hub” in the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood. A response to the COVID-19 hard-hit Latino community the Mission Neighborhood Centers’ Essential Services Hub is funded by Mayor London Breed’s $28.5 million commitment to support the Latino COVID-19 response and recovery efforts provides critical access to food housing health services and workforce stabilization during the current pandemic.

The MNC hub was launched in December 2020 with a Zoom news conference. During the launch Mayor Breed said of the MNC Essential Services Hub: “This pandemic has had far reaching impacts on people’s lives and it is crucial that trusted community organizations such as Mission Neighborhood Centers are able to meet the increasing demand and provide a lifeline to residents during this difficult time.

“With the city’s targeted COVID-19 response investment this essential services hub will ensure that those most in need are connected to assistance programs such as access to health care and COVID-19 testing financial subsidies for rent and food job placement and training access to food and basic needs to support families in need; like diapers and infant formula. In addition these centers will bridge the digital divide by running learning hubs that will provide full-day in-person programming for youth from economically disadvantaged households as well as those experiencing homelessness or in foster care.”

Although financed with funds from Breed’s $28.5 million commitment for the Latino COVID-19 response all eligible residents of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood will benefit from MNC’s Essential Services Hub community uplifting services.

District 10 Supervisor Shamann Walton part of the December 2020 Zoom news conference along with then MNC CEO Sam Ruiz Mayor Breed and Assemblyman David Chiu said the expansion of the MNC hub is good for the residents of his district.

A response to the COVID-19 hard-hit Latino community the Mission Neighborhood Centers’ Essential Services Hub is funded by Mayor London Breed’s $28.5 million commitment to support the Latino COVID-19 response and recovery efforts.

“The impact of the expansion of Mission Neighborhood Centers’ programs has struck a positive chord in the Bayview Hunters Point Neighborhood. We are excited to launch the first of our essential service hubs in District 10 to help our families get connected to the resources services and emergency support they need while being impacted by COVID-19.”

New MNC CEO Ybarra says he is honored to provide strong leadership in the face of the pandemic and other issues as indicated in recent news reports. “When everyone in society is consumed in an avalanche of epidemics from climate and racial injustice to economic collapse that’s when elected officials look to nonprofits and community groups for answers” said Ybarra. “We will be working with our fellow community leaders in Bayview Hunters Point and across San Francisco to provide solutions.”

In partnership with UCSF and the Department of Public Health the hub will facilitate COVID-19 testing referrals provide support to families testing positive and collaboration on pop up COVID-19 testing sites.

The community uplifting services at the hub will also provide:

Vital financial subsidies: Subsidies are provided to address housing and food insecurities.

Food pantry: Critically needed food grocery store gift cards diapers baby formula wipes and emergency personal protective equipment is provided.

El Grupo Bimbo incrementó sus ingresos un 13.4 por ciento durante 2020 a pesar de la pandemia por la COVID-19 según el informe entregado por la compañía a la Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (BMV).

Los mayores ingresos se registraron en el canal tradicional de ventas es decir las tiendas de abarrotes aseguró Daniel Servitje presidente y director general de Grupo Bimbo en conferencia de prensa con analistas.

“Los canales que se vieron afectados fueron el canal de conveniencia el canal de vending (máquinas expendedoras) el servicio de comidas y el canal mayorista” dijo Daniel Servitje quien agregó que los números de dichos canales continúan por debajo de las cifras pre pandemia pero se ha observado una recuperación gradual.

Grupo Bimbo es la mayor empresa de panificación del mundo (particularmente pan de caja bolletería pan de dulce y pastelitos) con presencia en 33 países en cuatro continentes con 133692 trabajadores y 203 plantas.

El 2020 fue un año excepcional para Bimbo que registró resultados récord y ganancias de participación de mercado los ingresos sumaron 331051 millones de pesos (mdp) -poco más de 16500 millones de dólares a la paridad cambiaria de finales del año pasado- en comparación con el año anterior.

Las ventas netas del cuarto trimestre de 2020 (4T20) aumentaron un 12.4 por ciento lo que representó un ingreso de 84778 mdp según el reporte de la panificadora que se debió a una mezcla de precios favorables y al sólido desempeño de volúmenes en todas las regiones.

La región que destacó por su crecimiento fue Norteamérica al registrar un incremento de ventas del 19.2 por ciento en el 4T20 mientras que las ventas en dólares aumentaron 11.3 por ciento. El ingreso de 44541 mdp fue impulsado por un crecimiento de las categorías con marcas así como en el canal de autoservicios.

Le siguieron las operaciones en Europa Asia y África con un aumento del 17.3 por ciento impulsado por la adquisición de la planta de Cerealto Siro Foods en España a principios de 2020.

En México -un mercado que representa el 31.6% del total de los ingresos de Grupo Bimbo- la venta de bollería pan tortillas pan dulce y botanas en los canales tradicionales y de autoservicio sumaron un ingreso de 26699 mdp durante el 4T20 un incremento de 1.6 por ciento en comparación con el mismo periodo de 2019.

Si bien el negocio ""se vio parcialmente afectado principalmente en los primeros tres meses de 2020 por la pandemia"" la liquidez ""se vio beneficiada desde el tercer mes del 2020 por los cambios en los hábitos de los consumidores a nivel mundial consecuencia de la pandemia y que pueden prolongarse de manera incierta e indefinida"" dice el reporte enviado a la BMV.

""La Compañía modificó su estrategia financiera en los primeros seis meses de 2020 mediante la priorización de la generación y conservación del flujo de efectivo revisó el plan de inversión de capital se redujeron gastos generales y administrativos y se pospusieron ciertos proyectos de reestructura"" añade el reporte.

El desempeño de las ventas así como los precios favorables de materias primas impactaron positivamente en otros indicadores. La Utilidad Bruta Consolidada aumentó 16.1 por ciento durante todo el año con 178443 mdp y una expansión del margen de 120 puntos base indicó el reporte de la BMV. Asimismo la Utilidad de Operación mejoró 24.4 por ciento con respecto al año anterior y generó 25408 mdp a pesar de los gastos relacionados con la protección ante el COVID-19.

La Utilidad antes de ingresos netos financieros impuestos depreciación y amortización (UAFIDA) ajustada del 2020 aumentó 19.3 por ciento el margen se expandió 70 puntos base que se atribuye al sólido desempeño operativo principalmente en Norteamérica EAA y Latinoamérica. Cabe destacar que la UAFIDA considera el efecto de la implementación de la Norma Internacional de Información Financiera 16 (NIIF 16) durante el periodo.

La Utilidad Neta Mayoritaria para 2020 aumentó 44.2 por ciento una expansión de 60 puntos base debido al fuerte desempeño operativo en Bimbo.

“El pasado no es un predictor del futuro”: Servitje

Tras los resultados positivos durante el año pasado Grupo Bimbo planea realizar una inversión cercana a 1000 millones de dólares (mdd) en 2021. La multinacional retrasó proyectos importantes debido a la pandemia por lo que buscará invertir 1000 mdd en un programa Capex enfocado en la renovación de plantas infraestructura informática vehículos eléctricos y energías renovables.

“El pasado no es un predictor del futuro lo que hacemos cada año es ver la visión que teníamos frente a nosotros la oportunidad y alineación con nuestra estrategia” dijo Daniel Servitje cuando se le cuestionó sobre los planes a futuro para la panificadora.

Asimismo Diego Gaxiola director de Finanzas de la empresa agregó que en los últimos años Bimbo ha estado invirtiendo alrededor de 700 millones de dólares por año. En 2020 Grupo Bimbo adquirió una planta de producción en España así como la marca india Modern Foods.

La adquisición de Cerealto Siro Foods una planta de producción en Medina del Campo España permitirá a Bimbo entrar al mercado de pan dulce de marca privada mientras que la compra de Modern Food expandirá la presencia de la panificadora mexicana en India.

Los resultados positivos no acaban para Grupo Bimbo pues el Ethisphere Institute nombró por quinto año consecutivo a Grupo Bimbo como una de “Las Empresas Más Éticas del Mundo” debido a su compromiso con el avance de la integridad empresarial.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbXVuZG8vbm90aWNpYXMtNTYyMjAzNDLSAS9odHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL211bmRvL25vdGljaWFzLTU2MjIwMzQyLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hong Guang Mini: el auto eléctrico de US$4.500 que le planta cara a Tesla en China,"Hong Guang Mini: el auto eléctrico de US$4.500 que le planta cara a Tesla en China

27 febrero 2021

Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Pie de foto El mes pasado las ventas de este automóvil eléctrico en China fueron alrededor del doble de las de Tesla.

En China un vehículo eléctrico económico con un precio de US$4.500 está plantándole cara nada más y nada menos que a Tesla.

El automóvil compacto está resultando un gran éxito para la estatal SAIC Motor el principal fabricante de automóviles de China.

El Hong Guang Mini está siendo fabricado en colaboración con el gigante automotriz estadounidense General Motors (GM).

El mes pasado las ventas de este automóvil eléctrico en China fueron alrededor del doble de las de Tesla cuyos autos son diez veces más caros.

Si bien el Hong Guang Mini de US$4.500 es el modelo más popular hay uno mejorado con aire acondicionado por poco más de US$5.000. Estos coches se comercializan como ""la herramienta de transporte de la gente"".

La sociedad conjunta SAIC-GM-Wuling se conoce en China como Wuling.

Los expertos en automóviles creen que si bien este automóvil está claramente por detrás de Tesla en lo que respecta a su batería alcance y rendimiento su conveniencia y bajo precio lo han convertido en uno de los vehículos de ""nueva energía"" más vendidos en China.

Lanzado el año pasado el modelo básico tiene una velocidad máxima de 100 km/h y puede acomodar hasta cuatro personas.

""El gobierno de China se toma en serio la reducción de la contaminación y convertirse en el líder mundial en la adopción y promoción de la innovación de vehículos eléctricos"" le dijo a la BBC Shaun Rein director gerente del Grupo de Investigación de Mercado de China.

""Creemos en la adopción de vehículos eléctricos económicos como el Hong Guang Mini y de alta de gama alta como NIO y Tesla"".

Para promover los vehículos eléctricos el gobierno chino ofrece placas de matrícula gratuitas. En muchas ciudades chinas puede llevar meses o incluso años obtener una matrícula para un auto de motor de gasolina a través de varios sistemas de subastas.

Plantando cara a Tesla

El Hong Guang Mini registró ventas de 112.000 unidades en la segunda mitad de 2020 ocupando el segundo lugar detrás del Modelo 3 de Tesla que fabrica en su fábrica de Shanghái.

A principios de este mes cinco reguladores chinos convocaron a Tesla para discutir los problemas de calidad y seguridad en su planta. China es el mercado más grande de Tesla después de Estados Unidos.

En enero las ventas de Hong Guang Mini superaron a las de Tesla por casi dos a uno. Ahora se cree que es el segundo modelo eléctrico más vendido en todo el mundo detrás del Modelo 3.

Pero los vehículos eléctricos de alta gama siguen teniendo éxitoy Tesla duplicó su volumen de ventas en China el año pasado.

El Modelo 3 se vende por alrededor de US$39.000 en China gracias a los recortes de precios debido a su producción local.

El Hong Guang Mini podría venderse fuera de China ya que Wuling ha dicho que planea exportar estos vehículos al extranjero.

""China tiene muchos fabricantes de vehículos eléctricos pequeños y baratos sin embargo la mayoría de ellos son productos de baja calidad y baja velocidad que no atraen a un mercado amplio"" dijo Sam Fiorani de Auto Forecast Solutions.

""El Hong Guang Mini es el primer vehículo eléctrico simple que apunta a compradores que buscan un automóvil real"".

Algunas informaciones han vinculado a Wuling con un fabricante de automóviles de Letonia que podría vender una versión del automóvil en Europa. Sin embargo es probable que el precio sea el doble debido a los requisitos medioambientales y de seguridad europeos.

Sin embargo la mayoría comenzó a extremar las medidas de conservación para evitar que se consuman alimentos marinos en mal estado.

Las autoridades sanitarias están realizando visitas de inspección para que el producto se expenda con las condiciones sanitarias suficientes.

Además con el inicio de la cuaresma el pasado miércoles 17 de febrero se comenzó a sentir una mejoría en el nivel de ventas en hasta un 50% de lo que se vendía a principios del año.

Eleazar Medina comerciante mayorista de pescado y mariscos en la zona centro manifestó que las autoridades de la Secretaría de Salud de Guanajuato (SSG) a través de la Jurisdicción Sanitaria realizó en la última semana de febrero visitas a diversos establecimientos para dar recomendaciones parea el traslado y manejo del producto.

Señaló que cualquier variedad de pescado y mariscos deben estar entre los menos 18 grados y los siete grados centígrados para lo cual se tienen congeladores y refrigeradores que pueden lograr esas temperaturas.

Señaló que están coordinados con las autoridades sanitarias durante este Operativo Cuaresma 2021 en donde la Jurisdicción Sanitaria V han realizado estado realizando visitas de inspección.

“Lamentablemente no todos están cumpliendo y ponen en riesgo la salud de los consumidores ya que al no estar un producto bien refrigerado sobre todo cuando son pescado y mariscos se corre el riesgo de que se altere la salud de quien lo consume”  dijo.

Sin embargo Wood Mackenzie proyecta que la compañía solo cumplirá el 61% (42 millones) de ese objetivo de stock para 2030. La falta de una plataforma de vehículos eléctricos (EV) dedicada hasta 2025 es parcialmente responsable. Además es probable que una línea débil actual de BEV en comparación con los PHEV con un enfoque continuo en los PHEV hasta 2023 reduzca las posibles ventas de BEV.

Prachi Mehta analista de investigación senior de Wood Mackenzie dijo: “Para alcanzar sus objetivos de 2030 la participación global de vehículos eléctricos de BMW Group debería aumentar del 2% al 9%. Al mismo tiempo su participación de BEV en todas las ventas debería aumentar del 2% al 60%. Nuestro análisis indica que la empresa no podrá alcanzar estos números tal y como se encuentra actualmente.

“En términos de estrategia BMW Group se está enfocando en reducir los costos de las baterías y asegurar la disponibilidad de la materia prima de las baterías mediante el abastecimiento directo de las minas. También está incursionando en la fabricación de sus propias celdas en su planta piloto de celdas de batería que comenzará a operar en 2022 además de los contratos de suministro de baterías”.

Si bien Europa es la base de BMW Group con el 47% de las ventas totales tiene una presencia significativa en América del Norte y China y ambas regiones representaron un 48% de todas las ventas en 2020.

Según el análisis de Wood Mackenzie Europa seguirá siendo un mercado importante para la empresa a lo largo de la década. Sin embargo las ventas combinadas europeas de BEV y PHEV solo alcanzarán el 41% de todas las ventas de automóviles para 2030 en comparación con su objetivo del 50% para la región. La huella de BMW Group en China seguirá creciendo especialmente en el sector de vehículos eléctricos.

Con la transición energética en marcha la estrategia de la empresa también incorpora objetivos de sostenibilidad muy necesarios.

“El Grupo tiene como objetivo reducir las emisiones de CO2 de la cadena de suministro por vehículo en un 20% con respecto a los niveles de 2019 para 2030. Habrá un mayor enfoque en la sostenibilidad en las operaciones mineras para materiales de batería críticos al trabajar con proveedores y la compra directa de materias primas de origen sostenible. Además la empresa se centra en incorporar más plásticos reciclados en sus coches. Esta estrategia puede aumentar la rentabilidad a largo plazo” agregó Mehta."

VZ,Verizon,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob25lYXJlbmEuY29tL25ld3MvdmVyaXpvbi1zYXlzLXR1cm4tb2ZmLTVnLWlmLXlvdS1oYXZlLWJhdHRlcnktaXNzdWVzX2lkMTMwNDE00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon says that if you're having this issue turn off 5G,"Verizon has been heavily promoting its 5G network even running a new television campaign starring actor Samuel Jackson. Still today on the Verizon Support Twitter feed  the nation's largest carrier tweeted that subscribers having battery life issues should turn on LTE. In other words Verizon is saying to turn of 5G if you need to conserve battery life. While the tweet is no longer available The Verge posted a screen grab of the tweet.







The carrier wrote in the tweet ""Are you noticing that your battery life is draining faster than normal? One way to conserve battery life is to turn on LTE. Just go to Cellular > Cellular Data Options > Voice & Data and tap LTE."" Note how Verizon doesn't actually say to turn off 5G but by turning on LTE you would be effectively shutting 5G off. Ironically if you're using Verizon's nationwide 5G network instead of its Ultra Wideband service you might find your download data speed to be faster with LTE enabled. That's because the Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (which allows 4G LTE and 5G to share spectrum) connects those outside of Verizon's high band mmWave 5G service to low-band 5G. And low-band 5G can deliver download data speeds slower than 4G LTE.









This isn't something that is Verizon's problem alone. Low-band 5G might travel longer distances and penetrate structures better but it hardly delivers the fast data speeds consumers expect from 5G. That is why there is such demand for mid-band spectrum and explains why a record-breaking $81 billion was recently received in bids for C-band spectrum that was auctioned off by the FCC. Verizon spent over $45 billion for 3500 licenses and AT&T paid over $23 billion for 1600 licenses. T-Mobile spent only $9 billion for 162 licenses but that's because the company picked up plenty of mid-band 2.5GHz spectrum with its $26.5 billion acquisition of Sprint.





The mid-band spectrum won at auction includes airwaves in the 3.7GHz-3.98GHz range and it won't be available in many instances until later this year. That means that in some areas Verizon and AT&T subscribers might continue to experience disappointing 5G speeds for the rest of the year. T-Mobile's acquisition of Sprint has already given the nation's second largest carrier a head start in the use of mid-band airwaves for 5G.

In a Sunday morning tweet Verizon support helpfully suggested that “one way to help conserve battery life is to turn on LTE” if users found their batteries were “draining faster than normal.” That step would of course turn off 5G in a phone that has it available. It’s also worth pointing out that you don’t actually “turn on LTE” when doing this step — LTE is always enabled as a fallback for the 5G network. But Verizon is obviously being cautious so as not to actually tell its customers to “turn off 5G”.

Twitter users naturally pointed out that switching to LTE-only would mean turning off 5G (which is available in some newer phones) but the helpful support person said it was important to troubleshoot “steps to find the root cause of any issues with speed” adding that Verizon is “quickly launching more 5G areas and making updates constantly to improve speeds.” Verizon’s nationwide 5G network uses a technology called DSS which in many instances is actually slower than the LTE network it’s trying to replace.

Verizon announced its big 5G plans for 2021 last month after formally launching its next-gen network in October 2020. One of its top priorities is expanding coverage of its ultra-fast mmWave coverage which is currently restricted to parts of some cities in the US. It’s also heavily dependent on how close you are to a Verizon 5G site.

Both Verizon and AT&T spent big bucks in the FCC’s Auction 107 bidding on the C-band spectrum. Verizon spent $45.4 billion— twice as much as AT&T’s $23.4 billion. AT&T’s current nationwide 5G network also relies on DSS with speeds close to or lower than 4G LTE.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2QwMzNiN2NmLTlmOTgtNDI0MC05Y2QwLWYxOTI2ODJhMzM1NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon gambles on sports betting to restore media business,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Here’s how it works

All U.S. carriers have been pushing hard to get people to adopt 5G. After all there's a lot of money in it so everywhere you look someone is ready to tell you about why you should be excited about it. The reality has been much more lackluster.

For example if there's an event about advancements in 5G Verizon is there to talk about its Ultra Wideband network. For a while it boasted the fastest 5G speeds which was because the network was all millimeter wave. That means that you get gigabit speeds but the much harder part is getting a mmWave signal. You need to be in direct line-of-sight with an antenna and even a window or a piece of paper can block it.

Millimeter wave signals can also suck down battery life something that Verizon support commented on on Twitter today. In fact the carrier said that if you want better battery life you can just go ahead and shut off 5G altogether.

Verizon's network isn't exclusive to mmWave anymore as it did launch a sub6 network late last year. While that won't suck down battery life in the same way in many places it's actually slower than 4G LTE. You should be seeing a pattern by now that leads to exactly what Verizon Wireless Customer Support tweeted: all of this is solved by simply turning off 5G and switching back to 4G.

The tweet has unsurprisingly been deleted even though it's not incorrect. It's really more that the message has to continue being that 5G is just the greatest thing ever.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYWpkZWxsaW5nZXIvMjAyMS8wMi8yOC9mZWVsLWxpa2UteW91ci01Zy1uZXR3b3JrLWlzLXNsb3dlci10aGFuLXByb21pc2VkLXlvdS1hcmVudC1pbWFnaW5pbmctaXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Feel Like Your 5G Network Is Slower Than Promised?

But consumers should be careful to read the fine print before applying.

Since 2012 Affirm has offered point-of-sale or installment loans on select retailers' websites including Casper Peloton Walmart and thousands of others. These buy now pay later (BNPL) financing options let customers pay off their purchases at select retailers in monthly installments at times at a 0% interest rate though this depends on the individual and the retailer. They are often advertised as a less expensive alternative to credit cards.

The new Affirm Card takes this system a step further. While all of the details have not been disclosed essentially consumers will be able to link the card to their existing bank account to either pay in full for purchases like a typical debit card or via monthly installments at any retailer online or in-store. Affirm says the installments are interest-free for ""eligible"" purchases but did not specify what those include.

It also has not yet specified what financial firm is issuing the cards.

If the pay-over-time option sounds a lot like a credit card or credit line that's because it acts a lot like one says Ted Rossman an analyst at Bankrate. Affirm is essentially combining a debit card with a financing plan similar to a credit card though notably without credit card protections or rewards points he says.

The main appeal of the debit card is that it will likely streamline the check-out process: Cardholders may be able to use the card for all of their purchases all the time rather than filling out a separate application for every purchase as is the practice now. And some consumers may benefit from the 0% financing Rossman says.

Others may also consider it a more responsible way to take on debt than a credit card Rossman says since the interest rate and the payback cycle are fixed: Consumers know upfront exactly how much they owe when they will owe it and how many payments they will make. Credit card debt on the other hand is open-ended.

""Psychologically it feels better"" says Rossman of taking on debt this way. ""For some people it really works. It just depends on what terms you get.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Berkley Hill rescued 25 dogs and one cat from a puppy mill bust that happen in September.

Officer Berkley Hill has now been awarded the 'Stop Puppy Mills Hero' award by the Humane Society of the United States.

Officer Hill said he remembers the horror the day of the bust and he hopes he never sees such an incident ever again.

""I can still smell the smell. The amount of ammonia in there was so unreal"" Hill described. ""It took my breath. We had to walk out and ventilate the property.""

Officer Hill shared that the conditions the animals were living in were ""horrendous.""

Due to the officer's work the animals rescued that day have found forever-homes.



According to Hill ""It was a total success. We were able to get the animals taken out of the Jumanji of a mess and living style to be living in a house with air conditioning and heat and being loved on and not used for profit.""

Officer Hill refers to himself as an animal lover. He says the true reward is seeing the animals he rescues live happy lives.

""When you take an animal out of a bad situation and put it in a wonderful situation it's just really good to watch that animal blossom.""

Officer Hill encourages everyone to report signs of animal abuse to authorities.

""I've been doing this for 11 years and I fell in love with it. I do it because I love animals. Pets are living creatures and you should provide for them as you should.""

An accomplished water polo family both Anti and son Anton represented their respective countries as Polo Goalies.

The Anti Wave Story:

Founder Anti Kajlich played Polo as Goalie for Czechoslovakia as a young man until defecting from the Communist regime for the United States in 1967 where he studied Chemical Engineering at University of California Berkley gaining a sports scholarship going on to be selected for the ‘All American’ Team as Goalie in 1967. Anti then worked as a Chemical Engineer from 1968-71 continuing to play and coach various teams.

Drawing on his Engineering experience while playing Goalie in US Polo competitions Anti Kajlich saw a market for the production of Polo Goals and produced in his Garage what became the Munich 1972 Olympic model of the Anti Goal.

The rest as they say is history and Anti Wave is now the world premiere aquatic equipment designer and innovator and Anti Wave equipment exported to over 150 Countries since 1972. Today Anti continues to play FINA Masters 70+ Polo with his team winning the Gold Medal in 2014.

Anti’s son Anton Kajlich General Manager of Anti Wave was also a previous national polo player selected for Australian Jnr Team as Goalie continuing to play social polo in his spare time today as well as introducing his own kids to the sport. Anton Kajlich’s comments “The Anti Wave story and company history is based on continual innovation and product develop; we continue that history today with the release of these new products. “

Product Innovation & Availability:

“We continue to extend both our product range and innovations and also our increased product availability and distribution around the world for all clubs and pools to enjoy.”

“The Anti Goal available today as the Anti Pro Goal and SNR/JNR Folding Goal models has undergone continual updates and improvements since its development.”

“The Anti Pro Goal was recently selected for FINA World Cup events Commonwealth Games facility South East Asian Games competition and training facilities and other top national and international events and facilities.” Anton Says

Apart from top national and international facilities the Anti & SNR/JNR Goals can also be found installed at top school and club Polo facilities across Australia and indeed the world. To date the Anti Goal is the longest and best selling Polo Goal in the world exported to over 70 countries since 1972.

Anti Wave’s product range and innovation also sees it as one of the worlds leading producer and key innovator of Swimming Racing Lanes Polo Goals and Starting blocks and also providing a wide range of Innovative Pool Deck Pool Management and Pool programming products.

Global Anti Goal – NEW for 2021 :

The Brisbane Australian based family company continues its long history of aquatics and polo innovation with its 2021 Release of the Global Anti Goal (GAG).

The latest goal in the Anti Wave series is the Innovative FINA-compliant Global Anti Goal (GAG) as installed at Brisbane’s Yeronga Park Memorial Swimming Pool in Australia.

Tested for over two years by top teams at the Polo-strong pool facility the innovative and advanced design is according to Anton “the culmination of 50 years of water polo goals knowledge with every part and every detail invested with careful attention.”

The Global Anti Goal is a Full sized Competition and Training Polo Goal designed and produced in Australia with Premium materials construction and components.

Weighing just 25kg/55/lbs this folding/floating goal can easily be moved in and out of the water by one or two persons and its game-changing functional design will not damage pool tiling as do many current popular Goal models available.

Its light weight has also made the goal easy to air courier door-to-pool from the Anti Wave’s Brisbane Australia factory direct to customers with the goals now exported to 5 countries and growing.

Nicola Johnson FINA Polo Referee (Tokyo Olympic Referee 2020) said of the new goal: “The new Global Anti Goal is the best goal I have seen in over 30 years of water polo it is light weight (one person can put the goal in and out of the pool) it is very durable and I love the training rod along the back of the goal that allows for balls to be stored in the back of the net during training sessions this is such a great inclusion go easy for the GK to reach for a ball when needed.”

John Whitehouse Honorary Secretary of FINA Water Polo Technical Committee 1996-2017) said “Well done team Anti Wave! I don’t know why I would expect anything else! Well done again!”

The Ultimate Swimming Lane has a ‘soft-touch’ finish which makes it particularly appealing for training and learn to swim facilities as well as general aquatics lane division and use.

The lane discs incorporate the Patented & Innovative Anti Wave Lane wave breaking design dispersing the waves along the lane lines and then downwards into the water column for effective and efficient wave dissipation.

After extensive testing under the Australian sun since 2018 the Ultimate Swim Lane has proven a tough and durable option for general lane division standing up well to the tough Australian conditions whilst undergoing testing over the last 2 years in the fierce Australian sun and conditions.

The Ultimate Swimming Lane is currently available in the 110mm dia size which is suitable for most general pool division installations.

New BackStroke Start Ledges:

Anti Wave innovated developed and patented the worlds first Moveable Track-Start Starting Block system included in their 2008 Premium SuperBlock 800 model used in top International Swimming competitions in the same year. The system allowed the swimmer to adjust the position of the rear foot on the starting block to ensure the fastest start times possible. The Moveable Track-Start System is now world competition standard included in various Block models around the world.

Having pioneered high performance Moveable TrackStart systems for Starting Blocks Anti Wave’s investment in research and development over recent years has also seen it launch a range of new and innovative Backstroke Start Ledges.

The Track Start Ledge model attaches to the rear of the TrackStart Wedge via secure 3M Fastener  and the height of the ledge in the water is easily adjusted as per FINA Regulations by movement of the position of the TrackStart Wedge on the blocks.

 and the height of the ledge in the water is easily adjusted as per FINA Regulations by movement of the position of the TrackStart Wedge on the blocks. The Backstroke Handle model suitable for most blocks is fixed onto the front of the Backstroke Handles and the height of the Ledge in the water is adjusted by a durable and easy to use Marine Stayput system with three possible height positions as per current FINA regulations.

Made in Brisbane Australia the Ledges have already been shipped to 10 countries and used at top international events (FINA World Cup Singapore 2019).

Commenting on the ongoing innovation Kajlich (founder) notes “the Munich 1972 Olympics was the most important water polo event for the Anti Wave brand.”

“The water polo goals selected for Munich Olympics which I had patented in 1971 included a difficult to design floating sport structure.”

“And decades later our goals were among the products that we used to fully furnish pool deck at the then Sydney Olympic Aquatic Centre for the 2000 Games and then at Beijing’s Water Cube for the 2008 Olympics.”

The Backstroke Start Ledges (both models) are available for direct order ex AUS from the Anti Wave Webshop at www.anti-wave.com.

Sauter

24/7 Wall Street

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed out a tumultuous 2020 by hitting a record high of over 30600 points. It has since climbed even higher leaving shareholders and analysts wondering how long the market can continue to rise before the next major sell-off.

Though the DJIA comprises only 30 stocks it is often regarded as a gauge of American business and economic prosperity. At the time of this writing the Dow Jones sits at just over 31300 roughly triple its value from a decade ago.

The DJIA is a price-weighted average of 30 large American companies. The index currently contains companies such as the world’s largest retailer Walmart media juggernaut Disney global financial institution J.P. Morgan aerospace and defense giant Boeing and as of 2015 tech behemoth Apple.

The companies comprising the Dow change over time to reflect the changing economy. Since the creator of the index Charles Dow was also the founding editor of The Wall Street Journal editors at the publication select the companies that comprise the index.

GameStop frenzy:GameStop’s saga may be over; its effect on Wall Street isn’t

Since its inception in 1896 when only 12 companies were included in the average the Dow has changed over 50 times. The last remaining company from the original list of 12 General Electric was finally removed in June 2018. It was replaced with drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance.

To determine the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average the year you were born 24/7 Wall St. reviewed daily Dow figures aggregated by economic research website Macrotrends.net. Historical Dow data are inflation-adjusted using annual headline CPI in chained 2018 dollars.

WHITEHALL TWP. Pennsylvania (WPVI) -- Police have made an arrest in the deadly shooting that happened Friday night outside a Walmart in Whitehall Township Lehigh County.

The suspect is identified as Edward Joel Rosario-Jimenez 23 of Whitehall.

He has been charged with criminal homicide attempted criminal homicide and aggravated assault; all felonies of the first degree; and firearm not to be carried without a license a felony of the third degree officials say.

The shooting happened around 7 p.m. on the 2600 block of MacArthur Road in Whitehall Township.

Police said the shooting in the parking lot left one person dead and another injured.

On Sunday the coroner's office identified the victim who died as 20-year-old Nicolette Law of Allentown.

The cause of death is gunshot wound(s) to the body and the manner of death is homicide the coroner's office said.

One female witness told police that she arrived at the Walmart with Rosario-Jimenez and two other people and that Rosario-Jimenez got into an argument with one of the victims.

The witness says she heard gunshots and left in a Toyota but Rosario-Jimenez remained in the parking lot. Another witness told police they saw Rosario-Jimenez fire several gunshots at the victims.

Police say a gun was later found in a snowbank.

Witnesses at the scene said the incident happened very suddenly.

""As I'm walking in I hear like a 'boom boom.' I thought it was a car exhaust or something"" Qusai Muhasen of New Jersey said.

It appeared the Walmart never closed despite the large police presence.

Whitehall Township Police are investigating a shooting Friday at a Lehigh County Walmart that left two people injured.

""As we were coming in the parking lot we saw one of the Whitehall police cars come flying up the main entrance over here near T.J. Maxx and then heading towards Walmart"" said Scott Dias of Upper Macungie. ""Within seconds we saw like more than five or six police cars show up.""

No information has been released concerning the second victim's condition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlaGlnaHZhbGxleWxpdmUuY29tL2FsbGVudG93bi8yMDIxLzAyL3ZpY3RpbS1pZGVudGlmaWVkLWluLWZhdGFsLXdhbG1hcnQtc2hvb3RpbmcuaHRtbNIBcmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlaGlnaHZhbGxleWxpdmUuY29tL2FsbGVudG93bi8yMDIxLzAyL3ZpY3RpbS1pZGVudGlmaWVkLWluLWZhdGFsLXdhbG1hcnQtc2hvb3RpbmcuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Victim in fatal Walmart shooting had aspiration to study nursing uncle says,"Authorities have identified the woman killed in Friday’s shooting outside the Walmart Supercenter as a 20-year-old Allentown woman Nicolette Law.

Law’s cause of death was due to gunfire and it was ruled a homicide the Lehigh County Coroner’s Office said in identifying Law. A full autopsy is scheduled for Monday.

Nathaniel Law II of Georgia Nicolette’s uncle and her mother’s brother told lehighvalleylive.com Sunday he helped raise Nicolette since she was an infant.

She attended Lowndes High School in Valdosta Georgia where she was a member of the school’s marching and competition bands “The Georgia Bridgemen.” Nicolette has a passion for music and served as first-chair clarinet as a freshman.

During her sophomore year of high school Nicolette moved back to Allentown where she graduated from Agora Cyber Charter School. She began working for ManorCare Health Services in Allentown and had plans to study nursing.

“Her personality and spirit were infectious” Nathaniel Law a Philadelphia native said of his niece. “She had a way of making even strangers smile.”

Authorities have identified the woman killed in Friday’s shooting outside the Walmart Supercenter as 20-year-old Nicolette Law of Allentown.

Nathaniel Law said Nicolette was especially close to her biological older sister Sherrel Law of Allentown who was her best friend and treated her more like a daughter than a sister. She also was fond of Nathaniel’s total seven children and stepchildren who were biologically cousins but treated her more like siblings. Her 1-year-old niece Empress was her pride and joy he said.

Nathaniel Law believes Nicolette’s late grandmother Sarah Law was behind her spirit in helping others at the nursing facility he said. In her younger years Nicolette traveled to visit the sick and those who were shut-in with her grandmother to help give Holy Communion he said.

“She was loyal and giving thoughtful and caring” Nathaniel Law said. “She would give her all for those she cared about.”

Nicolette also enjoyed fishing and camping with her uncle. Her favorite holiday was Christmas. She was religious and of the Catholic faith. Her death comes just a few months shy of plans to ring in her 21st birthday Nathaniel Law said.

Aside from Nathaniel and her sister Sherrel Law Nicolette leaves behind her mother Natalie Law of Allentown; stepmother Amie Law of Allentown; and her cousins (like siblings to her): Nathaniel Law III; Alexis Law; Alecia Kaelke; and Santana Law; and step-cousins Karl Rosip and Makai and Makaela Adams.

A candlelight ceremony is planned by family and friends to honor Nicolette’s memory in coming weeks Nathaniel said. Services are being handled by Bachman Kulik & Reinsmith Funeral Homes in Allentown.

Authorities say Edward Joel Rosario-Jimenez 23 of Whitehall Township opened fire in the parking lot of the Walmart 2601 MacArthur Road (Route 145) in Whitehall. Responding officers found two victims shortly before 7 p.m. near a parked vehicle with the engine still running in the parking lot authorities said. Both victims were suffering from gunshot wounds.

Law was taken to Lehigh Valley Hospital-Cedar Crest in Salisbury Township where she was pronounced dead at 7:40 p.m. Friday according to the Lehigh County Coroner’s Office. The second victim remains hospitalized and is currently receiving medical treatment authorities said Sunday.

Investigators were able to review video surveillance footage from the Walmart store showing the victim’s vehicle arriving and parking in an area of the merchandise pick-up lot authorities said. Within a few minutes a black Toyota SUV entered and parked directly in front of the victim’s vehicle.

Several witnesses were interviewed by investigators with one reporting she went to the Walmart parking lot to pick up her child who also is the child of one of the shooting victims. The witness was a passenger in the Toyota along with Rosario-Jimenez and two other people police said.

Rosario-Jimenez then allegedly got into an argument with one of the victims. The witness reported hearing a gunshot and leaving in the Toyota but Rosario-Jimenez allegedly remained in the parking lot.

Another witness reported seeing Rosario-Jimenez fire several gunshots at the victims authorities said. Investigators seized a handgun in a snowbank adjacent to where the shooting happened.

Rosario-Jiminez was arraigned Sunday before District Judge Donna Butler without bail. He was then taken to the Lehigh County jail. He is due back in court for a preliminary hearing tentatively scheduled for noon on March 8 before Butler.

Law’s death is being investigated by the Whitehall Township Police Department the Lehigh County Homicide Task Force and the District Attorney of Lehigh County.

But this is much more than a celebration of 50 years for Magic Kingdom — it’s a celebration of Walt Disney World Resort as a whole!

Back in 2019 during the Disney Parks Experiences and Products panel at the D23 Expo it was announced that there will be a party brought to EACH theme park to commemorate 50 years since Walt Disney World opened — making this Walt Disney World’s biggest celebration yet!

In case you missed it the Disney Resort’s 50th anniversary celebrations will begin on October 1 2021 and will run for a total of 18 months. And these festivities won’t just be happening at Magic Kingdom — they will be happening at all four of the theme parks including Magic Kingdom EPCOT Disney’s Hollywood Studios and Disney’s Animal Kingdom.

So what this means is that no matter which park you visit at the Disney Resort no matter which day you visit you as a Disney World Guest will be celebrating Walt Disney World’s 50th anniversary!

Though not too many details have been revealed quite yet we do know that a special celebration will be coming to each of the four theme parks on Disney World property. Let’s break it down and take a look at what Guests can expect at each of the Disney World theme parks later this year.

Magic Kingdom

Magic Kingdom — the Disney Park that started it all for Walt Disney World Resort. So what will be happening over at this theme park? Well Disney has confirmed that Cinderella Castle the theme park icon of Magic Kingdom will be getting even more magical ahead of the 50th anniversary celebration.

Cinderella Castle recently underwent a makeover in honor of Walt Disney’s Cinderella (1950) celebrating 70 years. Now we can look forward to additional embellishments to be added to the theme park icon which will give Cinderella Castle an even more stunning appearance.

Disney Parks Blog shared:

As part of the celebration Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom Park will add to its royal makeover from last year. As you can see in this new artist rendering the castle will feature golden bunting and a 50th anniversary crest as part of its festive new look. But that’s not all because Cinderella Castle will transform after the sun goes down as well! Disney Parks Blog continued: The castle will add even more magic at night joined by icons at each of the other three theme parks as they transform into Beacons of Magic. […]

Additionally we know that Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse will have custom-made looks featuring “EARidescent” fabric and Cinderella Castle which you can see in the image above. At this time we do not know if they will be decked out in this new attire at all four theme parks or they will only wear commemorative outfits at Magic Kingdom but Inside the Magic will keep you posted as we get information.

EPCOT

Though an opening date has not yet been confirmed Guests are excited for when Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure will open this summer — Just in time for the 50th anniversary celebration.

As for what has been confirmed Guests can look forward to new lights across Spaceship Earth! Disney Parks Blog explained:

And at EPCOT new lights will shine across the reflective panels of Spaceship Earth connecting to one another and resembling stars in a nighttime sky. This permanent new lighting will continue beyond “The World’s Most Magical Celebration” as a defining feature of the park.

The event — dubbed “The World’s Most Magical Celebration” — will begin Oct. 1 the resort announced Feb. 19. Disney World opened to the public Oct. 1 1971.

Expect the castle’s makeover to include more gold decor. The landmark received a paint job that shifted its color scheme to deep blues and light pinks last year.

“The entire castle will shimmer with pearls and jewels and the turrets and towers will be wrapped in iridescent gold and royal blue ­ribbons” said George Adams Walt Disney Imagineering. “Above the castle gate a 50th-­anniversary crest will warmly welcome guests to join the festivities.”

It will not be a repeat of Disney World’s 25th-anniversary celebration which saw the castle transformed into a giant pink cake.

Epcot’s Spaceship Earth Animal Kingdom’s Tree of Life and the Hollywood Tower Hotel at Disney’s Hollywood Studios will be incorporated into the celebration as well.

During Disney World’s celebration the Hollywood Tower Hotel’s lighting will evoke the golden age of imagination and adventure” Disney says.

“At night our four park icons … are going to come to life with a magical iridescent glow covered in pixie dust that we call the beacons of magic” said Dana Carlson associate broadcast producer with Disney Live Entertainment.

Disney renderings show the Hollywood ­Studios building home of Tower of Terror outlined in bright lighting. The Tree of Life will be home to “magical fireflies” Disney said. An artist’s concept shows multiple points of light on the adjoining triangles of Spaceship Earth. The Epcot lighting package will remain after the 50th-anniversary celebration ends Disney said.

Meanwhile Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse will don new costumes for the occasion. The look is described as multi-toned with pops of gold and embroidered impressions of Cinderella Castle backed by fireworks.

Some of the celebration news was announced during a Feb. 19 broadcast of “Good Morning America” which airs on Disney-­owned ABC. A brief segment showed Mickey and Minnie in their new outfits on a float with 50th anniversary theming and Cinderella Castle in the background.

“If there was ever a time that the world needed some pixie dust this is it” Jeff Vahle president of Walt Disney World posted on social media on Feb. 19. He indicated that more information would be given “in the weeks and months ahead as we approach the big day.” The anniversary event will feature “new experiences at the resort’s four theme parks and beyond” a news release said.

The company hadn’t previously revealed much about its golden year. When some major attractions were announced their completion date was presented as “in time for” the 50th celebration but no specific dates were given. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted operations shutting down the resort for about three months in 2020.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1enpmZWVkLmNvbS9rcmlzdGVuaGFycmlzMS9kaXNuZXktbW92aWUtZmFjdHMtc2VjcmV0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,50 Behind-The-Scenes Facts And Secrets From Classic Disney Movies,"36.

Today February 27th is National Strawberry Day and I’ve got a whopper of a magical Disney treat for you!

While my hobby is photography and writing about Disney my wife Theresa’s hobby is figuring out travel deals and getting us to fun destinations. It’s a pretty good match. Back in 2018 and 2019 our family of four plus our good friends Ruston and Jacob visited every single Disney Park in the World! That’s going to be a story for another time but it helped me pull together a special article for you today that I hope you find berry fun (see what I did there?).

When I saw that National Strawberry Day was coming up it got me to thinking I’ve tried a whole bunch of different strawberry treats when I’ve been to Disneyland. I wonder… Have I tried a Strawberry Treat from every Disney Resort in the world?

Going through my massive archive of photos from all our travels I think we have! This is just a small sampling of the many things we’ve tried but some of our favorites have been:

Disneyland Resort – The Dole Pineapple-Strawberry Float with Vanilla Ice Cream and Strawberry Pearls from the Food and Wine Festival at Disney California Adventure

– Two different Strawberry frozen treats available at many of the ice cream carts around the park Disneyland Resort Paris – A Strawberry and Orange drink from Bistro Chez Rémy

Theresa – So which one do you want to make for National Strawberry Day?

Well… One thing you’ll find out about me is that I like to go big. If something is worth doing it’s worth overdoing.

Joe – Let’s make them all!

Luckily Theresa puts up with my craziness and decided to go all in with me. I have been having a blast making all sorts of things from scratch at home. I’m up for the challenge! Let’s get started!

Hong Kong Disneyland – Strawberry Frozen Treats

One thing we ate a lot of at the Hong Kong Disney Resort was Frozen Pops. Everyone is familiar with the Chocolate Mickey Bar but did you know there’s also a Minnie Bar? Made with Strawberry Ice Cream a vanilla bow and coated on the back with chocolate the Minnie Bar is pretty adorable. There’s also a Lots-o’-Huggin’ Bear Sherbet Frozen Treat that is strawberry flavored (naturally).

I’m going to make it my own today and make a Strawberry Sorbet to do double duty and make both frozen treats!

This homemade Strawberry Sorbet is super simple to make.

Ingredients:

1 whole lemon (seeded) 2 cups of sugar Juice of 1 additional lemon 2 cups of strawberries with the tops cut off frozen



Living in Southern California we’re fortunate to have a lemon tree in our yard that keeps us stocked up with fresh lemons year round.

I love to make kitchen time family time. The kids love to help out in the kitchen and I love that they love to do it.

In a food processor add 1 whole lemon yes the peel pith and all and blend with the sugar. After fully blended pour into a bowl.

Add 2 cups of frozen strawberries plus the lemon juice to the food processor and blend it to a puree.

Add lemon and sugar mixture and continue mixing until finely blended.

It wasn’t quite as pulverized as I liked so I used my powerful Vitamix blender to completely destroy any of the chunks. It also had the added benefit of whipping some air into the mixture. That went into an 8″x8″ glass dish lined with parchment paper to freeze overnight.

The next day it was time to cut out my shapes. These Mickey Mouse sandwich cutters are super versatile to making any project a little more Disney-like. The Lotso Frozen Pop has a strawberry outer edge with an internal vanilla ice cream. Using one of my smaller cookie cutters I took out a small circle from the center and filled it with vanilla! I’m turning these Lotso pops into Mickey pops!

Using the same Mickey cookie cutters I made additional Minnie Mouse blanks. Then I used a Bow Cookie cutter to take out a section of the strawberry sorbet.

Then using that same method cut out a piece of vanilla ice cream to fill it!

All this brings back fun memories. Like Ian eating his Lotso treat while being on Ruston’s shoulders. Yikes! I hope it didn’t drip too much!

Making anything chocolate dipped at home is ridiculously simple. You don’t need fancy melting chocolates from the store. My family regularly makes chocolate covered strawberries or other treats and all you need is chocolate chips and shortening.

Ingredients:

1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips 1.5 tsp of shortening



Place chips in microwave safe bowl break the shortening into bits and sprinkle throughout the chocolate. Microwave on High in 30 second increments until it’s all melted. (mine took 90 seconds).

From there you’re good to dip or spread onto your treats! I made sure the Minnie Pops were hard frozen because the warm chocolate is going to cause it to start melting! As soon as they were dipped they went back into the freezer to harden again.

For being made at home I think they looked great but they tasted even better! Theresa said that this was the best strawberry sorbet that she has ever tasted.

Shanghai Disneyland Resort – Mickey Strawberry Napoleon with Powdered Sugar and a Chocolate Mickey Stencil

At Shanghai Disneyland there’s a fantastic pastry shop called Remy’s Patisserie on Main Street that has cases and cases filled with delicious treats. My crew stopped there multiple times during our visit to that park. One of the amazing treats was a Mickey Napoleon with fresh strawberries and a vanilla cream.

To start I needed to make the Vanilla Pastry Cream for my Napoleons.

Vanilla Pastry Cream ingredients:

1 whole egg 2 egg yolks 1/2 cup of sugar 1/4 corn starch 1 tsp of salt 2 cups of whole milk 1 tsp of vanilla extract 4 Tbsp butter cubed



Whisk together 1 whole egg 2 egg yolks 1/2 cup of sugar 1/4 corn starch 1 tsp of salt until it is fluffy and creamy.

Separately in a saucepan bring 2 cups of whole milk to a boil.

I spooned a couple tablespoons of hot milk into my egg mixture while whisking it to temper it and slowly bring the temperature of the eggs up without scrambling them. I continued adding hot milk to the eggs in small increments until it was all combined. That went into a saucepan for 4 minutes to cook.

After letting it cool slightly I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 4 tablespoons of cubed butter and whisked to combine. I passed everything through a sieve to filter out any of the larger bits of cooked egg. That went into a plastic bag which would then go into the fridge to chill.

Puff Pastry is pretty amazing. Taking the advice of one of my favorite TV chefs Alton Brown I bought frozen Puff Pastry instead of trying to make it from scratch. Using those Mickey sandwich cutters from above I followed the instruction on the packaging to thaw the puff pastry dough then pre-cut a few Mickey shapes and baked at 400F.

About 12 minutes later these beautifully puffy pastries were the result!

Should I go the easy route or the harder route for the stencil? I had toyed with the idea of making a simple tri-circle Mickey head but decided to go for the more difficult path. With a hobby knife I cut out my stencil and hoped for the best.

After splitting the puff pastries and filling them with strawberries and vanilla cream I called the kids into the kitchen to help again.

Alright kids I’ve got a super important job for you! These need powdered sugar and a Mickey design.

Alli took care of sprinkling the powdered sugar on top.

Ian your job is one of the most important. This Mickey stencil made of cocoa powder will make it look amazing or make it look like a mess. No pressure.

Ian – Did I do a good job?

Joe – Wow buddy! That looks amazing! You did an outstanding job!

Seriously that turned out better than I could have hoped!

The original is on the left and the recreation is on the right. These were so delicious with the freshly baked pastry homemade vanilla cream and yummy strawberries.

Walt Disney World Resort – Candied Strawberries

I’ve got the kids helping me measure out ingredients for my candied sugar.

For our ingredients we just need

1 cup of sugar 1/2 cup of water 1/4 cup of corn syrup Candy thermometer that’s super important.



After washing and drying my strawberries a grapefruit spoon made quick work of taking off the tops and not taking away too much of the berry.

I shooed the kids out of the kitchen for the next part because I figured it would be best not to have them around boiling sugar. Add all 3 ingredients to a saucepan and stir together. Brush any sugar grains from the walls of the pan into the liquid below. Bring to a boil and do not stir again.

Once it hit 300F the hard crack stage of sugar I knew that when it cooled it would be a crunchy sugar candy.

Theresa helped me out as I ladled the boiling sugar on top of the strawberry skewers.

This stuff cools really fast! By the time I started sprinkling sesame seeds on top many of them had already hardened! That’s why some of these are extra thick because it’s double-coated so I could have another try to get the seeds to stick.

Not bad not bad. Looks pretty close to me! The sugar glaze set up great around these strawberries. They’re going to be tasty and crunchy!

Disneyland Resort – Dole Pineapple Strawberry Float with Vanilla Ice Cream and Strawberry Popping Pearls

For this next recipe and a few others that follow I need a strawberry syrup.

For ingredients we’ll need:

2 cups of strawberries 1/2 cup of sugar 1 cup of water 1 Tbsp of corn starch + 2 Tbsp cool water



Alli helped me measure the strawberries sugar and water into a saucepan. We brought it to a boil and then simmered for 10 minutes. Mix the 1 Tbsp corn starch and 2 Tbsp cool water in a separate bowl.

After 10 minutes I added the extra water and corn starch to thicken things up. Then to make it extra smooth I blended the whole thing in the Vitamix blender and passed it through a sieve.

For the rest of our ingredients we’ve got to use Dole Pineapple Juice. I knew I could buy Strawberry Popping Pearls in bulk but I don’t need that many. Theresa found me this awesome alternative with these Bubble Fruit cups found in the apple sauce section of my local Target.

I separated the strawberry popping pearls from the peaches. Grr I wish they were red. Oh well.

Those clear pearls are hard to see but they’re in there. I added a good bit of our strawberry syrup to the pineapple juice along with a couple good scoops of vanilla ice cream.

This Strawberry drink was one of our favorites at the DCA Food and Wine festival and our homemade version was also delicious!

Disneyland Paris Resort – Strawberry and Orange drink from Bistro Chez Remy

Wait wait wait. I’m in Paris and I’m not making a Strawberry Crêpe? So the truth is I don’t know if you can get a strawberry crêpe in Disneyland Paris. I did see crêpes but the choices were either Nutella or Plain Sugar. Maybe if we would have gone to more sit-down restaurants.

The crêpes in the picture below are from Tokyo Disneyland and I’ve already got something planned for that. So I’m going to have to think of something different for Disneyland Paris.

There were two choices I had. Either a Strawberry Cheesecake Ice Cream that none of us really liked or this Strawberry and Orange drink that we were served at Bistro Chez Remy! This wasn’t even something we ordered! Based on the amount of time we were visiting Disneyland Paris it made sense for 1 of us to buy an Annual Pass. One of the benefits is a free non-alcoholic drink at many table-service restaurants. When we showed our server the AP he brought these drinks out to everyone before the meal.

After adding a straw I took a sip of the bottom layer and it was a ridiculously sweet strawberry syrup. Tasting the orange layer on top afterwards it was almost bitter in comparison. Mixing the two together resulted in a delicious strawberry and orange drink that everyone at the table loved.

To make ours I poured our strawberry syrup that we made earlier into the cup and then poured some orange juice on top. Super simple.

I swear I bought an orange just so I could put a slice on the side of the glass but forgot. Doh. Still looks good though. And tastes good too.

Tokyo Disney Resort – Strawberry Waffle

Waffles are a delicious breakfast option made even better when you have a Mickey waffle iron. I was fortunate enough to be gifted one by a co-worker who knows how much I love Disney.

Using a waffle mix Theresa made a Mickey Waffle. Easy peasy.

She did make whipped cream from scratch to go on top along with some macerated strawberries. For the drizzle Theresa used the vanilla cream from the Napoleons and strawberry syrup we made earlier. Theresa did a great job on the presentation making it look a whole lot like the real thing! In the end it tasted even better than it looked! Everyone enjoyed the strawberry waffle.

Well it has been hours of time in the kitchen getting all this together but seriously this is how family memories are made. I’m remembering the fun times we had in all the parks and now this will be a new entry into those memories of how we made Strawberry Treats from every single Disney Resort in the world!

It’s time to taste everything!

The frozen pops are first up. I didn’t opt for dry ice so these are only as cold as my freezer will go. They’ll last for a few minutes but not much longer than that. Kids and parents alike loved these homemade strawberry sorbet pops. The lemon gives it a tartness that goes really well with the strawberry flavor.

Our two drinks turned out wonderfully. Both were really good.

The strawberry waffles were fantastic. This strawberry syrup is delicious on so many things.

The candied strawberries are a little difficult to eat especially with little mouths. That outer candy shell shatters into hard pieces but is good with that strawberry underneath.

And the strawberry Napoleon with the vanilla cream was so good. It was a really fun thing to recreate.

Wow that was fun! I can’t believe we made a strawberry treat from every Disney Resort in the World!!!

… Aulani

What’s that you said?

… Aulani. You said every Disney Resort in the World. What about Aulani – A Disney Resort & Spa?

Fine.

Aulani – Fresh Strawberries

Fresh Strawberries can be a delicious treat too without anything extra added to them at all. Our family had a fun character breakfast with Minnie Mickey Pluto and Auntie and part of that buffet breakfast included fresh strawberries. Along with all our foods above we enjoyed fresh strawberries too.

With that I’m calling it. What a way to celebrate and remember National Strawberry Day! Good food and good memories.

But while there have been a fair number of mouse-loving visitors who have made their advance park pass reservations had their temperature checked strapped on face masks in the Orlando humidity and flocked to the ""Most Magical Place on Earth"" during the pandemic there are also plenty who have decided that mid-pandemic is not when they want to head to the most popular theme park in the country.

Disney World may have stayed open since July but it's also undergone a litany of rapid changes.

From the elimination of free Magic Bands for resort guests a pause on nighttime fireworks completely altered character interactions and parades an upcoming sunsetting of the free Magical Express Bus and more the next time you visit Disney World may be very different than your most recent pre-pandemic visit.

Change on the surface isn't inherently good nor bad but rather exactly what Walt expected to happen when he said ""Disneyland will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world.""

But with all this change will Disney pixie dust still shine brightly when the carousel of theme park progress has turned as quickly as it has in the last few months?

Here are 11 changes to expect at Disney World in 2021.

New Disney mask requirements for dining areas

Just as dining has changed in day-to-day life so has dining at Disney.

In an update to the previous dining mask policy face coverings for guests ages 2 and up must now ""be worn in all public areas and can only be removed while actively eating or drinking"" per Disney's website. This mandate includes wearing masks while ""standing waiting or sitting in dining locations."" Previously guests had the option of removing masks while seated at tables even if they weren't actively eating or drinking.

In some locations reservations are ""highly recommended"" while in others a reservation is required. To help navigate the various rules and regulations the My Disney Experience app will be your new best friend (sorry Mickey). Cashless or contactless forms of payment are not only accepted but encouraged.

Park-hopping has returned in a new way

Park-hopping -- where you can visit more than one Disney World theme park in a day on one eligible ticket -- was suspended for the rest of 2020 when the park reopened. However park-hopping returned on Jan. 1 2021 though in a changed way.

While you can now once again hop to as many parks as you wish (pending availability) beginning at 2 p.m. each day you must have first visited the park you made a park pass reservation for that day before you can start hopping to other parks in the afternoon. You can call (407) 560-5000 to check the entrance availability of additional parks for that afternoon and evening.

Reservations still required

Speaking of reservations park pass reservations are still required as they have been since July 2020 with no end in sight to that requirement.

This necessitates advance planning as to which park you plan to visit each day especially if you are considering going during a more peak timeframe such as around holidays or special events. For example Oct. 1 2021 is already full at the Magic Kingdom even though that's more than nine months away since that's the date of the park's 50th anniversary.

Magic bands no longer included

For years one of the tangible perks of staying at a true Disney resort was included Magic Bands in the color of your choice for everyone registered to the room. These bands would allow you to tap to pay for purchases around Disney World unlock your room door and serve as your theme park ticket and FastPass.

You can still use Magic Bands but they now cost $14.99 and up each for all Disney guests -- regardless of where you stay. Magic Bands you have from previous trips can be reused but if you want to buy a set for your family of four it'll cost you at least $60 for that privilege.

While this is almost certainly a cost-cutting measure it's also true that Disney is leaning into smartphone technology within the Disney app to complete some of the tasks that it used to relegate to the Magic Band such as opening Disney resort doors.

Free Magical Express Bus will end

Countless Disney trips have started -- and concluded -- on the Magical Express Bus that takes Disney resort guests to and from the Orlando International Airport at no additional charge.

Pre-pandemic you could even have this service magically pick-up and deliver your checked bags to your Disney resort room. But Dec. 31 will mark the end of the line for this service. This is another change that is likely a mix of very real cost-cutting as Disney contracted out this service but it is also a reflection of changing consumer behavior.

While many families loved the (price of the) Magical Express and will be very sad to see it drive off into the sunset if you wanted to squeeze as much time out of your vacation as possible ride-sharing services were already a very enticing option that would almost certainly give you a couple of more hours of legitimate vacation time than relying on the Mickey-wrapped bus.

Extra Magic Hours will be replaced

Remember the days of Extra Magic Hours getting you into a select Disney theme park each morning before non-resort guests or allowing you to stay a little later in the evening? Well that perk has been gone since Disney World reopened -- and it isn't coming back.

This change has a very real upside but it's still an adjustment.

When this perk returns in its new form later this year those staying at Disney resorts will be able to enter all four of the theme parks 30 minutes before non-resort guests every day. This not only aligns with spreading out guests more for safety reasons but it also prevents the Extra Magic park of the day from being unintentionally over-crowded even during non-pandemic times.

Water parks will return

While the four Disney World theme parks have been open since early-July of 2020 the Disney water parks have yet to unlock their gates.

However that is scheduled to change on March 7 when Disney plans to reopen Blizzard Beach. If a look over at Universal's Volcano Bay water park gives any clues face masks are likely not going to be required (for safety reasons) while in the water on waterslides etc. but will be required in some areas of the park such as in retail or dining locations (when not actively eating).

More hotels will reopen -- some with a new look

While many Walt Disney World resort hotels have reopened since last summer following the initial closure some have remained closed.

Dates can change but currently Disney's All-Star Movies Resort is scheduled to reopen on March 22 Disney's Beach Club Resort is scheduled to reopen on May 30 Disney's Wilderness Lodge is scheduled to reopen on June 6 and Disney's Polynesian Village is scheduled to open sometimes during the summer. (Some of those resorts such as the Polynesian do have Disney Vacation Club rooms/villas open at this time just not the hotel rooms.)

Disney's All-Star Sports All-Star Music BoardWalk Inn and Port Orleans remain closed with no scheduled reopening dates.

But when Polynesian Village officially reopens this summer it will do so with a new look with some Moana-inspired theming among other updating. For what it's worth the Polynesian Village Resort is currently accepting reservations for non-DVC rooms beginning in late-July.

Will FastPass return?

FastPass+ which gives riders the ability to skip the bulk of the line has not been available at Disney World since the March closure.

At first it simply wasn't needed as capacity and demand were so low that wait times just weren't a problem and you could easily ride everything in a park before the end of the day. As the number of visitors steadily increased leading up to the 2020 holiday months wait times did grow to the point where FastPass+ would have been a welcome sight in some cases.

However traditional stand-by lines are moving relatively quickly because they aren't alternating with the FastPass+ line. Additionally there would be new challenges introduced into distancing two lines -- the regular line and the FastPass+ line -- that do sometimes virtually touch each other.

(Photo courtesy of Summer Hull)

Our money is on FastPass+ eventually returning in some form perhaps in the latter half of 2021 but likely not in any immediate future until capacity can be safely increased.

It's also very possible that when FastPass+ returns it will look different than it did in the past. Out west in Disneyland that park had an optional paid version of FastPass called MaxPass that cost $20 per day per person. Additionally before the closure those staying at Walt Disney Club Level rooms could purchase additional FastPasses for $50 per person per day. Disney has already been experimenting with a paid model add-on and we would not be surprised to see some optional upsell components when FastPass+ returns.

We also know that Disney is working toward a new Genie app to help guests plan and maximize their park days so it's possible that whatever comes next for FastPass+ will play a role with that technology.

Parades fireworks and more are still out -- for now

For now crowd-creating formal parades and nighttime fireworks shows are still on pause at Disney World. Honestly the much shorter and more spontaneous ""character cavalcades"" that pop up in place of parades really feel preferable to many guests (self-included) but the nighttime shows and live actor shows are missed.

While the precise timeline is anyone's guess there are strong odds that some of these missing elements return in 2021. For example Epcot's upcoming and much-anticipated nighttime Harmonious show is still expected to debut in 2021 and especially since it can likely be viewed from all over Epcot's World Showcase it very well may begin this year.

""Harmonius"" will debut at Epcot as the largest nighttime spectacular ever created for a Disney park (Image courtesy of Disney)

Additionally the popular Festival of the Lion King live actor show at Animal Kingdom will return in the summer (in a modified way) which is great news for those who have been missing some of the shows and offerings that make Disney feel magical.

Also keep in mind that character interactions are still largely suspended but there are several character dining experiences that have reopened albeit in a different way with the character keeping a safe distance from the tables.

There are discounts

While Disney World has altered -- and outright suspended -- some of its operations this isn't the kind of place that will put admission tickets on 50% discount just because some things aren't available. However there are some discounts available now and we expect that trend to continue in 2021 while demand is a bit softer than normal.

Through Sept. 25 most Disney World hotel and ticket packages that are at least four-nights and three park days long are eligible for two extra theme park days. In other words you pay for three theme park days and get five. Those five days must be used within eight days of check-in. This would be a great deal to use if you want to start your trip at a true Disney resort and then spend the last few nights using points off-property somewhere like the new JW Marriott Bonnet Creek or the iconic Swan and Dolphin all bookable with Marriott Bonvoy points.

That way you can make use of those two more park days without spending more cash on a Disney resort stay.

Speaking of Disney resorts you can save up to 35% on select Disney resort stays until April 17 -- and those with a Disney World annual pass can take that savings all the way up to 40%. With those discounts deluxe resorts start at under $300 per night (which is rare for Disney) moderate resorts start around $150 and value resorts can be had for around $100 per night.

So while you aren't going to find a huge discount on Disney World tickets themselves you can find discounts on the resorts and a special that adds some bonus days onto your theme park tickets.

Bottom line

A successful trip to Disney World pretty much always requires significant planning (or the use of a solid Disney vacation planner) but while some things are easier to plan right now in the absence of FastPass+ and with dining reservations only open 60 days in advance instead of the usual 180 there are new complexities to contend with.

Those used to all the perks that used to come with staying at a true Disney resort may also find some of those benefits eroding -- especially when the Magical Express Bus ends on Dec. 31 2021. So is a trip to Disney World still as magical as ever in 2021? It really just depends on what you look for in a trip to the most ""Magical Place on Earth.""

If you are mentally keeping count of the previous traditional Disney offerings that are missing you may find yourself a touch conflicted on whether it was worth it. But if you are looking to enjoy and celebrate what is available then you're more likely still wear to find a smile as big as the drop down on Splash Mountain."

The city is served by two waste collection companies with Republic Services serving the west side of Stockton and Waste Management the east. On Monday both haulers will begin imposing fees on customers for improperly filling their carts.

Residents in Stockton are provided with three carts: organics recycling and trash. Customers who put items not allowed in the carts or fill them too full could be hit with charges ranging between $6.09 to $18.20.

The city says the move is not aimed to be a punitive measure.

""This just allows us to be able to get people to properly separate their materials while also having the materials removed from the curbside"" Grace Smith Stockton's solid waste manager said.

The franchise agreement between the city and the two companies which was renewed last January and will be in effect for 10 years allowed for the haulers to impose surcharges for customers not following waste disposal guidelines Smith said. She called contamination and overfilled carts as a ""long-standing problem.""

Mailers sent out by both Waste Management and Republic Services in the last month or so informed customers that the charges would go into effect after three incidents of overage and/or contamination within three months. Continued violation could also lead to a customer receiving a larger bin or face an increased rate to accommodate excess waste and contaminates.

Excess waste includes leaving trash recycling or organics directly on the curbside or bins being so full that the lid doesn't close all the way. Contamination includes things like putting items in the wrong carts such as throwing trash in with the recycling.

Molly Gomez the municipal manager for Republic Services in Stockton says the company has seen an ongoing increase of contaminations. She said this is an opportunity.

""We're seeing an increase amount of contaminations on a daily basis"" Gomez said. ""So we're using this opportunity to educate the public on how to properly utilize the recycle and organics carts.""

One misconception Gomez says is that plastic bags can be placed in with the recycling.

""They get caught up in the machinery causing delays and damage to the equipment"" Gomez said. ""The bags also contaminate the bales of clean recyclables with nonrecyclables.""

Bales that are found to be contaminated also can't be recycled and are then sent to the landfill Gomez said. That's why helping to educate the public is the main goal she said.

Paul Rosynsky senior communications specialist for Waste Management said that plastic bags make up about 80% to 85% of contamination.

""A lot of people are just putting their recycling in a trash bag or in a plastic bag and then putting that whole bag in the recycling cart"" Rosynsky said. ""We can't stress enough that you should not be doing that that you need to keep your recycling loose in the cart — loose and dry.""

Rosynsky also said that tightening recycling restrictions on contaminants both from the state and internationally have made it more vital for customers to be vigilant about what items they throw into what bin.

Both Waste Management and Republic Services provide online general guidance regarding what waste can and should go into each cart. The companies have also partnered with the city with a more detailed and area-specific list of dos and don'ts for recycling green waste and what should ultimately end up at a landfill called StocktonRecycles.com. It also allows you to search the site by typing in what item you're looking to dispose of as well as provides some ideas for reuse.

The companies and the city say the new surcharges aren't meant hassle customers about minimal violations such as someone's neighbor throwing a bag of dog poop in their recycling cart.

""We're not checking for those little objects like that"" Rosynsky said. ""We're looking for gross contamination.""

Organics and recycling carts which are the main focus for contaminants have contamination thresholds of 3% and 10% respectively to incur surcharges for violations Smith said.

Haulers must also provide evidence to customers of violations Smith said such as documentation photos or video. Republic Services says it is using auditors to randomly check customers carts while Waste Management has installed cameras on their trucks that will be reviewed by auditors.

The companies can notify customers of a violation in a variety of ways such as electronically via email or text message and by leaving notification tags on carts Smith said.

""In all instances the customer receives a letter regarding the service' Smith said.

Both companies also have apps that can be downloaded that customers can use to receive alerts and manage their accounts.

Customers can report to the companies if they believe they have been improperly cited for a violations such as a cart being identified with the wrong address or someone else illegally dumping trash in someone else's carts.

""It's a huge concern of customers but It's not something that we see happening regularly at all"" Rosynsky said.

Residents can also report problems to the city but Smith said they should start with speaking to the companies themselves. She also noted that if needed additional carts can be provided at a reduced or no cost.

""We do recognize the fact that nobody is perfect there's always going to be some level of contamination"" Smith said.

By: Edda Pujadas

Although the solid waste processing plant located on NW97th Avenue in Doral is supposed to be built with the most up-to-date systems to control emissions generated during the treatment of garbage the city’s residents insist on their concern for our environment.

It is for this reason that Digna Cabral Councilwoman for the City of Doral held a meeting with the director of the Miami-Dade’s Solid Waste Management Department Michael Fernandez to discuss and analyze the actions that could be taken so the processing of garbage stops being a problem for those that work and live in Doral.

It is important to take into consideration that each of the residents of Miami Dade County generates an average of 2000 pounds of garbage per year therefore the first thing that comes to mind is what could we do with these residues if the landfills and solid waste processing plants do not exist?

For example the Waste Management plant in Doral managed by Covanta Dade Renewable Energy Ltd and whose facility is owned by Miami Dade County receives more than a million tons of garbage per year. This garbage is treated through a combustion process that manages to reduce it in 90% and turns it into ashes.

These ashes are one of the issues that Councilwoman Cabral commented on during the meeting. She stated that these ashes remain in the environment and can even be seen in common areas and on the roofs of the communities to the North of the City of Doral. Even when these are cleaned frequently they get quickly filled with ashes again.

“Today I speak as Councilwoman representing the concerns of the residents of Doral but also as a resident myself because I also feel affected by the operations of the plant especially with regard to the odors and the ashes which tend to intensify during the weekends” said Digna Cabral.

Cabral pointed out that she understands the importance of the plant’s operations but that in the face of the imminent renewal of the contract between Miami-Dade County and Covanta Dade Renewable Energy Ltd in the year 2023 she thinks it is essential to consider the implications this has for the residents of Doral.

“I believe that the possibility of moving the plant outside of the residential area of the City of Doral must be taken into consideration. There are some pieces of land close to the Turnpike that might be considered. I believe that it would be more useful for the County to invest in moving the plant than in making updates or improvements to the existing facilities.”

The City of Doral Councilwoman who has expressed a special concern for the environmental problem that the processing of this garbage generates also told the director of the

Miami Dade’s Solid Waste Management Department of her curiosity to know which are the investments that will be made in the plant to mitigate the environmental impact and the benefits that these will bring to the residents workers and visitors of Doral.

She recalled that recently an agreement was reached with Waste Management the company that manages the facilities of the landfill in the nearby city of Medley. The agreement verses over the reduction of the emission of odors and the mitigation of the environmental impact: “in the next days we will follow up on the compliance of the agreed actions.”

On his side Michael Fernandez positively highlighted the importance of this meeting and referenced the importance of the work that this plant conducts for benefit of the whole community. “Covanta does not only get rid of the garbage that is generated by the residents of Miami Dade County but it also turns it into energy. The residues are recycled and transformed into 77 megawatts of electricity 24 hours a day seven days a week enough electricity to power 29000 homes during a whole year.”

The Director of the Miami Dade Solid Waste Management Department explains that Covanta also collects 20000 tons of metal per year enough metal to build 13000 automobiles. Regarding the ashes he explained that these are being used as raw material in the construction field.

“Garbage has to go somewhere and moving the plant is not an easy or unilateral decision. The environmental operative and economic implications of a different location must be evaluated” comments Fernandez. He also indicated that apart from keeping the garbage outside of the landfills they are committed to guaranteeing safe operations and minimizing environmental impacts.

When considering the environmental implications it is important to understand that less residues in landfills reduce greenhouse emissions by 870000 tons of CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) which is the equivalent of taking 123000 automobiles off of the road.

In Covanta garbage is discharged via a hermetical process. The facility has an automated gate system that opens allowing the trucks to come in. It is not until the gates close that the discharge of garbage is initiated. They also have equipment that suctions air and absorbs the air during the garbage burning process as well as a specialized system to control the odor.

While highlighting the importance of the operation of Covanta in Doral Fernandez stated that this facility complies with all the legal and environmental requirements at the local state and federal level.

When President Joe Biden made environmental protection a key element of his campaign he promised to overhaul the federal office that investigates complaints from people in minority communities who believe they have been unfairly harmed by industrial pollution or waste disposal.

Although the Environmental Protection Agency acknowledges that disadvantaged communities in America are disproportionately affected by pollution hundreds of complaints sent to its civil rights office since the mid-1990s have only once resulted in a formal finding of discrimination.

The situation has provoked criticism from the U.S. Civil Rights Commission the EPA’s own Office of Inspector General and citizens who have filed complaints that sometimes languished for years — or decades.

Under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act states cities and other entities that receive federal funds are prohibited from discriminating because of race color or national origin. That means citizens bearing the brunt of industrial pollution can bring a complaint if federal money is tied to the project.

In Uniontown Alabama — a mainly Black town of 2200 — residents complained to the EPA in 2013 about the Alabama Department of Environmental Management’s oversight of a huge landfill containing 4 million tons of coal ash that residents blame for respiratory kidney and other ailments. Five years later the EPA dismissed the complaint saying residents hadn’t proven the landfill caused their health problems.

The U.S. Civil Rights Commission called the dismissal of the Uniontown complaint “another distressing step in the wrong direction” by the EPA office.

The outcome was typical. In three decades of fielding complaints EPA’s civil rights office has almost never found pollution was adversely affecting human health. And without such a finding the agency won’t even consider whether illegal discrimination occurred.

Marianne Engleman-Lado who was recently appointed by the Biden administration to the EPA’s office of general counsel had helped Uniontown residents with their case. She maintains the way the EPA evaluates such complaints makes it nearly impossible to prevail because proving with scientific certainty that pollution is causing disease is a nearly insurmountable obstacle.

Ben Eaton a Perry County Commissioner involved in the Uniontown complaint said attorneys warned that discrimination claims usually go nowhere but residents felt their evidence — including photos and videos — was compelling. “What’s the use of having these agencies” he said “if they’re not going to do the job?”

Residents of a predominantly Black and Latino community in Oakland California were similarly disappointed with results of their civil rights complaint over air pollution from ships and truck traffic at the busy Port of Oakland.

Margaret Gordon a co-founder of the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project said her group did not have a seat at the table when EPA hammered out an informal resolution with the port. Air pollution is still a problem she said although port officials are now more willing to listen to community members.

Lilian Sotolongo Dorka who heads the EPAs office of external civil rights enforcement touted the 2019 Oakland resolution as an “extremely effective” example of the difference her office is making in people’s lives.

But Richard Grow who worked at EPA for 40 years before retiring in 2019 and was one of the agency’s negotiators agrees with Gordon’s assessment.

“We put forth a number of very practical ... solutions and recommendations and they just said ‘No’” Grow said. When he reported the port’s and city’s position to Dorka’s office he said he was told nothing could be done.

The office had no further comment and the port issued a statement saying it is committed to continuing a dialogue with the community.

The EPA has the power to withdraw funding from groups that discriminate although it has never used that power. Dorka defends her office’s record saying it has eliminated a chronic backlog of complaints.

“I disagree very significantly with the conclusion that you can judge our civil rights program by the number of formal findings (of discrimination) we’ve made” she said noting the office is required by regulation to seek informal resolutions wherever possible.

U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) is among those who think EPA’s civil rights office should do more. During confirmation hearings this month for Michael Regan Biden’s nominee for EPA administrator Booker spoke of meeting Alabama citizens suffering from tropical diseases they attribute to sewage pollution children with elevated lead levels in his own state and families in Louisiana’s so-called “cancer alley” who felt abandoned by their government.

The EPA’s civil rights office “has been eviscerated over the years” the African-American senator told Regan. “You’re not even equipped in my opinion to actually begin to fight against these issues that affect millions of Americans.”

Regan promised to make environmental justice a top priority including “restructuring and reorganizing” the office of civil rights which has 12 fulltime employees. “We will need additional resources. ...” he said.

Critics concede that Dorka who took over the office of external civil rights under President Barak Obama has made some progress including producing a case resolution manual to guide investigations.

Obama’s last day in office marked the only time Dorka’s office issued a formal finding of discrimination — in a complaint filed 25 years earlier over the Genesee Power Plant outside Flint Michigan. The agency dismissed allegations that the plant’s emissions hurt Black residents finding insufficient evidence of harm to their health. However the EPA did find residents were not given a fair opportunity to participate in the permitting process.

Dorka said progress has continued under the Trump administration.

EPA spokeswoman Lindsay Hamilton said that “The new leadership team will be working closely with career colleagues ... as well as receiving input from stakeholder groups in an effort to bolster the agency’s capabilities to deliver on our environmental justice and civil rights missions.”

Environmental justice advocates say the changes need to be significant.

“There are still places where people don’t have access to safe drinking water where they live in close proximity to hazardous sources” said Vernice Miller-Travis a longtime advocate and cofounder of WE ACT for Environmental Justice. “This could be a moment of real sea change in terms of how the EPA is not just paying lip service to civil rights.”

Some banks are offering their staff lab-based PCR tests which are considered the most accurate way of detecting coronavirus but they can cost around $100 to process per The New York Times. Results of PCR tests usually come back within a couple of days.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Other banks are providing antigen tests also known as lateral flow tests which give results in about 15 to 30 minutes. Both antigen and PCR tests require swabbing the nose or throat.

""I have been back at work since the start of the year and have been asked to produce three negative test results every week"" a source who works in a bank in London told Insider on the condition of anonymity. ""It's a bit stressful but the antigen tests are quick and I have got into a nice routine now. It's also nice to be able to go back to work although I miss the pre-COVID office environment"" they said.

However a number of other banks are asking employees to fill out questionnaires about possible symptoms and exposure to the virus before they come into the workplace.

Insider spoke with sources working in banks across the world to get a sense of return-to-work plans.

Deutsche Bank

Twice a week Deutsche Bank is testing UK employees considered key workers that work on the busiest floors in the office sources familiar with the system said. They are being tested with PCR tests. It's unclear whether staff working on other floors are being also tested.

Deutsche Bank declined to comment to Insider.

Bank of America

Bank of America is testing employees on a weekly basis if they're coming into the office according to sources familiar with the matter. The testing is currently targeted at UK offices and there are plans to roll out the tests to the rest of Europe the Middle East and Africa region.

JPMorgan

JPMorgan told Insider that employees coming into the workplace in all locations are required to take a daily health check before entering an office. The health check is a survey that can be completed via mobile or laptop and asks if you've been exposed or in close contact with someone who is infected with COVID-19 or showing related symptoms.

The bank said the daily health checks had been in place since the pandemic began in March.

On top of this JPMorgan is also sending at-home testing kits to staff if they want one. Employees are also able to book a PCR COVID-19 test at one of the bank's on-site health and wellness centers.

Wells Fargo

A Wells Fargo spokesperson confirmed to Insider that all workers who go into the bank are required to complete a self-screening assessment which involves filling out a questionnaire about whether they have symptoms or have been exposed to COVID-19. They must complete this every day before entering the workplace the spokesperson said.

In its largest US locations the bank has an on-site nurse to check staff for COVID-19 symptoms and refer them for testing.

Credit Suisse

Sources familiar with the situation at Swiss bank Credit Suisse said it is offering its staff in London weekly testing despite only a small number of them coming into the workplace. Credit Suisse declined to comment.

Citibank and Barclays could not be reached for comment. HSBC didn't respond to Insider's request for comment.

Jack Gaukel left Wells Fargo Arena three years in a row with the bitter taste of a runner-up finish.

This year however Gaukel came out with his hand raised as the 2A 152-pound champion.

The senior from Sergeant Bluff-Luton left it all on the mat. He secured the win with a 10-2 major decision over Winterset’s Tyler Brown.

Unlike past years of anxiousness and nerves prior to his matches Gaukel felt relaxed and went into each match with a “let’s just wrestle” mindset.

“The last three years I would say that I was extremely anxious to get out there and anxious to start the match. But this year it was very strange. The whole day I was super relaxed and calm and and not really stressing out about too much of anything” Gaukel said. “Then five minutes before my match I started to get just more and more excited and just kind of ready to go. I put on the best performance that I possibly could.”

How did Gaukel reach a point of just trusting his craft? He credits his coaches and the Lord.

“They didn’t put any pressure on any match whether it was the duel in the beginning of the year or you know a bigger matchup that I had in January or you know whether it was the state finals they just basically preached to me to go wrestle offensively and do my thing. Just let it fly and wrestle free” Gaukel said. “That was the same message every single match every single practice. I think looking back that made a huge difference because it just basically cleared my mind of everything else.”

Gaukel will close that chapter and prepare to start his new one. He committed to Iowa State in November of 2020.

The decision to join Kevin Dresser came easy for Gaukel when considering his options.

It became clear when he walked into a practice and saw firsthand the culture this program offered.

“I felt at home the whole time that I got to be there. Meeting Coach Dresser he’s a very very straight shooter. He’s gonna tell you exactly what he feels and I really like that about him. Coach Metcalf is definitely a guy that I looked up to when I was little. I mean when I was eight years old he was kind of at that his high point and he was definitely a guy that I wanted to wrestle like and compete like so it was really cool meeting him” Gaukel said. “It also felt like I could go up to anybody and have a conversation immediately. You know it was unlike other programs. I would say that was the big selling point.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5jYWEuY29tL2xpdmUtdXBkYXRlcy93cmVzdGxpbmcvZDEvY29sbGVnZS13cmVzdGxpbmctbmMtc3RhdGUtd2lucy10aGlyZC1jb25zZWN1dGl2ZS1hY2MtdGVhbS10aXRsZS1maXZlLWNoYW1wc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,N.C.

Micron Technology (MU -0.77%) and Western Digital (WDC -1.53%) are both major players in the memory and data storage market. Micron mainly sells DRAM and NAND (flash) memory chips while WD produces NAND chips flash-based SSDs (solid-state drives) and traditional platter-based HDDs (hard disk drives).

Both companies struggled with declining memory chip prices throughout 2019 as sluggish shipments to smartphone and PC makers caused a global glut of chips. DRAM and NAND prices gradually stabilized in 2020 but that recovery was throttled by pandemic-related disruptions in the first half of the year.

However investors have been much more bullish on Micron than WD over the past 12 months. Micron's stock price rallied more than 50% as its memory chip sales improved while WD's stock price remained nearly flat as its weak HDD business largely offset the growth of its NAND business. Will Micron remain a stronger investment than WD throughout the rest of the year?

The key differences between Micron and WD

Micron generated 70% of its revenue from DRAM chips another 27% from NAND chips and the rest from other types of memory last quarter. That business model makes it the only ""pure play"" on memory chips in the U.S. market.

WD which significantly expanded its NAND business by acquiring SanDisk in 2016 generated 52% of its revenue from flash products last quarter. The remaining 48% came from its legacy HDD business.

WD's HDD business has been shrinking as more PC makers have shifted to SSDs which are pricier but also smaller faster more power-efficient and less prone to damage than platter-based drives. It's trying to counter that secular shift by selling higher-capacity HDDs to enterprise and data center customers but the segment's revenue and margin will likely continue to decline for the foreseeable future.

WD and Micron rank third and fifth respectively in the global NAND market according to TrendForce's latest numbers. Samsung and Kioxia (formerly known as Toshiba Memory) rank first and second respectively and SK Hynix ranks fourth. However SK Hynix will likely jump to third place after it closes its forthcoming takeover of Intel's (INTC -0.94%) NAND business.

In the HDD market WD shares a near-duopoly with Seagate Technology (STX) which hasn't aggressively followed its lead into the NAND market yet.

Which company is growing faster?

Micron's revenue declined 8% to $21.4 billion in fiscal 2020 which ended last September as it grappled with low DRAM and NAND prices in the first half of the year. But its revenue rose in the second half of the year thanks to rising sales of PCs during the pandemic the production of new 5G smartphones and gaming consoles and robust orders from data center customers.

Those accelerating tailwinds boosted its revenue and adjusted earnings by 12% and 63% respectively in the first quarter of 2021. Its DRAM revenue jumped 17% year over year and its NAND revenue grew 11%.

Micron expects DRAM and NAND prices to rise throughout 2021. Based on these catalysts analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 17% and 47% respectively for the full year -- which are impressive growth rates for a stock that trades at just 11 times forward earnings.

Western Digital's revenue rose 1% to $16.7 billion in fiscal 2020 which ended last July. However its adjusted earnings plunged 37% as weak NAND prices crushed the flash unit's margins and its HDD margins continued to contract.

WD's fortunes didn't improve in the first half of fiscal 2021. Its revenue dipped 5% year over year to $7.9 billion during those six months as its weak HDD business offset its rebounding flash revenue.

WD's HDD business struggled as weak demand from data center customers offset stronger demand from PC makers during the pandemic. The HDD segment's declining margins also partly offset its expanding flash margins.

However WD's adjusted earnings still rose 40% thanks to lower spending during the pandemic and an easy year-over-year comparison to the first half of 2020. Unfortunately analysts expect its revenue and earnings to both decline about 4% for the full year before turning positive again in fiscal 2022.

WD's stock also trades at 11 times forward earnings but it deserves that discount valuation a lot more than Micron. It also suspended its dividend last May and probably won't reinstate those payments anytime soon. Micron hasn't paid a dividend since the 1990s.

The winner: Micron

I recently said Western Digital was a better investment than Intel since it has a clearer path to a turnaround than the struggling CPU maker.

But WD definitely isn't a better buy than Micron which is recovering at a faster rate while trading at the same forward P/E ratio. Micron isn't as diversified as WD but its streamlined exposure to the DRAM and NAND markets along with its lack of a legacy HDD business clearly make it a better overall investment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vc2NvcmluZ2xpdmUuY29tL3N0b3J5LnBocD9zdG9yeWlkPTE4MTc00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rebels off to hot start thanks in part to Capllonch Oliveira,"UNLV Photo Services View image 1 of 1

The UNLV women's volleyball team is off to a hot start this spring and a pair of sophomores from Hawaii can be found right in the thick of it.

Outside hitter Shelby Capllonch and libero/defensive specialist Paris Oliveira a couple of 2019 graduates from Damien and Kamehameha respectively have been a big part of the early-season success for the Rebels who are 4-0 for the first time since the 2016 season and for just the fifth time in program history.

""I think everyone is very excited about how we've started out and it's been a lot of fun"" said Capllonch via video call Friday morning.

Capllonch the Interscholastic League of Honolulu Division II Player of the Year in 2018 when she was also a First Team All-Hawaii selection has started all four matches this season and ranks second on the team in kills (45) and kills per set (3.21). She leads UNLV in digs (64) and digs per set (4.57).

The Rebels are back in Las Vegas this week after a pair of key wins over Colorado State over the weekend. UNLV swept the Rams in straight sets Thursday and won in four sets in the rematch Saturday.

For the seventh consecutive year CSU was picked to win the Mountain West Conference in a preseason coaches poll — just two points ahead of UNLV.

""I'm pretty sure a lot of us were upset about it at the time but I mean it drove us to even want to beat them more at their hometown which we accomplished"" said Oliveira who totaled 33 digs and 10 set assists in the two matches including a 25-dig effort in Saturday's victory.

Capllonch amassed 27 digs to go with 14 kills Saturday for her fourth double-double this season. She had team-highs of 11 kills and 12 digs Thursday when she hit .375 for the match.

On Monday Capllonch was recognized as Mountain West Conference Defensive Player of the Week.

Congratulations 👏 to Shelby Capllonch on being named the @MW_OlySports Defensive Player of the Week. The sophomore OH had a pair of double-doubles & led the Rebels with 39 digs in the season sweep of Colorado State. 📄: https://t.co/EYFXtm8AoJ#BEaREBEL | #MWVB pic.twitter.com/J74nCazry6 — UNLV Volleyball (@UNLVvball) February 22 2021

""I was really surprised actually. Usually in the game I don't really know how many digs or kills that I have I'm just there and just focusing on the next play the next ball where is it going. All I know is that that Colorado State game I just put my heart out there and I just wanted to play. I didn't really care if I got anything — I'm happy I did but I didn't care if I did — but it was nice having some recognition."" said Capllonch who was in the athletic training room at the time that she got word of the award. ""I just remember being super excited to see it and immediately calling my mom and she was probably more excited than I was.""

Capllonch also received a MWC Offensive Player of the Week honor during her freshman season.

""I'm always happy for my teammates regardless if she's from Hawaii or not but especially playing with her for so long"" Oliveira said of Capllonch her teammate from their days with both the Manoa Beach and Aloha State club teams. ""I've supported her been through all of it I'm super happy for her and she deserves it so it was a good thing for sure.""

Oliveira who ranks second on the team in both digs (61) and digs per set (4.36) and has a team-best 96.3 percent success rate in serve-receive noted that she and Capllonch are almost always on the same page on the court especially when it comes to defense.

""We just know sometimes that we just turn to each other and we don't have to say anything we're just like ‘Yup. Got it. K' but yeah it's been definitely helpful"" Oliveira laughed.

Capllonch agreed in full.

""It's kind of funny when we play defense next to each other or when we're passing next to each other we don't talk. We just know who's getting what and we know what's going to happen the next play but when we're by other people that we don't usually pass by we're like ‘OK what do you have? What do I have?' like all this stuff so it's kind of funny"" Capllonch explained.

The pair have been club teammates since they were high school sophomores although they never got to team-up or face-off during their prep days. Oliveira's Kamehameha team is a perennial contender for the Division I state title while Damien was still a year away from its first D2 state championship when Capllonch completed her four-year run at the school.

""Mine was probably very different from Paris's"" Capllonch laughed when asked about her high school experience. ""Damien is definitely smaller (than Kamehameha) I definitely had way less kids in my classes than Paris did but I feel like it was fun. Damien was very serious when it came to volleyball because we were always just trying to go for that championship but in the classroom it was nice getting to know everyone and knowing everyone meant supporting each other — like people would go to robotics competitions and cheer them on and then the robotics team would come to volleyball games and cheer us on — and it was just nice for that those little relationships to have.""

Oliveira a three-year varsity player for the Warriors who received All-Hawaii Honorable Mention as a senior expressed appreciation for the opportunity she had to attend Kamehameha and play for highly-successful program.

""I'm really grateful for the resources that my school had because it made the transition from high school to college volleyball a little easier but it was a great experience. I learned a lot since sophomore year being on the varsity team and learning from the upperclassmen. They always taught us to work hard and we had goals for our team then to win the D1 volleyball championship then and it was a great experience. I definitely have a lot of great memories looking back on it now"" Oliveira said.

She added that some of the most important lessons she's learned through sports came from her time at Kamehameha.

""Being flexible and learning how to work as a team work with others and cooperate — it's not always going to be about you and you're going to have to make sacrifices to accommodate with others — and I think just being flexible and adaptable is always super important and putting other people's needs before yours and thinking about the bigger picture rather than just solely on yourself"" Oliveira said.

Capllonch a three-time All-Hawaii selection echoed much the same sentiment about what she gained from her time as a student-athlete for the Monarchs.

""That is probably like the main thing right there but also I feel like in Hawaii they always teach you to play with your heart play with everything you've got and that's something that really helped me here at UNLV like putting it all on the court and leaving it there and giving a hundred percent of what you have left doing what you need to do to win the game"" she said.

That's the same spirit that the pair have brought to the Rebels — and it comes out in the way they play defense.

""When I talk to our teammates they are like ‘You guys just lay out for everything' "" Capllonch said. ""I'm pretty sure me and Paris together have like 20 cuts on our hands and arms from just diving on the floor court-burns all this stuff. We just don't like the satisfaction of the ball hitting the floor especially when it's in our zone so we always try to go for it but that's like every Hawaii player.""

Oliveira offered an explanation.

""I think that we were just always trained to give it our all and just the effort you put out there to get a ball up off of the floor it's a big thing. I think that coaches knowing that we are usually the underdogs as the shorter players compared to mainland girls they teach us from a young age that it's going to have to be solely focused on defense and getting the ball up and off the floor and I think that's something that Hawaii girls have a lot in common and it's definitely a thing to be proud of"" said Oliveira who at 5 feet 7 inches tall stands just an inch shorter than Capllonch.

""I'm very small for my position. I'm a 5-8 outside hitter and the girls I go up against are like 6-3 6-4 but I just want to show Hawaii girls that they can do it because I feel like when we're raised we're raised to be (liberos) in college"" Capllonch explained. ""We weren't raised to be outsides or middles in college it was just like libs all the way so it's nice having them look up to us and think that they can do more than they think they can.""

But the job is far from over. Capllonch Oliveira and the Rebels are just getting started on what they hope will be a banner season for the program.

""Our main goal is to get to the NCAA Tournament win the Mountain West Conference — I feel like it's very important to all of us to do that this year especially with all our seniors"" Oliveira said. ""We all are trying to play for them because this is their last year. COVID has been obviously putting up many challenges in this season for us but I think that's just kind of driven us more to want to come out with the wins and show people who we are this year because we're not the same team as last year and we've been training and working so hard and trying to accomplish what we want to this season.""

In Oliveira and Capllonch's freshman year UNLV went 15-3 in the Mountain West and 20-11 overall but did not qualify for the NCAA Tournament. Dating back to that 2019 season however it has won 20 of its last 22 matches — which is the best run through 22 matches in program history.

In fact the Rebels garnered six points in this week's American Volleyball Coaches Association Top 25 Poll which would tie them for 35th place. It is the first time since the end of the 2016 season that UNLV has received votes in the AVCA poll.

""I thought that was very awesome to see that"" Oliveira said. ""It's just really cool to see that people have been noticing the work that we've been putting in especially because we know how far this program has come. Our seniors have told us that how many years ago they were literally last in conference and just to see the progress that we've helped be a part of and just to see it play out it's been amazing and we all know that especially this year we're capable of doing really great big things and that's the goal for all of us.""

The Rebels can leap-frog fellow-unbeaten Boise State (6-0) with a couple of wins when the teams face-off in Las Vegas this weekend.

""We are very pumped for this game and I know that we have been practicing really hard to know their system know how they play very well so I think we're ready"" Capllonch said.

The teams play Friday and Saturday at Cox Pavilion with both matches set for 4:30 p.m. start Hawaii time. A live stream of both matches will be available on the Mountain West Digital Network.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx5bm5uZXdzLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvbXVzaWNpYW5zLXJlbWVtYmVyLXRoZS1tYWVzdHJvLXdoby1saXZlZC10by1lbnRlcnRhaW4tOTE1ODE4MS_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5seW5ubmV3cy5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FtcC9tdXNpY2lhbnMtcmVtZW1iZXItdGhlLW1hZXN0cm8td2hvLWxpdmVkLXRvLWVudGVydGFpbi05MTU4MTgxLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Musicians remember the maestro who lived to entertain.,"West Norfolk's music scene has struck a sad note with the death of George King at the age of 90.

Tributes have poured in from fellow musicians remembering him as a much loved character with a wicked sense of humour always up for a laugh and who will be greatly missed.

Making and teaching music was George's passion from his early gigs with a skiffle group touring the American air bases on to playing with bands in the dance halls clubs pubs and theatres.

Later he formed his own jazz quartet the King Swingers which was still out there entertaining until the pandemic shut them down.

“Music was his life” said his daughter Christine Robinson. “It is very sad that lockdown meant he had to stop. He missed it all terribly. They all did.”

Outside music he was a keen sailor talented artist and writing as George Thos King airing his views as a regular contributor to the Lynn News letter pages. He was also a motorcycle enthusiast taking part in several of the mayor's charity annual Christmas runs and he had a new bike sitting in the garage when he died.

George was born in South Lynn left school at 14 worked first in a wood yard and spent 42 years as an engineer with Cooper Roller Bearings. He had worked his way through the ranks to purchasing manager when the firm changed hands in 1987 and he was one of a number made redundant.

In 1953 he had married Brenda – who died last August – and they moved to West Lynn.

Music was George's life. His father was a musician and Christine believes he got his first experience of the big band sound when his grandmother provided accommodation for famous bands who appeared at Lynn Corn Hall.

“I also know that he was a bugler in the air cadets and led the Sunday morning parades from the Tuesday Market to the Bawsey Sandboy” she said.

Fellow musicians take up the story: Derek Stringer chairman of West Norfolk Music Centre who had known George for 40 years said that he was a founder teacher at the Centre.

“He could play a number of instruments but primarily all the saxophones and the clarinet. His great talent was being able to connect with pupils of all ages from four into the late 80s.

“He was no run of the mill music teacher. He was self taught in the university of life and he always encouraged his pupils to be adventurous and improvise and not just to 'follow the dots on the sheet music'. He would say 'write your own name on the music'.

“He was a much loved character who was genuinely liked and he had a wicked sense of humour.”

One of George's pupils was Nik Carter who has gone on to great things in the world of music and show business.

Nik is a saxophonist in demand for live performances theatre TV and recording sessions all over the world. Stars he has worked with include Ed Sheeran Jools Holland Pixie Lott Girls Aloud Olly MursVanessa Mae and the Lighthouse Family and he has played big venues from the Royal Albert Hall to Wembley.

“ I am told I chased him down a school corridor at Springwood School after hearing him in a Music Centre concert and I begged him to teach me to play” said Nik. “I was 11 and he taught me until I went to London at 15 to continue my training.We never lost touch and I could rely on him for help and advice. He watched me play on a number of occasions and I spoke to him on the phone a couple of days before he died.

“Probably the last time I saw him was on Christmas Day when I took a Christmas dinner to his home and he stood on the doorstep and played “I Wish You a Merry Christmas."" George meant the world to me.”

Michael Williamson was one of the four King Swingers and recalls their gigs on Sunday afternoons at Bank House Lynn at the Fox pub at Heacham entertaining at weddings parties and fetes at St John's Church coffee mornings and at Watlington Jazz Club.

“ He was perhaps the last link to the old local dance bands. For a time he was also on keyboard and sax with the Geoff Stinton Musicmen the Centre Stage Swing Band Norfolk Reeds and Hunstanton Concert band.

“I know that one of his proudest moments was playing his clarinet on the corner of Bourbon Street New Orleans

“We were also members of the Ouse Sailing Club and for a bit of fun we formed the Anmer Mere Yacht Club. We organised some brilliant April 1 spoofs including a story about fracking fears at Anmer and in collaboration with Palm Paper we announced the launch of a paper boat on the Ouse.We had many laughs together.”

Fellow King Swinger musician Ivan Garford said: “George was always up for a laugh. I remember him as friendly and encouraging and especially so when he was teaching young people.”

Nigel Portass's memories of George go back to the Bert Murray Band which played on Saturday nights at Wisbech Rose and Crown Hotel. They went on to play in club and cabaret bands and had a shared love of jazz. He was incredibly popular” said Nigel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhYmNuZXdzLmNvbS9zYWJjbmV3cy9zZWFyY2gtY29udGludWVzLWZvci1uZXdsYW5kcy13ZXN0LWtpZG5hcHBlZC1sZWFybmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Search continues for learner kidnapped in Newlands West,"Reading Time: < 1 minute

KwaZulu-Natal police are continuing their search for a learner who was kidnapped from a school in Newlands West in Durban. Police spokesperson Thembeka Mbele says 17-year-old Mmeli Ngcobo was allegedly taken on Monday after he was accused of stealing a classmate’s cellphone.

Mbele says it’s alleged the parents arrived at the school and confronted Ngcobo. The boy was given until Monday to return the phone.

She says it’s believed that the classmate and two other males in gold or silver Mercedes-Benz approached Ngcobo later and forced him into a vehicle.

Mbele says police arrested two suspects.

“There was a suspect who was arrested. In fact there were two and one was released because there was no evidence initially. Then the one that was arrested the owner of the cellphone but then when his case was taken to court. It was not enrolled because of insufficient evidence. For now there is still an investigation that should be done. So once it’s done the case is going to be taken back for decision.”",,,

But in the pandemic economy there’s a new way for the rich and recognized to flex their status and wealth: through a SPAC. (That’s a “special purpose acquisition company” but more on that later.)

Jay-Z is involved with one. Shaquille O’Neal has one. Ciara Wilson sits on the board of one as does Serena Williams.

Sports figures seem especially enthusiastic about them: Alex Rodriguez Steph Curry and the activist and former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick — or should we say “SPAC-ERNICK” — all have one.

Because of their addictions no one had believed them.

Swab knows firsthand what it’s like to not be believed. A former addict he witnessed the “rehab shuffle” as it’s called. Body Brokers a crime thriller available in select theaters and on demand now stars Jack Kilmer Alice Englert Melissa Leo and Michael K. Williams and takes to task the multi-billion-dollar fraud that uses addicts to recruit other addicts into rehab. Swab—now a successful filmmaker—wants to help others who were like him.

“I’m hoping that this film brings some attention to this [scam]” he says “because a lot of these drug addicts and alcoholics have been lying for so long that nobody believes them when they’re telling the truth. They go out to get help then come back and tell their families that they’re being taken advantage of but their families have no incentive to believe them.”

I was introduced to some brokers treatment center owners and a lot of people who were frankly criminals and ironically were really excited to share their story about what they were doing.

As the film dramatizes when the Affordable Healthcare Act was signed in 2008 it required every healthcare provider to cover substance abuse treatment. “Since the bill was passed” he says “nearly 2000 sober livings 100 in-patient treatment centers and 200 detox facilities have opened up just in Southern California alone. That is nearly 35000 beds that need to be filled each month and almost 500000 that need to be filled each year” bringing a profit of around $12 billion annually—again just in Southern California.

Because many drug treatment facilities are set up more akin to a multi-billion dollar insurance scam than as places created to help individuals with addiction Swab has made the film to spur people into creating some regulations and oversight in the treatment industry so that people can start addressing the problem and changing their lives like he’s been able to.

Here Swab talks to Observer about what type of treatment is trustworthy how he managed to do the clandestine research to make the film and whether or not he’s scared of the consequences of making a film about this subject matter.

Observer: You’d made a couple crime thrillers before this film. What made you want to tackle something so close to home?

John Swab: I had been in all kinds of rehabs and had seen it all with about an aggregate of two and a half years in residential treatment. The body brokering aspect of the industry started to happen and at that time I was a part of it. Ultimately I got sober and moved away but I got a taste of it. About three years after I came back out to Los Angeles to visit somebody who worked in a treatment center and they explained to me how this whole thing had boomed and how much money was being made now. From there I was introduced to some brokers treatment center owners and a lot of people who were frankly criminals and ironically were really excited to share their story about what they were doing.

So is body brokering just an open secret?

That’s the tragedy of it. There are some good people running these treatment centers but there are more businessmen and people who used to sell drugs and criminals that run these places now. You need more certification to cut hair than you do to own a treatment center. The irony is that when somebody is ready to go to treatment they’re so helpless that they just think they’re doing the right thing by going to a treatment center. And their families who send them it’s a closeted conversation that their son or their wife is an addict. It’s not something that people like to talk about they just want to get it fixed.

So they ship them off to these places and it’s an out-of-sight out-of-mind thing. They’re not thinking about the treatment centers’ incentive which isn’t to get somebody well it’s to keep them there as long as they can and milk them for all the money that insurance will pay out. Because of a lack of regulations laws and oversight the treatment facilities have been able to operate in the grey where it’s not necessarily illegal what they’re doing.

Are you scared of the consequences these criminals might enact upon you for making this film?

My wife was worried. I was basically being introduced around to drug dealers gangsters like meeting them in a nice Westside hotel and they took my phone they patted me down they had gun and but he was willing to talk to me. I think he was excited at the prospect of his life story being made into a movie. I do think about the people like that seeing this movie and/or the treatment facility owners who have a ton of money at their disposal to go after people like me but I try not to. Honestly I don’t really care because this happened to me and people are dying who are just trying to get help and do the right thing and they’re being taken advantage of.

And to clarify it’s insurance companies who are being defrauded not the individual?

Insurance companies are getting defrauded and some are government-based like Medicaid so financial losses are primarily there yes. I would argue that the real loss is to these people asking for help and the families trying to save their loved ones.

Right because it’s hard to feel bad for big multi-billion-dollar insurance companies…

Right. And many of these addiction centers are publicly traded companies that are involved in body brokering. It’s really murky to know who the villain is. Even the people doing the body brokering they were addicts trying to get home and at some point were taught how to do this. It’s tough to point your finger at any one place or person and say they’re in the wrong; it’s a really messy situation.

So are there legit rehab facilities out there?

There are but I was gathering information from all sides and everybody’s aware that this is going on. It’s just whether or not they’re participating in it. And for the most part if you are running a bigger successful rehab you’re involved. A lot of the small mom-and-pop shops are not because they’re focusing on one thing be it detox or outpatient or residential. If you’re running an operation that is servicing detox all the way to aftercare there’s no way you can really keep your head above water without getting competitive by way of body brokering.

What routes do you recommend for people seeking treatment?

I’ve tried a lot of different things and for me I see the most success with 12-step programs. There’s no angle it doesn’t cost you any money and it’s just people helping other people. I have a lot of people who call me struggling with addiction and I don’t give them a number for a treatment center I offer to take them to a 12-step meeting.

The brothers’ stake in Evolution Gaming – a Swedish-based online gambling business that has surged during the pandemic – has delivered 5000% returns since they became shareholders jumping 200% in the last year alone. The brothers’ 8.6% stake is now worth almost $3bn and Evolution has proved a crucial source of liquidity while many of the hotels in their London and Regional property empire have been closed.

This is the tech niche to be in

Plenty of the world’s richest have diversified into tech in the pandemic says Bloomberg. But the Livingstones spotted Stockholm-listed Evolution’s potential much earlier. Since the brothers provided early seed funding the fifteen-year-old company has grown to become the unseen presence behind live casino games run by some 300 operators globally including Betfair and William Hill. And the real bonanza is still to come. Having recently signed partnership deals with Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts Evolution is poised to clean up from the liberalisation of the huge US market. As analyst Martin Arnell of DNB Markets observes: “within gambling globally this is the niche to be in right now”.

Raised in Ealing west London – the sons of a dentist – and educated at St Paul’s School the brothers now in their mid-50s have always displayed a flair for snapping up promising assets when underrated by others. The basis of their combined $7.2bn fortune is London West End property snapped up in the recession of the early 1990s when they were still in their 20s remarkable given that their training (Ian pictured as an optometrist; Richard a chartered surveyor) suggested other life trajectories.

The funding of the Livingstones’ early investments is “shrouded in mystery” said the London Evening Standard in 2012. But their ascent began in 1989 when Ian opened his first opticians shop Optika in Hampstead. Within three years the business was strong enough to buy the upmarket David Clulow chain out of receivership and by 1996 there were 40 outlets valued at £20m. Richard’s contribution according to a friend was a nose for property. “They cobbled together a bit of money somehow and started buying and selling flats. Gradually lots of small deals got bigger and bigger.”

A genius for persuasion

Between 1991 and 1994 the youthful wheeler-dealers set up 18 companies to buy commercial properties in central London. Richard’s “genius” appears to have been “his power to persuade lenders” – particularly Jacob Rothschild’s Dawnay Day – “to advance tens of millions to a young man with only the shortest of track records”. Key to this was the brothers’ reputation for decency. “They’re lovely people really clever but really quite modest” says one associate.

Over the years the brothers invested in everything from fitness clubs to nursing homes and London cinemas. But they found their niche in luxury hotels – most famously Cliveden the Grade I-listed Buckinghamshire pile made infamous by the 1960s Profumo scandal. Modesty is everything to the Livingstones. But as Ian’s wife Natalie once observed there’s a certain satisfaction that a house once run by the notoriously antisemitic Nancy Astor is now in the hands of “a self-made Jewish family”.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy is leaning on its engineering and technological prowess to embark on a new pilot project that may change energy production for the better. Executive vice president and chief generation officer Timothy O’Connor is helping to lead the charge. Under a $14 million project authorized by the U.S. Department of Energy Xcel is partnering with the Idaho National Laboratory to produce hydrogen at one of Xcel’s Minnesota nuclear plants. The project which planners say won’t produce any carbon uses a high-temperature electrolyzer to separate hydrogen and oxygen molecules in water at the plant. The resulting hydrogen could be used in fuel cells for the transportation industry or in a blend with natural gas among several other possible applications O’Connor says. “It now starts to open the door of ‘What are the other practical feasible possibilities for hydrogen and what are the economics of those paths?’ ” he says. “I do think economics is going to determine the direction but the good thing is no matter which direction we go more hydrogen use means more decarboniz[ation] overall.” Like several other companies Xcel has pledged to drastically reduce its carbon emissions over the next few decades making the hydrogen project a perfect fit for the company’s long-term goals. The utility company aims to be 100 percent carbon-free by 2050.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vdWsubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9uZXdzL3hjZWwteGVsLWRvd24tNy05LTE2MzAwNDk2OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xcel (XEL) Down 7.9% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Xcel Energy (XEL). Shares have lost about 7.9% in that time frame underperforming the S&P 500.

The Wild defenseman is launching the inaugural Matt Dumba Hockey Without Limits Camp on Saturday at the Guidant John Rose MN OVAL as part of Hockey Day Minnesota 2021.

Youth players from the Herb Brooks Foundation the Hendrickson Foundation and New Directions Youth Ministry will take part in the event created by Dumba to bring more diversity and inclusion to the game.

""It's just an awesome opportunity for the kids who don't necessarily get this opportunity to come to a hockey camp like this"" Dumba said. ""Make some memories [and] make some new friendships.""

Dumba started working on the concept in September after he became synonymous with hockey's social justice movement helping form the Hockey Diversity Alliance to eradicate racism and intolerance in hockey. He went on to win the NHL's King Clancy Trophy for his leadership qualities and contributions to the community.

With the Wild in action Saturday against the Kings at Xcel Energy Center Dumba won't be able to make an appearance at the camp. But the attendees will see a message from Dumba and Dumba wants to connect with them afterward. About 40 children from each of the three groups are expected to participate.

""It will be super cool to see just the diversity amongst our group — white Black Hispanic kids inner-city kids"" he said.

""That's where you can make the most change for the next generation of young hockey players young leaders in our game. Having a camp like mine with as much inclusivity and diversity involved in it as there's going to be is something special something hockey's really never seen before.""

Talbot starts

Cam Talbot returned to action Friday for the first time since getting cleared from the NHL's COVID protocols last week.

Even after Talbot rejoined the team on its recent road trip backup Kaapo Kahkonen continued to get the nod in net. Kahkonen ended up making five consecutive starts and backstopping the Wild to four straight wins.

This was Talbot's first appearance since Feb. 2 at Colorado.

""It's a great thing for a coaching staff when you can have that decision be the tough one"" coach Dean Evason said.

Celebration time

The most excited the Wild has been all season Evason said was when rookie Nico Sturm scored his first regular-season goal Wednesday in the 6-2 rout at Colorado.

""The most exciting part was seeing how happy all the other guys were for me"" said Sturm whose first goal in the NHL came in the playoffs last season.

Sturm's empty-net goal gave him only two points this season but he has helped the Wild plenty as a checker and penalty killer.

""To be on the fourth line and play 10-12 minutes those got to be the 10-12 hardest minutes that I can play and I actually feel really comfortable doing it"" said Sturm who feels ""pretty much back to normal"" after having COVID-19 earlier this month. ""The coaching staff sees that I'm comfortable in this role as well and I'm actually having a positive impact on the team.""

Fans in the building

The Wild welcomed about 40 fans to Xcel Energy Center on Friday after Gov. Tim Walz scaled back crowd restrictions earlier this month increasing the limit of attendees to 250 from 150 during the team's previous homestand. Aside from family and friends of players and Wild employees some season-ticket holders took in the action from the club level. Around 40 fans are also expected for Saturday's game.

Injury update

Forward Marcus Johansson sat out a fourth straight game with an upper-body injury.

Goalie Alex Stalock who's out indefinitely with an upper-body injury skated with the taxi squad Friday morning. Evason described it as a progression for Stalock. ""He's excited about getting some live pucks"" Evason said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpbmtsaXZlLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvZG9sbGFyLWJpbGwta2lyaWxsLXF1aWNrbHktZW5kZWFyaW5nLWhpbXNlbGYtdG8td2lsZC10ZWFtbWF0ZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Dollar Bill Kirill' quickly endearing himself to Wild teammates,"Whether it’s a miraculous move in front or a logic-defying shift Wild rookie Kirill Kaprizov seems to do something every night that makes his teammates do a double take.

Well the 23-year-old Russian got a taste of his own medicine on Friday night when he walked into the Wild locker room.

Much to his surprise his teammates were wearing shirts with his face plastered on the front and the phrase “Dollar Bill Kirill” underneath it. It’s a nickname Matt Dumba bestowed on Kaprizov earlier this season because he’s money with the puck on his stick.

“The nickname has kind of stuck” Dumba said with a laugh. “He’s a great kid so it’s nice to have some fun with him. We are happy to have him. That kind of energy he brings is contagious. It elevates everyone’s game.”

That’s proven to be the case throughout the current six-game winning streak. Not only has Kaprizov been masterful in his own right he has made everyone around him better. He currently leads the team with 17 points (6 goals 11 assists) in 18 games.

“He’s an unbelievable player” said Kevin Fiala who might soon have to relinquish his title of the most dynamic player on the team. “He does it every night on a consistent basis.”

That said Kaprizov’s skill with the puck isn’t the only thing that’s impressive about him. He also works extremely hard to get the puck back when it’s not on his stick.

His goal in Friday’s win over the Los Angeles Kings was a perfect example of that as he outworked star defenseman Drew Doughty along the boards then collected a rebound before using his strength to convert on a wraparound goal.

Those types of plays are something Kaprizov’s teammates have come to expect at this point.

“Honestly the first practice I saw him skate I knew he was something special” said Nick Bjugstad who has played a few games alongside Kaprizov this season. “I hadn’t seen him play beforehand so I couldn’t anticipate how it was going to go. As soon as I saw him in the first practice I definitely saw a lot there from his compete level.”

Sometimes it’s hard not to marvel at the way Kaprizov uses his edges. There seems to be a few stretches throughout every game where he makes it look like everyone around him just put on skates for the first time in their life.

That’s something Joel Eriksson Ek can appreciate having to go up against the opposing team’s top player night in and night out. Needless to say Eriksson Ek is thrilled he doesn’t have to worry about defending him.

“He’s hard to read” Eriksson Ek said. “The way he opens up his hips and makes it so hard to defend. You don’t know which way he’s going. He’s super smart too. He’s been great for us and I’m sure he’ll keep going too.”

Photo: Getty

Swedish plant-based milk company Oatly has said it has begun work on a US stock market listing which could value it at as much as $10bn (£7.2bn).

While Oatly did not specify how much cash it hopes to raise in its initial public offering (IPO) the $10bn valuation is more than the $2bn suggested in an investment round in July 2020.

The firm which has celebrity investors such as Oprah Jay-Z and Natalie Portman raised $200m in investment last year. Products from the company which is backed by Blackstone are sold in over 20 countries.

Earlier this week the Malmo-based group said that it had submitted a confidential filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The IPO which is subject to market review is expected to take place following the SEC's review the company said.

Appetite for plant-based alternatives has increased in recent years amid a surge in demand for environmentally friendly food and drinks.

While the company hasn't released its sales figures for 2020 yet the company which was founded in 1990 had revenues of about $200m in 2019 — roughly double that in 2018.

US investors have also invested in companies such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods which opened the lane for vegan products to enter the mainstream league.

Vegan-meat pioneer Beyond Meat (BYND) and Impossible Foods have both secured big deals with fast-food franchises such as McDonald's (MCD) and Burger King respectively.

Beyond Meat announced on Friday that it signed a three-year global contract with McDonald's and Yum! (YUM) brand companies including KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell — further cementing the future of plant-based meat in the sector.

“We will combine the power of Beyond Meat’s rapid and relentless approach to innovation with the strength of McDonald’s global brand to introduce craveable new plant-based menu items that consumers will love"" Ethan Brown founder and CEO of Beyond Meat said.

Plant-based options at fast-food chains hospitality venues and grocery stores have become increasingly more popular especially during the coronavirus pandemic which prompted people to focus more on their health.

Shopping trends are also changing in the UK. In 2020 there were more than £1bn in sales of plant-based foods with an estimated 13 million shoppers in the country opting for meat-free substitutes and alternative milk options.

In January 2021 nearly 600000 people had taken part in Veganuary which sees people give up animal products for one month. Despite the third national lockdown this was an increase of the 400000 or so people that took part in 2020.

Meanwhile FTSE 100 (^FTSE) firm Unilever has said that expanding its vegan business is a high priority the company's chief executive Alan Jope called plant-based alternatives an ""inexorable trend.""

Unilever (ULVR.L) which is behind brands such as Marmite and Hellman plans to capitalise on the shift by increasing sales of plant-based foods to €1bn ($1.2bn £867m) by 2027 — a five fold increase.

Shrinkage calculations offer little if any insights into the root causes of loss. As the complexity of retailing continues to accelerate the capacity to assimilate data and the range of risks retail now faces have increased considerably. Relying upon this single measure of loss to guide strategy is increasingly anachronistic.

Championed by the Retail Industry Leaders Association the Total Retail Loss concept offers a much more progressive and inclusive approach to understanding how retail risks impact profitability. This webinar makes the case for why adopting this concept will enable retailers to develop a strategic approach to not only recognizing the true cost of retail loss but also how to return value to the bottom line. However this path includes many challenges through the change needed in retail.

But Stan Wong of Scotia Wealth Management is advising investors to hold off for the time being as the stock has run up enough.

“Zoetis is a name that we used to hold. We took profits on it probably about a year nine months ago” said Wong director of wealth management at Scotia who spoke on BNN Bloomberg on Thursday.

A former subsidiary of Pfizer New Jersey-headquartered Zoetis specializes in animal health under two segments pets and livestock with business in the US and worldwide. The company hit $6.7 billion in revenue last year has about 300 product lines and sells to 45 countries globally. (All figures in US dollars.)

As for many companies 2020 was a bit of a challenge with US business taking a bit hit during the pandemic but Zoetis seemed to have picked up the pace over the tail end of the year reporting revenue growth of 13 per cent year-over-year for its third quarter 2020 and then last week coming in with eight-per-cent growth for the company’s fourth quarter.

For the full 2020 revenue grew by seven per cent from 2019 while net income rose by nine per cent to $1.636 billion and EPS landed at $3.42 per share compared to $3.11 per share a year earlier. Meanwhile management has guided for 2021 revenue between $7.4 and $7.55 billion and EPS between $4.36 and $4.46 per share.

“We believe [2020’s] momentum sets us up for a strong 2021 even amidst ongoing COVID-19 uncertainty” said CEO Kristin Peck in the fourth quarter press release.

“We expect to continue growing revenue faster than the market in 2021 driven by continued strength in pet care; ongoing expansion in markets outside the U.S. most notably China; and acceleration of our diagnostics portfolio penetration. As a result we are guiding to full-year operational growth of nine per cent to 11 per cent in revenue” said Peck.

But while Zoetis managed a good return in 2020 the stock was pretty well flat from August onward. So far in 2021 ZTS is down five per cent.

Wong says secular tailwinds make his long-term take on Zoetis better than his near-term.

“[Zoetis] makes a lot of sense long term because during the pandemic people are buying pets to have more company in the house and so forth and long term companion pets continue to be a part of the family and people will spend what they need to spend to help their friends” Wong said.

“In the livestock space when you look at what’s happening in the emerging markets as incomes and disposable income continues to grow there’s more need for protein in people’s diets in the emerging markets so long term I think this name makes a lot of sense” Wong said.

“The only thing that I would say about this particular stock at this point is that the valuation is getting a little bit heavy at 36x forward earnings. We see a growth rate on the EPS side of about 11 or 12 per cent so it’s a good growth rate but the P/E on a forward basis is a bit expensive for me” Wong said.

Pet adoptions in the US reportedly rose by 15 per cent in 2020 while the American Pet Products Association has said the American spend on pets rose six per cent in 2019 over 2018 to $95.7 billion as quoted by CNBC.

Peck said the stay-at-home economy has meant not just more animals per household but better care of them as owners are around the home more and are identifying health issues more readily.

“They’re noticing more and those pets are getting taken care of much better than ever before” Peck said in a CNBC interview in January. “They’re noticing that itching or the need for preventatives so it has been a real strong growth driver for the industry overall.”

Wong said there has been movement in the healthcare space away from more well-known pharma names like Zoetis and into biotech stocks making for less gains.

“Especially given what’s happened with the vaccine space and so on names like Zoetis and some of the old-type of pharmacare names have not done as well” Wong said.

“With that being said I think valuation keeps me away from this particular name right now. I look for valuation to come down a little bit before buying in again” Wong said. “Long term I think there’s good secular growth in this particular name but right now I’d probably be on the sidelines.”",,,,,,,,,,,,
